The execution started with a screening of "This Brick", a short 35mm film of a block produced using the powder of the K Foundation's million-pound blaze. Following a presentation by Factory Records originator Tony Wilson, Drummond and Cauty were then revealed as pajama-clad, wheelchair-utilizing retired people with silver hair and, tied to their brows, unmistakable horns that had been utilized consistently in The KLF's limited time recordings. Drummond was additionally observed culling quills from a dead swan. As indicated by an official statement issued by Mute/Blast First (Acid Brass' and 2K's record name), "Two older courteous fellows, smelling of Dettol, caused devastation in their mechanized wheelchairs. These old heretics, looking to some extent like messrs Cauty and Drummond, professed to have quite recently been asked along." The pair wheeled around the phase to the sound of Acid Brass' "What Time Is Love?". They were bolstered differently by a male choir's version of "K Cera", joined by musical drama vocalist Sally Bradshaw; the Viking Society in ensemble as lifeboatmen; and the politically topical Liverpool Dockers reciting "Screw the Millennium". Following the execution, each group of onlookers part got a "Screw the Millennium" T-shirt, publication, and guard sticker in a bearer pack.
