'Cranbourne Bells' is a twofold bloomed structure with pink blossom buds blurring to white as they open. Enlisted by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1988, it happened normally close to the Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne in Victoria, yet its natural surroundings has since been cleared. A twofold bloomed type of "Epacris impressa" was gathered as right on time as the 1860s in Victoria when Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller sent an example to Kew Gardens. This was inspected by botanist William Hemsley in 1865. The example, named as "Epacris impressa" var. "pleniflora", started from Stawell in western Victoria. Another example given a similar name by Mueller was gathered at Nunawading, today a suburb of Melbourne. Charles French, fellow benefactor of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, gathered a white twofold blossomed structure from Cheltenham south of Melbourne in 1859 and a pink twofold bloomed structure from Dromana on the Mornington Peninsula in around 1862. These were later sent as attached cuttings to Veitch Nurseries in England. Twofold bloomed types of different hues have since been found all through Victoria, yet just single plants have been seen in any area, and they are still viewed as an irregularity. A normally happening type of the assortment "grandiflora" with rosebud-like twofold blossoms is likewise developed.
