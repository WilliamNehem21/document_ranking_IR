While his clarification was observed to be believable by certain perusers, Long's faultfinders blamed a model he gave of two orioles he had seen building a home outside his window. Proposed to demonstrate his theory about the unusual and versatile nature of wild creatures, he composed of how the pair "doubtlessly pondered" their intricate swinging home that had been made out of three sticks affixed together; when completed, the winged animals then "tied a solitary bunch at the outrageous end" of a dangling string so it would not unwind after some time. Burroughs and his partners were again exasperated at Long's request that what he composed depended completely upon truth, and immediately reacted with analysis; Burroughs' composed answer allegedly turned out to be unreasonably cruel for distribution. "The Atlantic Monthly" did not wish to heighten the discussion, so it was at last distributed by "Century Magazine". Bringing out Long's account of the orioles, Burroughs stated, "After such a model as this, to what extent will it be before the water-fowls will manufacture minimal surge supports for their young or surge vessels driven about the lakes and lakes by methods for verdant sails, or before Jenny Wren will live in her very own log lodge development?"
