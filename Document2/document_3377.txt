There were just 16 presidential essential states in 1920, of which the most urgent to Harding was Ohio. Harding needed to have a few followers at the tradition to get any opportunity of designation, and the Wood crusade would have liked to thump Harding out of the race by taking Ohio. Wood crusaded in the state, and his supporter, Procter, spent vast wholes; Harding talked in the non-fierce style he had received in 1914. Harding and Daugherty were so sure of clearing Ohio's 48 delegates that the competitor went on to the following state, Indiana, before the April 27 Ohio essential. Harding conveyed Ohio by just 15,000 votes over Wood, taking not exactly a large portion of the absolute vote, and won just 39 of 48 delegates. In Indiana, Harding completed fourth, with under 10% of the vote, and neglected to win a solitary representative. He was happy to surrender and have Daugherty record his re-appointment papers for the Senate, however Florence Harding snatched the telephone from his hand, "Warren Harding, what's happening with you? Surrender? Not until the tradition is finished. Think about your companions in Ohio!" On discovering that Daugherty had left the telephone line, the future First Lady answered, "Well, you tell Harry Daugherty for me that we're in this battle forever."
