In 1389, WÃÂadysÃÂaw's standard in Lithuania confronted a resuscitated test from Vytautas, who disliked the power given to Skirgaila in Lithuania to the detriment of his own patrimony. Vytautas began a common war in Lithuania, meaning to turn into the Grand Duke. On 4 September 1390, the joint powers of Vytautas and the Teutonic Grand Master, Konrad von Wallenrode, laid attack to Vilnius, which was held by WÃÂadysÃÂaw's official Skirgaila with consolidated Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops. In spite of the fact that the Knights lifted the attack of the palace following a month, they diminished a significant part of the external city to ruins. This ridiculous clash was in the end conveyed to a brief end in 1392 with the Treaty of OstrÃÂ³w, by which WÃÂadysÃÂaw gave over the administration of Lithuania to his cousin in return for harmony: Vytautas was to lead Lithuania as the Grand Duke ("magnus dux") until his passing, under the overlordship of the Supreme Duke ("dux supremus") in the individual of the Polish ruler. Skirgaila was moved from the Duchy of Trakai to progress toward becoming sovereign of Kiev. Vytautas at first acknowledged his status however before long started to seek after Lithuania's freedom from Poland.
