The shielded recuperation vehicle, known as the AMX-30D (AMX-30 "DÃÂ©panneur-Niveleur"), was intended to recover or help keep up vehicles in the field. Work on the AMX-30D started in 1966, as the French Army looked into building up a recuperation vehicle to be issued to units accepting the AMX-30 tank. A model was created and conveyed for experimentation in 1971, and in February 1973 the first of a pre-arrangement of five vehicles was conveyed. That equivalent year, another 100 AMX-30Ds were requested, and these started creation in 1975. The recuperation vehicle incorporates a winch fueled by the vehicle's motor, with the capacity to pull a limit of weight. The vehicle likewise has an overwhelming towing link, while a helper winch has another towing link, ready to tow up to when working over the front of the AMX-30D. In the last case the vehicle must be upheld by removable props, which are carried on the vehicle, and the bulldozer cutting edge must be brought down on the ground. The crane can lift up the power pack and the turret. Rather than a turret, the AMX-30D is fitted with a superstructure, and weighs , in spite of the fact that with the additional power pack it can weigh up to . The vehicle can secure itself with an assault rifle. The driver's perceivability is supported by the incorporation of three M-223 episcopes. The AMX-30D has a most extreme on-street speed of and a greatest street scope of .
