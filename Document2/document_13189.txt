The Tasmanians, bowling first, utilized their underarm style; the two bowlers, William Henty and Robert McDowall, had a strangely moderate pace. The Port Phillip opening batsmen, Duncan Cooper and William Philpott, included 14 keeps running in 22 minutes before Cooper was bowled. A syndicated Tasmanian press report of the match depicted Philpott as batting "in fine style" before he was gotten at mid-off. Thomas Hamilton and Charles Lister batted consistently before the previous was bowled in the primary hour, after which the score was 34 keeps running for the loss of three wickets. Hamilton was bowled and Lister run out; Alfred Thomson, who scored one run, was before long bowled to leave the score 42 for five. Richard Philpott, the senior sibling of Victorian chief William Philpott, influenced 12 rushes to bring the score to up to 54, preceding he also was bowled, and Thomas Antill was rejected for a duck. James Brodie hit out to score 17 runs, equalling William Philpott as the most elevated scorer of the innings. He was gotten at slip. The last two wickets fell economically; Frederick Marsden and Matthew Hervey were both bowled, and Melmoth Hall remained not out on six. The Victorian group scored 82 of every 26 four-ball overs in 125 minutes. Henty (four wickets at an expense of 52 runs) and McDowall (five for 27) bowled unaltered all through the innings.
