Palmer had for some time been keen on UFOs, and ran an article in "Different Worlds" in 1951 titled "I Flew in a Flying Saucer", bylined "Commander A.V.G.", however Lester del Rey reports in his history of sf magazines that it might have been composed by Palmer himself. Inevitably Palmer chose to drop sci-fi; from June 1957 just three issuesÃ¢ÂÂJune, July and SeptemberÃ¢ÂÂincluded fiction; from that point it was a true to life magazine about UFOs. He wrote in the accompanying issue that he would print updates on flying saucers and bits of gossip, and would expose any cases he could demonstrate counterfeit. Throughout the following twenty years he included such periphery thoughts, for example, that the earth was not round, and in December 1959 ran an article in "Flying Saucers" that asserted the earth was molded like a doughnut, and that flying saucers began from an unexplored source on the world's surface. In 1965 Palmer distributed an article by Delmar H. Bryant that exposed that the earth was empty, however the next year again proposed that the earth may be doughnut molded. On the June 1970 issue, the spread picture demonstrated a doughnut molded earth from space; Palmer guaranteed this was proof from a satellite photo.
