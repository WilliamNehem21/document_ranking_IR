The skull of "T. sethi" had a streamlined profile, particularly from the tip of the nose to the front edge of the nasoantorbital fenestra (opening which joined the antorbital fenestra before the eye with the hard nostril). The most prominent element of the skull was the huge peak, which kept running along the upper edge from the tip of the nose and past the occiput at the back of the skull, nearly multiplying the length and stature of the skull. Except for the pterosaur "Tupandactylus imperator" (whose peak comprised for the most part of delicate tissue), "T. sethi" had the relatively biggest cranial peak of any known vertebrate (75 percent of the skull's side surface). The peak was for the most part framed by the premaxillae (the frontmost nose bones), frontal bones, parietal bones, and part of the supraoccipital bone. The premaxillae shaped a large portion of the peak, reaching out to its back, and reached the frontoparietal part of the peak by a straight suture (a particular component of this species). The peak changed from in thickness; it thickened at the contact between the premaxillae and the frontoparietal part, and turned out to be slowly more slender toward the top and back (with the exception of the lower part behind the occiput, where it had a thick base).
