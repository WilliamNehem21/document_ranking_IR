As per the "Historia Brittonum", Cadafael of Gwynedd, "ascending in the night, got away together with his military" (in this way gaining him the name "Cadomedd", or "fight shirker"), and Bede says that at the season of the fight, Aethelwald of Deira pulled back and "anticipated the result from a position of wellbeing". As indicated by Kirby, if Penda's military was walking home, it might have been therefore that a portion of his partners were reluctant to battle. It might likewise be that the partners had distinctive purposes in the war, and Kirby recommended that Penda's forsaking partners may have been disappointed "with what had been accomplished at "Iudeu"".

Bede says that Penda's "thirty officers, and the individuals who had provided to his with some much needed help were put to flight, and practically every one of them killed," and that more suffocated while escaping than were executed in the genuine fight. He additionally says that Penda's head was removed; an association among this and the treatment of Oswald's body at Maserfield is conceivable. Writing in the twelfth century, Henry of Huntingdon accentuated the possibility that Penda was enduring a similar destiny as he had exacted on others.
