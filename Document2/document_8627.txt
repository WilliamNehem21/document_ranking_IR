Antiochus VII Sidetes ("r".ÃÂ 138Ã¢ÂÂ 129ÃÂ BC), a sibling of Demetrius, accepted the Seleucid position of authority and wedded the last's significant other Cleopatra Thea. In the wake of overcoming Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus started a crusade in 130ÃÂ BC to retake Mesopotamia, presently under the standard of Phraates II of Parthia ("r".ÃÂ c.ÃÂ 138Ã¢ÂÂ 128ÃÂ BC). The Parthian general Indates was vanquished along the Great Zab, trailed by a neighborhood uprising where the Parthian legislative head of Babylonia was slaughtered. Antiochus vanquished Babylonia and involved Susa, where he printed coins. In the wake of propelling his military into Media, the Parthians pushed for harmony, which Antiochus would not acknowledge except if the Arsacids surrendered all terrains to him with the exception of Parthia appropriate, paid overwhelming tribute, and discharged Demetrius from imprisonment. Arsaces discharged Demetrius and sent him to Syria, yet rejected different requests. By spring 129ÃÂ BC, the Medes were in open rebel against Antiochus, whose military had depleted the assets of the farmland amid winter. While endeavoring to put down the rebellions, the primary Parthian power cleared into the area and slaughtered Antiochus in fight. His body was sent back to Syria in a silver pine box; his child Seleucus was made a Parthian prisoner and a little girl joined Phraates' array of mistresses.
