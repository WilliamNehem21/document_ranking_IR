Armstrong mentioned a brief stop at Catania, on the island of Sicily, probably on June 29, visiting the Catania Cathedral and Mount Etna. Their next stop was at Naples on June 30, where they were greeted by the Prefect of Naples, the Commanding General and Admiral of Naples, and Celso Caesar Moreno, presenting himself to local officials as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hawaii. Moreno was a friend of KalÄkaua's who many felt was a con artist. Armstrong described him as someone who scammed his way into KalÄkaua's good graces in Hawaii. Moreno had been appointed Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1880. He created a divisive situation that put the King at odds with his own cabinet, leading to Moreno's dismissal five days later. He and KalÄkaua remained on cordial terms. Moreno had been appointed the guardian of three Hawaiian students, including the future rebel leaders Robert NapuÊ»uako Boyd and Robert William Wilcox, who were being educated in Italy as a part of the government funded study-abroad program. Moreno was relieved of that responsibility once the King was made aware that Moreno had misrepresented them as KalÄkaua's natural sons, and that he had misled the Italian government into believing he had an official position with the Hawaiian government. The "Saturday Press" in Honolulu was indignant at his association with KalÄkaua and their re-connection in Italy, stating that Moreno "â¦Â had fought to the last ditch, and has, we hope, tumbled into it and will remain there."
