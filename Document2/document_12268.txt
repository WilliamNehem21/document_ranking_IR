Over the winter of 1906Ã¢ÂÂ 07, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" experienced a noteworthy update in Kiel, which was finished before the finish of April. At this point, the most current s were coming into administration; alongside the s, these gave enough present day war vessels to make two full fight squadrons. Therefore, the "Heimatflotte" was renamed the "Hochseeflotte" (High Seas Fleet). Beginning on 13 May, real armada practices occurred in the North Sea and kept going until 8 June with a voyage around the Skagen into the Baltic. The armada started its standard summer journey to Norway in mid-July. The armada was available for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German boats left the next day for Helgoland, to join practices being directed there. The armada was back in Kiel by 15 August, where arrangements for the fall moves started. On 22Ã¢ÂÂ 24 August, the armada partook in landing practices in EckernfÃÂ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The moves were delayed from 31 August to 3 September when the armada facilitated vessels from Denmark and Sweden, alongside a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The moves continued on 8 September and endured five more days.
