A few parts of the well known perspective on analyzation were exemplified by the last board of William Hogarth's "The Four Stages of Cruelty", a progression of etchings that portray a criminal's voyage to the anatomical theater. The main specialist (John Freke) shows up as an officer, looking out for the examination of the killer Tom Nero's body by the Company of Surgeons. As indicated by creator Fiona Haslam, the scene mirrors a mainstream see that specialists were "overall, notorious, heartless to human affliction and inclined to victimis[ing] individuals similarly that offenders misled their prey." Another prevalent view suggested by Hogarth was that specialists were so uninformed of the regard because of their subjects, that they enabled the remaining parts to progress toward becoming offal. As a general rule, the unpleasant treatment demanded by body snatchers on carcasses proceeded on the premises they conveyed to. Joshua Brookes once conceded that he had kicked a body in a sack down a trip of stairs, while Robert Christison griped of the "stunning obscenity with no passing mind" shown by a male instructor who analyzed a lady. Tricks were additionally normal; a London understudy who playfully dropped a cut away leg down a family unit stack, into a housewife's stewpot, caused an uproar.
