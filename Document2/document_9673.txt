In 1846, Seward turned into the focal point of discussion in Auburn when he shielded, in isolated cases, two criminals blamed for homicide. Henry Wyatt, a white man, was accused of lethally cutting a kindred detainee in jail; William Freeman, an African American, was blamed for breaking into a house after his discharge and wounding four individuals to death. In the two cases the respondents were likely rationally sick and had been manhandled while in jail. Seward, having for some time been a supporter of jail change and better treatment for the crazy, tried to keep each man from being executed by utilizing the generally new guard of madness. Seward picked up a balanced jury in Wyatt's first preliminary, however he was in this manner indicted in a retrial and executed regardless of Seward's endeavors to verify mercy. Freeman was indicted, however Seward picked up an inversion on request. There was no second Freeman preliminary, as authorities were persuaded of his craziness. Freeman passed on in jail in late 1846. In the Freeman case, summoning dysfunctional behavior and racial issues, Seward contended, "he is as yet your sibling, and mine, in structure and shading acknowledged and endorsed by his Father, and yours, and mine, and bears similarly with us the proudest legacy of our raceÃ¢ÂÂthe picture of our Maker. Hold him at that point to take care of business."
