The classification of "Thalassodromeus" and its closest relatives is one of the most contentious issues regarding their group. Kellner and Campos originally assigned "Thalassodromeus" to the family Tapejaridae, based on its large crest and large nasoantorbital fenestra. Within this clade, they found that it differed from the short-faced genus "Tapejara" but shared a keel on the palate with "Tupuxuara". Kellner elaborated on the relationships within Tapejaridae in 2004, and pointed out that "Thalassodromeus" and "Tupuxuara" also shared a crest consisting primarily of bone; the crest had a large component of soft tissue in other members of the group. 
Martill and Naish considered Tapejaridae a paraphyletic (unnatural) group in 2006, and found "Tupuxuara" (which included "Thalassodromeus" in their analysis) to be the sister taxon to the family Azhdarchidae. This clade ("Tupuxuara" and Azhdarchidae) had been named Neoazhdarchia by palaeontologist David Unwin in 2003, an arrangement Martill and Naish concurred with. According to Martill, features uniting members of Neoazhdarchia included the presence of a notarium (fused vertebrae in the shoulder region), the loss of contact between the first and third metacarpals (bones in the hand), and very long snouts (more than 88% of the skull length). Kellner and Campos defended the validity of Tapejaridae in 2007, dividing it into two clades: Tapejarinae and Thalassodrominae, the latter containing "Thalassodromeus" (the type genus) and "Tupuxuara". They distinguished thalassodromines by their high nasoantorbital fenestrae and the bony part of their crests beginning at the front of the skull and continuing further back than in other pterosaurs.
