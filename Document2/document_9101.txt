In October 1839, Ralph Waldo Emerson was looking for an editorial manager for his visionary diary "The Dial". After a few declined the position, he offered it to Fuller, alluding to her as "my vivacious companion." Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that gathering, he conceded: "she made me snicker more than I loved." The following summer, Fuller went through about fourteen days at Emerson's home in Concord. Fuller acknowledged Emerson's idea to alter "The Dial" on October 20, 1839, and started work in the main seven day stretch of 1840. She altered the diary from 1840 to 1842, however her guaranteed yearly pay of $200 was never paid. In view of her job, she was before long perceived as a standout amongst the most vital figures of the supernatural development and was welcome to George Ripley's Brook Farm, a public investigation. Fuller never authoritatively joined the network yet was a regular guest, frequently spending New Year's Eve there. In the late spring of 1843, she made a trip to Chicago, Milwaukee, Niagara Falls, and Buffalo, New York; while there, she communicated with a few Native Americans, including individuals from the Ottawa and the Chippewa clans. She detailed her encounters in a book called "Summer on the Lakes", which she finished composition on her 34th birthday celebration in 1844. The commentator Evert Augustus Duyckinck called it "the main certifiable book, I can think about, this season." Fuller utilized the library at Harvard College to do look into on the Great Lakes locale, and turned into the principal lady permitted to utilize Harvard's library.
