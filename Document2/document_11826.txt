Manuel attempted to recover Thessalonica with Nicaean help, however an arranged settlement was achieved which gave him Thessaly and left Thessalonica and its environs to Theodore and John. In 1241, John III Vatatzes welcomed Theodore to visit Nicaea. He was invited and treated with significant privilege, however was viably kept there until the spring of one year from now, when Vatatzes walked on Thessalonica with Theodore close by. Theodore was sent in to consult with his child and persuade him to acknowledge downgrade to the position of Despot and to perceive the suzerainty of Nicaea. John passed on in 1244 and was prevailing by Theodore's more youthful child Demetrios. In 1246, Vatatzes toppled the disagreeable Demetrios and added Thessalonica.
