After Webb's passing, Gibbons stayed at Oakshott Avenue and kept on composing books. From 1961 she leased a late spring house at Trevone in Cornwall, which turned into the setting for her 1962 novel "The Weather at Tregulla". She came back to scholarly analysis after numerous years, when in 1965 she contributed a paper to "Light on C.S. Lewis", a survey of that essayist's work altered by Jocelyn Gibb. In 1966 she composed a paper for "Punch", "Beginning of a Novel", in which she considered on the negative impact of "Limited consolidation Farm" on her long haul vocation. She compared the book to "some unignorable old uncle, to whom you must be appreciative on the grounds that he offers you an attractive leniency, yet is regularly a humiliation and a drag". Gibbons made her last abroad excursion in 1966, to Grenoble in France where she visited her old companion Elizabeth Coxhead. This visit gave material to her 1968 novel "The Snow Woman" in which Gibbons defeated her routine dislike for enthusiastic abundance by opening the book with an exaggerated birth on a couch. "The Woods in Winter" (1970) was her last distributed novel; she chose by then that she was never again arranged to expose her work to article control. During the 1980s she composed two additional books for private flow among companions, "The Yellow Houses" and "An Alpha". These books Ã¢ÂÂ "An Alpha" retitled "Unadulterated Juliet" Ã¢ÂÂ were distributed by Vintage Classics in 2016, after the original copies were discharged by Gibbons' family.
