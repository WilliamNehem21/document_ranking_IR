Initially, authoritative power was practiced by the sovereign following up on the counsel of the "Curia Regis", or Royal Council, in which essential magnates and ministers took an interest and which advanced into parliament. In 1265, the Earl of Leicester sporadically called a full parliament without illustrious authorisation. Enrollment of the alleged Model Parliament, built up in 1295 under Edward I included diocesans, abbots, dukes, noblemen, two knights from every shire and two burgesses from every district. The body in the end came to be partitioned into two branches: religious administrators, abbots, dukes, and aristocrats framed the House of Lords, while the shire and district delegates shaped the House of Commons. The King would look for the counsel and assent of the two houses under the steady gaze of making any law. Amid Henry VI's rule, it wound up customary practice for the two houses to start enactment as bills, which would not wind up law except if the sovereign's consent was gotten, as the sovereign might have been, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Consequently, all Acts incorporate the statement "Be it authorized by the Queen's (King's) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the exhortation and assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament amassed, and by the specialist of the equivalent, as follows...". The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 give a second potential preface if the House of Lords were to be barred from the procedure.
