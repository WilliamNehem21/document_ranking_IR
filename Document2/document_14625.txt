Roddenberry did not live to see the film's discharge, biting the dust of heart disappointment on October 24, 1991. Before the film's discharge he saw a close last form of "The Undiscovered Country", and as per the film's maker and Kelley's biographer, affirmed a last form of the film. Interestingly, Nimoy and Shatner's journals report that after the screening he called his attorney and requested a fourth of the scenes be cut; the makers can't, and inside 48 hours he was dead. Principal considered spending near $240,000 to send Roddenberry's fiery debris into spaceÃ¢ÂÂa move that had the support of fansÃ¢ÂÂyet ruled against it; his remaining parts would make it into space alongside 22 others in 1997. The film's opening incorporated a note to Roddenberry's memory; at early showings, the hordes of "Star Trek" fans acclaimed boisterously. While the makers had started take a shot at the film foreseeing it as the last film, by the debut it was clear the film would profit and that a "Star Trek VII" would before long be in progress. The cast was part on the likelihood of a continuation; Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley said that the film would be their last, while the supporting cast unequivocally campaigned for another film. The agreement was for the following film to star the cast of "The Next Generation". The seventh "Star Trek" include, "Star Trek Generations" (1994), would mix the old and new cast.
