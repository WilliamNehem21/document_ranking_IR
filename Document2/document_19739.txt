As the nominations for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards approached, early media reports named "True Detective" among several potential miniseries candidates, due to a revision made by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories. By March 2014, HBO had submitted "True Detective" as a drama series contender, an unconventional move given the show's anthology format and fierce competition from the likes of "Breaking Bad" and "House of Cards". HBO's decision was censured by FX president John Landgraf, who remarked to reporters at a press event: "My own personal point of view is that a miniseries is a story that ends, a series is a story that continues. To tell you the truth, I think it's actually unfair for HBO to put "True Detective" in the drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed-ended series â a la Billy Bob Thornton in "Fargo" or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in "True Detective" â who you can't get to sign on for a seven-year [regular drama series] deal." Nevertheless, "True Detective" emerged as a frontrunner heading into the Primetime Emmy season, and in July 2014, was nominated for twelve awards; its closest rival, "Breaking Bad", received sixteen nominations. The series ultimately won five Emmy awards: Outstanding Directing (Fukunaga), Outstanding Casting, Outstanding Main Title Design, Outstanding Make-Up, and Outstanding Cinematography.
