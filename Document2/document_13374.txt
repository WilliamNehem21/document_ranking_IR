Franco's passing in 1975 prompted the beginnings of strategic development among Britain and Spain on the Gibraltar issue, however not right away. Spain connected to join the European Economic Community (EEC) and NATO, for which it required British help. In 1980, talks among British and Spanish clergymen prompted the Lisbon Agreement, an announcement on co-activity between the two nations which submitted them to beginning dealings on Gibraltar's future and lifting the Spanish confinements on correspondences with Gibraltar. In spite of the fact that Britain guaranteed to "respect the unreservedly and equitably communicated wishes of the general population of Gibraltar", Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher showed in the House of Commons that sway would be on the table, in a change from the past arrangement. Notwithstanding, the fringe was not revived because of "specialized issues" Ã¢ÂÂ code for uncertain issues between the two governments Ã¢ÂÂ and the understanding was emphatically contradicted by numerous Gibraltarians, who did not want their power to be under discourse and questioned the absence of Gibraltarian delegates at the discussions. The flare-up of the Falklands War in 1982 caused a further deferral. Argentina completed a fruitless damage activity, stayed discreet at the time, that was proposed to sink a Royal Navy frigate in Gibraltar's harbor; the saboteurs were caught by the Spanish police in Algeciras before they could do their assault. A further understanding was come to in Brussels in 1984 which illuminated the Lisbon Agreement and necessitated that Britain enable Spaniards to live and work in Gibraltar, which they would reserve the option to do at any rate as EEC residents. The fringe was at long last completely revived on 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5 February 1985.
