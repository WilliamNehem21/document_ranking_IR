The eight I Squadron ships went into the Baltic on 22 February 1915 for unit preparing, which endured until 13 March. Following their arrival toward the North Sea, the boats partook in a progression of uneventful armada fights on 29Ã¢ÂÂ 30 March, 17Ã¢ÂÂ 18 April, 21Ã¢ÂÂ 22 April, 17Ã¢ÂÂ 18 May, and 29Ã¢ÂÂ 30 May. "ThÃÂ¼ringen" and the remainder of the armada at that point stayed in port until 4 August, when the I Squadron came back to the Baltic for another round of preparing moves. From that point, the squadron was appended to the maritime power that endeavored to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian maritime powers in August 1915. The strike drive incorporated the eight I Squadron warships, the battlecruisers , and "Seydlitz", a few light cruisers, 32 destroyers and 13 minesweepers. The arrangement called for directs to be cleared in Russian minefields with the goal that the Russian maritime nearness, which incorporated the pre-battleship , could be dispensed with. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to keep Russian boats from coming back to the Gulf. "ThÃÂ¼ringen" and most of the other enormous boats of the High Seas Fleet stayed outside the Gulf for the total of the task. The gunboats and were disengaged on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to crush "Slava", however they neglected to sink the old warship. Following three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August; reports of Allied submarines in the territory provoked a German withdrawal from the Gulf the next day. By 26 August, the I Squadron had come back to Wilhelmshaven.
