Hoffman's profile continued to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama "Jack Goes Boating" was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of JackÂ â a lonely limousine driver looking for loveÂ â after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the "Daily Mirror" remarked that "Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember what it was about as I left", while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to "Jack Goes Boating", in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard's tragic drama "The Long Red Road" for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of "Variety" described the production as "heavy handed" and "predictable", but "intriguing and at least partially successful".
