In 1921, Hewett exhumed Chetro Ketl's incredible kiva, where he found a progressively antiquated one covered beneath. He additionally discovered a few macaw quills, yet no copper ringers like those found at Pueblo Bonito. Hewett was astounded at the absence of colorful things at the site, where no human internments have been found. In 1931 and 1932, Reiter and Gordon Vivian found reserves of turquoise dots and pendants while diving in the incredible kiva. Taking all things together, 17,454 dabs were recouped from the kiva's covered specialties. In 1947, when rising waters from Chaco Wash infringed on Chetro Ketl, Vivian saved a reserve of wooden antiques from an unexcavated room. Archeologists think about the wooden figures, some of which portray fowls, one of a kind in the area. A few highly contrasting stone neckbands was likewise revealed. Barbara J. Plants, creator of "Key Debates in Chacoan Archeology", trusts the things speak to "proof of exceptional stylized action" at Chetro Ketl. Lekson takes note of that after "astounding measures of material" were recuperated at Pueblo Bonito, "desires for Chetro Ketl were without a doubt high", and in spite of the fact that Hewett and his understudies were at last disillusioned, he portrays the wooden antiques as "an unprecedented gathering". In spite of this, researchers keep on viewing Chetro Ketl as a spot where generally couple of things of archeological intrigue have been revealed.
