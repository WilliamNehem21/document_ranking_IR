At the point when the Southern states withdrew from the Union and the American Civil War started, a large number of men in Ohio volunteered for administration. Among them were McKinley and his cousin William McKinley Osbourne, who enrolled as privates in the recently framed Poland Guards in June 1861. The men left for Columbus where they were solidified with other little units to frame the 23rd Ohio Infantry. The men were miserable to discover that, in contrast to Ohio's prior volunteer regiments, they would not be allowed to choose their officers; they would be assigned by Ohio's representative, William Dennison. Dennison delegated Colonel William Rosecrans as the authority of the regiment, and the men started preparing on the edges of Columbus. McKinley rapidly took to the trooper's life and composed a progression of letters to the place where he grew up paper praising the military and the Union reason. Deferrals in issuance of garbs and weapons again carried the men into strife with their officers, however Major Rutherford B. Hayes persuaded them to acknowledge what the administration had issued them; his style in managing the men inspired McKinley, starting an affiliation and kinship that would last until Hayes' demise in 1893.
