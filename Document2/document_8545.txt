In 1997, Charig and Milner noticed that two fragmentary spinosaurid noses from the Elrhaz Formation of Niger (detailed by the French scientist Philippe Taquet in 1984) were sufficiently comparable to "Baryonyx" that they thought about them to have a place with an uncertain types of the variety (in spite of their a lot more youthful Aptian topographical age). In 1998, these fossils turned into the premise of the family and species "Cristatusaurus lapparenti", named by Taquet and the American scientist Dale Russell. The American scientist Paul Sereno and partners named the new sort and species "Suchomimus tenerensis" later in 1998, in view of increasingly total fossils from the Elrhaz Formation. In 2002, the German scientist Hans-Dieter Sues and partners recommended that "Suchomimus tenerensis" was comparative enough to "Baryonyx walkeri" to be viewed as an animal varieties inside similar class (as "B. tenerensis"), and that "Suchomimus" was indistinguishable to "Cristatusaurus". Milner agreed that the material from Niger was vague from "Baryonyx" in 2003. In a 2004 meeting conceptual, Hutt and Newberry bolstered the synonymy dependent on a vast theropod vertebra from the Isle of Wight which they credited to a creature firmly identified with "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus". Later examinations have kept "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus" isolated, though "Cristatusaurus" has been proposed to be either a "nomen dubium" or conceivably unmistakable from both. A 2017 audit paper by the Brazilian scientist Carlos Roberto A. Candeiro and associates expressed that this discussion was more in the domain of semantics than science, as it is commonly concurred that "B. walkeri" and "S. tenerensis" are particular, related species.
