The divine beings were accepted to show in numerous structures. The Egyptians had a mind boggling origination of the human spirit, comprising of a few sections. The spirits of the divine beings were made out of huge numbers of these equivalent components. The "ba" was the part of the human or heavenly soul that influenced it's general surroundings. Any obvious indication of a divine being's capacity could be called its "ba"; in this way, the sun was known as the "ba" of Ra. A portrayal of a god was considered a "ka", another part of its being, which gone about as a vessel for that god's "ba" to occupy. The clique pictures of divine beings that were the focal point of sanctuary ceremonies, just as the hallowed creatures that spoke to specific gods, were accepted to house divine "ba"s along these lines. Divine beings could be attributed many "ba"s and "ka"s, which were here and there given names speaking to various parts of the god's temperament. Everything in presence was said to be one of the "ka"s of Atum the maker god, who initially contained everything inside himself, and one divinity could be known as the "ba" of another, implying that the main god is an appearance of the other's capacity. Divine body parts could go about as discrete gods, similar to the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, the two of which were represented as goddesses. The divine beings were so loaded with nurturing power that even their organic liquids could change into other living things; mankind was said to have sprung from the maker god's tears, and different gods from his perspiration.
