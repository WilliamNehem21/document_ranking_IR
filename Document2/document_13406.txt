The assessed expense of such a plant was around $32.6 million to assemble and $62,600 every day to run. What killed the proposition was that the plant would require 600 days to achieve balance, by which time $72 million would have been spent, which the S-1 Executive Committee gathered together to $75 million. Accepting that work began promptly, and the plant filled in as planned, no enhanced uranium could be delivered before 1946. Murphree proposed that a fluid warm dissemination plant delivering uranium improved to 10% uranium-235 may be a substitute for the lower phases of a vaporous dispersion plant, yet the S-1 Executive Committee ruled against this. Among February and July 1943 the Anacostia pilot plant created of marginally advanced uranium hexafluoride, which was transported to the Metallurgical Laboratory. In September 1943, the S-1 Executive Committee chose that no more uranium hexafluoride would be designated to the NRL, in spite of the fact that it would trade advanced uranium hexafluoride for ordinary uranium hexafluoride. Forests diverted down a request from the NRL for extra uranium hexafluoride in October 1943. When it was brought up that the naval force had built up the generation procedure for uranium hexafluoride in any case, the military reluctantly consented to satisfy the request.
