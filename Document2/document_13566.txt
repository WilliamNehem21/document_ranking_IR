II Corps was renumbered I Corps on 13 April 1944 and came back to Australia, where Blamey gave Berryman his next task. In anticipation of the Philippines Campaign, General MacArthur moved the propelled component of GHQ to Hollandia in Dutch West Papua, where it opened in late August 1944. To keep up contact with GHQ, Blamey shaped another base camp, Forward Echelon LHQ, which opened at Hollandia on 7 September under Berryman, who turned into Blamey's own delegate at GHQ. Forward Echelon LHQ hence moved with GHQ to Leyte in February 1945, and Manila in April 1945. Berryman's job was to "protect Australian interests" at GHQ, yet he likewise guarded GHQ against analysis from the Australian Army. Just as liaising with GHQ, Forward Echelon LHQ ended up in charge of arranging activities including Australian troops. It chipped away at designs for activities on Luzon and Mindanao before it was at last chosen that Borneo would be the Australian Army's next goal. In the majority of this Berrymen stayed in touch with Blamey, and the two were Australian Army delegates at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in September 1945. For his administrations in the last crusades, Berryman got a fourth and last Mention in Despatches on 6 March 1947.
