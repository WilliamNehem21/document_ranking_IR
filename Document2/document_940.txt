Its relationship with tempests makes the tempest petrel a winged animal of awful sign to sailors; they are said to either prognosticate or cause terrible climate. An increasingly dull clarification of their appearance in unpleasant climate is that, as most maritime seabirds, they depend on the breezes to help them in flight and simply sit on the water surface when soothed. The winged creatures were here and there thought to be the spirits of died mariners, and executing a petrel was accepted to bring misfortune. The petrel's notoriety prompted the old name of "witch", in spite of the fact that the commonest of the people names is Mother Carey's Chicken, a name likewise utilized for tempest petrels by and large in the UK and USA from no less than 1767. This is accepted to be a debasement of "mater cara" ("dear mother", the Virgin Mary), a reference to the extraordinary Mother Carey, or a superstitious change of a prior "Mother Mary's Chicken" to diminish the strength of the religious name. The Mother Carey character shows up various occasions in writing. In the Cicely Fox Smith sonnet "Mother Carey", she calls old mariners to come back to the ocean, yet in John Masefield's ballad of a similar name she is viewed as a wrecker of boats. She shows up as a pixie in Charles Kingsley's "The Water Babies" and is portrayed in one of Jessie Willcox Smith's representations for the book.
