Colonel McClureÃ¢ÂÂdirecting the 35th InfantryÃ¢ÂÂrequested the 35th's second Battalion and the 25th's Reconnaissance Troop to mitigate the 132nd Infantry Regiment at the Gifu, with requests to weight that solid point and stay in contact with Goggin's third Battalion, 182nd on the right. The 35th's own third BattalionÃ¢ÂÂdirected by Lt. Col. William J. Mullen, Jr.Ã¢ÂÂ was to propel southwest from Hill 27 (south of the Gifu on Mount Austen), and after that swing north to catch Hills 43 and 44. Lt. Col. James B. Sneer's first Battalion was to be at first in regimental save, following about an a large portion of day's walk behind Mullen's brigade. The third Battalion, 182d Infantry, was allocated the undertaking of securing the 25th Division's big guns positions on the open ground north of Mount Austen and east of the Matanikau by propelling south from Hill 65 to square the waterway gorge and the gorge between Hills 31 and 42 against Japanese penetration. Keeping up contact with the 27th and 35th Regiments, Goggin's force was to strike Sea Horse Ridge working together with the other two regiments. By 30 December, Goggin's third Battalion, 182nd was in real life against Japanese powers on Sea Horse Ridge.
