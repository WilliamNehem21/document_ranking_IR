Paul's sixteenth CD, "The Day After Everything Changed", was discharged on January 12, 2010. As opposed to work with a record name, Paul welcomed fans to help money the chronicle by offering givers different premiums dictated by the dimension of gift. Despite the fact that Paul didn't know what's in store when the United States economy crumbled, the fan-subsidizing activity brought about more than $100,000 being gathered - increasingly, as per Paul, - than any mark had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a visitor appearance by Kristian Bush that incorporates a two part harmony on the track, "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan bolster motivated him to make "the best record I could". One commentator expressed: "This is such a tuneful, flawlessly drawn arrangement of melodies played and sung with power that it reminds you the amount we need storytellers back in popular musicÃ¢ÂÂstorytellers with sympathy, fine eyes and an understanding that despite the fact that we live in a callous, impassive world our music doesn't need to mirror our way of life." In her audit for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is "a masterwork loaded up with the best music and verses of his vocation."
