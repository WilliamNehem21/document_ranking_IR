Imprint Mangini filled in as "The Voyage Home"s sound creator. He portrayed it as unique in relation to chipping away at numerous different movies in light of the fact that Nimoy valued the job of audio cues and ensured that they were conspicuous in the film. Since numerous sounds natural to "Star Trek" had been set upÃ¢ÂÂthe Bird-of-Prey's shrouding gadget, the transporter bar, "et al."Ã¢ÂÂ Mangini concentrated on rolling out just little improvements to them. The most essential sounds were those of the whales and the test. Mangini's sibling lived close scholar Roger Payne, who had accounts of whale tune. Mangini experienced the tapes and picked sounds that could be blended to propose discussion and language. The test's shrieking calls were the whale melody in twisted structure. The humpback's correspondence with the test at the peak of the film contained no emotional music, implying that Mangini's sounds needed to remain solitary. He reviewed that he experienced issues with imagining how the scene would unfurl, driving Bennett to play out a manikin show to clarify. Nimoy and different makers were discontent with Mangini's endeavors to make the test's rambling working commotion; after in excess of twelve endeavors, the sound fashioner at long last asked Nimoy what he figured the test should seem like. Mangini recorded Nimoy's throaty "wub-wub-wub" reaction, twisted it with "simply the most minor piece of dressing", and utilized it as the last solid.
