Sound editorial manager Carl Glanville chipped away at the soundtrack, blending the sound into a 5.1 encompass sound blend with sound architect Robbie Adams in New York City. Video film was assembled into documents by Wicki, which were given to Glanville for incorporating the soundtrack. Glanville and Adams said the sound altering was troublesome primarily in light of the fact that the determination of video film was restricted, as just a single to two cameras points were caught at the majority of the shows. Further, the verses and music from the tune exhibitions contrasted marginally every night. To keep away from lip match up and instrumental synchronize issues, the editors needed to utilize the definite sound that was recorded amid each shot. Blending the vocals required that Glanville layer the sound recorded from the stage mouthpieces with that from the gathering of people amplifiers and to include a short deferral between the two to adjust for any reverberations or postpone that happened in the scene. The sound from the subwoofer channel was blended inside two IMAX theaters in Los Angeles to guarantee the volume of low-end frequencies was predictable with the remainder of the soundtrack. The altered video film included 10-to 20-second-long shots, rather than the shorter shots generally found in show films. Broadened holes were added between melodies to marginally back off the pace of the film. All sound and video film utilized was recorded live in show, with no additional overdubs.
