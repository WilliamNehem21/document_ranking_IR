Bernhard acquired Elinor Mavor to alter both "Stunning" and "Phenomenal". Mavor had already altered "Bill of Fare", an eatery exchange diary, and was a long-term sci-fi peruser, however she had little information of the historical backdrop of the magazines. She was uninformed, for instance, that she was not the main lady to alter them, thus embraced a male pen nameÃ¢ÂÂ"Gohagen"Ã¢ÂÂ for some time. She proposed a crusade to expand course, and ventured to such an extreme as to assemble data about expenses while on an outing to New York in 1979. Bernhard chose rather to consolidate the two magazines. Flow was proceeding to drop; the figures throughout the previous two years are not accessible, yet sf student of history Mike Ashley gauges that "Fabulous'" paid course may have been as low as 13,000. Bernhard felt that since "Awesome" had never been beneficial, while "Astonishing" had profited, it was ideal to continue "Stunning". Until the March 1985 issue, "Astounding" incorporated a notice of "Awesome" on the spine and on the substance page. In 1999, the fiction magazine once in the past known as "Privateer Writings" restored the "Phenomenal" title and Cele Goldsmith-time logotype for a few issues, eventually ineffectively, however this was not planned as a continuation of the first magazine.
