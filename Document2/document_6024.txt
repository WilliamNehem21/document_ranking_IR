In spite of the fact that the outside of Bodiam Castle has to a great extent endure, the inside is ruinous. The household structures inside the mansion lined the shade dividers. Be that as it may, remains are sufficiently considerable to reproduce an arrangement of the manor. The structure was isolated into discrete living zones for the ruler and his family, high-status visitors, the armies, and workers. The south scope of the mansion comprised of the extraordinary corridor, the kitchens, and related rooms. The extraordinary lobby, toward the east of the halfway found postern door, was and would have been as tall as the shade divider. Toward the west of the extraordinary corridor was the wash room and rich, connected to the incredible lobby by a screens entry. The three standing curves offered access to various rooms, the wash room, rich and the kitchen which was at the most distant west of the south range. This design was average of expansive medieval houses. The extraordinary corridor was the social focus of the stronghold, and where the ruler would have engaged visitors. The rich and storeroom involved the base floor, or more was a room of obscure reason. The rich had a basement and was utilized to store lager and wine, while the wash room held the provisions for the kitchen. To keep heat from the cooking fires getting to be terrible, the kitchen was as tall as the drape dividers to give a huge space to ingest the warmth. In the southwest pinnacle was a well, from which water would have been drawn for the family unit.
