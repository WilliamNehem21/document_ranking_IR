Debussy's scholarly motivations were for the most part French, yet he didn't neglect outside journalists. Just as Maeterlinck for "PellÃÂ©as et MÃÂ©lisande", he drew on Shakespeare and Charles Dickens for two of his PrÃÂ©ludes for piano Ã¢ÂÂ "La Danse de Puck" (Book 1, 1910) and "Hommage ÃÂ  S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C." (Book 2, 1913). He set Dante Gabriel Rossetti's "The Blessed Damozel" in his initial cantata, "La Damoiselle ÃÂ©lue" (1888). He composed coincidental music for "Lord Lear" and arranged a musical drama dependent on "As You Like It", yet deserted that once he directed his concentration toward setting Maeterlinck's play. In 1890 he started take a shot at a symphonic piece enlivened by Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" and later outlined the lyrics for a musical drama, "La chute de la maison Usher". Another undertaking roused by Poe Ã¢ÂÂ an operatic variant of "The Devil in the Belfry" did not advance past portrayals. French authors whose words he set incorporate Paul Bourget, Alfred de Musset, ThÃÂ©odore de Banville, Leconte de Lisle, ThÃÂ©ophile Gautier, Paul Verlaine, FranÃÂ§ois Villon, and MallarmÃÂ© Ã¢ÂÂ the remainder of whom likewise given Debussy the motivation for a standout amongst his most prominent instrumental pieces, "PrÃÂ©lude ÃÂ  l'aprÃÂ¨s-midi d'un faune".
