Stephan Dupuis was given the assignment of updating Jason for the tenth "Friday the thirteenth" film. One idea brought into the film was Jason's regenerative capacities. Dupuis gave the character more hair and all the more a characteristic tissue appearance to delineate the consistent recovery the character experiences; Dupuis needed an increasingly "gothic" plan for Jason, so he included chains and shackles, and made the hockey veil progressively rakish. Jim Isaac and the remainder of his team needed to make a completely new Jason sooner or later in the film. The thought was for the youngsters to totally wreck Jason's body, enabling the modern innovation to breath life into him back. What was alluded to as ÃÂber-Jason was intended to have pieces of metal developing from his body, pleather rings that developed into the metal, all pushing through a cowhide suit. The metal was made from VacuForm, a similar material used to build the span of the first hockey cover, and was joined by Velcro. The ringlets were produced using silicone. The majority of the pieces were created onto one suit, including a whole head piece, which Hodder wore. The make-up impacts group included zippers at the edge of the suit, which permitted Hodder to enter and leave the suit inside 15 minutes.
