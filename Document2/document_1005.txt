The underlying outlines for the CRSP included two dams on the Green River inside Dinosaur National Monument's Echo Park Canyon, a move censured by both the U.S. National Park Service and naturalist gatherings, for example, the Sierra Club. Discussion achieved an across the nation scale, and the USBR dropped its arrangements for the Dinosaur dams in return for a dam at Flaming Gorge and a raise to an as of now proposed dam at Glen Canyon. The renowned restriction to Glen Canyon Dam, the essential component of the CRSP, did not gather speed until development was well in progress. This was fundamentally a result of Glen Canyon's remote area and the outcome that the vast majority of the American open did not know about the presence of the noteworthy crevasse; the rare sorts of people who did fought that it had a lot more prominent picturesque incentive than Echo Park. Sierra Club pioneer David Brower battled the dam both amid the development and for a long time a short time later until his passing in 2000. Brower emphatically trusted that he was by and by in charge of the inability to forestall Glen Canyon's flooding, calling it his "most noteworthy misstep, most prominent sin".
