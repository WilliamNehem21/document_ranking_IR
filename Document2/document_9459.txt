On account of the loss of their situations on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese chose that an assault on the U.S. resistances along the coast would be restrictively troublesome. In this way, after perception of the American safeguards around Lunga Point by his staff officers, Hyakutake chose that the primary purpose of his arranged assault would be from south of Henderson Field. His second Division (expanded by one regiment from 38th Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and containing 7,000 officers in three infantry regiments of three contingents every wa requested to walk through the wilderness and assault the American safeguards from the south close to the east bank of the Lunga River. The second Division was part into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi comprising of the 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division hold driven by Maruyama involving the sixteenth Infantry Regiment. The date of the assault was set for 22 October. To divert the Americans from the arranged assault from the south, Hyakutake's substantial big guns in addition to five contingents of infantry (around 2,900 men) under Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi were to assault the American resistances from the west along the waterfront passage. The Japanese evaluated that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in actuality there were around 23,000.
