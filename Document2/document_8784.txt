In 1893 the Highland dropped the traffic understanding and pulled back two interfacing trains, grumbling that they were unrewarding. One of the trains was reestablished after an intrigue was made to the Railway and Canal Commissioners and a baffled Great North connected to parliament in 1895 for running forces to Inverness, yet pulled back after it was concurred that the Railway and Canal Commissioners would parley in the issue. With no judgment by 1897, the Great North arranged to apply again to run controls over the Highland to Inverness, this time consenting to twofold track the line, yet the chiefs distributed their finding before the bill was submitted to parliament. Traffic was to be traded at both Elgin and Keith, the administrations traded at Elgin expected to incorporate through carriages from both the Craigellachie and the coast courses, and the timetable must be endorsed by the officials. The subsequent Commissioners' Service began in 1897 with eight through administrations, four by means of the Highland to Keith taking between and 5 hours, and four with carriages traded at Elgin with segments that voyaged by means of Craigellachie and the coast, two of these taking hours. The 3ÃÂ pm from Inverness to Aberdeen by means of Keith took 3 hours 5 minutes. At first bits for the coast and Craigellachie separated at Huntly, yet Cairnie Platform was opened at Grange Junction in summer 1898. The primary line was twofold track to Huntly in 1896 and Keith in 1898, aside from a solitary track connect over the Deveron among Avochie and Rothiemay, which was supplanted by a twofold track connect in 1900.
