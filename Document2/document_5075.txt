At the point when a gathering of around 50 ZANUÃ¢ÂÂ PF activists quickly attacked Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the occurrence, saying the interlopers were simply exhausted and out of work. "There's no governmental issues on the homestead," he said. After five months, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith depicted Mugabe as "rationally unsettled". The President reported accordingly that Smith would be captured and strove for decimation on the off chance that he at any point returned to Zimbabwe, a danger that Smith ridiculed. "I would love that. Give him a chance to attempt it," he saidÃ¢ÂÂ"It would allow me to inform the world reality regarding this gangsterÃÂ ... I will give him the date and time of landing of my plane so he can meet me at the airplane terminal." A mass of columnists plunged on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to observe Smith's capture, yet a long way from being confined, the previous Prime Minister was welcomed brightly by movement officers and permitted through with no deterrent. Telling the holding up pressmen that he was baffled not to have met any showdown, he remarked: "We have a president here who is rationally insecure and makes proclamations that make little difference to the real world", and returned home left alone.
