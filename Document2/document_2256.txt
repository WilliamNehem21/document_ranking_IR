The preliminary opened on 8 June 1976. Just as Davies, Dick and Munroe, three associates were available, accused of various offenses, including helping the burglary (the escape driver), providing guns, and intrigue charges. Davies, Dick and Munroe would not acknowledge the authenticity of the court. At the point when asked how they argued to the charges, Davies yelled "We've quit arguingÃ¢ÂÂwe've been arguing for a long time. This isn't a preliminaryÃ¢ÂÂit's a lynching party." The three men played Judas on the court and talked between themselves. The judge, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, requested that the three men be reclaimed to their cells and that a supplication of not liable be entered for their benefit. One of the associates, Lillo Termaine, confessed to the charges of connivance to burglarize the eatery. Police said that he had been the one behind the theft, and had arranged it to satisfy betting obligations. The preliminary finished on 30 June. Davies, Dick and Munroe were condemned to 22, 18 and 17 years in jail individually, Termaine was given six years. One of the associates was absolved and Addison, the escape driver, was sent for re-preliminary as the jury couldn't achieve a decision. That November, following the second preliminary, Addison was discovered blameworthy and gaoled for a long time. Davies, Dick and Munroe passed on in the wake of being discharged from jail, two of them at moderately youthful ages; Dick changed his name to Shujaa Moshesh when of his demise in Africa.
