Toward the start of the ninth century, England was entirely under the control of the Anglo-Saxons. The Midland kingdom of Mercia overwhelmed southern England, however their matchless quality arrived at an end in 825 when they were unequivocally vanquished by Ecgberht at the Battle of Ellendun. The two kingdoms moved toward becoming partners, which was critical in the protection from Viking assaults. Around the same time Ecgberht sent his child ÃÂthelwulf to vanquish the Mercian sub-kingdom of Kent (the zone of the cutting edge province in addition to Essex, Surrey and Sussex) and named him sub-lord. In 835 the Isle of Sheppey was attacked by Vikings and in the next year they vanquished Ecgberht at Carhampton in Somerset, however in 838 he was successful over a union of Cornishmen and Vikings at the Battle of Hingston Down, lessening Cornwall to the status of a customer kingdom. He kicked the bucket in 839 and was prevailing by ÃÂthelwulf, who selected his oldest child ÃÂthelstan as sub-ruler of Kent. ÃÂthelwulf and Ecgberht might not have planned a lasting joining among Wessex and Kent as they both designated children as sub-lords and sanctions in Wessex were confirmed (seen) by West Saxon magnates, while Kentish contracts were seen by the Kentish world class; the two rulers kept by and large control and the sub-rulers were not permitted to issue their own coinage.
