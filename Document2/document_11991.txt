Earth is the main known planet with oceans of fluid water on its surface, in spite of the fact that Mars has ice tops and comparable planets in other heavenly bodies may have seas. It is as yet hazy where Earth's water originated from, be that as it may, seen from space, our planet shows up as a "blue marble" of its different structures: seas, ice tops, mists. Earth's of ocean contain about 97.2 percent of its known water and spread in excess of 70 percent of its surface. Another 2.15% of Earth's water is solidified, found in the ocean ice covering the Arctic Ocean, the ice top covering Antarctica and its nearby oceans, and different ice sheets and surface stores the world over. The rest of (0.65% of the entire) structure underground stores or different phases of the water cycle, containing the freshwater experienced and utilized by most earthly life: vapor noticeable all around, the mists it gradually shapes, the downpour tumbling from them, and the lakes and waterways unexpectedly framed as its waters stream over and over to the ocean. The ocean's strength of the planet is with the end goal that the British creator Arthur C. Clarke once noticed that "Earth" would have been exceptional named "Sea".
