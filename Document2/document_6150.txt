Huge numbers of the pilgrims trusted Mexican specialists were producing a reason to assault the town and dispense with the civilian army. Texians slowed down CastaÃÂ±eda's endeavors to arrange the gun's arrival for a few days as they sat tight for fortifications from different provinces. In the early long periods of October 2, roughly 140 Texian volunteers assaulted CastaÃÂ±eda's power. After a short clash, CastaÃÂ±eda mentioned a gathering with Texian pioneer John Henry Moore. CastaÃÂ±eda uncovered that he shared their federalist leanings, however that he was compelled by a sense of duty to pursue orders. As Moore came back to camp, the Texians raised a hand crafted white flag with a picture of the gun painted in dark in the middle, over the words "Come and Take It". Understanding that he was dwarfed and outgunned, CastaÃÂ±eda drove his troops back to BÃÂ©xar. In this first skirmish of the insurgency, two Mexican officers were murdered, and one Texian was harmed when he tumbled off his pony. In spite of the fact that the occasion was, as portrayed by history specialist William C. Davis, "a unimportant clash in which one side did not attempt to battle", Texians before long proclaimed it a triumph over Mexican troops. Updates on the clash spread all through the United States, urging numerous globe-trotters to come to Texas to join the battle.
