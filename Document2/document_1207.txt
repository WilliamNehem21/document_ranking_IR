All through 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-supported the CooperÃ¢ÂÂ Church Amendments, went for checking further heightening of the Vietnam War. Congressional endorsement of one of these alterations on December 15, 1969, de-subsidized the utilization of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had needed to incorporate a limitation on powers entering Cambodia also, yet Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper compose the revision, expected that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was authoritatively unbiased in the contention, may be annoyed. At the point when Sihanouk was removed in 1970, Cambodia's new pioneer, Lon Nol, spoke to President Nixon for help in balancing out his standard. Nixon consented to send troops to Cambodia, regardless of challenges from Cooper and others this abused his expressed objective of de-heightening in the locale. Cooper and Church at that point drafted another change to de-finance U.S. activities in Cambodia; after exchanges with Nixon that kept subsidizing until July 1970 so the troops as of now in the nation could be emptied, the revision passed 58Ã¢ÂÂ 37. The House of Representatives later took the correction from the enactment to which it was joined, and it turned out poorly impact. The revision was all things considered hailed by "The Washington Post" as "the first run through in our history that Congress has endeavored to constrain the arrangement of American troops throughout a continuous war." The battle about the CooperÃ¢ÂÂ Church Amendments negatively affected Cooper's wellbeing, and he was quickly hospitalized to recapture his quality. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken persuaded Cooper to enable them to compose an alteration to end U.S. inclusion in Southeast Asia by and large, in any case, the measure did not have the help to pass and was deserted.
