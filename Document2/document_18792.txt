Following her commissioning, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was assigned to the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet), which shortly thereafter went on a cruise to Spain. While moored in CÃ¡diz, the ships met the four "Brandenburg"-class ships, which were returning from their expedition to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China. From 22 August to 21 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the entire fleet. While in the Danzig Bay, the fleet conducted a naval review for the visiting Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, whose wife Alexandra was Wilhelm's cousin. The winter cruise in December went to southern Norway. In April and May 1902, the squadron went on a training cruise to Britain, followed by a tour of the Kiel Week sailing regatta in late June. The ships then took part in another training cruise to Norway in July and then the autumn maneuvers, which began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade. During the exercise, which lasted from 17 August to 18 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and the rest of I Squadron were assigned to play the roles of both the German fleet and hostile forces. The usual winter cruise went to Bergen, Norway, that year.
