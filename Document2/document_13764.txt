The arrangement of numerous such seamounts has been clarified with the hotspot hypothesis, which portrays the development of chains of volcanoes which get dynamically more seasoned along the length of the chain, with a functioning well of lava just toward one side of the framework. Seamounts and islands in the Marshall Islands don't seem to have started from such basic age-dynamic hotspot volcanism as the age movements in the individual island and seamount chains are frequently conflicting with a hotspot cause. One clarification for this inconsistency might be that more than one hotspot went through the Marshall Islands, and it is likewise conceivable that hotspot volcanism was influenced by extensional twisting of the lithosphere. On account of WÃÂdejebato, hopeful present-day hotspots are the Macdonald hotspot which passed near the seamount amid the Aptian and Albian ages, somewhere in the range of 115 and 94 million years back in the early Cretaceous, and the Society hotspot and Rarotonga hotspot which moved toward the seamount in the late Cretaceous 85-80 million years prior, both timeframes where volcanism happened on WÃÂdejebato. A third hotspot which cooperated with WÃÂdejebato is the Rurutu hotspot. The last two are the hotspots well on the way to be seemingly perpetual, while numerous others, for example, the Marquesas hotspot, were likely dynamic irregularly or just for brief time interims.
