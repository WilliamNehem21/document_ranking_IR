Amid the seventeenth century, the littler Mareyeuse type was utilized for transporting new fish from Boulogne to Paris, a separation of very nearly 200 miles, in less than 18 hours. This adventure is recollected yearly in the Route du Poisson race. Just female horses pulled little trucks brimming with ice and fish on the hand-off style trip. By 1884, the Boulonnais was known as the "biggest and most significant of that sort of pony in France". Around then, they were utilized to move overwhelming squares of structure stone in Paris, with six to eight ponies drawing squares of a few tons. Amid the twentieth century, the bigger Boulonnais type was used by the French armed force, and exceedingly respected for its capacity to pull big guns and supply wagons. Falling interest for the breed implies that today it is reared mostly for horsemeat. In 2010, 60 percent of Boulonnais ponies reared in France were expected for butcher, and 80 percent of these were traded, basically to Italy, to be stuffed before being sent to slaughterhouses. Be that as it may, the part is in emergency because of falling costs, debate and the importation of modest meat; regardless of a resurgence following the Mad Cow alarms of the 1990s, the utilization of pony meat has fallen pointedly, despite the fact that the Nord-Pas-de-Calais area remains the biggest shopper of steed meat in France.
