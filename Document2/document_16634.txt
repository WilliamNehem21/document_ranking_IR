In 2013 The Anti-Defamation League's National Director Abraham H. Foxman accused Waters of anti-Semitism for his support of BDS and for saying that the current Palestinian situation paralleled âwhat went on in the â30s in Germany".Earlier in 2013 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center accused Waters of anti-Semitism for including a giant pig balloon emblazoned with a Jewish Star of David at one of his concerts. In response Waters said "I deplore the policies of the Israeli government in the occupied territories and Gaza. They are immoral, inhuman and illegal. I will continue my non-violent protests as long as the government of Israel continues with these policies. ... It is difficult to make arguments to defend the Israeli government's policies, so would-be defenders often use a diversionary tactic, they routinely drag the critic into a public arena and accuse them of being an antisemite". On 2 October 2015, Waters published an open letter in "Salon" criticising the band Bon Jovi for performing in Tel Aviv, which led Howard Stern to criticise Waters on his radio show. In June 2017 an organization known as "We Don't Need No Roger Waters" started to boycott Waters for his support of the BDS.
