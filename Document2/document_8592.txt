"A. pinnatum" and the other three tree waratah species lie in the subtribe Embothriinae, alongside the genuine waratahs ("Telopea"), "Oreocallis" and the Chilean firetree ("Embothrium coccineum") from South America. Practically every one of these animal categories have red blossoms that are terminal (emerging at the finishes of branches), and henceforth the subtribe's inception and flower appearance in all likelihood originates before the part of the supercontinent Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America more than 60 million years prior. The position, shading and cylindrical state of the blossoms propose that they are winged creature pollinated, and have been so since the radiation of nectar-sustaining fowls, for example, honeyeaters in the Eocene. "Triporopollenites ambiguus" is an antiquated individual from the proteaceae known just from dust stores, initially portrayed from Eocene stores in Victoria. The fossil dust intently looks like that of the Tasmanian waratah ("Telopea truncata"), "A. pinnatum" and "Oreocallis grandiflora". Cladistic investigation of morphological highlights inside the Embothriinae indicated "A.ÃÂ pinnatum" to be the soonest branch inside the family and sister to the next three species. Alongside individuals from other genera in the Embothriinae, "A.ÃÂ pinnatum" has blood red dust, while the other three "Alloxylon" species have yellow dust. Henceforth almost certainly, the genealogical dust shading was red, and remained so with the development of the family "Alloxylon", yet changed to yellow after the uniqueness of "A.ÃÂ pinnatum".
