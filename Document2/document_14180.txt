On 6 May, another duke and skipper for the city were chosen: Paolo Trevisan and Paolo Orio. In July 1426, the new Venetian commander general, Andrea Mocenigo, was told to continue arrangements, yet surrender to the Ottomans ownership of Kassandra and Chortiatis. Then again, the harmony settlement should be exhaustive, including the Latin masters of the Aegean, who were Venetian natives and customers. Coming up short that, Mocenigo was to assault Gallipoli. In August, the Despot of Serbia, Stefan LazareviÃÂ, offered his administrations as go between. On 28 November, Mocenigo figured out how to get Murad's consent to a harmony settlement on the expansive lines of the understanding proposed by Michiel, then again, actually Venice would pay a yearly tribute of 150,000 aspers and expanded annuities for senior individuals from the Ottoman court, and would surrender Chortiatis. Regardless of the Republic's longing to finish up a harmony settlement, the months and years delayed without an understanding. Benedetto Emo, selected diplomat to the Sultan in July 1427 with the express motivation behind sanctioning the arrangement, was supplanted in August 1428 by Jacopo Dandolo. Dandolo was told, if vital, to offer a further increment of the tribute to 300,000 aspers, and a complete aggregate of blessings from 10,000Ã¢ÂÂ 15,000 ducats and a further 2,000 ducats as annuities; further totals could be offered in return for ownership of the environs of Thessalonica, Kassandra, and the salt works. Dandolo did not have any more accomplishment than his forerunner: the Sultan requested of him the surrender of Thessalonica, and when Dandolo answered that he didn't have specialist to do this, the Sultan had him tossed behind bars, where he was left beyond words.
