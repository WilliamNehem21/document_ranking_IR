As a young man FaurÃ© had been very cheerful; a friend wrote of his "youthful, even somewhat child-like, mirth." From his thirties he suffered bouts of depression, which he described as "spleen", possibly first caused by his broken engagement and his lack of success as a composer. In 1890 a prestigious and remunerative commission to write an opera with lyrics by Paul Verlaine was aborted by the poet's drunken inability to deliver a libretto. FaurÃ© was plunged into so deep a depression that his friends were seriously concerned about his health. Winnaretta de Scey-MontbÃ©liard, always a good friend to FaurÃ©, invited him to Venice, where she had a "palazzo" on the Grand Canal. He recovered his spirits and began to compose again, writing the first of his five "MÃ©lodies de Venise", to words by Verlaine, whose poetry he continued to admire despite the operatic debacle.
About this time, or shortly afterwards, FaurÃ©'s liaison with Emma Bardac began; in Duchen's words, "for the first time, in his late forties, he experienced a fulfilling, passionate relationship which extended over several years". His principal biographers all agree that this affair inspired a burst of creativity and a new originality in his music, exemplified in the song cycle "La bonne chanson". FaurÃ© wrote the "Dolly Suite" for piano duet between 1894 and 1897 and dedicated it to Bardac's daughter HÃ©lÃ¨ne, known as "Dolly". Some people suspected that FaurÃ© was Dolly's father, but biographers including Nectoux and Duchen think it unlikely. FaurÃ©'s affair with Emma Bardac is thought to have begun after Dolly was born, though there is no conclusive evidence either way.
