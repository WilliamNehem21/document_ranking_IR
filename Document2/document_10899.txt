Malley surrendered his arrangement in the Commonwealth Military Forces on 18ÃÂ June 1925. The next day, he was authorized a flight lieutenant in the Citizen Air Force, the low maintenance dynamic hold of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He filled in as a pilot with No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron, which worked Airco DH.9s and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s. Shaped at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, the squadron exchanged to the recently opened RAAF Richmond, New South Wales, on 30ÃÂ June. From 1925 to 1928, Malley was VP of the Australian Flying Corps Association. In January 1928, he was elevated to privileged squadron pioneer, and incidentally directed No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron in MarchÃ¢ÂÂ April. That year, he surrendered his situation with Malley's to turn into a flight expert to Australian National Airways (ANA), just as a chief of the organization. In JanuaryÃ¢ÂÂ February 1929, he again incidentally directed No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron. That April, he was an individual from the natives' council in charge of arranging and financing the scan for the "Southern Cross" and its team, Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had drive arrived in North West Australia amid a departure from Richmond to England. Les Holden in the long run found the missing pilots close to the Kimberley locale. In 1930, Malley exchanged to the (latent) RAAF Reserve.
