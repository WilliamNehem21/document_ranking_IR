The nearness of "Australia" around the previous German provinces, joined with the probability of Japan pronouncing war on Germany, incited von Spee to pull back his boats from the district. On 13 August, the East Asia SquadronÃ¢ÂÂexcept for , which was sent to go after British dispatching in the Indian OceanÃ¢ÂÂhad started to move eastwards. Subsequent to showing up off Samoa on 14 September, at that point assaulting Tahiti eight days after the fact, von Spee drove his power to South America, and from that point wanted to cruise for the Atlantic. Patey was requested on 17 September to head back north with "Australia" and "Sydney" to secure the Australian expeditionary power. On 1 October, "Australia", "Sydney", "Montcalm", and "Experience" traveled north from Rabaul to locate the German boats, however pivoted to return at midnight, subsequent to getting an Admiralty message about the Tahiti assault. In spite of the fact that Patey suspected that the Germans were setting out toward South America and needed to pursue with "Australia", the Admiralty was uncertain that the insight was precise, and entrusted the battlecruiser with watching around Fiji on the off chance that they returned. "Australia" achieved Suva on 12 October, and went through the following a month watching the waters around Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia: regardless of Patey's wants to go out further, Admiralty orders kept him tied to Suva until early November.
