Basically nighttime, the female redback lives in a messy web in a warm shielded area, ordinarily close or inside human habitations. It preys on creepy crawlies, bugs and little vertebrates that become caught in its web. It executes its prey by infusing an intricate venom through its two teeth when it nibbles, before enclosing them by silk and sucking out the condensed internal parts. Regularly, it first squirts its injured individual with what takes after 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilizing the prey by staying the unfortunate casualty's appendages and limbs to its very own body. The redback creepy crawly then supports the unfortunate casualty with silk. When its prey is limited, it is nibbled over and over on the head, body and leg sections and is then pulled back to the redback creepy crawly's retreat. Now and again a possibly perilous unfortunate casualty can be left to battle for a considerable length of time until it is sufficiently depleted to approach securely. Male insects and spiderlings regularly live on the fringe of the female creepy crawlies' web and take scraps. Different types of creepy crawly and parasitoid wasps go after this species. The redback is one of couple of 8-legged creature that generally show sexual savagery while mating.
