Stephen Holden from "The New York Times" expressed, "This rendition of "The Mummy" has no misrepresentations to be something besides a bombastic comic computer game sprinkled onto the screen. Think "Pillagers of the Lost Ark" with animation characters, no intelligible story line and sumptuous however mushy enhancements. Think "Night of the Living Dead" deprived of certifiable ghastliness and restaged as an Egyptian-topic Halloween expo. Think "Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy" joined onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope street picture ("The Road to Hamunaptra"?) and siphoned up into an epic-estimate classification parody." Publications like "The Austin Chronicle" and "Dallas Observer" reached the resolution that in spite of good acting and enhancements, the motion picture needed attachment; discussing the embellishments, the "Onlooker" mourned "If just creating a spirit for the film itself were so natural." Other distributions, for example, "Bounce Cut" felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on embellishments demonstrated adverse to "The Mummy"; "The mummy", Ernest Larson composed for the "Hop Cut", "is standard-issue I.L.&M.". Kim Newman of the British Film Institute made a decision about the image mediocre compared to the first, as all the time was spent on enhancements, rather than making the climate which made the first film such a work of art. "USA Today" gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was "not free of generalizations", an assessment with which the BFI agreed. "On the off chance that somebody whines of a foul smell, you can make certain an Arab chump is going to enter a scene. Fraser, similarly snappy with weapon, clench hand or jest, may spare the day, yet even he can't spare the image", "USA Today" composed.
