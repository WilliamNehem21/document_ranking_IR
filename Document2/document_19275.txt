Kruger developed a habit of threatening to resign whenever the volksraad did not give him his way. In the 1897 session there was much surprise when the new member Louis Botha reacted to the usual proffered resignation by leaping up and moving to accept it. A constitutional crisis developed after the judiciary under Chief Justice KotzÃ© abandoned its prior stance of giving volksraad resolutions legal precedence over the constitution. "This decision would have upset the whole country", Kruger recalled, "for a number of rules concerning the goldfields, the franchise and so on depended on resolutions of the volksraad." Chief Justice De Villiers of the Cape mediated, sided with Kruger and upheld the volksraad decrees.
Kruger was never more popular domestically than during the 1897â98 election campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier than he had been in years. He won his most decisive election victory yetâ12,853 votes to Joubert's 2,001 and Schalk Willem Burger's 3,753âand was sworn in as president for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as president, his first act of his fourth term was to sack KotzÃ©, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger's critics this lent much credence to the notion that he was a tyrant. Milner called KotzÃ©'s dismissal "the end of real justice in the Transvaal" and a step that "threatened all British subjects and interests there".
