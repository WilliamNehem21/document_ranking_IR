During this period Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he produced his final opera, "Fennimore and Gerda" (1908â10), like "A Village Romeo and Juliet" written in tableau form, but in his mature style. His choral works of the period, notably "An Arabesque" (1911) and "A Song of the High Hills" (1911) are among the most radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in the quantity and quality of Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to "Hassan" (1920â23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.
