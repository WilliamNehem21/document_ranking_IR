Scholar Yolanda M. Manora insisted that three women in "Caged Bird"âthe "hybridized mother" of Angelou's grandmother, her mother, and her friend Mrs. Flowersâtaught her how to be a mother to her son Guy. Although Angelou's grandmother died early in the series, in her third autobiography "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas", Angelou quoted her many times throughout the series. Angelou's desire for security for Guy drove her to marry Tosh Angelos in "Singin' and Swingin"', and drove many of her decisions, job choices, and romantic relationships. Scholar Siphokazi Koyana stated that due to Angelou's race and economic background, her "experience of motherhood is inseparably intertwined with work". According to Koyana, "...Â Black motherhood always encompassed work". Angelou's long list of occupations attested to the challenges, especially in her second autobiography "Gather Together in My Name", she faced as a working teenager mother, which often led Angelou to "quick and easy" decisions. Koyana stated that it was not until Angelou was able to take advantage of opportunities, such as her role in "Porgy and Bess", when she was able to fully support her and Guy, and the quality of her life and her contribution to society improved. It was impossible, however, for Angelou to become successful without her extended family to provide childcare for her; for example, she left Guy in the care of his grandmother in spite of the conflict and guilt she experienced as a result (something Koyana insisted was imposed on her by the larger society), a pattern established in "Caged Bird" by her own mother when she left Angelou and her brother in the care of Angelou's grandmother.
