The toll of worldwide big name on Wong's own life showed itself in episodes of despondency and unexpected indignation, just as over the top smoking and drinking. Feeling fractious when she landed in Hong Kong, Wong was strangely impolite to the anticipating swarm, which at that point immediately turned unfriendly. One individual yelled: "Down with Huang Liu TsongÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the sap that disfavors China. Try not to release her aground." Wong started crying and a rush resulted. After she left for a short outing to the Philippines, the circumstance cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her dad and her kin, Wong visited his family and his first spouse at the family's hereditary home close Taishan. Clashing reports guarantee that she was either heartily invited or met with threatening vibe by the residents. She spent over 10ÃÂ days in the family's town and some time in neighboring towns before proceeding with her voyage through China. In the wake of coming back to Hollywood, Wong thought about her year in China and her vocation in Hollywood: "I am persuaded that I would never play in the Chinese Theater. I have no inclination for it. It's an entirely tragic circumstance to be dismissed by Chinese since I'm 'excessively American' and by American makers since they favor different races to act Chinese parts." Wong's dad came back to Los Angeles in 1938.
