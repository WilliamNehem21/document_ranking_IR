Contention encompassing "The Big Issue", the world's most generally coursed road paper, is a genuine case of these two schools of thought. "The Big Issue" is for the most part a newspaper covering big name news; while it is sold by the destitute and creates a benefit that is utilized to profit the destitute, the substance isn't composed by them and there is little inclusion of social issues that are important to them. In the late 1990s when the London-based paper started making arrangements to enter advertises in the United States, numerous American road paper distributers responded protectively, saying they couldn't contend with the creation esteems and standard intrigue of the expertly delivered "The Big Issue" or that "The Big Issue" did not do what's necessary to give a voice to the destitute. The response to "The Big Issue" raised what is currently a continuous clash between popularized, proficient papers and progressively grassroots-style ones, with papers, for example, "The Big Issue" copying standard papers and magazines so as to produce a substantial benefit to put resources into destitute issues and others concentrating on political and social issues instead of on substance that will create cash. Some road paper defenders trust that the essential point of the papers ought to be to give destitute people a voice and to "fill the void" in prevailing press inclusion, while others trust it ought to be to give destitute people occupations and a salary.
