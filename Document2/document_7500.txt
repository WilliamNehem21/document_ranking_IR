In spite of being the longest articulation of the realities in any of the four re-appraising assessments created by the case, Cardozo's was depicted by Posner as "curved and inclined". It has likewise been considered "exceptionally conceptual". As per Professor Walter O. Weyrauch in his 1978 diary article, "Cardozo's popular conclusion decreased the convoluted actualities of the case to an absolute minimum. Mrs. Palsgraf was changed into an 'offended party' without age, family status, or occupation. The feeling precluded the idea of her damage, the measure of harms that she looked for, and the extent of the jury grant." For instance, Cardozo depicts Palsgraf (whom he doesn't name, nor notice her girls) as remaining on the LIRR's stage, as opposed to sitting tight for a train, in this way making light of her status as a client qualified for a high level of consideration by the railroad. The unstable bundle is depicted as little, however the observers had portrayed it as vast. The scales are depicted as being "at the opposite end of the stage, numerous feet away" from the blast, however the record does not bolster this announcement. This portrayal may have been founded on declaration by Lillian Palsgraf, who had gone to purchase a paper from a magazine kiosk "at the opposite end of the stage", however who was yet close enough to see the bundle fall. Cardozo's portrayal of separation would be tested by the offended party in her movement for reargument, which would be denied with the reply that anyway close she was to the blast, she was not all that nearby as to bring her inside the zone of predictable hazard.
