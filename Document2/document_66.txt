The job of the radio designer Rajan was at first given to S. V. Sahasranamam, who was expelled following a couple of long stretches of shooting on the grounds that Balachander and Meiyappan were not happy with his execution and felt he looked "excessively old" to assume the job. The producers at that point connected with newcomer N. Viswanathan, a Tamilian educator from Calcutta (presently Kolkata). At the point when the generation was part of the way through, Meiyappan was disappointed with his execution and needed to reshoot the film with Sivaji Ganesan. At the point when Balachander denied Meiyappan requested the creation controller Vasu Menon to settle Balachander's compensation duty and to bring the reels to be scorched before him. Balachander was stunned on hearing this and obliged to Meiyappan's desire. Since Meiyappan had presented Ganesan in "Parasakthi" (1952), he was quick to have him assume the lead job. At first, Balachander was reluctant to approach Ganesan on the grounds that he was uncertain whether he would consent to assume a negative job. In his personal history, Ganesan expressed that the film was nearly finished before he was drawn closer. He consented to be a piece of the film since he found the story intriguing and suspected that depicting an assortment of characters would intrigue the group of onlookers. In 2009, film history specialist Film News Anandan proposed that the achievement of "Thirumbi Paar" (1953), which included Ganesan as a wannabe, urged him to assume a comparable job in "Andha Naal". As per film history specialist Randor Guy, Rajan was one of the most punctual screw-up jobs in Tamil film.
