Battling delayed. Mortier and Gazan sat tight for Dupont's entry while Kutuzov and Miloradovich sat tight for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's segment was required to be the last to join the battle since it needed to walk the best separation. The planning of the reliefÃ¢ÂÂ12:00 or 14:00Ã¢ÂÂfluctuates, contingent upon whose reports are counseled. Strik arrived first and promptly struck Gazan's line with three contingents, driving the French out of DÃÂ¼renstein. Gotten between two in number powers, Gazan endeavored to drive his way back through DÃÂ¼renstein, to achieve the stream where the flotilla could clear his depleted troops. Pulling back through the restricted Danube ravine and warding off the Russian power at their back, Gazan and his division were caught when a greater amount of Strik's Russians seemed to hinder their retreat. The tight debases hampered the Russians; Strik's men needed to walk out of the gullies, structure positions and assault in waves. In spite of Strik's nonstop ambush in the following a few hours, Mortier and Gazan drove the Russians back up the limited crevice in the slope. Now, Dokhturov's segment showed up behind the French line and joined the fight. The French were dwarfed more than three to one, struck in the front by Miloradovich's segment, in the center by Strik's and in the back by Dokhturov.
