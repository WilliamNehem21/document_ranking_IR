Before long a short time later, Parsons, Hubbard and Sara consented to set up a business association, "Unified Enterprises", in which they contributed almost their whole investment fundsÃ¢ÂÂby far most contributed by Parsons. The arrangement was for Hubbard and Sara to purchase yachts in Miami and sail them toward the West Coast to sell for a benefit. Hubbard had an alternate thought; he kept in touch with the U.S. Naval force mentioning authorization to leave the nation "to visit Central and South America and China" for the reasons for "gathering composing material"Ã¢ÂÂ as such, attempted a world journey. Aleister Crowley firmly condemned Parsons' activities, expressing: "Suspect Ron playing certainty trapÃ¢ÂÂJack Parsons frail trickÃ¢ÂÂclear injured individual lurking swindlers." Parsons endeavored to recoup his cash by acquiring a directive to counteract Hubbard and Sara leaving the nation or discarding the leftovers of his advantages. They endeavored to cruise in any case however were constrained back to port by a tempest. After seven days, Allied Enterprises was broken down. Parsons got just a $2,900 promissory note from Hubbard and returned home "broke". He needed to pitch his chateau to engineers soon thereafter to recover his misfortunes.
