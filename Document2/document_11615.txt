Kratos' fundamental weapon is the Blades of Athena, a couple of cutting edges joined to chains that are folded over the character's wrists and lower arms. In interactivity, the edges can be swung disagreeably in different moves. Later in the diversion, Kratos secures another weapon, the Arms of SpartaÃ¢ÂÂa lance and shield offering elective battle alternatives (e.g., Kratos can utilize the shield for barrier and the lance for offense, for example, tossing it at inaccessible targets). Kratos gains an uncommon capacity, Thera's Bane, that mixes his cutting edges with flame, and is like the Rage capacity in past amusements, giving expanded assault harm that is sufficiently able to puncture through adversary covering. Likewise with the Items in "Lord of War III", this capacity consequently renews itself (spoken to by the Fire meter), permitting further utilization. Both the Arms of Sparta and Thera's Bane are utilized to beat ecological snags (e.g., certain entryways require the utilization of Thera's Bane to open). Kratos figures out how to utilize something like three mystical capacities, including the Eye of Atlantis, Scourge of Erinys, and the Horn of Boreas, giving him an assortment of approaches to assault and execute adversaries. The relic Poseidon's Trident is held from the earlier portion, which enables him to inhale submerged, a fundamental capacity as parts of the amusement require extensive stretches of time there.
