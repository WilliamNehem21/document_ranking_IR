The "Record-Courier", a daily newspaper which mainly covers Portage County, is the main source of printed news media for Kent. The "Record-Courier" was formed by the merger of the Ravenna "Evening Record" and the Kent "Courier-Tribune" and is published by the Record Publishing Company, a subsidiary of GateHouse Media. The "Record-Courier" maintained an office in Kent until 2008 before all offices were moved to Kent from Ravenna in 2012. In addition to the "Record-Courier", the Kent offices house the various departments of Record Publishing and its other weekly newspapers that serve several Summit and Portage County communities. Kent Patch, a local division of Patch Media, mainly serves as an online bulletin board for local events. It was established in 2010 and functioned as a news source specific to Kent before Patch Media downsized hundreds of local Patch sites across the United States in October 2013. The city is also served by Kent State University's "Kent Stater", which is available in print at select locations on and off campus and online via KentWired.com, a collaborative site with TV-2 and Black Squirrel Radio. The "Akron Beacon Journal" and "The Plain Dealer" also serve Kent through regional coverage and delivery. Magazines published at Kent State include "Fusion", an LGBTQ magazine; "Kent State Magazine", an official publication of the university; and "The Burr", a student-run magazine about events going on in and around Kent.
