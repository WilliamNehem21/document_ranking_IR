Manor Park stayed in much a similar state for an additional 30 years, with no significant advancements until the late 1950s. Amid the 1930s the earth and timber porches with wooden accident obstructions were totally supplanted by cement terracing and metal boundaries, a procedure initially started by Rinder. In 1936 he was casted a ballot back onto the board at 78 years old after the club were consigned to the Second Division. About 25 years after he had made his 1914 masterplan, Rinder restored it and hoped to complete the third period of his advancements. He kicked the bucket in December 1938 (Leitch had passed on in April), leaving his development business to his child, Archibald Junior. The total redevelopment and expansion of the Holte End started in mid 1939, administered by Archibald Junior. At the point when the Second World War broke out in September 1939, all development the nation over halted. Abnormally, given the severity measures set up at the time, Villa gained an uncommon license to proceed with development of the Holte End; Simon Inglis notes "How they accomplished this isn't recorded." Work on the ground was finished by April 1940, and the stand was promptly retired as Villa Park changed to its wartime job. The Trinity Road Stand turned into an air-strike sanctuary and ammo store while the home changing area turned into the brief home of a rifle organization from the ninth Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment. German bombs caused ÃÂ£20,000 worth of harm to the Witton Lane Stand, which was helped by 1954.
