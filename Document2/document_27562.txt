"Good Girl Gone Bad" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 17 reviews. "Uncut" called it a "shiny, trans-atlantic blend of Europop vim, R&B grit and Caribbean bounce." Andy Kellman of AllMusic deemed it quintessential pop music and said each of its tracks was a potential hit. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album, describing it as "more raw, perhaps edgier and more risquÃ©" than Rihanna's previous material. Kelefa Sanneh of "The New York Times" wrote that the album "sounds as if it were scientifically engineered to deliver hits". Peter Robinson of "The Observer" commended her collaborators for "masking her own shortcomings" and commented that, "While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop." Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying. Neil Drumming of "Entertainment Weekly" felt that, although it "goes bad when Rihanna tries her hand at treacly ballads and glum sentiment", at times "Good Girl Gone Bad" is a "thrilling throwback to more than a decade ago, when upstart producers haphazardly mashed R&B with hip-hop to create chunky jeep anthems such as Mary J. Blige's 'Real Love'."
