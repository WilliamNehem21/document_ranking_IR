The consolidated Franco-Spanish armada put to ocean on 19 October 1805, and by 21 October was in sight of the British boats. Nelson framed up his lines and the British started to meet on their removed adversaries. In spite of his unique guidelines, Nelson led the pack of the climate segment in "Triumph". Worried for the president security in such an uncovered position, Henry Blackwood, a long-standing companion of Nelson and authority of the frigate that day, proposed that Nelson get on his ship to all the more likely watch and direct the fight. Nelson won't, so Blackwood rather endeavored to persuade him to give Harvey a chance to come past him in the "Temeraire", thus lead the section into fight. Nelson consented to this, and motioned for Harvey to come past him. As "Temeraire" drew up towards "Triumph", Nelson chose that on the off chance that he was standing aside to give another ship a chance to lead his line, so too ought to Collingwood, telling the lee segment of boats. He flagged Collingwood, on board his leader , to give another ship a chance to come in front of him, however Collingwood kept on flooding ahead. Rethinking his arrangement, Nelson is accounted for to have hailed "Temeraire", as she came up close by "Triumph", with the words "I'll thank you, Captain Harvey, to keep in your legitimate station, which is "toward the back" of the Victory". Nelson's guidance was followed up by a formal flag and Harvey dropped back reluctantly, however generally kept inside one ship's length of "Triumph" as she cruised up to the Franco-Spanish line.
