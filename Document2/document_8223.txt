In October 2012, reports of an expert rifleman shooting autos along I-96 of every four areas prompted a government examination and a multi-jurisdictional team of 100ÃÂ law implementation authorities. As of October 30, 2012, 25ÃÂ shootings had been connected to one think. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime Stoppers offered a $102,000 compensate for data prompting the capture of the culprit. The suspect, Raulie Casteel of Wixom, was captured on November 5, 2012, and requested to stand preliminary in 2013 in Oakland County for 60ÃÂ charges in one case, with a second preliminary on fear mongering and murder allegations to be brought by the Michigan Attorney General. On October 30, 2013, the suspect argued no challenge, yet rationally sick, in the Oakland County case, and he was condemned to serve somewhere in the range of six years and eight months to 10 years in jail on numerous strike charges (just as two simultaneous years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The preliminary for the Livingston County case started on January 14, 2014, and subsequent to being indicted on the psychological warfare charge, Casteel was condemned to 16 to 40 years in state jail.
