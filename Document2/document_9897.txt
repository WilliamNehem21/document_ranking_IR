Klepacki has announced popular music as having turned into the "biggest sham in music historyÃ¢ÂÂsoul-less, mechanical, and made for the sole reason for making the quickest dollar conceivable, with more accentuation on symbolism than the music." He's likewise censured lip-syncing and the repackaging of music sort through various names, for example, Nu metal for shake music and Neo soul for soul music. He trusts that marking an arrangement does not ensure benefits, and would prefer to keep his normal everyday employment as sound chief. These opinions were reverberated in an uncommon component on the band Home Cookin' in 2000Ã¢ÂÂKlepacki said the gathering needed to "work with a mark, not for them." Stating that he would not bargain his work for prevalence, he trusts that "the main craftsmen that have any life span are the ones that pioneer a developmentÃ¢ÂÂnot tail one." He appreciates working autonomously, as he doesn't need to "change...music for pop radio." He champions the web as a medium through which innovative and unique specialists can be found. Klepacki trusts it is the favored road for music when contrasted with radio airplayÃ¢ÂÂwhere one hears "precisely the same tunes 3 months on end." When met about document sharing, he communicated blended feelings.

His most loved craftsmen by decade, beginning with the 1960s, are Sly and the Family Stone, Graham Central Station, Metallica, Home Cookin', and Bob Schneider.
