Close Albert, the division had been kept for possible later use until the night 11/12 April, when the division eased the twelfth (Eastern) Division. The Germans had caught high ground close Bouzincourt and Aveluy, disregarding the British lines. The division was requested to retake this to deny the Germans the capacity to watch the British positions and to pick up perception positions neglecting the German lines in the Ancre valley. At 19:30 on 22 April, components of the 113th and 115th Brigades assaulted with help from Australian big guns. The German infantry, upheld by an expansive number of automatic weapons and much cannons support, opposed the assault. Unfit to drive the German infantry off the majority of the high ground, the division picked up on a front, which accomplished the goal. The thirteenth RWF figured out how to drive further ahead and verified an area of high ground neglecting the German lines, warded off a few German counter-assaults and abducted and six automatic weapons. The assault was expensive, with the thirteenth RWF enduring more than 400 injured. The Germans made rehashed endeavors to push back the British and a major assault was spurned on 9 May. The division endeavored a failed assault on another German-held edge and directed a few strikes on the German lines, before they were pulled back for a brief break on 20 May.
