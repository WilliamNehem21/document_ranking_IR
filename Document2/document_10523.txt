Hutton continued expert cricket with Pudsey St Lawrence in 1943, quickly captaining the group before poor outcomes and a conflict with the board of trustees drove him to leave the captaincy. He played for Pudsey until 1945, batting effectively and helping the group to the Priestley Cup, yet his association with the club stayed stressed and he didn't play for them again after 1945. At the point when the war finished in 1945, a program of top of the line matches was composed, including districts and different groups. A progression of matches was played among England and an Australian Services cricket group, called Victory Tests in spite of the fact that they were not official Test matches. Hutton played in every one of the three diversions with blended achievement. He scored 46 in the second match, however was struck horrendously on his feeble arm by a short ball from Keith Miller, whom he experienced out of the blue. Subsequent to scoring 81 for Yorkshire against the Australian group, Hutton scored 104 and 69 in the last "Test". One more century pursued for Yorkshire against the Australians, taking his top of the line run total to 782 keeps running at a normal of 48.87 in nine diversions. Observers were fulfilled that his batting procedure stayed viable and that he could in any case prevail at the largest amount. The show-stopper match of the period was England against the Dominions at Lord's, however Hutton was kept from showing up by his duties to Pudsey.
