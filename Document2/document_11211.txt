The Mediterranean had right now fallen under the control of privateers, to a great extent from Cilicia. Rome had devastated a significant number of the states that had recently policed the Mediterranean with armadas, however had neglected to venture into the hole made. The privateers had caught the chance of a relative power vacuum and had choked delivering paths as well as had pillaged numerous urban communities on the shores of Greece and Asia, and had even made plunges upon Italy itself. After the Roman chief of naval operations Marcus Antonius Creticus (father of the triumvir Marcus Antonius) neglected to clear the privateers as per the general inclination of the Roman experts, Pompey was selected his successor as officer of an extraordinary maritime team to crusade against them. It as far as anyone knows took Pompey only forty days to clear the western bit of the western Mediterranean of privateers, and reestablish correspondence between Iberia, Africa, and Italy. Plutarch portrays how Pompey previously cleared their specialty from the Mediterranean in a progression of little activities and through the guarantee of regarding the surrender of urban communities and art. He at that point pursued the fundamental body of the privateers to their fortifications on the bank of Cilicia, and decimated them there in the maritime Battle of Korakesion.
