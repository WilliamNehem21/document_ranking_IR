The Don Valley Parkway was not the principal thruway arranged through the valley. During the 1930s, a "speedway" through the lower valley was advanced as conceivable sorrow alleviation. In contrast to the present turnpike, this street would have bended northwest close to the Don Valley Brick Works and associated with Mount Pleasant at Davisville. The city did not have the cash and spoke to 'municipal disapproved of residents' to give the arrive on which the thruway would be assembled. None approached. In 1939, city transportation organizer Norman Wilson proposed a lane that would pursue the valley into the upper east. On January 1, 1946, Toronto voters affirmed the structure of a 'Wear Valley Traffic Artery' following a similar course as the "speedway" by a vote of 31,882 to 12,328. This was a similar plebiscite where Toronto voters endorsed the development of the Yonge portion of Line 1. The City at that point acquired $1.5 million to fund the venture. In 1949, the Official Plan of the City of Toronto refreshed the Don Valley Roadway intend to incorporate two branchesÃ¢ÂÂone toward the north-west which would in the long run become the Crosstown Expressway proposition, and one toward the north-east prompting O'Connor Drive. The first intend to interface with St. Clair remained. East York Township restricted development of the north-east roadway. The City began the main segment of this course from Eastern Avenue south to Keating Street in 1949, yet needed to suspend work in 1951 because of an absence of steel.
