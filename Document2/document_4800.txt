Saunders went before an officer determination block that had been determined to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, where the units of the sixth Division had been based after their arrival from New Guinea. The meeting board on the board comprised of three senior officersÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ all accomplished infantry contingent commandersÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ who were entrusted with deciding a competitor's appropriateness for appointing as an infantry officer. Saunders was observed to be a satisfactory applicant and presented on an officer preparing unit in Seymour, Victoria. Endless supply of the 16-week course, he was elevated to lieutenant in November 1944, turning into the principal Aboriginal charged officer in the Australian Army. The point of reference of his authorizing had caused the Army some worry because of its "uncommon centrality", and therefore the administrative work for its affirmation was in the end sent to the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, for endorsement. All things considered, Blamey is accounted for to have "demanded following the typical methodology", trusting that there ought to be no distinction in the manner in which Saunders' bonus ought to be blessed to receive whatever other warrior who had finished the important preparing. The story earned much press inclusion in Australia, the majority of it good, if in parts paternalistic.
