In the elimination round, the Gliders needed to beat the dominant bosses, Team USA, before a little horde of 4,428 at the North Greenwich Arena. Group USA had first belonging and earned the primary purposes of the amusement, however the two groups' shooting was poor, and the score was just 10Ã¢ÂÂ 12 at quarter time. The second quarter began with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14Ã¢ÂÂ 12. Group USA turned the ball over the Gliders a few times, however they were unfit to benefit from their solid guard, leaving the score tied at 26Ã¢ÂÂ 26 at half time. In the second from last quarter, an early objective by Gauci from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A progression of takes gave the Gliders extra shots, the greater part of which they missed, yet Team USA surrendered a progression of turnovers, and their shooting was more terrible than their adversaries', bringing about a 10Ã¢ÂÂ 0 kept running by the Gliders. Group USA were unfit to score at all until the last moment of the quarter. A rushed objective with seconds to pass by Hill saw the Gliders driving 38Ã¢ÂÂ 28. Group USA would at last post 28 turnovers to Australia's 17, and the Gliders would score 12 from turnovers to Team USA's three. Triscari cautioned his players, "They will return! We need to stop them!"
