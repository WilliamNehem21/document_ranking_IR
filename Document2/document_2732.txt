The Kylfings have likewise been related to the Votic individuals. Carl Christian Rafn, Edgar V. Saks, B. Briem and SigurÃÂ°ur Nordal have proposed Kylfings to have been the Norse name for the Votes. The reason is that the ethnonym "Vadja(laiset)" can be related with "vadja" (current Estonian "vai"') which signifies "stake", "wedge" or "staff", which compares to Old Norse "kolfr". "Vadjalaiset" would therefore be converted into Old East Norse as "kolfingar", which in Old West Norse (Old Icelandic) would be umlauted as "kylfingar". While some local names were Scandinavized, as "Rostov" into "RÃÂ¡ÃÂ°stofa", the Norse scholarly of the significance of different names and interpreted them, which they did at Volkhov, and on account of a portion of the Dniepr rapids. The hypothesis that the Kylfings were Votes has been contradicted by Max Vasmer and Stender-Petersen, while Holm thinks that its feasible. Holm thinks of it as clear that the Varangians and the Finnic clans had the capacity to collaborate well, and he indicates the relative simplicity and soundness with which Finland was later coordinated as a piece of the Swedish kingdom. Jorma Koivulehto, a Finnish language specialist, can't help contradicting the Vote hypothesis and keeps up that the Votic name or some other Finnic ethnonym isn't etymologically associated with the name Kylfingar.
