An expected 200,000 creatures were taken before the twentieth century. The moderately stationary and vulnerable tortoises were gathered and put away live ready boats, where they could get by for no less than a year without sustenance or water (some recounted reports recommend people enduring two years), giving profitable new meat, while their weakened pee and the water put away in their neck packs could be utilized as drinking water. The seventeenth century British privateer, adventurer, and naturalist William Dampier stated, "They are so remarkably substantial and fat, thus sweet, that no pullet eats all the more charmingly," while Captain James Colnett of the British Navy composed of "the land tortoise which in the manner in which it was dressed, was considered by us all as the most delectable sustenance we had ever tasted." US Navy skipper David Porter announced, "after once tasting the Galapagos tortoises, each other creature nourishment tumbled off enormously in our estimationÃÂ ... The meat of this creature is the most effortless of assimilation, and an amount of it, surpassing that of some other sustenance, can be eaten without encountering the scarcest of bother." Darwin was less eager about the meat, expressing "the bosom plate simmered (as the Gauchos do "carne con cuero"), with the substance on it, is great; and the youthful tortoises make magnificent soup; however generally the meat to my taste is uninterested."
