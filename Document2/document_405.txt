Theodore's sibling Manuel, who figured out how to escape from Klokotnitsa, presently assumed control over the royal position in Thessalonica. His area was decreased to the environs of the city and his family's center domains in Epirus and Thessaly, just as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his sibling Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania perceived his suzerainty. As a child in-law of John Asen, Manuel was permitted to keep up inner independence, yet to all goals and purposes he was a customer of the Bulgarian Tsar. At about a similar time, Michael I's charlatan child Michael II came back from outcast and immediately succeeded, clearly with the help of the neighborhood populace, in assuming control over control of Epirus. Manuel was compelled to perceive the "fait accompli" under the misrepresentation that Michael perceived his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel presented him the title of Despot. In all actuality Michael was completely free, and in all respects immediately stopped to recognize Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu. So as to save some opportunity of move and counter Asen's endeavors to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel swung to his sibling's past opponents in Nicaea and finished the religious faction by recognizing the authenticity and predominance of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.
