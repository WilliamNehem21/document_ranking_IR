Pundits hailed the scene as fruitful in recounting to a mind boggling tale pretty much every one of the characters exceptionally, while holding the arrangement's powerful components of composing and character advancement. All through the showÃ¢ÂÂas in the remainder of the arrangementÃ¢ÂÂthe characters hesitantly address their very own exchange and activities. Anya depicts her own two part harmony "I'll Never Tell" as "a retro pastiche that is never going to be a breakaway pop hit". With a trademark dry air, Giles clarifies that he caught the data about Sunnydale inhabitants suddenly combusting as he was listening in upon the police taking "witness arias". In her opening number, "Making a halfhearted effort", Buffy sings that she feels as if she is having an impact: "nothing here is genuine, nothing here is correct". The melody presents the character's passionate state yet in addition evacuates the boundary between the performing artist and the group of onlookers, as Gellar the on-screen character depicts Buffy, who feels she is simply filling the role of the Slayer. This insights to the group of onlookers that the scene's melodic arrangement is weird to the performers and characters. As per "Buffy" writer Richard Albright, the absence of clean among cast individuals' performing voices added to the genuineness of their breaking out into melody without precedent for the arrangement. Whedon included hesitant discourse and references about the characters being in a melodic and demonstrated their hesitance toward tune and move, so the crowd would feel increasingly good with the unlikelihood of a wonder such as this occurrence on the show.
