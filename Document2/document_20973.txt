Following the commercial successes of "Terang Boelan" ("Full Moon"; 1937), "Fatima" (1938), and "Alang-Alang" ("Grass"; 1939), the film industry of the Dutch East IndiesÂ â which had been severely weakened by the Great DepressionÂ â was revived. Film production increased and, in 1940, four new production houses were opened, including Union Films. The company was funded by ethnic Chinese businessman Ang Hock Liem, who is credited as producer for the majority of the company's releases; daily operations, however, were handled by Tjoa Ma Tjoen. Union was headquartered in Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta), and, according to a press release, established to "improve the quality of Indonesian art".
The fledgling Union's first film, "Kedok Ketawa", was released in July 1940. Following a young couple who face off against criminals with the help of a masked bandit, this film was directed by Jo An Djan and starred Oedjang, Fatimah, and Basoeki Resobowo. It received positive reviews; the journalist Saeroen wrote in "Pemandangan" that the film's quality was comparable to imported Hollywood productions, and a review in "Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad" praised the cinematography. Following these positive reviews, Union hired SaeroenÂ â who had previously written "Terang Boelan" and several works for Tan's FilmÂ â as a screenwriter. He made his debut for the company with "Harta Berdarah", directed by new hires R Hu and Rd Ariffien, following Jo An Djan's departure for Populair's Film. The film, in which a young man convinces a miserly hajji to be more charitable, was released in October 1940 and starred the singer Soelastri and martial artist Zonder.
