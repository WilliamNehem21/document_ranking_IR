Peale now and again took a shot at decorations for the administration, taking consideration to bar Longacre from the procedure. Amid the MexicanÃ¢ÂÂ American War, Congress casted a ballot a gold decoration to Major General Zachary Taylor for his triumphs at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. Peale engraved the plan from a representation by William Carl Brown and a model by John T. Battin. After Taylor moved toward becoming president, Peale structured his Indian Peace Medal; Peale likewise engraved Indian Peace Medals for presidents John Tyler and James Polk, working from plans or models by other men. In 1846, Peale planned and engraved the Coast Survey Medal (likewise called the George M. Bache decoration). Peale trusted that all national memorial awards, those approved by Congress, ought to have their passes on stopped at the Philadelphia Mint, and be struck there, and with Patterson's help asked the issuance of decorations for presidents for whom no Indian Peace Medal had been planned, for example, John Adams and William Henry Harrison. This was done, yet not in Peale's timeÃ¢ÂÂfor instance, the William Henry Harrison award was structured by later Assistant and Chief Engraver George T. Morgan. These works, similar to Peale's Indian Peace Medals, structure some portion of the Mint's Presidential arrangement, which proceeds to the present day.
