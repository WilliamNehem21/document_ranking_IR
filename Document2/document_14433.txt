The Verdeja generation model was to embrace the 120ÃÂ horsepower (89ÃÂ kW) Lincoln-Zephyr gas V12 motor, requiring an agreement between the Spanish government and Ford Motor IbÃÂ©rica, Ford's Spanish backup. At the same time, in the event of disappointment of talks among Ford and Spain, the administration additionally started to contact various German organizations, including Maybach. So as to start generation, the Tank Workshop in Zaragoza was to be extended to permit last get together of no less than five tanks for every month. Regardless of subsidizing and two years of development distributed, the processing plant development and extension was never finished. Different issues emerged, including the inability to achieve a concurrence with Ford or Maybach. These components, the poor financial circumstance in Spain, the absence of customers other than the Spanish Army and the absence of motivating forces for Spanish organizations to share in the development program, prompted the relinquishment of the endeavor to create the VerdejaÃÂ 1. Another endeavor was embraced at getting the ADESA ("Armamento de AviaciÃÂ³n, S.A.") organization, to fabricate two Verdeja light tanks for test purposes. In spite of the inability to acquire a motor, ADESA offered to develop 300 units, yet these endeavors fizzled and the program was deserted by 1941.
