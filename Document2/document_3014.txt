Since composed wellsprings of the time are rare, Gediminas' family, early life, and suspicion of the title of Grand Duke in ca. 1316 are dark and keep on being the subject of academic discussion. Different speculations have guaranteed that Gediminas was either his antecedent Grand Duke Vytenis' child, his sibling, his cousin, or his hostler. For a few centuries just two variants of his causes circled. AccountsÃ¢ÂÂcomposed long after Gediminas' passing by the Teutonic Knights, a long-standing foe of LithuaniaÃ¢ÂÂasserted that Gediminas was a hostler to Vytenis; as indicated by these narratives, Gediminas slaughtered his lord and expected the position of authority. Another adaptation presented in the Lithuanian Chronicles, which additionally seemed long after Gediminas' demise, announced that Gediminas was Vytenis' child. Be that as it may, the two men were nearly a similar age, making this relationship improbable. In 1868, a letter issued by the Council of Riga in 1323 was distributed that contained a little note referencing Vytenis as "the sibling and ancestor" of Gediminas. After the letter became exposed, course books generally spoke to Vytenis and Gediminas as siblings. Be that as it may, antiquarian Tomas Baranauskas trusts "sibling" has been translated too actually, and that the two were in certainty cousins.
