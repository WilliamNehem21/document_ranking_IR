In July 1969, MboyaÃ¢ÂÂan unmistakable and well known Luo KANU lawmakerÃ¢ÂÂwas killed by a Kikuyu. Kenyatta had apparently been worried that Mboya, with U.S. backing, could expel him from the administration, and crosswise over Kenya there were doubts voiced that Kenyatta's legislature was in charge of Mboya's demise. The executing started strains between the Kikuyu and other ethnic gatherings the nation over, with mobs breaking out in Nairobi. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, situated in Luo domain, to open a clinic. On being welcomed by a group yelling KPU mottos, he lost his temper. At the point when individuals from the group began tossing stones, Kenyatta's guardians opened flame on them, executing and injuring a few. In light of the ascent of KPU, Kenyatta had presented oathing, a Kikuyu social custom in which people came to Gatundu to swear their steadfastness to him. Writers were debilitated from giving an account of the oathing framework, and a few were extradited when they endeavored to do as such. Numerous Kenyans were compelled or compelled to swear pledges, something denounced by the nation's Christian foundation. In light of the developing judgment, the oathing was ended in September 1969, and Kenyatta welcomed pioneers from other ethnic gatherings to a gathering in Gatundi.
