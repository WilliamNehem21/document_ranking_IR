"KÃ¶nigsberg" was ordered under the contract name ""Ersatz" " and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel on 12 January 1905. She was launched on 12 December 1905, when the "OberbÃ¼rgermeister" of KÃ¶nigsberg, Siegfried KÃ¶rte, christened the ship, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet for sea trials on 6 April 1907. Her trials were interrupted at the beginning of June when she was tasked with escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht during three sailing regattas including Kiel Week. The two ships then cruised the North Sea and stopped at Nordkapp, where from 3 to 6 August, Wilhelm II met Czar Nicholas II of Russia. After returning to Germany, "KÃ¶nigsberg" resumed her sea trials, which lasted from 9 August to 9 September. She visited her namesake city from 21 to 23 September and was later assigned to the fleet scouting forces to replace the cruiser on 5 November. At this time, "KÃ¶nigsberg" was again used to escort Wilhelm II's yacht, this time in company with the new armored cruiser and the dispatch boat on a visit to Britain. The ships stopped in Portsmouth and the Thames, and were visited by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.
