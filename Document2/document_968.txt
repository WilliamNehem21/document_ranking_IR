The first score for "Mystery of Mana" was created and delivered by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had formed the soundtrack for "Definite Fantasy Adventure", was initially slated for the venture, yet was supplanted with Kikuta after he had begun on different tasks, for example, "Romancing SaGa". "Mystery of Mana" was Kikuta's first computer game score, and he experienced challenges in managing the equipment confinements of the Super NES. Kikuta endeavored to express in the music two "differentiating styles" to make a unique score which would be neither popular music nor standard amusement music. Kikuta took a shot at the music for the most part without anyone else's input, going through about 24ÃÂ hours every day in his office, shifting back and forth among forming and altering to make a soundtrack that would be, as indicated by him, "vivid" and "three-dimensional". As opposed to having sound specialists make the examples of instruments like most amusement music arrangers of the time, Kikuta made his very own examples that coordinated the equipment capacities of the Super NES. These custom examples enabled him to realize precisely how each piece would sound on the framework's equipment, so he didn't need to stress over contrasts between the first creation and the Super NES. Kikuta expressed in 2001 that he considered the score for "Mystery of Mana" his most loved creation.
