Asimov said that "The dropping of the nuclear bomb in 1945 made sci-fi decent" to the overall population, yet just eight US sci-fi or dream magazines endure World War II: "Surprising Science Fiction", distributed by Street and Smith; "Strange Tales", from Delaney's Short Stories, Inc.; Standard Magazines' "Alarming Stories" and "Exciting Wonder Stories"; Ziff-Davis' "Astonishing Stories" and "Awesome Adventures"; Popular's "Well known Fantastic Mysteries"; and "Planet Stories", distributed by Love Romances, Inc. All had been compelled to quarterly calendars by the war, aside from "Strange Tales", which was every other month, "Dumbfounding," still the main sf magazine. Campbell kept on finding new scholars: William Tenn, H. Shaft Piper, Arthur C. Clarke and John Christopher all made their first deals to "Dumbfounding" in the late 1940s, and he distributed numerous accounts presently viewed as works of art, including "Vintage Season" by C.L. Moore, "With Folded HandsÃÂ ..." by Jack Williamson, "Offspring of the Lens" by E.E. Smith, and "The Players of Null-A" by A.E. van Vogt. The pace of creation which had denoted the war a very long time for "Bewildering" was currently loosening, be that as it may, and in Ashley's words the magazine was presently "laying on its shrubs". In 1950, Campbell distributed an article on dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard; this was a mental hypothesis that would in the long run advance into Scientology, another religion. Dianetics was condemned as pseudoscience by the medicinal calling, yet to the frighten of a large number of "Astonishing's" perusers it was not until 1951 that Campbell repudiated it.
