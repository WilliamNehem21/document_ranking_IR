The spotted green pigeon was just sporadically referenced in the writing all through the twentieth century; minimal new data was distributed, and the fledgling remained a conundrum. In 2001, Errol Fuller recommended that the fowl had been generally ignored in light of the fact that Rothschild (an energetic authority of uncommon winged animals) rejected it as an abnormality, maybe in light of the fact that he didn't possess the enduring example himself. Fuller thought of it as a legitimate, terminated animal categories, and furthermore begat an elective regular name for the fowl: the Liverpool pigeon. Based on Fuller's support, BirdLife International recorded the spotted green pigeon as "Wiped out" on the IUCN Red List in 2008; it was beforehand "Not Recognized". In 2001, the ornithologist David Gibbs expressed that the spotted green pigeon was just externally like the Nicobar pigeon, and conceivably particular enough to warrant its very own family (identified with "Ptilinopus", "Ducula", or "Gymnophaps"). He additionally guessed that the fledgling may have possessed a Pacific island, in view of stories enlightened by Tahitian islanders in 1928 concerning a green and white dotted winged animal called "titi". The scientist David Steadman debated the last case in a book audit, taking note of that "titi" is an onomatopoeic word (taking after the sound of the fledgling) utilized particularly for shearwaters (individuals from Procellariidae) in east Polynesia. The ornithologists Julian P. Hume and Michael Walters, writing in 2012, concurred with Gibbs that the winged animal justified conventional status.
