Pharaohs likewise manufactured sanctuaries where contributions were made to continue their spirits in life following death, regularly connected with or situated close to their tombs. These sanctuaries are generally called "funeral home sanctuaries" and viewed as basically not the same as perfect sanctuaries. Lately a few Egyptologists, for example, Gerhard Haeny, have contended that there is no reasonable division between the two. The Egyptians did not allude to funeral home sanctuaries by any particular name. Nor were customs for the dead and ceremonies for the divine beings totally unrelated; the imagery encompassing passing was available in every Egyptian sanctuary. The love of divine beings was available somewhat in funeral home sanctuaries, and the Egyptologist Stephen Quirke has said that "at all periods imperial faction includes the divine beings, yet similarly... all faction of the divine beings includes the lord". All things considered, certain sanctuaries were unmistakably used to remember expired rulers and to offer contributions to their spirits. Their careful reason for existing isn't completely comprehended; they may have been intended to join the lord with the divine beings, raising him to an awesome status more noteworthy than that of standard sovereignty. Regardless, the trouble of isolating heavenly and morgue sanctuaries mirrors the nearby entwining of heavenliness and authority in Egyptian conviction.
