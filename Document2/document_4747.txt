The main standard strips started to rise during the 1870s, with numerous clubs settling on hues related with the schools or other wearing associations from which the clubs had risen. Blackburn Rovers, for instance, received shirts of a split structure dependent on those of the group for previous students of Malvern College, one of the schools where the game had created. Their unique shades of light blue and white were picked to mirror a relationship with Cambridge University, where some of the club's organizers had been taught. Hues and plans regularly changed drastically between matches, with Bolton Wanderers turning out in both pink shirts and white shirts with red spots around the same time. As opposed to the advanced shorts, players wore long knickerbockers or full-length pants, frequently with a belt or even supports. Ruler Kinnaird, an early star of the diversion, was noted for continually being radiant in long white pants. There were no numbers imprinted on shirts to distinguish singular players, and the program for a 1875 match between Queen's Park and Wanderers in Glasgow recognizes the players by the shades of their tops or tights. The primary shin cushions were worn in 1874 by the Nottingham Forest player Sam Weller Widdowson, who chop down a couple of cricket cushions and wore them outside his leggings. At first the idea was disparaged yet it before long got on with different players. By the turn of the century cushions had decreased and were being worn inside the tights.
