The Limpet Mill Scheme was a line displayed in a 1862 bill by the ostensibly free Scottish Northern Junction Railway, however bolstered by the SNER. This proposed a long railroad between Limpet Mill, toward the north of on the SNER, to the Great North at Kintore. An intersection with the Deeside Railway was likewise arranged, over which the SNER ineffectively endeavored to acquire running rights. Disliked, this was given authorization by parliament, yet the Great North prevailing with regards to embeddings a provision this would be suspended on the off chance that it acquired an Act by 1 September 1863. The Great North proposed a course, referred to locally as the "Circumbendibus", that was longer yet less expensive than the immediate course through the Denburn Valley. Notwithstanding nearby resistance, the course was endorsed by parliament in 1863, however was denied the next year when the SNER got authorization for a railroad through the Denburn Valley. The Great North contributed the ÃÂ£125,000 that its Circumbendibus line would have cost and the SNER contributed ÃÂ£70,000 out of the ÃÂ£90,000 it had been set up to propel the Limpet Mill Scheme. The SNER fabricated the twofold track railroad, culverting the Denburn and burrowing two short passages. The joint station opened on 4 November 1867 and comprised of three through tracks, one with a long stage, together with two straight stages for ending trains at either end. Two lines toward the west were accommodated products traffic, and the stations at Waterloo and Guild Street shut down to travelers and moved toward becoming merchandise terminals. The line toward the north of the station go to the Great North and the long Hutcheon Street burrow turned into its longest.
