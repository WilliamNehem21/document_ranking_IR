Six thousand silver awards on a meager (1.6ÃÂ mm) planchet were struck between May 21 and 23, 1925, at the Philadelphia Mint. They were dealt with like conventional coins: They were checked, sacked, and transported to the Fourth Street National Bank of Philadelphia for the centennial commission's utilization. Between May 29 and June 13, an aggregate of 33,750 pieces were struck on a thick (2ÃÂ mm) silver planchet. The explanation behind the two assortments is unsure; Swiatek conjectures that the Norse-American Centennial Commission probably won't have loved the wonderful way the slim ones looked, or may have needed authorities to purchase two awards. One hundred were struck in gold, on June 3 and 4Ã¢ÂÂKvale got the second one struck. The decorations cost the commission 30 pennies each for the slight ones, 45 pennies for the thick, and $10.14 for the gold. The retail cost of the flimsy ones is dubious (Swiatek gauges $1.75), the thick ones are known to have cost $1.25, and the gold pieces about $20. They were sold via mail request; none were sold at the festivals or face to face. There was a business breaking point of one for every individual, except buyers could purchase for the benefit of the same number of relatives as they needed. The slight pieces were not offered available to be purchased until November or December 1925, and sold generally to numismatistsÃ¢ÂÂthe commission's secretary, J.A. Horvik, was disappointed that more "Norsemen" were not purchasing the award. After the festivals, Kvale took 5,000 awards to New York, wanting to offer them, however was not effective. Of the 100 gold pieces struck, 47 were in the end come back to the Treasury when they couldn't be sold, and a portion of the silver pieces (in all likelihood thick ones) were too.
