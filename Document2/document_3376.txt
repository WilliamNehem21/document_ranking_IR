The armada came back to Southampton in June where it was visited by King Henry. In August the armada cruised for Brest where it experienced a joint, yet poorly organized, French-Breton armada at the clash of St. Mathieu. The English with one of the extraordinary ships in the number one spot (as per Marsden the "Mary Rose") battered the French boats with overwhelming gunfire and constrained them to withdraw. The Breton lead "CordeliÃÂ¨re" set up a battle and was boarded by the 1,000-ton "Official". Coincidentally or through the reluctance of the Breton group to surrender, the powder magazine of the "CordeliÃÂ¨re" burst into flames and exploded in a vicious blast, setting flame to the "Official" and in the end sinking her. Around 180 English group individuals spared themselves by dedicating themselves completely to the ocean and just a bunch of Bretons endure, just to be caught. The chief of the "Official", 600 warriors and mariners, the High Admiral of France and the steward of the town of Morlaix were murdered in the occurrence, making it the point of convergence of a few contemporary accounts and reports. On , the English consumed 27 French boats, caught another five and landed powers close Brest to assault and take detainees, yet storms constrained the armada back to Dartmouth in Devon and after that to Southampton for fixes.
