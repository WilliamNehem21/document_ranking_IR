Before leaving the ""FÃÂ¼hrerbau"," Chamberlain mentioned a private gathering with Hitler. Hitler concurred, and the two met at Hitler's loft in the city later that morning. Chamberlain asked restriction in the execution of the understanding and mentioned that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs opposed, to which Hitler appeared to be pleasant. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed "AngloÃ¢ÂÂ German Agreement," which contained three passages, including an explanation that the two countries considered the Munich Agreement "emblematic of the craving of our two people groups never to do battle again." According to Chamberlain, Hitler added ""Ja! Ja!"" ("Yes! Indeed!") as the Prime Minister read it. The two men marked the paper without even a moment's pause. At the point when, soon thereafter, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop opposed with Hitler for marking it, the FÃÂ¼hrer answered, "Gracious, don't pay attention to it so. That bit of paper is of no further essentialness whatever." Chamberlain, then again, tapped his front pocket when he came back to his lodging for lunch and stated, "I have it!" Word spilled of the result of the gatherings before Chamberlain's arrival, causing delight among numerous in London however misery for Churchill and his supporters.
