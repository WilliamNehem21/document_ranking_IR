The red-followed tropicbird measures by and large, which incorporates the - long , and weighs around . It has a wingspan of . It has a streamlined yet strong form with practically all-white plumage, frequently with a pink tinge. The genders are comparable in plumage. A dull dark colored comma-molded stripe stretches out once more from the legends, through and over the eyes and achieving the ear coverts. The iris is dull dark colored. The bill is splendid red, somewhat paler at the base and dark around the nostrils. The legs and base of the toes are light blue-mauve, while the webbing and rest of the toes are dark. The white quills of the head and rear end have disguised dull darker bases, while those of the mantle, back, tail rectrices and tail coverts have dim darker shaft bases. The two long tail quills are orange or red with white bases for around a tenth of their length, and can be difficult to see when the flying creature is flying. The white wings are set apart by dull chevron-formed fixes on the tertials, and the dim shafts of the essential flight quills are obvious. The pink tinge is frequently increasingly articulated in the remiges of the upper wing. Shedding happens outside the rearing season, the streamers being supplanted before the remainder of the quills. Streamers are supplanted whenever, one developing while the other is shed, and old streamers may litter the territory around a reproducing state.
