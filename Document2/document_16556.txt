The next year, the California Highway Commission declined to have the Campo road improved. However, the HighwayÂ 94 association, as well as the Campo-Potrero and HighwayÂ 80 chambers of commerce raised concerns about the safety of the children going to school in the buses along the road. In 1952, the Southern California committee of the state Chamber of Commerce recommended to the California Highway Commission that RouteÂ 94 be widened to four lanes from the Wabash Freeway to Jamacha. In JuneÂ 1953, the Commission approved an eight-lane freeway for RouteÂ 94 from Home Avenue in San Diego to Palm Avenue around La Mesa. The local Board of Education also gave their approval, which was required because the freeway would be built on land that was for a proposed school. But the next month, State Senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal because he believed that it would be too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long term. Approval extended to the junction with USÂ 80 by October 1953; the part from 18th Street to Wabash Boulevard followed in November 1954. Later that year, a toll road that would have tunneled under the Laguna Mountains and bypassed RouteÂ 94 was proposed by the county Board of Supervisors. The state allocated $3.48Â million (about $ in dollars) for making SRÂ 94 a freeway from College Avenue to Campo Road in OctoberÂ 1954.
