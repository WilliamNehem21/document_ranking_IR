It is understood that Turner had a poor working relationship with senior MOD officials, for example with former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon. Significantly the first meeting between Olver and Hoon was said to have gone well; a MOD official commented "He is a man we can do business with. We think it is good to be taking a fresh look at things". It has been suggested that relations between Turner and Olver were tense. On 16 October 2007 the company announced that Mike Turner would retire in August 2008. "The Times" called his departure plans "abrupt" and a "shock", given previous statements that he wished to retire in 2013 at the age of 65. Despite suggestions that BAE Systems would prefer an American CEO due to the increasing importance of the United States defence market to the company and the opportunity to make a clean break from corruption allegations and investigations related to the Al Yamamah contracts, the company announced on 27 June 2008 that it had selected the company's chief operating officer, Ian King, to succeed Turner with effect from 1 September 2008. The "Financial Times" noted that King's career at Marconi distances him from the British Aerospace-led Al Yamamah project.
