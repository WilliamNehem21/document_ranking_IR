The Carthusian line was set up in the mid eighteenth century when two Spanish siblings, AndrÃÂ©s and Diego Zamora, acquired a stallion named El Soldado and reproduced him to two female horses. The female horses were plummeted from horses bought by the Spanish lord and set at Aranjuez, one of the most established steed reproducing ranches in Spain. One of the posterity of El Soldado, a dull dim yearling named Esclavo, turned into the establishment sire of the Carthusian line. One gathering of female horses sired by Esclavo in around 1736 were given to a gathering of Carthusian priests to settle an obligation. Different creatures of these bloodlines were ingested into the fundamental Andalusian breed; the stock given to the priests was reproduced into a unique line, known as Zamoranos. All through the next hundreds of years, the Zamoranos bloodlines were protected by the Carthusian priests, to the point of challenging regal requests to present outside blood from the Neapolitan pony and focal European breeds. They did, notwithstanding, acquaint Arabian and Barb blood with improve the strain. The first supply of Carthusians was enormously drained amid the Peninsular Wars, and the strain may have turned out to be wiped out notwithstanding the endeavors of the Zapata family. Today, the Carthusian strain is brought up in state-possessed stud cultivates around Jerez de la Frontera, Badajoz and Cordoba, and furthermore by a few private families. Carthusian ponies keep on being sought after in Spain, and purchasers pay high costs for individuals from the strain.
