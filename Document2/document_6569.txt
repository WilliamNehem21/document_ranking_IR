The film's topic of class has pulled in much academic consideration. Carole Dole noticed that class comprises a critical component in Austen's accounts and is "unthinkable" to stay away from while adjusting her books. As indicated by Dole, Lee's film contains an "uncertain treatment of class esteems" that burdens social contrasts however "underplays the outcomes of the class qualifications so imperative in the novel"; for example, Edward's story closes upon his proposition to Elinor, with no consideration paid to how they will live on his little yearly salary from the vicarage. Louise Flavin trusted that Lee utilized the houses to speak to their tenants' class and character: the Dashwood sisters' decrease in qualification are spoken to through the difference between the roomy rooms of Norland Park and those of the disengaged, cramped Barton Cottage. James Thompson reprimanded what he portrayed as the anesthetized "mÃÂ©lange of detached picture postcard-blessing schedule impeccable scenes," in which little association is made between "singular subjects and the land that underpins them." Andrew Higson contended that while "Sense and Sensibility" incorporates discourse on sex and sexual orientation, it neglects to seek after issues of class. Thompson's content, he composed, shows a "feeling of impoverishment [but is] kept to the still advantaged way of life of the excluded Dashwoods. The more extensive class framework is practically underestimated." The closure visual picture of flying gold coins, portrayed amid Marianne's wedding, has likewise drawn consideration; Marsha McCreadie noticed that it fills in as a "visual wrap-up and symbol of the merger among cash and marriage."
