In July 1966, 3M sold the system to a secretly held organization, Mutual Industries, Inc., headed by John P. Fraim. Upon Mutual Industries' procurement of Mutual, it was renamed to "Common Broadcasting Corporation". The next month, after the passing of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his child Fulton Lewis III assumed control over his Monday-to-Friday, 7ÃÂ p.m. opening. At the point when ABC Radio "split" into four demographically focused on systems on January 1, 1968, Mutual ineffectively sued to obstruct the move. In the mean time, the system was experiencing some administration precariousness, with continuous changes at the top: for instance, Matthew J. Culligan was Mutual's leader from October 1966 to June 1968. He was supplanted by Robert R. Pauley, who came over from the ABC radio division, where he had filled in as president for almost seven years. Be that as it may, Pauley just kept going a year, and surrendered after conflicts with the board over the requirement for cost-cutting, and different choices with which he oppose this idea. His substitution was Victor C. Diehm, proprietor of a few Mutual-partnered radio stations and dynamic on the Mutual Affiliates Advisory Council. Be that as it may, Diehm additionally did not stay in the situation of Mutual's leader for extremely long. After four years, he was supplanted by another president, a previous Miami radio official named C. Edward Little. Under Little, Mutual started its own specialty programming administrations, exploiting, similar to ABC, of the common FCC prerequisite that every single radio station, of whatever essential arrangement, routinely air news and open undertakings (a duty that would be wiped out in the mid 1980s).
