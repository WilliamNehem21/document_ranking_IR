Nelson mounted a free barricade of the joined armada, keeping the vast majority of his armada far out, yet with a line of frigates and bigger boats positioned at interims among himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the joined armada was seen to put ocean, and the flag was passed down the line of boats. William Pryce Cumby, "Bellerophon"s first lieutenant, was first in the fundamental armada to detect the flag, flying from the last ship in the correspondence connect, HMS "Mars". The British started to seek after the joined armada as it advanced towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in sight of it on the morning of 21 October. The officer and mariners of "Bellerophon" arranged for the fight to come, a portion of the weapon teams chalking the words "Triumph or Death" on their firearm barrels. At 11 am "Bellerophon"s flag sailor, John Franklin, noticed that Nelson had lifted the flag "Britain expects that each man will carry out his responsibility", and after 90 minutes "Bellerophon" entered the fight as the fifth ship in Collingwood's lee section. She was toward the back of the 80-firearm HMS "Tonnant" and in front of the 74-weapon , with the 74-firearm near to her port side.
