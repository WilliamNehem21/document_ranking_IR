Ian Hunt agrees that offers might be viewed as coercive, and cases that, whatever structure the intercessions take, they might be viewed as coercive "when they are socially corrigible inÃÂfluences over activity that lessen an operator's opportunity by and large". He acknowledges that a conceivable protest to his case is that probably some coercive offers do apparently expand the opportunity of their beneficiaries. For example, in the psychological study of the lascivious tycoon, a mogul offers a mother cash for treatment for her child's perilous disease in return for her turning into the tycoon's courtesan. Joel Feinberg considers the offer coercive, however in offering a plausibility of treatment, the tycoon has expanded the choices accessible to the mother, and in this manner her opportunity. For Hunt, Feinberg "neglects the way that the tycoon's offer opens the choice of [the mother] sparing her kid on condition that the alternative of not being [the millionaire's] special lady is shut". Chase does not see the mother as increasingly free; "while obviously she has a more prominent ability to seek after her interests as a parent once the offer has been made, and to that degree can be viewed as more liberated, it is clear likewise that her ability to seek after her sexual advantages may have been lessened." Every coercive proposition, regardless of whether risk, offer or throffer, as indicated by Hunt, contains a concurrent misfortune and addition of opportunity. KristjÃÂ¡nsson, on the other hand, contends that Feinberg's record of "coercive offers" is imperfect on the grounds that these are not offers by any means, however throffers.
