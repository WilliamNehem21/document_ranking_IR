Wesley Yin-Poole of "VideoGamer.com" said that regardless of the discussion the diversion was drawing in because of supposed prejudice, no master assessment had been looked for. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior teacher in social human sciences at the University of Kent, regardless of whether he thought the amusement was supremacist. Bowman considered the prejudice allegations "senseless", saying that the diversion had an enemy of provincial topic and those griping about the amusement's bigotry may express a "rearranged prejudice which says that you can't have terrifying individuals who are dark". It was accounted for that one cutscene in the amusement scene indicated "dark men" hauling off a shouting white lady; as per Yin-Poole, the charge was off base and the single man hauling the lady was "not clearly dark". The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for assessment. BBFC head of correspondences Sue Clark stated, "There is just a single man pulling the blonde lady in from the overhang [and he] isn't dark either. As the entire diversion is set in Africa it is not really astounding that a portion of the characters are dark ... we do pay attention to prejudice very, yet for this situation, there is no issue around bigotry."
