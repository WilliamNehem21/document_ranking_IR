Muhammad's granddad Juff left Farghana to enter military administration in the Abbasid court at Samarra, as did the dad of Ibn Tulun, the organizer of the Tulunid tradition. Juff and his child, Muhammad's dad Tughj, both served the Abbasids, however Tughj later entered the administration of the Tulunids, who since 868 had turned out to be self-governing leaders of Egypt and Syria. Tughj served the Tulunids as legislative leader of Tiberias (capital of the area of Jordan), Aleppo (the capital of the locale of Qinnasrin) and Damascus (capital of the homonymous region). He assumed a noteworthy job in repulsing the Qarmatian assault on Damascus in 903; albeit vanquished in fight, he held the city itself against the Qarmatians for seven months until, with the entry of fortifications from Egypt, the Qarmatians were headed out.
