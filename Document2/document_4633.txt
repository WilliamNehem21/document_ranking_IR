The disappointment of the task drove Dempsey to compose that there was "zero chance now of a snap activity with airborne troops either to seize Caen or to extend the bridgehead on XXX Corps front. It is clear now that Caen can be taken just by set-piece ambush and we don't have the men or ammo for that right now". After the war he composed that the assault by the seventh Armored Division ought to have succeeded and that his questions about the reasonableness of Bucknall and Erskine expanded. Dempsey considered the treatment of the fight a disfavor and said that the choice to pull back from Villers-Bocage was made by the corps administrator and Erskine. Carlo D'Este called Dempsey's remarks "unnecessarily cruel" yet students of history for the most part bolster them, recommending that an incredible open door quickly to catch Caen had been wasted by Bucknall. John Buckley composed that Bucknall was not prepared to help the assault once issues created and that Erskine was not equipped for acing the circumstance. The British authority history specialist, Lionel Ellis, composed that the outcome was "baffling" however that the battling intensity of the Panzer-Lehr Division and with the "unforeseen" landing of the second Panzer Division, the seventh Armored Division "could scarcely have made full progress". In 2001, Michael Reynolds composed that the second Panzer Division tanks were not even close to Villers-Bocage. Hubert Meyer composed that Operation Perch fizzled in light of the fact that the 50th Northumbrian Division and its heavily clad detachment couldn't conquer the Panzer-Lehr-Division, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division assault in the east end of the bridgehead fizzled and due to the fast counter-assault by cutting edge components of the second Panzer Division.
