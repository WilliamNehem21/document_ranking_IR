Simultaneously with planning houses of worship and building railroads, Sharpe was vigorously engaged with the metro life of Lancaster, especially in spearheading clean change. By political influence he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the nearby Heart of Oak Club, the center of the Lancaster Conservative Association. He was chosen a town councilor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for a long time, and in 1843 was named the town gathering's delegate on the neighborhood Police Commission. He was likewise a guest to the national schools, and in November 1848 he was chosen as city hall leader for year, around then a position progressively like that of a "boss justice". Through these workplaces he ended up mindful of the unacceptable condition of sanitation in the town, and set out to improve it. The town was packed, it experienced poor lodging, open sewers, flooding cesspits, and a poor water supply, principally from wells contaminated by penetration. Numerous individuals experienced typhus, and in 1848 there was an episode of cholera. The Police Commission had been set up in Lancaster in 1825 with a more extensive job than proposed by its title, including "purifying, lighting and viewing" the town. Be that as it may, there was consistent rubbing between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the previous tending to obstruct any fundamental changes on the grounds of expense to the ratepayers. The contention was uncertain until the two bodies converged in 1849. The elements of the new body incorporated the foundation of the primary Lancaster Board of Health.
