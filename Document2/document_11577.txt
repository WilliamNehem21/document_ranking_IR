Bayes' report contains components of guess; for example, his case that Turpin was hitched to a Miss Palmer (and not Elizabeth Millington) is very likely mistaken, and the date of Turpin's marriage, for which no narrative proof has been found, gives off an impression of being founded exclusively on Bayes' case that in 1739 Turpin had hitched 11ÃÂ orÃÂ 12ÃÂ years before. His record of those present amid the burglaries submitted by the Essex Gang frequently contains names that never showed up in contemporary paper reports, recommending, as indicated by creator Derek Barlow, that Bayes adorned his story. Bayes' depiction of Turpin's association with "Lord the Highwayman" is more likely than not anecdotal. Turpin may have referred to Matthew King as right on time as 1734, and had a functioning relationship with him from February 1737, yet the tale of the "Man of his word Highwayman" may have been made just to interface the finish of the Essex posse with the creator's very own memory of occasions. Barlow likewise sees the record of the burglary of Turpin's body, attached to Thomas Kyll's production of 1739, as "took care of with so much delicacy as to sum nearly to respect", and hence of suspect provenance.
