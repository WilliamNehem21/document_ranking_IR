"Dispensable Heroes" is an enemy of war melody about a youthful trooper whose destiny is constrained by his bosses. With areas performed at 220 beats for each moment, it is a standout amongst the most extraordinary tracks on the record. The guitar entry toward the finish of each stanza was Hammett's impersonation of the kind of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of "Untouchable Messiah" challenges the false reverence of the televangelism that developed during the 1980s. The tune depicts how individuals are eagerly transformed into visually impaired religious devotees who thoughtlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats for each moment mid-rhythm riffing of the stanzas comes full circle in a diving chromatic riff in the tune; it increments to a running 184 beats for every moment for the center segment that peaks in a contorted shout of "Untruth!". The title gets from the verses to the David Bowie tune "Ziggy Stardust". "Orion" is a multipart instrumental featuring Burton's bass playing. It opens with a blur in bass area, intensely prepared to look like an ensemble. It proceeds with mid-beat riffing, trailed by a bass solo at half-rhythm. The beat quickens amid the last part, and finishes with music becoming dim. Burton organized the center area, which includes its grouchy bass line and multipart guitar harmonies. "Harm, Inc." tirades about silly brutality and retaliation at an unspecified target. It begins with a progression of turned around bass harmonies dependent on the chorale prelude of Bach's "Come, Sweet Death". The melody at that point bounces into a fast mood with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was impacted by Deep Purple.
