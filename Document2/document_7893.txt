In May 1934, Barrymore was recording "Cap, Coat and Glove" for RKO while, amid the shooting of one scene, he again overlooked his lines and even the name of his character. Taping was deferred until the next day, yet the outcome was the equivalent. After he enjoyed a reprieve for a couple of days, he came back to the set, however despite everything he couldn't recall any of the content, and RKO supplanted him with Ricardo Cortez. Before long subsequently, he endured a psychological and physical breakdown and was hospitalized. Costello affirmed that his drinking over the past two years had compounded, and she portrayed him as a "sad heavy drinker". Barrymore's association with Costello was profoundly harried and, trusting she would announce him rationally inept, he left their home in Los Angeles and headed out first to London and after that to India. He came back to the US in mid 1935 and settled in New York, leaving his significant other in Los Angeles. Soon after his arrival, he was hospitalized for a month with bronchitis and flu. A 19-year-old fan, Elaine Jacobs, visited him, and the two turned out to be great companions. On his discharge from the clinic, her mom welcomed him to recover at their home. She changed her name to Elaine Barrie, which she disclosed was to get "as close to Barrymore as I challenged", and they started a relationship. In May, the couple experienced the first of a few expert coordinated efforts, when they showed up on Rudy VallÃÂ©e's "The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour" radio show.
