Canadian explorer Joseph B. MacInnis organized and led six publicly funded dives to "Edmund Fitzgerald" over a three-day period in 1994. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided "Edwin A. Link" as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, "Celia." The GLSHS paid $10,000 for three of its members to each join a dive and take still pictures. MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation why "Edmund Fitzgerald" sank. The same year, longtime sport diver Fred Shannon formed Deepquest Ltd., and organized a privately funded dive to the wreck of "Edmund Fitzgerald", using Delta Oceanographic's submersible, "Delta." Deepquest Ltd. conducted seven dives and took more than 42 hours of underwater video while Shannon set the record for the longest submersible dive to "Edmund Fitzgerald" at 211 minutes. Prior to conducting the dives, Shannon studied NOAA navigational charts and found that the international boundary had changed three times before its publication by NOAA in 1976. Shannon determined that based on GPS coordinates from the 1994 Deepquest expedition, "at least one-third of the two acres of immediate wreckage containing the two major portions of the vessel is in U.S. waters because of an error in the position of the U.S.âCanada boundary line shown on official lake charts."
