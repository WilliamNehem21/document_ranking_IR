At its peak, Diane developed a well-defined eye about in diameter, described by reconnaissance aircraft as taking the shape of an "inverted teacup". The strongest winds were located in the northeast quadrant, where there was a secondary pressure minimum located northeast of the eye. After moving to the north for about a day, Diane resumed its westward motion on AugustÂ 13, after Hurricane Connie to the northwest had weakened. That day, Diane reached its lowest pressure of , and peak winds of 105Â mph (170Â km/h); originally the hurricane was analyzed to reach peak winds of 120Â mph (195Â km/h), although the large size and slow forward speed suggested the lower winds. It maintained its peak winds for about 12Â hours, after which it weakened due to cooler air in the region. By AugustÂ 15, the eye had become poorly defined, and winds steadily weakened. As it approached land, its center deteriorated, with minimal precipitation near the center; the eye was observed on a radar installed in July 1955. On AugustÂ 17, Diane made landfall on the coast of North Carolina near Wilmington. Pressure at landfall was estimated at , accompanied by winds just under hurricane intensity. Diane struck the state only five days after Hurricane Connie struck the same general area.
