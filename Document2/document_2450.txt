At the following Battle of Chickamauga on September 19 and 20, 1863, perplexity among the wing officers over Rosecrans' requests made a hole in the lines, bringing about a defeat of the correct flank. Rosecrans inferred that the fight was lost and fell back on Chattanooga to set up a protective line. Garfield, in any case, believed that piece of the military had held and, with Rosecrans' endorsement, headed crosswise over Missionary Ridge to review the scene. Garfield's hunch was right. His ride wound up unbelievable, while Rosecrans' mistake reignited analysis about his administration. While Rosecrans' military had maintained a strategic distance from calamity, they were stranded in Chattanooga, encompassed by Bragg's military. Garfield sent a message to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton alarming Washington to the requirement for fortifications to keep away from obliteration, and Lincoln and Halleck conveyed 20,000 troops by rail inside nine days. Meanwhile, Grant was elevated to direction of the western militaries, and immediately supplanted Rosecrans with George H. Thomas. Garfield was requested to answer to Washington, where he was elevated to significant general, a commission he would leave before sitting down in the House of Representatives. As indicated by history specialist Jean Edward Smith, Grant and Garfield had a "protected relationship", since Grant elevated Thomas to direction of the Army of the Cumberland, as opposed to Garfield, after Rosecrans was expelled.
