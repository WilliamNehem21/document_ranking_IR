The macaroni penguin is a large, crested penguin, similar in appearance to other members of the genus "Eudyptes". An adult bird has an average length of around ; the weight varies markedly depending on time of year and sex. Males average from after incubating, or after moult to before moult, while females average after to before moult. Among standard measurements, the thick bill (from the gape) measures , the culmen being around a centimetre less. The wing, from the shoulder to the tip, is around and the tail is long. The head, chin, throat, and upper parts are black and sharply demarcated against the white under parts. The black plumage has a bluish sheen when new and brownish when old. The most striking feature is the yellow crest that arises from a patch on the centre of the forehead, and extends horizontally backwards to the nape. The flippers are blue-black on the upper surface with a white trailing edge, and mainly white underneath with a black tip and leading edge. The large, bulbous bill is orange-brown. The iris is red and a patch of pinkish bare skin is found from the base of the bill to the eye. The legs and feet are pink. The male and female are similar in appearance; males tend to be slightly larger. Males also bear relatively larger bills, which average around compared to in females; this feature has been used to tell the sexes apart.
