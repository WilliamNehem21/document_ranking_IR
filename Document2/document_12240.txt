The chief faÃÂ§ade is the incredible south front, a two-story corridor of Corinthian segments superimposed on Tuscan, the entire surmounted by a focal pediment. The sections are not stone, however wood covered in stucco. It is conceivable this exterior was motivated by work done in Paris on the congregation of S. Sulpice by Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni who was working in England from 1747 to 1751; a few illustrations made for Sir Francis Dashwood in copying of his uncle's support of Palladian style, get by him in the accumulation at West Wycombe. The executant modeler for this height and for a significant part of the work on the house seems to have been the minor structural view painter John Donowell, who worked somewhere in the range of 1761 and 1763 (despite the fact that he needed to hang tight until 1775 for installment). The faÃÂ§ade, which has likenesses to the fundamental faÃÂ§ade of Palladio's Palazzo Chiericati of 1550, was initially the passage front. The front entryway is still in the focal point of the ground floor driving into the principle section corridor. This is a considerable deviation from the established type of English Palladianism in which the fundamental passage and important rooms would be on the primary floor come to by an external staircase, giving the principle banquet halls raised perspectives, with the ground floor offered over to support rooms. Such an extreme re-plan was unrealistic here since the house was an incomplete modify as opposed to a completely new structure.
