The greater part of the data on the Gregorian mission originates from Bede's story, and this dependence on one source essentially leaves the image of local preacher endeavors skewed. To begin with, Bede's data is principally from the north and the east of Britain. The western territories, where the local ministry was most grounded, was a region minimal secured by Bede's sources. Also, in spite of the fact that Bede exhibits the local church as one element, as a general rule the local British were isolated into various little political units, which makes Bede's speculations suspect. The antiquarian Ian Wood contends that the presence of the "Libellus" focuses to more contact among Augustine and the local Christians on the grounds that the points shrouded in the work are not confined to transformation from agnosticism, yet in addition managed relations between varying styles of Christianity. Other than the content of the "Libellus" contained inside Bede's work, different renditions of the letter flowed, some of which incorporated an inquiry excluded from Bede's variant. Wood contends that the inquiry, which managed the faction of a local Christian holy person, is just reasonable if this religion affected Augustine's central goal, which would infer that Augustine had a greater number of relations with the nearby Christians than those related by Bede.
