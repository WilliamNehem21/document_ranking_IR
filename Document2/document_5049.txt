He proceeded to score nine fifties, incorporating three in progressive innings, in a total of 1,082 keeps running at a normal of 34.90. With the ball, he recorded his best wicket pull in a season, taking 63 wickets at a normal of 21.00. While this was not seen as an especially great record, "Wisden" noticed that "the batsmen who played against him reached the resolution that he had colossal conceivable outcomes." Critics perceived that Bosanquet had built up another style of bowling. While he couldn't generally control the spot the ball would arrive, making him sporadic, a few cricketers including Warner accepted on the off chance that he could acquire control, he would wind up a standout amongst the best bowlers on the planet. In spite of the fact that his bowling was all the while creating, and he was all the while endeavoring to consummate bowling a standard leg break just as ace the googly, he took six wickets in sequential innings against Surrey and Kent, proceeding to take 10 wickets in the last match. He likewise took 12 wickets in a counterpart for Warner's group against a visiting side, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. Bosanquet's commitments encouraged Middlesex to win the County Championship out of the blue. Albeit no Test matches were played that season, Warner trusted that Bosanquet's structure would have picked up him a spot in a delegate side. Out of the blue since 1899, he was chosen for the Gentlemen against the Players, despite the fact that he was fruitless.
