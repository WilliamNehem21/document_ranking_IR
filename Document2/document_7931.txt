In 1913, "The Strand Magazine" gave another supposed survivor's record, from one Abel Fosdyk, probably "Mary Celeste's" steward. In this form all ready (with the exception of Fosdyk) were suffocated or eaten by sharks after an impermanent stage, on which they had swarmed to watch a swimming challenge, fallen into the ocean. In contrast to Doyle's story, this was proposed by the magazine as a genuine answer for the mystery, however it contained numerous straightforward mix-ups: "Griggs" for Briggs, "Boyce" for Morehouse, Briggs' little girl as a seven-year-old youngster instead of a two-year-old, a team of 13 and a numbness of nautical language. A lot more individuals were persuaded by a conceivable artistic lie of the 1920s, executed by an Irish essayist, Laurence J. Keating. Again introduced as a survivor's storyÃ¢ÂÂone "John Pemberton"Ã¢ÂÂ this told a mind boggling story of homicide, frenzy and arrangement with the "Dei Gratia". It included fundamental blunders, for example, utilizing Doyle's name ("Marie Celeste"), and incorrectly naming key staff. All things considered, the story was so convincingly informed that the "New York Herald Tribune" of July 26, 1926, thought its fact past debate. Hastings depicts Keating's scam as "...ÃÂ an impudent trap, by a man not without inventive capacity."
