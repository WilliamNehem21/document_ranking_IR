In 1955, Diá»m tried to integrate the remaining HÃ²a Háº£o armies into the VNA. Ba Cá»¥t was one of four HÃ²a Háº£o military leaders who refused the government offer on 23 April, and continued to operate autonomously. At one stage, the Cao ÄÃ i, HÃ²a Háº£o and BÃ¬nh XuyÃªn formed an alliance called the United Front, in an attempt to pressure Diá»m into handing over power; Ba Cá»¥t was named senior military commander. However, this had little meaning as the various units were still autonomous of each other, and the United Front was more a showpiece than a means of facilitating coordinated action, and did not in any way strengthen any military threat to Diá»m. The leaders were suspicious of one another and often sent subordinates to meetings. Initially, American and French representatives in Vietnam hoped that Diá»m would take up a ceremonial role and allow the sect leadersâincluding Ba Cá»¥tâto hold government positions. However, Diá»m refused to share power and launched a sudden offensive against Ba Cá»¥t in Thá»t Ná»t on 12 March, shelling the area heavily. The battle was inconclusive and both sides blamed the other for causing instability and disrupting the situation. Diá»m then attacked the BÃ¬nh XuyÃªn's Saigon headquarters in late April, quickly crushing them.
