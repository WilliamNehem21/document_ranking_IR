Despite the fact that Noel rejoined Oasis half a month later, the band's administration and handlers were stressed. With a collection of tunes previously demoed, the general inclination among the Gallaghers was that they should record as quickly as time permits. Their supervisor, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that "all things considered, we went in the studio too rapidly. The savvy move would have been to take the remainder of the year off. Yet, at the time it appeared the best activity. In case you're a band and you have twelve tunes you believe are extraordinary, why not proceed to do it." Noel Gallagher would concur with this evaluation in 2016: "Rather than going, 'Right, we should simply go our different ways for a year or two,' we chose like simpletons to go straight into the studio. That perhaps wasn't the best thought." Morris communicated inverse estimations, contending that "It was an error on everybody's part, the executives particularly included, that we didn't record "Be Here Now" in the late spring of 1996. It would have been an entirely different collection: glad presumably." He depicted the Mustique demos as "the last great accounts I did with Noel" and had a decent affinity with Gallagher before Knebworth, viewing the show as having changed things for the more regrettable.
