Legatine committees in 1125, 1127 and 1129 were held in Westminster, the last two called by Archbishop William. The gathering of 1125 met under the heading of John of Crema and restricted simony, buy of the holy observances, and the legacy of administrative benefices. John of Crema had been sent to England not exclusively to look for a trade off in the CanterburyÃ¢ÂÂ York debate, however to expose the pronouncements of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had visited. Incorporated into standards were the dismissal of genetic cases to a benefice or prebend, which was a wellspring of alarm to the pastorate. Additionally restricted was the nearness of any ladies in church's family units except if they were relatives. In 1127 the committee censured the buy of benefices, ministries, or places in devout houses. It likewise ordered groups pronouncing that church who wouldn't surrender their spouses or mistresses would be denied of their benefices, and that any such ladies who did not leave the ward where they had been could be ousted and even constrained into bondage. In conclusion, in 1129 the church were yet again scolded to carry on with an abstinent life and to set aside their spouses. This gathering was managed by King Henry, who at that point undermined the power of the restriction of courtesans by allowing the ministry to pay a fine to the regal treasury to keep their ladies. William's recompense of this regal fine was censured by the recorder Henry of Huntingdon. The celebration of the Conception was likewise permitted at one of these committees.
