The measure of the Cuthbert Gospel places it inside the Insular custom of the "take accounts", of which eight Irish models endure, including the Book of Dimma, Book of Mulling, and Book of Deer, albeit all the others are or were initially messages of every one of the four accounts, with the conceivable exemption of a couple of pages from the Gospel of John cherished with the Stowe Missal in its cumdach or book-reliquary. There was a custom of considerably littler books, whose utilization appears to have been regularly amuletic, and a composition of John alone, with a page size of 72 x 56ÃÂ mm, was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712. It is presumably Italian from the fifth or sixth century, and the mark it conveyed in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus, a religious administrator of Chartes who kicked the bucket in around 556, might be right. Different precedents are for the most part in Greek or the Coptic language and contain an assortment of scriptural writings, particularly psalters. Julian Brown infers that the three Latin original copies of John "appear to authenticate an early medieval routine with regards to putting a total Gospel of St. John in a hallowed place, as a defensive special necklace; and it appears to be sensible to infer that our composition was set in St. Cuthbert's pine box to secure it".
