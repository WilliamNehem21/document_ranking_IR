As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement drew its inspiration from Paul CÃ©zanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting. Watts drew particular dislike from English critics, and "Hope" came to be seen as a passing fad, emblematic of the excessive sentimentality and poor taste of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1904 author E. Nesbit used "Hope" as a symbol of poor taste in her short story "The Flying Lodger", describing it as "a blind girl sitting on an orange", a description which would later be popularised by Agatha Christie in her 1942 novel "Five Little Pigs" (also known as "Murder in Retrospect").
Although Watts's work was seen as outdated and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and Expressionism drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young Pablo Picasso, who echoed "Hope's" intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in "The Old Guitarist" (1903â1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, by the time of his death in 1904 "Hope" had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his Summer White House at Sagamore Hill. By 1916, "Hope" was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for Angelina Weld GrimkÃ©'s "Rachel" explicitly use the addition of a copy of "Hope" to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.
