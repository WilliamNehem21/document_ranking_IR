As the German High Seas Fleet was prohibited from going out on a limb, most of "Princess Royal"s post-Jutland exercises comprised of uneventful watches of the North Sea. On the night of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to ocean in light of a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, short the II Squadron, would leave harbor that night. The Germans intended to barrage the port of Sunderland on the nineteenth, with broad surveillance given via carriers and submarines. The Grand Fleet cruised with 29 man of war vessels and 6 battlecruisers to their foreseen meeting in the North Sea; for dread that they had entered a minefield after was torpedoed, they turned north before turning south once more. Scheer guided south-eastbound seeking after a solitary British fight squadron revealed by a carrier, which was in certainty the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Understanding their error, the Germans at that point set course for home. The main contact came at night when Tyrwhitt located the High Seas Fleet yet was unfit to accomplish a favorable assault position before dull, and severed. Both the British and German armadas returned home; two British light cruisers, HMS "Nottingham" and had been sunk by submarines, and the German man of war had been harmed by a torpedo.
