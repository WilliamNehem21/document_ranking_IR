"Erin" originally was ordered by the Ottoman Empire on 8 June 1911, at an estimated cost of Â£2,500,000, with the name of "ReÅad V" in honour of Mehmed V ReÅÃ¢d, the ruling Ottoman Sultan, but was renamed "ReÅadiye" during construction. She was laid down at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness on 6 December 1911 with yard number 425, but construction was suspended in late 1912 during the Balkan Wars and resumed in May 1913. The ship was launched on 3 September and completed in August 1914. After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June, the British postponed delivery of "ReÅadiye" on 21 July, despite the completion of payments and the arrival of the Ottoman delegation to collect "ReÅadiye" and another dreadnought battleship, "Sultan Osman I", after their sea trials. The First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to detain the ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors formally seized them and "ReÅadiye" was renamed "Erin", a poetical name for Ireland. He did this on his own initiative to augment the Royal Navy's margin of superiority over the German High Seas Fleet and to prevent them from being acquired by Germany or its allies.
