Beam and his group worked extended periods of time on after creation, figuring out how to submit it without a moment to spare for Museum of Modern Art's "Materials and Ornamental Arts of India" show of May 1955. The film, charged as "The Story of Apu and Durga", needed captions. It was one of a progression of six night exhibitions at MoMA, including the US presentation of sarod player Ali Akbar Khan and the established artist Shanta Rao. "Pather Panchali"s MoMA opening on 3 May was generally welcomed. Along these lines, the film had its local debut at the yearly gathering of the Advertising Club of Calcutta; the reaction there was not positive, and Ray felt "incredibly disheartened". Prior to its showy discharge in Calcutta, Ray structured expansive blurbs, including a neon sign appearing and Durga running, which was deliberately put in a bustling area in the city. "Pather Panchali" was discharged in a Calcutta film on 26 August 1955 and got a poor starting reaction. But since of informal, the screenings began topping off inside possibly 14 days. It opened again at another film, where it kept running for seven weeks. A deferral in subtitling prompted the delay of the UK discharge until December 1957. It proceeded to make incredible progress in the US in 1958, running for eight months at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse in New York. The Bengali government earned a benefit of $50,000 from its underlying US discharge, and decades later the film netted $402,723 from its 2015 constrained discharge. The film allegedly earned an expected altogether at the overall film industry.
