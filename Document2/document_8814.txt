Alkan's extensive scale "Couple" (as a result a sonata) Op. 21 for violin and piano (committed to ChrÃÂ©tien Urhan) and his Piano Trio Op. 30 showed up in 1841. Aside from these, Alkan distributed just a couple of minor works somewhere in the range of 1840 and 1844, after which a progression of virtuoso works was issued, a significant number of which he had played at his effective presentations at ÃÂrard and somewhere else; these incorporated the "Marche funÃÂ¨bre" (Op. 26), the "Marche triomphale " (Op. 27) and "Le chemin de fer" (additionally distributed, independently, as Op. 27). In 1847 showed up the Op. 31 "PrÃÂ©ludes" and his first extensive scale bound together piano work, the Grande sonate "Les quatre ÃÂ¢ges" (Op. 33). The sonata is basically creative in two different ways; every development is slower than its ancestor, and the work envisions the act of dynamic tonality, starting in D major and consummation in G minor. Devoted to Alkan Morhange, the sonata delineates in its progressive developments its 'saint' at the ages of 20 (hopeful), 30 (""Quasi-Faust"", energetic and fatalistic), 40 (tamed) and 50 (enduring: the development is introduced by a citation from Aeschylus' "Prometheus Unbound"). In 1848 pursued Alkan's arrangement of "12 ÃÂ©tudes dans tous les tons majeurs" Op. 35, whose significant pieces run in disposition from the tumultuous "Allegro barbaro" (no. 5) and the extraordinary "Serenade d'amour-Chant de mort (Song of Love Ã¢ÂÂ Song of Death)" (no. 10) to the elucidating and beautiful "L'incendie au town voisin (The Fire in the Next Village)" (no. 7).
