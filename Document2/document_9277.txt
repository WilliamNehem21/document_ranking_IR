Classifiers did not increase official acknowledgment as a lexical classification (grammatical form) until the twentieth century. The soonest present day content to examine classifiers and their utilization was Ma Jianzhong's 1898 "Mama's Basic Principles for Writing Clearly" (). From that point until the 1940s, language specialists, for example, Ma, Wang Li, and Li Jinxi regarded classifiers as only a sort of thing that "communicates an amount". LÃÂ¼ Shuxiang was the first to regard them as a different classification, calling them "unit words" (ÃÂ "dÃÂnwÃÂ¨icÃÂ­") in his 1940s "Diagram of Chinese Grammar" () lastly "measure words" (ÃÂ "liÃÂ ngcÃÂ­") in "Punctuation Studies" (). He made this partition dependent on the way that classifiers were semantically faded, and that they can be utilized legitimately with a number, while genuine things need a measure word included before they can be utilized with a number. After this time, different names were additionally proposed for classifiers: Gao Mingkai called them "thing assistant words" (ÃÂ "zhÃÂ¹mÃÂ­ngcÃÂ­"), Lu Wangdao "checking markers" (ÃÂ "jÃÂ¬biÃÂo"), and Japanese etymologist Miyawaki Kennosuke called them "going with words" (ÃÂ "pÃÂ©ibÃÂ ncÃÂ­"). In the "Draft Plan for a System of Teaching Chinese Grammar" () embraced by the People's Republic of China in 1954, LÃÂ¼'s "measure words" (ÃÂ "liÃÂ ngcÃÂ­") was received as the official name for classifiers in China. This remaining parts the most widely recognized term being used today.
