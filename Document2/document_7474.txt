Shatner imagined his thought for the movie's story before he was authoritatively given the chief's activity. His motivation was TV preachers; "They [the televangelists] were awful, oddly appalling, but then I turned out to be totally intrigued," he reviewed. Shatner was fascinated that not exclusively did these identities persuade others God was talking straightforwardly to them, yet they ended up rich by what Shatner thought about false messages. The TV preachers framed the reason for the character Zar, later Sybok. Shatner's first layout was titled "An Act of Love", and a significant number of its componentsÃ¢ÂÂthe Yosemite excursion, the snatching of Klingon, human and Romulan prisoners on the fizzled heaven planetÃ¢ÂÂmade due to the last film. In Shatner's initial draft, Kirk is overpowered by Zar's prevalent quantities of adherents and Spock, McCoy and the remainder of the "Venture" group come to put stock in Zar's heavenly nature. Kirk fakes acknowledgment of Zar's convictions to head out with him to the God planet, which to Shatner would be a forsaken, red hot waste. At the point when Kirk goes up against "God", the picture of the being changes into that of Satan, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy split up in their getaway. Kirk evades catch yet returns to spare his companions from being diverted to Hell.
