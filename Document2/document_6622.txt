Craftsmanship student of history Cornelius Vermeule loathed the twofold bird and other Longacre coins appearing, calling them schedule. He found that the turn around "has some admirable purposes of heraldic symbolism" and compared that side of the coin to "the frontispiece for a devoted pamphlet". "The Daily Alta California" in May 1850 reproduced a piece from an anonymous Eastern paper, which said of the new piece, "we can't state that we respect itÃÂ ... [the bird on the switch is] incompletely framed, and damaged by some contiguous flummery planned for brilliance we assume, by which the entire thing is rendered confounded". "The Journal of Commerce", a New York periodical, proposed that the piece be supplanted with one indicating George Washington on one side and on the other "an attractive bird emerging as though it were not embarrassed about itself". The "Boston Evening Transcript" proposed that Mint specialists ought to be "ceasing the issuance of this extremely pitiful coin. The director of the mint would appear to be completely penniless of taste to permit such an example to go forward." Bowers, writing in 2004, expressed that regardless of the negative contemporary response, the structure of the twofold hawk is currently extremely mainstream among authorities.
