Preliminaries with comparatively formed engine dispatches recommended that the structure's propulsive productivity would be not exactly arranged, and this was acknowledged in the November 1938 amendment as a most extreme speed of . In any case, another propeller configuration turned out to be increasingly effective and was anticipated to expand speed to .
