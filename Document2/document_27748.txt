Berger was born on 16 July 1896 at Gerstetten in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg, the son of saw-mill owners Johannes and Christine (), and was one of eight children. He attended "Volksschule" (elementary school) and "Realschule" (junior high school) and then teacher training in NÃ¼rtingen. He volunteered for military service at the beginning of World War I, and rose to the rank of "Leutnant" in the infantry by the time of his discharge in 1919. Wounded four times, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and was considered 70 per cent disabled at the time of his discharge. During the war, all three of his brothers died, two killed in action and the other executed as a spy in the United States. Berger's combative temperament and very conservative politics fitted him for a leadership role with the North WÃ¼rttemberg "Einwohnerwehr" militia in 1918â19. He married Maria () in 1921. After joining the Nazi Party in 1922, he was arrested and briefly held in custody after Adolf Hitler's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923. He trained and worked as a physical education teacher, despite his injuries, and lost interest in politics for some years, before rejoining the Nazi Party in 1929, and the paramilitary "Sturmabteilung" (SA) in January 1931.
