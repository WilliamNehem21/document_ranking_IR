Dark colored's most prominent activity in the House was a discourse he made on FebruaryÃÂ 4, 1875, because of Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Head servant's call to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Alluding to remarks Butler had made the earlier day about disorder against African-Americans in the South, Brown asserted that out of line charges had been made against Southerners by a person "who is prohibited in his very own home by good society, whose name is synonymous with misrepresentation, who is the victor, and has been on all events, of extortion; who is the defender of hoodlums, who is such a wonder of bad habit and unpleasantness that to depict him would sicken the creative ability and fumes denunciation." Brown proceeded by referencing infamous Scottish killer William Burke, whose strategy for killing his unfortunate casualties ended up known as "Burking." At this point in the discourse, Speaker of the House James G. Blaine interfered with Brown, inquiring as to whether he was alluding to an individual from the House; Brown gave a questionable reaction before proceeding: "In the event that I wished to depict every one of that was pusillanimous in war, cruel in harmony, prohibited in ethics, and notorious in governmental issues, I should call it 'Butlerizing'." The House display detonated in dissent at Brown's comment, and frustrated Republican officials required Brown's prompt ejection. Despite the fact that not ousted, he was authoritatively blamed by the House for the utilization of unparliamentary language. The blame was erased from the record by an ensuing Congress.
