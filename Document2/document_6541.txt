Doury had extended the auditorium of activities, against Lyautey's requests, by setting up a French mission at Tighmart, in the Tafilalt locale, in December 1917 in response to a supposed German nearness there. The land here, for the most part desert, was practically useless to the French and Lyautey was sharp for his subordinates to concentrate on the more significant Moulouya Valley. Nearby clans opposed the French nearness, slaughtering an interpreter working at the mission in July 1918. Doury looked to vindicate this follow up on 9 August by connecting up to 1,500 tribesmen, driven by Sidi Mhand n'Ifrutant, at Gaouz with a littler French power that included ordnance and air ship support. Entering a thick, wilderness like date palm desert spring, one subgroup of Doury's power endured a nearby, hard-battled activity, hampered by fatigue and poor supply lines. The entire power endured setbacks of 238 men murdered and 68 injured, the most exceedingly terrible French misfortunes since the catastrophe at El Herri, and furthermore lost a lot of their hardware and transport. Lyautey was suspicious of Doury's case to have nearly cleared out his adversary, and accordingly chastised him for his rash activity in "this most fringe of zones" and set him under Poeymirau's immediate order. Hence, as the war in Europe was attracting to a nearby in the late-spring of 1918, the French stayed hard squeezed in Morocco. Notwithstanding the passing of Ali Amhaouch by regular causes, huge quantities of tribesmen under the administration of Hammou and Said kept on restricting them.
