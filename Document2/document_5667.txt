Characteristics are spoken to by physical (quality, expertise, and stamina), social (mystique, control, and appearance), and mental (recognition, insight, and minds). Capacities are abilities, (for example, fighting and avoiding), aptitudes, (for example, guns and scuffle) and familiarities, (for example, PCs and examination). The player is at first doled out focuses to spend in the three territories, with the sum they can spend controlled by group; for instance, the Brujah can spend the most focuses on physical and expertise characteristics.
