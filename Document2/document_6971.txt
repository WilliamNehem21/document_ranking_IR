With the entry of increasingly positive conditions, including the finish of the war, a proposition for a trench to connect the towns of Manchester, Bolton and Bury was mooted. Matthew Fletcher had in 1789 been utilized as a specialized consultant and had overviewed the course of the proposed waterway, yet the primary open notice originated from Manchester on 4ÃÂ September 1790. The underlying proposition most likely originated from a gathering in Bolton, with the help of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company. A gathering was "planned to be holden at the House of Mr Shawe, the Bull's Head in Manchester previously mentioned, on Monday, the twentieth day of right now, September, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon", where "Overviews, Plans, Levels, Estimates and Proposals" would be exhibited. A further gathering on 16ÃÂ September, held in Bolton, delegated a council of six Boltonians led by Lord Gray de Wilton to go to at Manchester. A progression of goals at this gathering pursued a discourse of the course, and approved the essential activities to bring the arrangement into realization, which incorporated the appealing to of Parliament for the required bill. Hugh Henshall was solicited to overview the proposed course from the channel.
