Hal Erickson of AllMovie called the scene "refreshingly free of the patronization which normally went to 'racially touchy' TV scenes of the period." In his book about "Charmed", pundit Walter Metz composes that "Sisters on a fundamental level" represents the radicalism supported by the arrangement, which he contends is too much nostalgic and oversimplified. He adulates Asher for his "capable comprehension of film feel", pointing out specific Asher's decision of camera edges in the scene in which Mr. Brockway initially meets Lisa. Metz contends that the Stephens' anteroom is a critical area in the arrangement, and that this significance is exemplified in the scene both by the scene of Mr. Brockway's first experience with Lisa just as in the epilog when Mr. Brockway returns to the house and apologizes for his earlier bigotry. Metz reprimands Mr. Brockway's "mystically discovered loving nature" as a "paternalistic way to deal with liberal racial resilience [that] suggests that just white patriarchs have the social specialist to proclaim that bigotry isn't right." Metz further contends that the scene hazardously figures Samantha as the defender and supplier for dark individuals, a job that he says Samantha likewise fills in "Samantha at the Keyboard", another "Entranced" scene.
