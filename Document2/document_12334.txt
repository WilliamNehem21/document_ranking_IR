The scene was viewed as the principal "South Park" melodic scene, and included such tunes as "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" and "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were at first worried about making a melodic in light of the fact that, Parker stated, "The general standard was individuals despised musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adjusted the vast majority of the components from the Mr. Hankey short film they arranged in school, then again, actually Mr. Hankey would turn out to be genuine, not an invention of Kyle's creative energy. Parker said this was chosen in light of his disappointment with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the kids' show "Sesame Street"; for his initial 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was a fanciful character seen just by Big Bird, which Parker said "truly freeloaded me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should epitomize the healthiness and ethics of kid's shows from the 1930s, so they planned him to take after the adaptation of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 animation "Steamboat Willie", especially in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey spreads excrement wherever he strolls, the artists checked pictures of spread out chocolate and fudge and embedded those pictures into the scene. Parker and Stone experienced difficulty settling on a voice for Mr. Hankey, yet Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from advancing "South Park" to the press.
