The tuft of grass growing from the rooftop's focal bracket over the figures passes on various implications. In spite of the fact that the bush is normally rendered, Christus in all likelihood put it there for its representative esteem; its situating proposes he pursued a program of camouflaged iconography. The most clear significance is of new life and fresh starts. On a mainstream level, the bush may have shown Christus' enrollment in the Confraternity of the Dry Tree, which he joined at some point around 1462Ã¢ÂÂ 63. The confraternity was esteemed, including among its positions Burgundian respectability, for example, Philip the Good and his better half Isabella, well off remote dealers and individuals from Bruges' high societies. The tuft of grass likewise symbolizes the tree of life, and Upton estimates that by putting it there, Christus "has offered articulation to the legend" of Adam's third child, Seth, whose mission for a branch was a mainstream legend in the medieval period. Besides, suggests Moses and the consuming shrubbery. As per Upton, in Christus' "Nativity" Joseph accept Moses' job of defender and law-carrier; similarly as Joseph has evacuated his pattens within the sight of Christ, Moses took off his shoes within the sight of the shrubbery.
