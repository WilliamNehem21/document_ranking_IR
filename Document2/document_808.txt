Due to confinements on extending the limit at Anfield, Liverpool declared designs to move to the proposed Stanley Park Stadium in May 2002. Arranging authorization was conceded in July 2004, and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council consented to give Liverpool a 999-year rent on the proposed site. Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed arena was upgraded. The new plan was affirmed by the Council in November 2007. The arena was planned to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 observers, with HKS, Inc. contracted to manufacture the arena. Development was ended in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks experienced issues in financing the ÃÂ£300ÃÂ million required for the improvement. In October 2012, BBC Sport revealed that Fenway Sports Group, the new proprietors of Liverpool FC, had chosen to redevelop their present home at Anfield arena, instead of structure another arena in Stanley Park. As a major aspect of the redevelopment the limit of Anfield was to increment from 45,276 to roughly 60,000 and would cost around ÃÂ£150m. At the point when development was finished on the new Main stand the limit of Anfield was expanded to 54,074. This ÃÂ£100ÃÂ million development added a third level to the stand. This was all piece of a ÃÂ£260ÃÂ million undertaking to improve the Anfield region. Jurgen Klopp the chief at the time portrayed the remain as "amazing."
