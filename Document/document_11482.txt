The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (likewise called Gun Director) was a vertical looking for gyrator. Its capacity was to build up and keep up a steady earth vertical with its related level plane. With the flat plane set up, the Mk 41 ceaselessly estimated the points between the deck and the level plane. These deck points were constantly transmitted to the Rangekeeper with the goal that it could keep the weapons effectively raised as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted midsection high on its side were the battery's terminating keys. ("see picture") The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in every one of the turrets to caution the firearm teams that the weapons were going to shoot. The middle key (with knocks on its handle for material recognizable proof) was the Automatic Firing Key. At the point when this key was held shut, the Mk 41 was empowered to naturally shoot the firearms at whatever point the ship's deck was parallel the even plane. Additionally, if the ocean state was to such an extent that the turrets' height control drives couldn't stay aware of the ship's movement, the weapons could be held at a fixed rise, and the MK 41 could again naturally discharge the firearms as portrayed. The correct key was the Hand Firing Key. It circumvent the Mk 41, and shot the firearms straightforwardly.
