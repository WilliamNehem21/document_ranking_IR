Despite the fact that Robert would not sanctify Spearhafoc, there is little proof that he was keen on the developing development towards Church change being declared by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was starting a change development later known as the Gregorian Reform, at first centered around improving the pastorate and precluding simony. In 1049 Leo IX proclaimed that he would look into English church matters and would research episcopal hopefuls all the more carefully before affirming them. It might have been halfway to pacify Leo that Edward selected Robert rather than ÃÂthelric, wanting to motion to the papacy that the English crown was not completely restricted to the developing change development. It was against this background Robert wouldn't sanctify Spearhafoc, despite the fact that there is no other proof that Robert grasped the change position, and his case that the pope denied the sanctification may have had more to do with finding a simple reason than any evident want for change. There are additionally a few signs that Spearhafoc was partnered to Godwin, and his arrangement was implied as a "compensation" for the non-arrangement of ÃÂthelric. Assuming genuine, Robert's refusal to bless Spearhafoc would have added to the developing crack between the diocese supervisor and the baron.
