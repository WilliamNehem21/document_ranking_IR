Evans was charged as a pilot officer on 3ÃÂ March 1947, turning into the most junior name in the 1947 "Flying corps List" of serving officers as per status. On 23ÃÂ August 1948 he wedded Dorothy (Gail) Campbell, the girl of a Merchant Navy commander; the couple had three little girls and a child. They had wanted to marry on 29ÃÂ August yet needed to present the service when Evans was chosen to partake in Australia's commitment to the Berlin Airlift. Having been elevated to flying officer, he withdrew Sydney on 28ÃÂ August, destined for London. From that point he joined RAAF Squadron Berlin Air LiftÃ¢ÂÂwhich contained teams from Nos.ÃÂ 36 and 38 Squadrons and was situated in LÃÂ¼beck, West GermanyÃ¢ÂÂand throughout the following 14 months flew more than 250 forays in Royal Air Force Dakotas. Carrier activities were considered especially testing, as flying machine were relied upon to fly on instruments their whole course, regularly in severe climate, and keep only three minutes detachment. On one event, Evans and his group found that crates of condoms were their fundamental load. As per Air Force history specialist Alan Stephens, "as they took off into a grim, snow-filled night they wound up scrutinizing the value of the fight, a frame of mind which without a doubt was not shared by the possible beneficiaries". Evans' most exceedingly terrible minute was the point at which one of his motors flopped soon after take-off, with 23 travelersÃ¢ÂÂgenerally youngstersÃ¢ÂÂon board, yet he had the capacity to arrive securely.
