Theobald's dealings with Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, his suffragan priest, were stressed as a result of Henry's situation as ecclesiastical legate. Henry bolstered the arrangement of William FitzHerbert as Archbishop of York in 1141, which Theobald contradicted. In spite of the fact that Theobald stood in opposition to the way of race, he took minimal dynamic part in the ensuing discretionary debate, which came about in the long run in the statement of FitzHerbert and his substitution at York by Henry Murdac. Be that as it may, in September 1143, Henry's legatine powers passed when Pope Innocent II, who had made the legatine arrangement, kicked the bucket. Celestine II was chosen on 26ÃÂ September 1143, yet he was a rival of Stephen, and hence was not positively slanted towards Stephen's sibling Henry either. To verify arrangement as legate, Theobald went to Rome in December 1143, arriving right away before Celestine's demise on 8 March 1144. Theobald was presumably joined by Nigel, Bishop of Ely, and Roger de Clinton, Bishop of Coventry. Prior to his demise, Celestine denied Theobald "to enable any change to be made in the situation of the English crown, since its exchange had been fairly impugned, and the issue was still under question". This turned into the ecclesiastical arrangement, and was a critical change from the acknowledgment of Stephen as lord by Pope Innocent II not long after Stephen's crowning celebration in 1135. It basically prohibited Theobald from delegated any successor to Stephen, particularly while Stephen was as yet alive.
