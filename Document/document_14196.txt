As indicated by Dyer, Monroe turned out to be "for all intents and purposes an easily recognized name for sex" during the 1950s and "her picture must be arranged in the motion of thoughts regarding ethical quality and sexuality that described the fifties in America, for example, Freudian thoughts regarding sex, the Kinsey report (1953), and Betty Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique" (1963). By seeming powerless and uninformed of her sex offer, Monroe was the principal sex image to display sex as characteristic and without peril, as opposed to the 1940s "femme fatales". Spoto in like manner depicts her as the encapsulation of "the after war perfect of the American young lady, delicate, straightforwardly penniless, adoring of men, credulous, offering sex without requests", which is resounded in Molly Haskell's explanation that "she was the fifties fiction, the untruth that a lady had no sexual needs, that she is there to oblige, or improve, a man's needs." Monroe's contemporary Norman Mailer composed that "Marilyn proposed sex may be troublesome and unsafe with others, yet frozen yogurt with her", while Groucho Marx portrayed her as "Mae West, Theda Bara, and Bo Peep all folded into one". As per Haskell, because of her status as a sex image, Monroe was less mainstream with ladies than with men, as they "couldn't relate to her and didn't bolster her", in spite of the fact that this would change after her passing.
