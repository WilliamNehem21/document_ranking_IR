Initially, Cindy's brisk winds downed banana trees and power lines across northern Martinique. After hours of continued rain, several riversâsuch as the RiviÃ¨re des PÃ¨res, RiviÃ¨re Claire and RiviÃ¨re SÃ¨cheâquickly swelled and overflowed. Severe flooding and mudslides swept through northern villages, submerging homes and destroying roads and bridges. News footage on national television showed "cars [being] swept away to sea and buried in mud". The PrÃªcheur River, which normally flows at 18Â ft/s (0.5Â m/s), burst its banks upon attaining an exceptional discharge rate of nearly 25,000Â ft/s (700Â m/s). Large amounts of volcanic matter from the riverbed congealed into a massive debris flow, which struck the small commune of Le PrÃªcheur. Reaching heights of up to 10Â ft (3Â m), the debris completely covered houses and roads and wreaked an estimated â£15Â million (1993 value; $2.7Â million in 1993 USD) in structural damage. Flash floods following the overflow of the Grande RiviÃ¨re surged through the adjacent village of the same name, devastating property and drowning one person. Despite recent improvements to its flood defenses, the RiviÃ¨re Roxelane rapidly topped its banks and inundated much of Saint-Pierre. Farther south, a combination of torrential rainfall and poor storm drains resulted in flood damage to private property and an aquafarm in Le Morne-Vert.
