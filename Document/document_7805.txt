In 1900 his commendatory survey of Henrik Ibsen's "The point at which We Dead Awaken" was distributed in "The Fortnightly Review"; it was his first production and, subsequent to learning fundamental Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he got a letter of thanks from the producer. Joyce composed various different articles and something like two plays (since lost) amid this period. Huge numbers of the companions he made at University College Dublin showed up as characters in Joyce's works. His nearest partners included driving figures of the age, most prominently, Tom Kettle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and Oliver St. John Gogarty. Joyce was first acquainted with the Irish open by Arthur Griffith in his paper, "Joined Irishman", in November 1901. Joyce had composed an article on the Irish Literary Theater and his school magazine would not print it. Joyce had it printed and conveyed locally. Griffith himself composed a piece discrediting the restriction of the understudy James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland records James Joyce (19) as an English-and Irish-talking researcher living with his mom and father, six sisters and three siblings at Royal Terrace (presently Inverness Road), Clontarf, Dublin.
