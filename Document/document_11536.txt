Inside a time of his first spouse's demise, Marbury wedded Bridget Dryden, around ten years more youthful than he and from a noticeable Northampton family. Bridget's sibling Erasmus was the granddad of John Dryden, the well known writer and Poet Laureate. Anne was the third of 15 youngsters destined to this marriage, 12 of whom endure early youth.
