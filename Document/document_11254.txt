Caroline's insightfulness far surpassed her husband's, and she read enthusiastically. She set up a broad library at St. James' Palace. As a young lady, she related with Gottfried Leibniz, the scholarly giant who was retainer and jack of all trades to the House of Hanover. She later encouraged the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, seemingly the most vital reasoning of material science discourse of the eighteenth century. She advanced the act of variolation (an early kind of vaccination), which had been seen by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Charles Maitland in Constantinople. At the bearing of Caroline, six denounced detainees were offered the opportunity to experience variolation rather than execution: they all made due, as completed six vagrant kids given a similar treatment as a further test. Persuaded of its medicinal esteem, Caroline had her youngsters Amelia, Caroline and Frederick immunized against smallpox in a similar way. In lauding her help for smallpox vaccination, Voltaire composed of her, "I should state that regardless of every one of her titles and crowns, this princess was destined to support human expressions and the prosperity of humankind; even on the position of authority she is a kindhearted savant; and she has never lost a chance to learn or to show her liberality."
