The Oregon State Capitol is home to the two parts of the state council, the House and Senate, and has workplaces for the senator, treasurer, and the secretary of state. In its middle, the floor of the unmistakable rotunda includes an installed Oregon State Seal etched in bronze by Ulric Ellerhusen. Ellerhusen likewise shaped the Oregon Pioneer that rests on the legislative center vault's outside. The arch transcends the state seal. The inside of the vault was painted by Frank H. Schwarz and highlights 33 stars, symbolizing Oregon's place as the 33rd state to join the Union. Eight emblems are painted close to the highest point of the dividers of the rotunda that speak to the eight articles in the state seal. Likewise circling the inside of the rotunda are four paintings delineating minutes from Oregon history. One wall painting delineates Captain Robert Gray's investigation of the Columbia River in 1792, another demonstrates the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and two others depict secured wagons from pioneer times. These four wall paintings were painted by Schwarz and Barry Faulkner. Different wall paintings incorporate the Provisional Government of Oregon's salmon and wheat seal, the Oregon Territory's seal, and delineations of Oregon's enterprises, all situated in the rotunda's wings along the great staircase. The legislative hall's galleria territory on the main floor incorporates hearing rooms, show cases, and the guest data zone.
