Writing in London's "Evening Standard" on 5 January 2011, media commentator Roy Greenslade expressed concern over a number of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates' landlord, Jefferies, following his arrest, describing the coverage as "character assassination on a large scale". He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a headline in "The Sun" describing JefferiesÂ â a former schoolmaster at Clifton CollegeÂ â as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the "Daily Express" quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as "... a sort of Nutty Professor" who made them feel "creeped out" by his "strange" behaviour; and an article from the "Daily Telegraph", which reported Jefferies "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 AprilÂ â "The Sun", the "Daily Mirror", the "Daily Star", the "Daily Express", the "Daily Mail" and the "Daily Record"Â â seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to jump to conclusions regarding Jefferies' arrest. Being a retired English teacher who lived alone, whose physical appearance and "eccentrically unkempt white hair," made him stand out, led people to believe that he looked the type. Stephen Moss wrote in "The Guardian": "The unspoken assumption was that no one could look that odd and be innocent."
