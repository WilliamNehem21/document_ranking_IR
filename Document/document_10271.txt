Whenever Bachelot and Short landed in Honolulu in May 1837, they went through just 13 days on the island. Despite the understanding he had marked with French Naval Captain Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars that enabled French residents to live on the island, King looked to expel the clerics. Bachelot and Short were restricted to the ship on which they had arrived, the "ClÃÂ©mentine", on . In any case, the "ClÃÂ©mentine's" skipper, Jules Dudoit, would not transport them from Hawaii. Dudoit, a British native of French drop, met with Charlton, the British diplomat, and they freely dissented the ministers' restriction. Their endeavors to verify opportunity for the clerics to live on the island were fruitless until the British maritime vessel HMS "Sulfur" and the French frigate the "La VÃÂ©nus" touched base in Honolulu on . The boats were instructed individually by Edward Belcher and Dupetit Thouars, who each attempted to persuade the specialists to enable the clerics to come back to the island. After exchanges demonstrated purposeless, they barricaded the harbor, boarded the "ClÃÂ©mentine", and brought Bachelot and Short shorewards. The "La VÃÂ©nus" sent 300 mariners to escort them from the harbor to the French mission. Lord consented to enable the ministers to remain in Honolulu until they could discover a ship to transport them somewhere else, under the condition that they shun converting.
