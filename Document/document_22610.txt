In 2003, Square, now Square Enix, began a drive to begin developing "polymorphic content", a marketing and sales strategy to "[provide] well-known properties on several platforms, allowing exposure of the products to as wide an audience as possible". The first of these was the "Compilation of Final Fantasy VII", and Square Enix intended to have campaigns for other series whereby multiple games in different genres would be developed simultaneously. Although no such project for the "Mana" series had been announced by this point, it was announced in late 2004 that an unnamed "Mana" game was in development for the upcoming Nintendo DS platform. In early 2005, Square Enix announced a ""World of Mana"" project, the application of this "polymorphic content" idea to the "Mana" franchise, which would include several games across different genres and platforms. These games, as with the rest of the series, would not be direct sequels or prequels to one another, even if appearing so at first glance, but would instead share thematic connections. The first release in this project and the sixth release in the "Mana" series was announced in September 2005 as "Children of Mana" for the DS. Four games were released in 2006 and 2007 in the "World of Mana" subseries: "Children of Mana", "Dawn of Mana", and "Friends of Mana" in 2006, and "Heroes of Mana" in 2007.
