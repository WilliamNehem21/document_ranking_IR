"Banksia speciosa" is serotinous, that is, it has an aeronautical seed bank in its covering as the follicles of the old blossom spikes. These are opened by flame and discharge seed in extensive numbers, which develop and develop after downpour. Seed can keep going for a long time; old spikes 11 to 12 years of age have been found to have half feasible seed. Blossom spikes seem to have comparative quantities of follicles paying little mind to the age of the parent plant. Youthful plants start blossoming three years in the wake of recovering from bushfire and store dynamically bigger quantities of old flowerheads (and henceforth seed) in the overhang. In one investigation, decade-old plants arrived at the midpoint of around 3.5 old cones, while 21-year-old plants had 105, and were determined as having more than 900 reasonable seeds for each plant. Plants seem to have a life expectancy of no less than 40 years, as solid and vivacious people of this age are known. A trial consume and checking of resultant seedling germination and development indicated "B.ÃÂ speciosa" seeds, however various, had poor rates of foundation yet that seedlings had the capacity to get to water all the more effectively and had higher rates of survival following two years than co-happening "Banksia" species. Despite the fact that this proposed "B.ÃÂ speciosa" may outcompete its conspecifics, the creators of the examination noticed that there could be different elements not represented in its common habitat.
