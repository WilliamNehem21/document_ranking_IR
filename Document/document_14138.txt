Appearing differently in relation to this parallel division, Gardell partitions Heathenry in the United States into three gatherings as indicated by their positions on the issue of race: the "counter supremacist" bunch which upbraids any relationship between the religion and racial character, the "radical bigot" group which considers it to be the common religion of the Aryan race that can't appropriately be trailed by individuals from some other racial gathering, and the "ethnic" group which looks for a center way by recognizing the religion's underlying foundations in Northern Europe and its association with those of Northern European legacy. The religious investigations researcher Egil Asprem considered Gardell's triple typology "key so as to understand the veering positions inside the more extensive talk" of Heathenry. The religious examinations researcher Stefanie von Schnurbein likewise received this tripartite division, in spite of the fact that she alluded to the gatherings as the "racial-religious", "a-bigot", and "ethnicist" groups separately. The researcher of religion Ethan Doyle White rather came back to the double division between the "universalist" and "folkish" gatherings, contending that the last could be subdivided among the "ethnicist" and "racial-religious" groups, both of whom "consider Heathenry to be a religion intended for a specific racial or ethno-social gathering (regardless of whether conceptualized as 'Nordic,' 'white,' or 'Aryan')".
