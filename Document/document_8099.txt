Bana is an engine hustling devotee, and partakes in different engine dashing rivalries in Australia. At 14 years old, he needed to leave school to concentrate full-time on turning into an engine specialist, yet his dad persuaded him to finish school, encouraging him to abstain from making his side interest an occupation. Bana obtained his first vehicle, a 1974 XB Ford Falcon roadster, at 15 years old for A$1100 and, driving it, made his engine sport hustling debut in Targa Tasmania 1996, seven days in length race around Tasmania. (Bana has had this vehicle for in excess of 25 years. In 2009 he discharged a narrative named "Love The Beast". The film subtleties the focal job that hustling and fixing this equivalent vehicle has played in his life and the lives of his companions.) In 2004, Bana obtained a Porsche 944 to contend in Australia's Porsche Challenge. Contending all through 2004, he regularly completed in the main ten and in November, completed fourth at the Sandown occasion, an individual best. On 21 April 2007 Bana smashed his 1974 XB Falcon Coupe in the Targa Tasmania rally. Neither he nor his co-driver were harmed. Bana showed up on the British motoring show "Top Gear" on 15 November 2009 as a visitor for its "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" portion.
