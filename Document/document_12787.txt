"Ruler of Wales" made a 160ÃÂ° turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans stopped flame as the range enlarged. Despite the fact that Lindemann unequivocally supported pursuing "Ruler of Wales" and decimating her, LÃÂ¼tjens obeyed operational requests to disregard any avoidable commitment with foe powers that were not securing an escort, solidly dismissing the solicitation, and rather requested "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" to set out toward the North Atlantic. In the commitment, "Bismarck" had shot 93 protection puncturing shells and had been hit by three shells consequently. The forecastle hit permitted of water to flood into the ship, which tainted fuel oil put away in the bow. LÃÂ¼tjens would not lessen speed to permit harm control groups to fix the shell gap which extended and permitted more water into the ship. The second hit caused some extra flooding. Shell-chips from the second hit additionally harmed a steam line in the turbo-generator room, yet this was not genuine, as "Bismarck" had adequate other generator saves. The consolidated flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree rundown to port and a 3-degree trim by the bow.
