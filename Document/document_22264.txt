At the start of the 19th century, improvements in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability. Most notable among these enhancements was the two-component achromatic lens of the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer that essentially eliminated comaâan optical effect that can distort the outer edge of the image. By 1812, Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic objective lens in diameter. The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a refracting telescope. During the opposition of Mars in 1830, the German astronomers Johann Heinrich MÃ¤dler and Wilhelm Beer used a Fraunhofer refracting telescope to launch an extensive study of the planet. They chose a feature located 8Â° south of the equator as their point of reference. (This was later named the Sinus Meridiani, and it would become the zero meridian of Mars.) During their observations, they established that most of Mars' surface features were permanent, and more precisely determined the planet's rotation period. In 1840, MÃ¤dler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and MÃ¤dler simply designated them with letters; thus Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was feature ""a"".
