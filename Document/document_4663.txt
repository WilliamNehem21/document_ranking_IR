Entering the Domain of Death, the Spartan liberates his detained sibling. Angered that Kratos had neglected to protect him sooner and expressing he will never excuse him, Deimos assaults and overwhelms Kratos. In any case, Thanatos intercedes and takes a challenging Deimos to Suicide Bluffs (the site of Kratos' suicide endeavor), where Kratos spares Deimos from tumbling to his demise. An appreciative Deimos at that point helps his sibling in fighting the god with the Arms of Sparta. Now, Thanatos acknowledges Ares picked the wrong Spartan; it was Kratos who ought to have been taken, the "mark" being his red tattoo. Thanatos, in any case, executes Deimos however is crushed, thusly, by Kratos. Commenting that his sibling is at last free, Kratos places Deimos in his grave (leaving the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker), while the undertaker expresses that Kratos has moved toward becoming "Passing... the Destroyer of Worlds." Athena shows up, asks for absolution, and offers full godhood for not uncovering reality, yet Kratos disregards her and comes back to Olympus, promising that "the divine beings will pay for this." As Kratos is seen leaving, Athena takes a gander at Kratos and murmurs out of his earshot, "Excuse me... sibling."
