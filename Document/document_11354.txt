Waddington bowled with control, keeping up a decent length while his activity made the ball swing far from the batsman. For variety, he conveyed an off-shaper and when he bowled, the ball appeared to expand its speed in the wake of bobbing. He regularly bowled around the wicket. His bended run-up started from the on side of the wicket, and he kept running behind the umpire. He at that point discharged the ball from the side of the bowling wrinkle, making a sharp plot for the batsman to confront, in some cases utilizing short conveyances with a ring of leg side defenders. Waddington displayed his bowling on that of George Hirst, an individual left-arm paceman who likewise went about as a mentor and coach to him in his initial vocation, yet Derek Hodgson takes note of that the two men were altogether different in identity: Waddington was unmistakably more combative than Hirst. Waddington's bowling activity was noted for its brilliance and flawlessness. Neville Cardus, the columnist and cricket essayist, portrayed it as "superbly rhythmical", and "so exquisite that one essentially can't deny he is a decent bowler." But over and over again, Cardus recommended, he was "consistently raising expectations that genuine significance will originate from him, just to disillusion over and over".
