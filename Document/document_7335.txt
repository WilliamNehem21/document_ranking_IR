Because of time imperatives, a group of scholars was relegated to compose the teleplay. Notwithstanding the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would take a shot at the teleplay, and Piller would give the completing contacts. Since the Writers Guild would not enable in excess of three staff authors to show up in the credits (four after an uncommon waiver was allowed), Piller consented to not highlight his name in the credits. An incomplete first draft was submitted on November 30 with the goal that preproduction for the scene could start. The modified course of events gave an opportunity to demonstrate the "Undertaking" group in a substantially more emotional and human light than would be admissible in an ordinary scene. Behr clarified that since the first course of events was to be reestablished, the scholars had the opportunity to incorporate more activity. "Despite the fact that it was an imaginary world, [Moore] and I got all energized in light of the fact that we understood we were going to slaughter everybody on screen", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted specialized notices in regards to the kind of inconsistency that may drag the "Venture"- C through time, and recommended interstellar, super-thick strings as a probability. The main draft teleplay was finished by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held that day. Given the size of the story, different offices contended over expenses and what things could be sliced to diminish the financial plan. The last draft was done and submitted on December 8.
