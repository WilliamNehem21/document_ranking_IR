Irving Blum was the primary seller to demonstrate Warhol's soup can works of art. Blum happened to visit Warhol in December 1961 and after that May 1962, when Warhol was being highlighted in a May 11, 1962 "Time" magazine article "The Slice-of-Cake School" (that incorporated a part of Warhol's silkscreened "200 One Dollar Bills"), alongside Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, and Wayne Thiebaud. Warhol was the main craftsman whose photo really showed up in the article, which is characteristic of his talent for controlling the broad communications. Blum saw many Campbell's Soup can varieties, including a framework of "One-Hundred Soup Cans" that day. Blum was stunned that Warhol had no exhibition course of action and offered him a July appear at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. This would be Warhol's initial exclusive show of his pop workmanship. Warhol was guaranteed by Blum that the recently established "Artforum magazine", which had an office over the display, would cover the show. Not exclusively was the demonstrate Warhol's first solo display show, yet it was viewed as the West Coast debut of pop craftsmanship. A letter from Blum to Warhol dated June 9, 1962 set the display opening for July ninth. Andy Warhol's first New York solo Pop display was facilitated at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6Ã¢ÂÂ 24, 1962. The display incorporated the works "Marilyn Diptych", "Green Coca-Cola Bottles", and "Campbell's Soup Cans".
