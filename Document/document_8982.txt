Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, kicked the bucket amid the chamber, and Eugene selected Foliot as his successor at Theobald's asking. One of the chamber's last demonstrations was to suspend the non-going to ministers from their workplaces. The main English cleric explicitly named was Henry of Blois, yet the other people who did not go to were apparently additionally suspended in spite of the fact that not named. Henry of Blois was singled out for unique dealing with, as the papacy requested that he couldn't be reestablished by Theobald; Eugene held to himself the ability to reestablish Henry. Theobald seems to have restored a large portion of the clerics rapidly, as Foliot composed later in 1148 that just the ministers of Winchester, Durham, Worcester, Bath and Exeter were as yet suspended. Theobald excused the religious administrators of Exeter, Worcester and Bath on 11ÃÂ November 1148, as indicated by the later writer Gervase of Canterbury. Gervase likewise records Hilary of Chichester as one of those excused by Theobald on that date, yet as Hilary went to the gathering all things considered, this is a blunder. Durham may have been excluded on the grounds that he was a suffragan diocesan of the Archbishop of York, and his reestablishment was in his ecclesiastical overseer's hands.
