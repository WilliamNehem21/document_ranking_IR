In 1896 KetÃÂ¨lbey took up the post of conductor for a voyaging light musical drama organization; his dad, who needed his child to be an arranger of genuine music, opposed what he saw as a lightweight job. Following a two-year visit KetÃÂ¨lbey was delegated as melodic executive of the Opera Comique TheaterÃ¢ÂÂat age 22, the most youthful showy conductor in London at the time. He moved into a house in Bruton Street, in London's Mayfair, where he composed the melody "Blow! Blow! Thou Winter Wind", to words from Shakespeare's "As You Like It". The Opera Comique organized a fruitful restoration of the melodic "Alice in Wonderland" between December 1898 and March 1899, and as indicated by his biographer John Sant, it is conceivable that KetÃÂ¨lbey kept in touch with a portion of the music. This was trailed by the comic musical drama "A Good Time" from April, for which KetÃÂ¨lbey composed the music and tunes. Following poor audits, the short keep running of the piece finished in May and the Opera Comique shut as a result of the misfortunes achieved by the generation. There, KetÃÂ¨lbey started an association with the on-screen character and artist Charlotte "Lottie" Siegenberg. The couple wedded in 1906 yet the relationship was childless.
