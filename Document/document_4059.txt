In late February 1944, Vice-Admiral Shiro TakasuÃ¢ÂÂthe Commander in Chief of Japan's Southwest Area FleetÃ¢ÂÂrequested the substantial cruisers , and to strike Allied sending on the primary course among Aden and Fremantle. The three boats left the Combined Fleet's jetty in the Lingga Islands close Singapore on 27ÃÂ February. The light cruisers and three destroyers (which were assigned a "Security and Supply Formation") escorted the attacking power through the Sunda Strait on 1ÃÂ March. These five boats were to stay adrift for the term of the assault, and after that escort the substantial cruisers back through the Sunda Strait. The Allies didn't know about the assaulting power or its takeoff, yet Allied code breakers consequently distinguished the cruising from Singapore on 4 March of a power including two ships, a plane carrying warship and various destroyers, and established that the boats were traveled east towards Surabaya. Back Admiral Ralph W. Christie, the leader of the Allied submarines based at Fremantle, trusted that this power could assault the PerthÃ¢ÂÂ Fremantle zone. Accordingly, he requested the submarine under the order of Lieutenant Commander Chester Nimitz Jr. to watch the Lombok Strait and report the development of any Japanese boats into the Indian Ocean.
