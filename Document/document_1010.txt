In March 1948, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Carl Spaatz, suggested that the Air Force assume control over the AFSWP, in light of the fact that the Key West Agreement had given it duty regarding key shelling. This would have streamlined direction of the AFSWP, as it would have been responsible to just a single administration boss rather than three The Army warily upheld the proposition, yet the Navy was unequivocally restricted, expecting that the Air Force's perplexity of nuclear besieging and vital bombarding would hinder or even keep the Navy from approaching atomic weapons, which it felt was important to achieve its essential oceanic mission. Another arrangement of talks was held at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, from 20 to 22 August 1948, which brought about the Newport Agreement, under which the Navy consented to drop its resistance to the AFSWP being set under the Air Force incidentally, as an end-result of the Air Force perceiving the Navy's prerequisite for atomic weapons. At the point when the Air Force moved to make the impermanent game plan perpetual in September 1948, the Army and Navy questioned, and the Military Liaison Committee coordinated that the AFSWP ought to remain a tri-administration association responsible to the three administration boss.
