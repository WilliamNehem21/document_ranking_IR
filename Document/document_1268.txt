With a credit from the West Bengal government, Ray at long last finished the film. It was discharged in 1955 to extraordinary basic and mainstream achievement. It earned various prizes and had long keeps running in the two India and abroad. In India, the response to the film was excited; "The Times of India" composed that "It is preposterous to contrast it and some other Indian film [...] "Pather Panchali" is unadulterated film." In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson composed a gleaming survey of the film. In any case, the response was not consistently positive. In the wake of viewing the motion picture, FranÃÂ§ois Truffaut is accounted for to have stated, "I would prefer not to see a motion picture of laborers eating with their hands." Bosley Crowther, at that point the most powerful pundit of "The New York Times", composed a searing survey of the film. Its American merchant Ed Harrison was stressed Crowther's survey would deter groups of onlookers, yet the film had a particularly long run when discharged in the United States. A film still utilized on the first notice for the motion picture included in "The Family of Man", the Museum of Modern Art display that was seen by 9 million guests. It is a low-edge shot of the legend Apu having his hair brushed by his sister Durga and revering mother Sarbojaya. Of the thirteen pictures the presentation portraying India it was the just a single made by an Indian picture taker. Keeper Edward Steichen attributed it to Ray, but since Ray was not known to be a picture taker, it is likely the creator of this photo, of a scene coordinated by Ray, was the film's cinematographer, Subrata Mitra.
