After the sinking, the somewhat covered wreck made a boundary at a correct point against the flows of the Solent. Two scour pits, substantial submerged trench, framed on either side of the disaster area while residue and ocean growth was kept inside the ship. A profound however limited pit shaped on the upward tilting port side, while a shallower, more extensive pit framed on the starboard side, which had generally been covered by the power of the effect. The grating activities of sand and residue conveyed by the flows and the action of growths, microorganisms and wood-exhausting shellfish and molluscs, for example, the "teredo" "shipworm", started to separate the structure of the ship. In the end the uncovered wooden structure was debilitated and bit by bit fallen. The timbers and substance of the port side were either saved in the scour pits and remaining boat structure, or took away by the flows. Following the breakdown of the uncovered pieces of the ship, the site was leveled with the seabed and continuously secured by layers of silt, disguising the majority of the rest of the structure. Amid the sixteenth century, a hard layer of compacted dirt and smashed shells framed over the ship, balancing out the site and fixing the Tudor-time stores. Further layers of delicate residue secured the site amid the eighteenth and nineteenth hundreds of years, yet visit changes in the tidal examples and flows in the Solent once in a while uncovered a portion of the timbers, prompting its coincidental rediscovery in 1836 and helped in finding the disaster area in 1971. After the ship had been raised it was resolved that about 40% of the first structure had endure.
