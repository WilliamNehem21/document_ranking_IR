The TPF framed a phalanx and endeavored to clear the roads by walking gradually and driving the group back. The horde transparently ridiculed the police. The group cheered, began off the cuff kick lines, and sang to the tune of Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: "We are the Stonewall young ladies/We wear our hair in twists/We don't wear clothing/We demonstrate our pubic hair." Lucian Truscott detailed in "The Village Voice": "A dormant circumstance there expedited some gay silliness as a tune line confronting the line of helmeted and club-conveying cops. Similarly as the line got into a full kick schedule, the TPF progressed again and cleared the horde of shouting gay power[-]ites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." One member who had been in the Stonewall amid the attack reviewed, "The police hurried us, and that is the point at which I understood this is certifiably not something worth being thankful for to do, in light of the fact that they got me in the back with a nightstick." Another record expressed, "I just can't ever understand that one sight crazy. The cops with the [nightsticks] and the kick line on the opposite side. It was the most astonishing thing... And all the abrupt that kick line, which I surmise was a parody on the machismo... I imagine that is the point at which I felt rage. Since individuals were getting crushed with bats. What's more, for what? A kick line."
