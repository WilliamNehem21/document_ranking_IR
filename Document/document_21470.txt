Although Noel rejoined Oasis a few weeks later, the band's management and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move would have been to take the rest of the year off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." Noel Gallagher would agree with this assessment in 2016: "Instead of going, âRight, we should just go our separate ways for a year or two,â we decided like idiots to go straight into the studio. That maybe wasn't the best idea." Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didnât record "Be Here Now" in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." He described the Mustique demos as "the last good recordings I did with Noel" and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.
