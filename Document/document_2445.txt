Preceding exchanging parties, Specter was guaranteed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that he would keep his rank on the Senate in the event that he joined the Democratic Party. The course of action disappointed some Senate Democrats, and, on May 3, the Senate casted a ballot to strip him of his rank regardless of Reid's guarantee. This briefly made Specter the most junior Democrat in the Senate and seriously restricted his impact as an official. All things considered, Specter's choice was commended by many real Democrats, including Reid and President Barack Obama, who guaranteed to battle for him. Republicans, in any case, censured the choice, blaming Specter for selling out his standards and gathering to safeguard his political vocation. Michael Steele, director of the Republican National Committee, said Specter "flipped the fledgling" to the gathering and that Specter settled on the choice based exclusively in light of the fact that he realized he would lose the race. Congressperson John Cornyn, administrator of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a past supporter of Specter, said the choice "speaks to the tallness of political self-protection". Phantom guarded his situation by belligerence the Republican Party had strayed excessively a long way from the vision of President Ronald Reagan, including, "I am not set up to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate chosen by the Pennsylvania Republican essential electorate."
