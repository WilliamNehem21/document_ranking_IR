After the break, Hassett achieved his century following 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He at that point quickened, including a further 37 keeps running in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. The rejection finished an eighth-wicket organization of 107 with Lindwall, who was gotten by Evans down the leg side four runs later, having scored 42 with seven fours. Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack swayed a further 33 keeps running in just 18 minutes, batting in a cheerful and freewheeling way, before Bedser caught Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the vacationers with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings as far as overs and the most elevated aggregate in the arrangement. Yardley set most of the bowling load on his spinners; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) conveyed 60 and 55 overs individually. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113. The low maintenance crease bowlers, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 overs individually. Australia had scored gradually yet they had no compelling reason to go out on a limb when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg hypothesis strategies neglected to cajole them into losing their understanding.
