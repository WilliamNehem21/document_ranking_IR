The supervisors on the skull of "Achelousaurus" may have been shrouded in a keratinous sheath throughout everyday life, except their shape in a living creature is dubious. In 2009, the scientist Tobin L. Hieronymus and associates analyzed connections between's skull morphology, horn, and skin highlights of current horned creatures, and inspected the skull of centrosaurine dinosaurs for similar corresponds. They recommended that the rugose managers of "Achelousaurus" and "Pachyrhinosaurus" were secured by thick stack of cornified (or keratinized) skin, like the supervisor of present day muskoxen ("Ovibos moschatus"). The nasal horncore of grown-up "Achelousaurus" had an upward inclination and its upper surface had corresponds for a thick epidermal (external layer of skin) cushion that reviewed into relates for a cornified sheath on the sides. A thick cushion of epidermis may have developed from the V-molded set indent at the tip of the nasal horncore. The development bearing of the nasal cushion would have been towards the front. The supraorbital managers may have had a thick cushion of epidermis, which developed at a sideways point like the bended horncores of "Coronosaurus", as shown by the introduction of the "balances" or edges on the supervisors. That the supraorbital supervisors came up short on a sulcus (or wrinkle) at their bases shows that their horn cushions halted at the wrinkled edges of the managers. The setting may demonstrate a milder developing layer interfacing the hard internal bone with the hard horn sheath. Likewise, connects for a rostral scale before the nasal supervisor and scale pushes along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal locale were recognized.
