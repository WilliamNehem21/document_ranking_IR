A worker family named Zunino concealed him for a short time; he at that point joined a gathering of expert Allied Italian partisans with whom he partook in harm tasks against the German battalion for around three months. At the point when the Germans hauled out of the region in October 1944, Smith left to endeavor to interface up with the Allied powers who had quite recently attacked southern France. Joined by three other servicemen, each from an alternate European nation, and a nearby guide, Smith climbed over the Maritime Alps, completing the adventure strolling shoeless on the ice and snow. American troops recuperated him in November 1944. Smith again turned down the idea of a billet in Rhodesia and came back to dynamic administration in April 1945 with No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron, by then situated in western Germany. He flew battle missions there, "[having] a tad of fun shooting up odd things", he reviewed, until the war in Europe finished on 7 May 1945 with Germany's surrender. Smith stayed with No. 130 Squadron for the remainder of his administration, flying with the unit to Denmark and Norway, and was released toward the finish of 1945 with the position of flight lieutenant.
