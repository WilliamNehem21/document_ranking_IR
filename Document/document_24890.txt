In 1981, after the 1980â81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point. Early in the 1981â82 season, Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers "slow" and "predictable". After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner Jerry Buss fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley. Although Johnson denied responsibility for Westhead's firing, he was booed across the league, even by Laker fans. However, Buss was also unhappy with the Lakers offense and had intended on firing Westhead days before the WestheadâJohnson altercation, but assistant GM Jerry West and GM Bill Sharman had convinced Buss to delay his decision. Despite his off-court troubles, Johnson averaged 18.6Â points, 9.6Â rebounds, 9.5Â assists, and a league-high 2.7Â steals per game, and was voted a member of the All-NBA Second Team. He also joined Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson as the only NBA players to tally at least 700Â points, 700Â rebounds, and 700Â assists in the same season. The Lakers advanced through the 1982 playoffs and faced Philadelphia for the second time in three years in the 1982 NBA Finals. After a triple-double from Johnson in Game 6, the Lakers defeated the Sixers 4â2, as Johnson won his second NBA Finals MVP award. During the championship series against the Sixers, Johnson averaged 16.2Â points on .533Â shooting, 10.8Â rebounds, 8.0Â assists, and 2.5Â steals per game. Johnson later said that his third season was when the Lakers first became a great team, and he credited their success to Riley.
