Hornung's contentions have extraordinarily affected different researchers of Egyptian religion, however some still trust that now and again the divine beings were more bound together than he permits. Jan Assmann keeps up that the thought of a solitary divinity grew gradually through the New Kingdom, starting with an emphasis on Amun-Ra as the immeasurably imperative sun god. In his view, Atenism was an outrageous outgrowth of this pattern. It likened the single god with the sun and rejected every other god. At that point, in the reaction against Atenism, holy scholars depicted the all inclusive god in an unexpected way, one that coincided with conventional polytheism. The one god was accepted to rise above the world and the various divinities, while in the meantime, the numerous divine beings were parts of the one. As indicated by Assmann, this one god was particularly likened with Amun, the predominant god in the late New Kingdom, while for the remainder of Egyptian history the all inclusive divinity could be related to numerous different divine beings. James P. Allen says that existing together ideas of one god and numerous divine beings would fit well with the "assortment of methodologies" in Egyptian idea, just as with the henotheistic routine with regards to standard admirers. He says that the Egyptians may have perceived the solidarity of the perfect by "recognizing their uniform idea of 'god' with a specific god, contingent upon the specific circumstance."
