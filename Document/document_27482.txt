"Irritator" had straight or only faintly recurved conical teeth, bearing sharply defined but unserrated edges. Flutes (lengthwise ridges) were present on its tooth crowns, a common dental trait among spinosaurids. Both sides of "Irritator"s teeth were fluted, as in "Spinosaurus", whereas "Baryonyx" exhibited them only on the lingual (inward facing) side of its teeth. "Irritator"s teeth were circular in cross section, as opposed to the laterally flattened condition of most theropod teeth. The enamel (first layer of the teeth) was thin, with a finely wrinkled texture also observed in "Baryonyx." Both of "Irritator"s maxillae preserve nine teeth, although the left maxilla's tooth crowns are more intact, and there are traces of a tenth tooth in the rock matrix. The teeth were deeply inserted into the jaw and widely spaced towards the front of the maxilla. The first and second preserved maxillary teeth were the largest, at and in crown length. The seven remaining teeth became progressively smaller towards the rear, one of the last ones measuring in estimated crown length. CT scans performed on the specimen revealed replacement teeth on both sides of the upper jaw. Their roots ran deep into the maxillae and converged close to the midline, nearly reaching the top of the skull. Based on comparisons with "Irritator"s relatives, the maxillae were probably lined with a total of 11 teeth each, similar to the number of 12 teeth in MSNM V4047, an upper jaw fossil referred to "Spinosaurus". The hindmost tooth of the "Irritator" specimen's left maxilla was not yet fully erupted, and only the tip of it was visible.
