Be that as it may, aside from an energetically affirming report in "The Saturday Review", the book's underlying basic gathering was tepid. The "Review"s commentator thought the book "splendid, and in a portion of its contacts [it] goes near virtuoso", with a characteristic and powerful intrigue: "The "Journal" has diverted us from spread to cover". This diverged from the negative judgment of "The Athenaeum", which opined that "the book has no legitimacy to make up for its miserable profanity, not in any case that of being interesting".

"The Speaker"s faultfinder thought the book "an investigation in foulness", while "The New York Times", inspecting the principal American release, found the work to a great extent unimaginable: "There is that sort of tranquil, ordinary, regular kidding in it which we are to assume is profoundly agreeable to our cousins over the waterÃÂ ... Our method for assembling fun is extraordinary". In spite of the fact that subtleties of offers figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later recognized that the early releases of the book did not have a wide open effect.
