Now, Kantakouzenos' position was enormously fortified by the mediation of his old companion, Umur Bey, who in late 1342 or mid 1343 cruised up the Evros stream with an armada of 300 boats and 29,000 (as per Kantakouzenos) or 15,000 (as indicated by Turkish sources) men-in-arms and mitigated Demotika both from the attack by the rule's powers and from the thefts of the Bulgarians. Subsequent to plundering Thrace for a couple of months, Umur was compelled to withdraw to Asia at the beginning of winter, to which the Turks were unfamiliar. This unforeseen development disappointed DuÃÂ¡an, for Kantakouzenos now had a free power base and was less dependent on the Serbian ruler's generosity. The last break among Kantakouzenos and DuÃÂ¡an happened in April 1343, when Kantakouzenos induced the town of Berroia, attacked by the Serbs, to surrender to him rather than DuÃÂ¡an. This was trailed by the surrender of a few different posts in the region to Kantakouzenos, including Servia and Platamon. These moves reinforced Kantakouzenos' position and autonomy from DuÃÂ¡an, in this way defeating the last's arrangements for extension. Understanding that he had little to pick up by proceeding to help Kantakouzenos, DuÃÂ¡an opened dealings with the regime and closed a formal coalition with them in the late spring of 1343.
