Barre served King Henry amid the ruler's squabble with Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had gone into outcast in 1164 over the debate about the points of confinement of regal expert over the English Church. As a result of Barre's nearby connections to King Henry, Becket thought of him as one of the lord's "abhorrent advocates", and Barre was the subject of condemnations by the diocese supervisor. In late August 1169, Barre was in Normandy with Henry, where Barre was a piece of a gathering of ministers exhorting the ruler on the most proficient method to determine the Becket question. In September 1169, Barre was sent alongside two different assistants to Rome to gripe about the conduct of ecclesiastical emissaries amid arrangements with Becket held toward the start of September. The ecclesiastical arbitrators at first consented to a trade off, yet the following day asserted that the proposition was inadmissible. With the disappointment of the arrangements, Becket reestablished the sentences of banishment on various regal authorities, however Barre was excluded among those explicitly named despite the fact that a large number of his partners were. The history specialist Frank Barlow contends that Barre was not explicitly named in the rebuilding of expulsions, as Becket thought of him as of now expelled as a result of his relationship with those under the congregation's boycott.
