Cooler set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such strike and effectively barraged a few English towns, yet British destroyers escorting the first BCS had just experienced German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 05:15 and battled an uncertain activity with them. Bad habit Admiral Sir George Warrender, directing the second Battle Squadron, had gotten a flag at 5:40 that the destroyer was connecting with adversary destroyers in spite of the fact that Beatty had not. The destroyer recognized the heavily clad cruiser and her escorts at about 07:00, however couldn't transmit the message until 07:25. Warrender got the flag, as did the battlecruiser , however Beatty did not, in spite of the way that "New Zealand" had been explicitly entrusted to hand-off messages between the destroyers and Beatty. Warrender endeavored to pass on "Shark"s message to Beatty at 7:36, yet did not figure out how to reach until 07:55. Beatty turned around course when he got the message and dispatched "New Zealand" to look for "Roon". She was being updated by "New Zealand" when Beatty got messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty requested "New Zealand" to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
