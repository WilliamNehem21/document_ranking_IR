There were charges of partiality in acquiring programs. Aubrey's companion Keefe Brasselle, who had bit parts in a few motion pictures during the 1950s and met Aubrey when they both worked at KNXT, had no involvement as a maker. "A 1965 release of George Raft," said David Susskind, especially able as there were likewise gossipy tidbits Brasselle had connections to the Mafia. All things considered, Aubrey booked three shows from Brasselle's Richelieu Productions for the 1964Ã¢ÂÂ 65 season, all without pilots, still a practically inconceivable practice. (The shows were "The Baileys of Balboa", a sitcom with Paul Ford; the paper dramatization "The Reporter"; and "The Cara Williams Show", a sitcom featuring red-head Williams, charged as the following Lucille Ball.) Brasselle would actually manage "The Reporter", shot in New York City. Expenses soar on Brasselle's showsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ after nine scenes, "The Reporter" was $450,000 over budgetÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and each of the three bombedÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "The Reporter" running just three months, "Baileys" until April 1965; and "Cara Williams" completing the season. Aubrey was later inquired as to why he disclosed three untested projects. "Egotism, I surmise" he reacted. In his book "The Other Glass Teat", media faultfinder Harlan Ellison claims that a Mafia wear had put out an agreement on Aubrey for beating his little girl amid consensual sex at a Las Vegas, Nevada lodging, and that Brasselle requested the shows in return for his utilizing his own Mafia associations with cover things up.
