The covered bridge crosses Muncy Creek in Davidson Township on Champion Hill Road (Township RoadÂ 310), just east of U.S. Route 220. The village of Sonestown is north of the bridge on RouteÂ 220 and has given the Sonestown Covered Bridge its name. The bridge is also east of the village of Muncy Valley along RouteÂ 220. Its official name on the NRHP is Sonestown Covered Bridge. It is also known as the Davidson Covered Bridge, for its township. Sullivan County is located in north central Pennsylvania, about northwest of Philadelphia and east-northeast of Pittsburgh.
The area that became Davidson Township was first settled in 1806Â and was incorporated as a township in 1833. Within the township, George Sones built a sawmill and founded the unincorporated village of Sonestown in 1843. All of these events occurred before Sullivan County was formed from part of Lycoming County on March 14, 1847. The bridge was built in 1850, and in the late 19th century Sonestown "boomed like crazy" as the lumber industry grew in Sullivan County. The village was then home to a plant that manufactured the staves for making barrels. It had a clothespin factory from 1903Â to 1929 but lost almost all industry by the 1930s. As of 1996, Sonestown had a population of about 200, most of whom commuted to work in Muncy, Montoursville, and Williamsport. In 1996Â the village had a few stores, an inn with a restaurant, and attracted tourists and hunters.
