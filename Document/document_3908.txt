By 1759, Prussia had achieved a vital protective position; Russian and Austrian troops encompassed Prussia, in spite of the fact that not exactly at the outskirts of Brandenburg. After leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick amassed his military in Lower Silesia; this constrained the fundamental Habsburg armed force to stay in its organizing region in Bohemia. The Russians, in any case, moved their powers into western Poland-Lithuania, a move that undermined the Prussian heartland, conceivably Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending Generalleutnant Friedrich August von Finck's military corps to contain the Russians. Finck's corps was vanquished at the Battle of Kay on 23 July. Along these lines, Pyotr Saltykov and the Russian powers propelled west to possess Frankfurt a der Oder, Prussia's second biggest city, on 31 July (on Germany's fringe with present-day Poland). There he requested entrenchment of their camp toward the east, close Kunersdorf. To exacerbate the situation for the Prussians, an Austrian corps directed by Feldmarshalleutnant Ernst Gideon von Laudon joined Saltykov on 3Ã¢ÂÂ 5 August. Lord Frederick hurried from Saxony, assumed control over the remainders of Generalleutnant Carl Heinrich von Wedel's unexpected at MÃÂ¼llrose and pushed toward the Oder River. By 9 August, he had 49,000Ã¢ÂÂ 50,000 troops, improved by Finck's vanquished corps, and Prince Henry of Prussia's corps moving from the Lausitz area.
