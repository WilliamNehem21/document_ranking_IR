Backstage at "SNL", Hartman was called "the Glue", a name coined by Adam Sandler, according to Jay Mohr's book "Gasping for Airtime". However, according to a biography on Hartman's life entitled "You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman" written by Mike Thomas, author and staff writer for the "Chicago Sun-Times", the nickname was created by "SNL" cast member and Hartman's frequent on-screen collaborator Jan Hooks. Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided Hooks in overcoming her stage fright. "SNL" creator Lorne Michaels explained the reason for the name: "He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance." Michaels also added that Hartman was "the least appreciated" cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability "to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work". Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for "SNL" in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.
