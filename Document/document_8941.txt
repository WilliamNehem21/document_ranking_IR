Hilary endeavored to pardon the ruler's endeavor to avoid Theobald from the gathering, which gives off an impression of being the fundamental motivation behind why Stephen permitted Hilary to visit. Hilary was compensated for his unwaveringness by being named a ruler's clergyman. Not long after the chamber, Robert de Bethune kicked the bucket and Gilbert Foliot was chosen to the see of Hereford, at the heading of the pope. Theobald was estranged abroad in Flanders since he had resisted the lord, so the pope requested Robert de Sigello, the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and Hilary, to go to Flanders to help Theobald bless Gilbert. Notwithstanding, the three clerics were hesitant, and told the pope that since Gilbert had not gotten the imperial consent, nor had he sworn fealty to Stephen, they would not bless him. Theobald then sanctified Gilbert with the assistance of some mainland clerics. Hilary was one of the priests who made harmony among Theobald and Stephen after the committee at Reims, helping in the arrangements after Theobald's arrival to England. Theobald settled at Hugh Bigod's mansion of Framlingham; arrangements between the illustrious party and the diocese supervisor's gathering brought about the ruler yielding and in the reclamation of the ecclesiastical overseer to his territories.
