Since the 1970s, the boating theory has been raised doubt about by cases that lemur family Cheirogaleidae may be all the more firmly identified with the other Afro-Asian strepsirrhines than to the remainder of the lemurs. This thought was at first dependent on likenesses in conduct and molar morphology, despite the fact that it picked up help with the 2001 revelation of 30Ã¢ÂÂmillion-year-old "Bugtilemur" in Pakistan and the 2003 disclosure of 40Ã¢ÂÂmillion-year-old "Karanisia" in Egypt. "Karanisia" is the most seasoned fossil discovered that bears a toothcomb, while "Bugtilemur" was thought to have a toothcomb, yet in addition had significantly progressively comparative molar morphology to "Cheirogaleus" (overshadow lemurs). On the off chance that these connections had been right, the dates of these fossils would have had suggestions on the colonization of Madagascar, requiring two separate occasions. The most stingy clarification, given the hereditary proof and the nonattendance of toothcombed primates in European fossil destinations, is that stem strepsirrhines advanced on the Afro-Arabian landmass, scattering to Madagascar and all the more as of late from Africa to Asia. All the more as of late, the structure and general nearness of the toothcomb in "Bugtilemur" has been addressed, just as numerous other dental highlights, proposing it is no doubt an adapiform.
