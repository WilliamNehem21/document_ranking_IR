"Banksia aquilonia" was first depicted by Alex George in 1981 as an assortment of "Banksia integrifolia" (coast banksia), from an example gathered at Witts Lookout in Crystal Creek National Park south of Ingham on 12 April 1975. The species name is the Latin modifier "aquilonius", signifying "northern", as it was the most northerly type of "B.ÃÂ integrifolia". In 1996 Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges distributed a cladistic examination of "Banksia" in light of morphology, in which this taxon emerged as the main individual from "B.ÃÂ integrifolia" to be both morphologically and topographically particular from other infraspecific taxa. They additionally noticed that there were no middle of the road plants between what was then known as "B.ÃÂ integrifolia" var. "aquilonia" and different populaces of "B.ÃÂ integrifolia". On this premise they would have gotten a kick out of the chance to elevate it to species rank, yet did not on the grounds that their gathered phylogeny recommended that this taxon emerged from inside "B.ÃÂ integrifolia". They were reluctant to render "B.ÃÂ integrifolia" paraphyletic by hoisting this taxon to species rank, and they were similarly reluctant to raise each of the four assortments to species rank, since the others all had critical covers in dispersion and morphology. In this way, they essentially elevated every one of the four to subspecies rank. This precedent has since been held up as a fascinating contextual analysis on how the idea of "species" ought to be characterized, as it shows the issue of "a monophyletic assemble containing a paraphyletic basal gathering of not completely separated geographic structures inside which is settled somewhere around one unique, autapomorphic taxon that welcomes treatment as an animal categories."
