The creation chose two adjoining properties on the Warner backlot's "Blondie Street" for the Burnham and Fitts' homes. The group remade the houses to fuse false rooms that set up viewable pathwaysÃ¢ÂÂamong Ricky and Jane's room windows, and between Ricky's room and Lester's carport. The carport windows were planned explicitly to acquire the significant shot at the finish of the film in which Col. FittsÃ¢ÂÂviewing from Ricky's roomÃ¢ÂÂerroneously expect that Lester is paying Ricky for sex. Mendes made a point to set up the viewable pathway right off the bat in the film to comprehend nature with the shot. The house insides were taped on the backlot, on area, and on soundstages when overhead shots were required. Within the Burnhams' house was shot at a house near Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles; within the Fitts' house was shot in the city's Hancock Park neighborhood. Ricky's room was intended to be cell-like to recommend his "monkish" identity, while in the meantime mixing with the cutting edge gear to mirror his voyeuristic side. The generation purposely limited the utilization of red, as it was an imperative topical mark somewhere else. The Burnhams' home uses cool blues, while the Fitts' is kept in a "discouraged military palette".
