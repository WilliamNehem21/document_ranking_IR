The primary gathering of the five focal backstabbers occurred on Sunday 20 May 1604, at a motel called the Duck and Drake, in the stylish Strand region of London. Catesby had just proposed at a before meeting with Thomas Wintour and John Wright to execute the King and his administration by exploding "the Parliament House with black powder". Wintour, who at first questioned the arrangement, was persuaded by Catesby to head out to the mainland to look for help. Wintour met with the Constable of Castile, the ousted Welsh covert operative Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would get no help from Spain. Owen did, be that as it may, acquaint Wintour with Fawkes, who had by then been far from England for a long time, and in this way was to a great extent obscure in the nation. Wintour and Fawkes were peers; every wa activist, and had direct involvement of the reluctance of the Spaniards to help. Wintour advised Fawkes of their arrangement to "doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott", and in this manner in April 1604 the two men came back to England. Wintour's news did not shock Catesby; in spite of positive clamors from the Spanish specialists, he expected that "the deeds would nott answere".
