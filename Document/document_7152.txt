After Florida went under the Kingdom of Great Britain's purview in 1763, Quaker father and child naturalists John and William Bartram investigated the length of the stream while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766. They distributed diaries portraying their encounters and the plants and creatures they watched. They were charged by King George III to discover the wellspring of the waterway they called the Picolata or San Juan, and estimated its widths and profundities, taking soil tests as they voyaged southward. William came back to Florida from 1773 to 1777 and composed another diary about his movements, while he gathered plants and become a close acquaintence with the Seminoles who called him "Puc Puggy" (blossom seeker). William's visit accepting him as far south as Blue Spring, where he commented on the completely clear perspectives offered by the spring water: "The water is splendidly transparent, and here are constantly a huge number and assortment of fish; they show up as plain as if lying on a table before your eyes, albeit numerous feet somewhere down in the water." Bartram's diaries pulled in the consideration of such unmistakable Americans as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. The achievement of these diaries enlivened different naturalists, for example, AndrÃÂ© Michaux to additionally investigate the St. Johns, as he did in 1788, cruising from Palatka south to Lake Monroe, and offered names to a portion of the plants portrayed by the Bartrams' diaries. Michaux was trailed by William Baldwin somewhere in the range of 1811 and 1817. Consequent pilgrims, including John James Audubon, have conveyed William's "Goes Through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida" with them as a guide.
