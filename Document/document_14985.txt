"Bellerophon" now found herself in a desperate position. The much more powerful three-decked "Orient" fired several broadsides into the "Bellerophon", smashing her boats, dismounting guns and cutting rigging. French marines on the higher decks poured volleys of musket fire onto "Bellerophon"s exposed upper decks. Between 60 and 70 of her crew were killed or wounded in the first stages of the engagement, including Darby, who was rendered unconscious by a head wound. Command then devolved to the first lieutenant, Lieutenant Daniel. Daniel and the second lieutenant, Lieutenant Lander, were both wounded, but were able to direct the fighting until a shot took away Daniel's left leg. As he was carried below he was hit by grapeshot and killed outright. The fourth lieutenant, John Hadaway, was wounded and was taken below to the surgeon, while the fifth lieutenant, George Joliffe, was killed on the deck. After an hour fighting "Orient" alone, "Bellerophon"s mizzenmast collapsed, followed shortly afterwards by the mainmast. Lieutenant Lander was among those killed in the fall of the mainmast, and command devolved to the third lieutenant, the uninjured Lieutenant Robert Cathcart. Several fires had broken out on both "Bellerophon" and "Orient". According to the "Bellerophon"s logbook, at 9pm, when a further fire broke out on the "Orient", Cathcart was down below on duty, and the 13 year old Midshipman John Hindmarsh was briefly the senior officer on deck. He ordered the anchor cable cut and the spritsail was hoisted, but put too great a strain on the foremast, which collapsed. Now totally dismasted, "Bellerophon" began to drift away from the action, her crew fighting fires. As she moved out of the line she received some long range shots from the French "Tonnant".
