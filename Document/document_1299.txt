A report entitled "A Statement of the Situation of the Works of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal, on the Eighteenth of December, 1795." gives subtleties of the advancement of the works, including subtleties of extensions, cuttings, raised bankings and water passages. A great part of the report subtleties the work required to change over the channel to wide check. A length between Oldfield Lane in Salford and Giants Seat Locks in Outwood was safe with 3ÃÂ ft 8ÃÂ in (1.12ÃÂ m) of water. The rest of the work included fortifying work to the banks, an expansion of water profundity to , and the gravelling of half of the towpath. Between Giants Seat locks and Ringley Bridge two locks had been raised, with a little segment of trench to be expanded before getting to be traversable. From Ringley Bridge to Prestolee Aqueduct one lock had been raised. Nob End Locks were still under development yet for the most part total, in spite of the fact that the bowl at the base had not yet been burrowed. The stretch to Bolton had right now been enlarged, with a few extensions requiring further work, inadequate dikes, development of a weir, and gravelling of the towpath. On the Bury arm, nearly the whole length had been burrowed, and dividers to help the channel along the bank of the Irwell had been assembled. Some enlarging of already thin areas still couldn't seem to be attempted, none of the towpath had been graveled, and no wall had been raised along the towpath.
