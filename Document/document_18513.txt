FaurÃ©'s new position left him better off financially. However, while he also became much more widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling to earn a living as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, "PÃ©nÃ©lope" (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle "La chanson d'Ãve", Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9â11; Barcarolles Nos. 7â11, written between 1906 and 1914).
FaurÃ© was elected to the Institut de France in 1909, after his father-in-law and Saint-SaÃ«ns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the SociÃ©tÃ© musicale indÃ©pendante. While FaurÃ© accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid.
