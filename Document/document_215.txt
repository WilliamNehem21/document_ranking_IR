During the 1880s, in spite of the arrival of gold to trade across the country with the resumption of specie installments toward the finish of 1878, couple of three-dollar pieces were authored. There was a little theoretical blast by general society in setting aside three-dollar pieces; by and by, thousands stayed at the Philadelphia Mint. Maybe a couple were sent to banks; the coins sold for a little premium when banks had a few or when they were acquired from trade representatives. The coins' principle use was as blessings, or in adornments. The pieces were struck just at Philadelphia after the 1870-S irregularity, and early numismatist S.H.ÃÂ Chapman noted of the 1879 through 1889 issues, "of the later long stretches of theÃÂ $3, huge numbers were remelted at the Philadelphia Mint." The Mint evidently supported certain Philadelphia sellers in the circulation of the gold dollar, yet the three-dollar piece could be gotten without a premium at the clerk's window of the Philadelphia Mint. Expansive quantities of the 1879 three-dollar piece (mintage 3,000ÃÂ for flow), 1880 (1,000), and 1881 (500) were stored by early currency gatherer and vendor Thomas L.ÃÂ Elder, who approached bank employees to pay special mind to them. Senior couldn't have gotten them straightforwardly from the Mint at the season of issue as he was as yet a kid in 1880, and did not start gathering coins until 1887.
