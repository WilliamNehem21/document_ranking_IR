On 12ÃÂ November 1945, at the main general gathering of armed force authority, General SudirmanÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the pioneer of the Fifth Division in Purwokerto, who had two years military experience and was 23 years more youthful than OeripÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ was chosen pioneer of the military after two halted cast a ballot. In the third round, Oerip had 21ÃÂ votes to Sudirman's 22. Divisional officers from Sumatra, who had casted a ballot collectively, influenced the vote to support Sudirman; Oerip had lost votes since a portion of the division heads doubted his history with the KNIL and the promise he had taken to the Dutch country upon graduation. In spite of the fact that Sudirman was astounded at his choice and offered to surrender the authority position to Oerip, the gathering did not permit it; Oerip himself was happy to never again be accountable for the military. Sudirman kept Oerip, by then a lieutenant general, to fill in as head of staff under him. While Sudirman stayed unverified, Oerip remained "by law" pioneer; notwithstanding, the Indonesian columnist Salim Said composes that Oerip's requests were now and again incoherent attributable to the pioneer's poor direction of Indonesian and regularly overlooked except if affirmed by Sudirman.
