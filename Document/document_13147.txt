"Krazy Kat" picked up a thankful gathering of people in the realm of human expressions. The character appeared in film in 1916. The principal vivified films featuring a feline were delivered by Hearst's International Film Service, however without Herriman's immediate association. In 1922, Adolph Bolm arranged a jazz-emulate "Krazy Kat" expressive dance composed by John Alden Carpenter. It was first performed in New York in 1922 by Ballet Intime, and Herriman delineated the lyrics and planned the outfits and situation. While it was anything but an extraordinary achievement, the pundits Deems Taylor, Stark Young and Henrietta Straus composed positively about it. The strip itself was the subject of an article by abstract commentator Gilbert Seldes called "Golla, Golla the Comic Strip's Art", which showed up in the May 1922 issue of "Vanity Fair". Seldes extended this article as a component of his book on the prevalent expressions, "The Seven Lively Arts" (1924), in which Seldes contended against moderate inclinations that avoided craftsmen in the prominent expressions, for example, Herriman and Chaplin, from being considered close by conventional specialists. "Krazy Kat" was the subject of a part entitled "The Krazy Kat That Walks independent from anyone else", which is the most celebrated bit of expounding on the strip and the soonest case of a commentator from the universe of high craftsmanship offering authenticity to the funny cartoon medium. "Vanity Fair" enlisted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in the April 1923 issue.
