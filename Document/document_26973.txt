"First Contact" was the first "Star Trek" film to make significant use of computer-generated starship models, though physical miniatures were still used for the most important vessels. With the "Enterprise"-D destroyed during the events of "Generations", the task of creating a new starship fell to veteran "Star Trek" production designer Herman Zimmerman. The script's only guide on the appearance of the vessel was the line "the new "Enterprise" sleekly comes out of the nebula". Working with illustrator John Eaves, the designers conceived the new Sovereign Class "Enterprise"-E as "leaner, sleeker, and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine". Braga and Moore intended it to be more muscular and militaryesque. Eaves looked at the structure of previous "Enterprise" iterations, and designed a more streamlined, capable war vessel than the "Enterprise"-D, reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the nacelles. Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes. Working from blueprints created by Paramount's Rick Sternbach, the model shop at effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fabricated a miniature over a five-month period. Hull patterns were carved out of wood, then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature. The model's panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture. The crew had multiple difficulties in prepping the miniature for filming; while the model shop originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass, the material came out tacky. ILM instead cut the windows using a laser. Slides of the sets were added behind the window frames to make the interior seem more dimensional when the camera tracked past the ship.
