From 1986 to 1987, the USGS overviewed the Three Sisters region with tilt-leveling systems and electro-optical separation meters, however South Sister was not the subject of close geodetic examination for the following two decades. The fountain of liquid magma was observed to be conceivably dynamic in 2000, when satellite symbolism demonstrated a twisting structural inspire west of the mountain. The ground started to swell in late 1997, as magma began to pool about underground. Researchers ended up worried that the fountain of liquid magma was arousing, however examination of interferograms, or outlines of examples framed by wave impedance, uncovered that just little measures of disfigurement happened. A recent report deduced that the structure of interfering magma was basaltic or rhyolitic. A guide at the Lava Lands Visitor Center of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument south of Bend demonstrates the degree of the inspire, which achieves a limit of . In 2004, a tremor swarm happened with an epicenter in the zone of inspire; the many little quakes died down following a few days. As indicated by a recent report, this swarm may have started a critical decline in the pinnacle elevate rate, which dropped by 80ÃÂ percent after 2004. By 2007 the elevate had hindered, however the territory was as yet thought about possibly dynamic.
