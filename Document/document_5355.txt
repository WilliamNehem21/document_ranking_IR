Landward development of the shingle implied that the channel of the Glaven was getting to be blocked progressively regularly by 2004. This prompted flooding of Cley town and the ecologically vital Blakeney freshwater swamps. The Environment Agency thought about a few medicinal choices. It inferred that endeavoring to keep down the shingle or rupturing the spit to make another outlet for the Glaven would be costly and presumably ineffectual, and doing nothing would be ecologically harming. The Agency chose to make another course for the waterway toward the south of its unique line, and work to realign a 550ÃÂ m (600ÃÂ yd) stretch of stream 200ÃÂ m (220ÃÂ yd) further south was finished in 2007 at an expense of about ÃÂ£1.5ÃÂ million. The Glaven had recently been realigned from a before, progressively northerly, course in 1922. The remnants of Blakeney Chapel are presently toward the north of the waterway dike, and basically unprotected from beach front disintegration, since the propelling shingle will never again be cleared away by the stream. The house of prayer will be covered by an edge of shingle as the spit keeps on moving south, and afterward lost to the ocean, maybe inside 20Ã¢ÂÂ 30ÃÂ years.
