"Kaiser Karl der Grosse" took an interest in activities in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904, with her squadron from 8 to 17 March, and with the armada in the North Sea in May. In July, the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain, including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July. The German armada left on 13 July, destined for the Netherlands; the I Squadron moored in Vlissingen the next day, where the boats were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. Leaving on 20 July for a journey in the northern North Sea with the remainder of the armada, the squadron ceased in Molde, Norway, after nine days while different units went to different ports. The armada reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it led a counterfeit assault on the harbor on 12 August. Following coming back to Kiel, the armada started arrangements for the harvest time moves, which started on 29 August in the Baltic. The armada moved toward the North Sea on 3 September, where it partook in a noteworthy landing task, after which the boats took the ground troops from the IX Corps that partook in the activities to Altona for a procession for Wilhelm II. The boats at that point directed their own motorcade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. After three days, the armada came back to the Baltic by means of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it partook in further landing activities with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the moves arrived at an end. The I Squadron went on its winter preparing voyage, this opportunity toward the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.
