A few later investigations have raised the likelihood that the dinosaur was omnivorous and utilized its tusks for prey slaughtering amid an infrequent chase. In 2000, Paul Barrett proposed that the state of the premaxillary teeth and the fine serration of the tusks are reminiscent of flesh eating creatures, indicating facultative carnivory. Conversely, the muntjac needs serration on its tusks. In 2008, Butler and partners contended that the extended tusks framed right off the bat in the improvement of the individual, and along these lines couldn't establish sexual dimorphism. Battle with conspecifics accordingly is a far-fetched work, as broadened tusks would be normal just in guys in the event that they were an apparatus for battle. Rather, sustaining or guard capacities are more probable. It has additionally been proposed that "Heterodontosaurus" could have utilized its jugal supervisors to convey blows amid battle, and that the palpebral bone could have secured the eyes against such assaults. In 2011, Norman and associates attracted consideration regarding the arms and hands, which are moderately long and furnished with extensive, recurved paws. These highlights, in mix with the long hindlimbs that considered quick running, would have made the creature fit for catching little prey. As an omnivore, "Heterodontosaurus" would have had a huge determination advantage amid the dry season when vegetation was rare.
