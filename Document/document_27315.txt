Actress Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) criticized the early stories as boring and lacking intriguing content. She felt that early "Enterprise" scripts ignored basic tenets of "Star Trek" chronology, and offered "revealing costumes instead of character development". UPN executives stated that the male-oriented episodes of "Enterprise" did not mesh with the viewership of its other top shows, such as "Top Model" and "Veronica Mars". Brannon Braga suggested that the reason for the cancellation was viewer fatigue, noting that "after 18 years and 624 hours of "Star Trek", the audience began to have a little bit of overkill." Fans, meanwhile, criticized Berman and Braga for ignoring "Star Trek" canon and refusing to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news coordinator for SyFy Portal, stated that in addition to the oversaturation of "Star Trek", there "also is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't sit back and say, 'You know, we just can't keep this fresh.' No, it was more about their stupid egos, and their nonsensical 'Even if it's broke, don't fix it' attitude." Braga defended the series, noting that "The Next Generation" faced little competition from other science fiction shows, while "Enterprise" had to contend with a plethora of shows such as "Battlestar Galactica".
