Lihau went to the UniversitÃÂ© catholique de Louvain in Belgium with the assistance of thoughtful Jesuit instructors, getting to be one of the primary Congolese to examine law. While there he urged Congolese government officials to shape a partnership that enabled them to verify the freedom of the Congo from Belgium. He served quickly as an equity authority and moderator for the Congolese focal government before being selected to lead a commission to draft a perpetual national constitution. He was made dignitary of law staff at Lovanium University in 1963. The next year he conveyed the Luluabourg Constitution to the Congolese, which was embraced by choice. In 1965 Joseph-DesirÃÂ© Mobutu caught all out control of the nation and coordinated Lihau to create another constitution. After three years Lihau was designated First President of the new Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo. He held the position, supporting for legal autonomy, until 1975 when he would not constrain a brutal sentence upon understudy dissidents. Lihau was summarily expelled from his post by Mobutu and put under house capture. Winding up progressively contradicted to the administration, he helped found the change situated Union pour la DÃÂ©mocratie et le ProgrÃÂ¨s Social. Mobutu reacted by suspending his rights and banishing him to a country town.
