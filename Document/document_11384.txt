In 1839, "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" was overhauled and republished as "Diary of a Six Weeks' Tour" and "Letters from Geneva" in "Papers, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments, by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edited by Mrs. Shelley" (1840). In spite of the fact that these works were not by her significant other, she chose to incorporate them since they were "a piece of his life", as she disclosed to her companion Leigh Hunt. She added her initials to the attempts to demonstrate her initiation. As Moskal clarifies, "the solidarity of the 1817 volume as a volume was broken up" to clear path for a life story of Percy Shelley. After Percy Shelley suffocated in 1822, his dad prohibited Mary Shelley from composing a diary or memoir of the writer. She along these lines added noteworthy personal notification to the altered accumulations of his works. The 1840 adaptation of "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" has four noteworthy kinds of changes as indicated by Moskal: "(I) modernization and adjustment of spelling, accentuation and French (ii) self-removing from the familial association with Claire Clairmont (iii) an elevated affectability to national personality (iv) introduction of the explorers as a composition, just as perusing, circle". Because of these changes, a greater amount of Percy Shelley's composing was incorporated into the 1840 variant than in the 1817 form. In 1845, Mary Shelley distributed a one-volume release with extra minor changes, in light of the 1840 adaptation.
