Various weaknesses in arranging and execution added to the catastrophe endured by the Confederates. The Confederate unit pioneers performed well, except for a couple of minor cases; Burton derives that the fault of July 1 must lie with the general authorities. Longstreet was arrogant about the big guns procedure, which demonstrated less viable than it could have been generally a result of issues assembling the cannons for the strike. The Confederate routine with regards to moving big guns with individual units rather than in one mass and the troublesome territory encompassing Malvern Hill added to this issue. A potential answer for this issue lay with Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton's fourteen batteries for possible later use. Notwithstanding, Lee's base camp never reached Pendleton, who spent July 1 "await[ing] occasions and requests, in preparation for whatever administration may be required." These requests never came, and Pendleton's batteries went unused. Magruder may likewise partake in the fault; his late entry to the war zone was brought about by awful maps and defective aides. Since Magruder got Chilton's draft late in the day, and with no time appended to it, there was no chance to get for him to decide the pertinence of the request. Burton recommends that Magruder can't be sensibly accused for his assaults on the Union line: he was reacting to Lee's requests and did at first attempt to frame a brought together assault on the Union line. At last, Magruder was riding forward and backward over the combat zone, making it troublesome for him to be found by junior officers looking for direction. A few different elements may have played into the Confederate rebuff, including Theophilus Holmes' refusal to take an interest in the fight, rejecting any thought of effectively captivating the foe.
