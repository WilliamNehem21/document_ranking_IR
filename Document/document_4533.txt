In 2005, following a hundred years of disregard, a piece of the Mare aux Songes swamp was unearthed by a global group of analysts (International Dodo Research Project). To avert intestinal sickness, the British had secured the marsh with no-nonsense amid their standard over Mauritius, which must be evacuated. Many remains were discovered, including bones of no less than 17 dodos in different phases of development (however no adolescents), and a few bones clearly from the skeleton of one individual winged animal, which have been safeguarded in their normal position. These discoveries were made open in December 2005 in the Naturalis exhibition hall in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the marsh had a place with turtles of the wiped out sort "Cylindraspis", and 7.1% had a place with dodos, which had been saved inside a few centuries, 4,000 years back. Consequent unearthings proposed that dodos and different creatures ended up buried in the Mare aux Songes while attempting to achieve water amid an extensive stretch of extreme dry spell around 4,200 years back. Moreover, cyanobacteria flourished in the conditions made by the waste products of creatures accumulated around the bog, which passed on of inebriation, drying out, trampling, and soiling. In spite of the fact that numerous little skeletal components were found amid the ongoing unearthings of the bog, few were found amid the nineteenth century, most likely inferable from the work of less refined strategies when gathering.
