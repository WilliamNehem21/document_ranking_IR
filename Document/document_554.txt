The American military foundation emphatically upheld DiÃ¡Â»Âm. Colonel Edward Lansdale, a CIA specialist who dug in DiÃ¡Â»Âm in power in 1955, criticized Durbrow's remarks and approached the Eisenhower organization to review the diplomat. Lansdale said that "It is most suspicious that Ambassador Durbrow has any close to home stature remaining. DiÃ¡Â»Âm must feel that Durbrow agreed with the renegades inwardly. Maybe he feels that Durbrow's comments throughout the months prompted the revolt." Lansdale reprimanded Durbrow: "At the most basic snapshot of the upset, the U.S. Minister encouraged DiÃ¡Â»Âm to surrender to revolt requests to dodge slaughter." Lieutenant General Lionel McGarr, the new administrator of the Military Assistance Advisory Group, concurred with Lansdale. McGarr had been in contact with both the renegade and follower units amid the standoff and attributed the disappointment of the upset to the "fearless activity of DiÃ¡Â»Âm combined with dependability and adaptability of administrators bringing troops into Saigon". McGarr declared that "DiÃ¡Â»Âm has risen up out of this extreme test in position of more noteworthy quality with obvious evidence of true help behind him both in military and regular citizen populace." General Lyman Lemnitzer, the director of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said that "When you have defiant powers against you, you need to act coercively and not limit your companions. The central matter is that occasionally gore can't be maintained a strategic distance from and that people with significant influence must act conclusively." The State Department prompted President Dwight David Eisenhower to send DiÃ¡Â»Âm a salutary message, however Durbrow questioned, contending that DiÃ¡Â»Âm would decipher the message as an inadequate support of his standard and keep him from "getting a handle on and noticing exercises of [the] upset".
