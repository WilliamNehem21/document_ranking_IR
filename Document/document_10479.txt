The sex exercises, Rykener clarified, were so that Brouderer could give her little girl, Alice, to men around evening time, while it was dull so they couldn't see her. Alice would then abandon her customer before sunrise, and Brouderer would tell the man that he had laid down with Rykener. Rykener would be available before the customer, wearing ladies' garments and called Eleanor by Brouderer. One of the men Rykener engaged in sexual relations with in Brouderer's home was the Rector of Theydon Garnon, called Philip. In the wake of engaging in sexual relations with the Rector, Rykener stole two outfits from him. The last surrendered attempting to recover his property when Rykener revealed to Philip that Rykener was the spouse of an imperative man in the city. This would have constrained the Rector to sue Rykener's alleged spouse in court for the arrival of Philip's property. Brouderer's thought processes in utilizing of Rykener along these lines have been the subject of theory among researchers. John Roxeth, thinking about Brouderer's treatment of Rector Philip, has recommended that she utilized Rykener to extort men, in spite of the fact that he doesn't extrapolate on the mechanics of her doing as such. Roxeth's hypothesis isn't generally acknowledged; Jeremy Goldberg, for example, noticed Roxeth's recommendation without remarking on its likelihood, while Ruth Karras considers Rykener to have simply been undermined in the standard design.
