On 29 September 1946 Boult led Britten's new "Celebration Overture", to initiate the BBC Third Program. For this imaginative social channel, Boult was worried in spearheading adventures including the British debut of Mahler's Third Symphony. "The Times" later said of this period, "The Third Program couldn't in any way, shape or form have had the extension which made it world-popular musically without Boult." Nevertheless, Boult's BBC days were numbered. When he was named in 1930, Reith had casually guaranteed him that would be absolved from the BBC's standard that staff must resign at age 60. Be that as it may, Reith had left the BBC in 1938 and his guarantee conveyed no weight with his successors. In 1948 Steuart Wilson was selected head of music at the BBC, the post recently involved by Boult and Bliss. He made it obvious from the beginning of his arrangement that he planned that Boult ought to be supplanted as boss conductor, and he utilized his power to demand Boult's implemented retirement. The executive general of the BBC at the time, Sir William Haley, was ignorant of Wilson's enmity against Boult and later recognized, in a communicate tribute to Boult, that he "had tuned in to badly passed judgment on counsel in resigning him." By the season of his retirement in 1950, Boult had made 1,536 communicates.
