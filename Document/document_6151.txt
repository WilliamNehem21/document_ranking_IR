The families challenged the administration's case, charging that the legislature had contrived to slaughter the three; that the arranging and control of the activity was defective; that the examination was not satisfactorily prepared to explore the killings; and that the relevant laws of Gibraltar were not agreeable with Article 2 of the ECHR.
