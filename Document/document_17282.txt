In 1927, Barrymore planned to revive "Hamlet" at the Hollywood Bowl, but in August he canceled the production, without explanation, and began filming the third of the UA pictures, "Eternal Love", for which he was paid $150,000. In February 1928, Barrymore obtained a quiet divorce from Oelrichs; she eagerly agreed to the separation, as she was in a relationship with a lawyer, Harrison Tweed, whom she later married. Barrymore and Costello married in November that year; their daughter, Dolores, was born in April 1930 and a son, John Drew Barrymore, followed in June 1932. Barrymore purchased and converted an estate in the Hollywood Hills into 16 different buildings with 55 rooms, gardens, skeet ranges, swimming pools, fountains and a totem pole.
By the late 1920s, sound films had become common, following the 1927 sensation, "The Jazz Singer". Actors with trained voices were in demand by the studios, and Barrymore was offered a five-film deal with Warner Bros. at $150,000 per picture, and a share of the profits. Before he began this contract, he played his first speaking role on film: a one-off section in "The Show of Shows" (1929), playing Richard, Duke of Gloucester in "Henry VI, Part 3". His first two films under contract were "General Crack" and "The Man from Blankley's", each of which were modestly successful. As he had been frustrated at the inability of making "The Sea Beast" as a sound film, Barrymore returned to "Moby Dick" as the source for a 1930 film of the same name. Peters thinks little of the film, describing it as "a seesaw between the cosmic and the comic, a travesty of Melville as well as a silly film all on its own".
