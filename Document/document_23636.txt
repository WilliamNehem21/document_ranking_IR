Brand's failure to return to Budapest was a disaster for the Aid and Rescue Committee. On 27 May Hansi Brand, who at some point during this period had become Kasztner's lover, was arrested and beaten by the Hungarian Arrow Cross. Kasztner wrote that on 9 June Eichmann told him: "If I do not receive a positive reply within three days, I shall operate the mill at Auschwitz" (""die Muehle laufen lasse""). During his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, Eichmann denied having said this to Kastner. He told the court that he did not have the authority to stop or start what was happening in Auschwitz, or to change the deal. The order from Berlin had said: "Deportations will continue in the meanwhile and will not be stopped until Joel Brand returns with a statement to the effect that these matters have been accepted by the Jewish organizations abroad." Hansi Brand told Claude Lanzman in 1979:
WeÂ ... [lived] between fear and despair and hope. And that formed itself into such a heap of stuff, that I can't really describe itÂ â how it was and what it was. Every evening, we went to pieces and during the night, we tried to build ourselves up again, so we could go into the streetÂ ... and look like human beings againÂ ... And [it] was like being in a windmill; it turned and moved.
