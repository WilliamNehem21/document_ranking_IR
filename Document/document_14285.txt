Subsequent to leaving the NOI, ClarenceÃÂ 13X and JohnÃÂ 37X kept on examining the gathering's lessons, in some cases while smoking cannabis. They expected new names: ClarenceÃÂ 13X took Allah, and JohnÃÂ 37X, Abu Shahid. Subsequent to perusing a NOI book with 34 questions, known as the "Lost-Found Lessons", JohnÃÂ 37X presumed that numbers spoke to explicit ideas, for example, information or shrewdness. He alluded to this framework as "living arithmetic". Amid its advancement, he was detained on guns charges. While JohnÃÂ 37X was in jail, ClarenceÃÂ 13X trained an arrangement of convictions he alluded to as "incomparable intelligence", which he saw as the center of Islam, to gatherings of young fellows. He was helped by his companion James Howard, with whom he built up an adjusted adaptation of living science, "preeminent arithmetic", and a going with tenet about letters, the "incomparable letters in order". The improvement of these frameworks, considered a "divine science" by followers, may have been affected by the lessons of Sufism; like a few schools of Sufism, they found recondite implications in the letter set. David Smydra of "The Boston Globe" looks at these lessons to Kabbalah; Felicia Miyakawa of Middle Tennessee State University sees likenesses to Gnosticism and Kemetism.
