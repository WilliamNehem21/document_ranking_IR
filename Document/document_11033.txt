Clarke investigates the points of confinement of "English" enchantment through the characters of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke clarifies, "On the off chance that you put a pixie beside an individual who is additionally outside English societyÃÂ ...ÃÂ suddenly the way that there is this outsider race appears to be increasingly trustworthy, in light of the fact that you have another outsider and both of them can discuss the English in this normal way." The man of honor with the thorn down hair considers Stephen to be a respectable savage and oppresses himÃ¢ÂÂlike Lady Pole, Stephen is quieted. Both "endure under a hushing spell that imitates holes in the chronicled record". Moreover, the man of his word's craving to secure Stephen for his moving corridor is reminiscent of the English typification of dark slaves. Stephen promises to abhor all white Englishmen after he finds that they oppressed his mom, however when the respectable man demonstrates to him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he sobs. Both Strange and Norrell see the embodiment of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by pixies and couldn't communicate in English. As Elizabeth Hoiem clarifies, "The most English of all Englishmen, at that point, is both lord and slave, from multiple points of view indistinct from Stephen Black. This Catch 22 is the thing that eventually settle the plot. Whenever Strange and Norrell call 'the anonymous slave', the Raven King's incredible unions with nature are exchanged to Stephen Black, enabling Stephen to execute the Gentleman and free himself from servitude." In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are caught in everlasting dimness while the quieted ladies, ethnic minorities, and poor whites rout the rival.
