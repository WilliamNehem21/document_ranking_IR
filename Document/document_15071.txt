The "national legions" were attached to the "Waffen-SS", and fought on the Eastern Front in 1942 and early 1943. Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into "SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland", authorised by Hitler at the end of 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the "Freikorps Danemark", Legion "Niederlande" and Legion "Norwegen", supplemented by transfers from "SS-Division Wiking", new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion "Flandern" was broken up and used as replacements in a number of "Waffen-SS" formations. While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism, the historian George C. Stein observes that few of the "national legion" recruits were motivated by "political or ideological idealism", but were instead motivated by such factors as a desire for adventure, better food, the prestige of the uniform, and personal circumstances. According to Stein, Berger had no illusions about the motives of his West European recruits, but paid mere lip service to the idea that they joined the "anti-communist" cause out of idealism. Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the "Waffen-SS". However, by mid-1942 onwards, the "Waffen-SS" faced increasing difficulties with these "Germanic" recruits, especially due to the policy of integrating them into "pan-Germanic" formations such as "SS-Division Wiking". For example, Norwegian recruits began requesting their release from duty, and at the beginning of 1943, nearly the entire Finnish battalion of that division asked to be released from their service obligations.
