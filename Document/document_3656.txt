A few extensions over the Sava were blown before all components of the seventh and eighth Border Regiments had pulled back, yet a few warriors had the capacity to swim over, the rest being caught by the propelling Germans. German watches achieved the Drava at Ptuj, and further east at OrmoÃÂ¾ they found the extension had been blown. Components of the XXXXIX Mountain Corps had pushed forward to Poljana and Dravograd. The German troops got close air support from plunge aircraft and warriors amid their development, while medium planes hit focuses all through the seventh Army zone. The fourth Fighter Regiment conflicted a few times with German flying machine on 8 April without result. Three Blenheims of the Yugoslav eighth Bomber Regiment again flew a mission to assault an objective in southern Austria, escorted by fourth Fighter Regiment Hurricanes, however the remainder of the eighth Bomber Regiment was anticipating requests to bomb a revolting Yugoslav regiment of the neighboring fourth Army in Bjelovar; the requests were in this way dropped. Amid the day, the Italian third Alpine Group caught Kranjska Gora at the headwaters of the Sava in the division of Mountain Detachment "Triglavski". The German requests for the next day were for LI Infantry Corps to constrain an intersection of the Drava close Varazdin and advance on Zagreb, while XXXXIX Mountain Corps were to drive towards Celje.
