De Gray's capacity to fund-raise made him valuable to John. In 1213 de Gray marshaled 500ÃÂ knights amid a period when Philip II was taking steps to attack England, bringing this power over from Ireland alongside mounted men-at-arms to help the ruler in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent at long last settled the disagreement about Langton's race to Canterbury, and part of the settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and got them once again from the pope, making John an ecclesiastical vassal. The settlement was fixed with a bargain, to which de Gray was one of the observers. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray was excluded in the general exculpation, and needed to go to Rome to be absolved. While in that city the priest was named as one of the underwriters of another money related plan between the lord and the pope managing medieval installments from England, which brought down the singular amount that must be paid before Innocent would lift the prohibit. After Innocent exculpated de Gray, the pope prescribed his decision as Bishop of Durham in 1213; yet de Gray kicked the bucket amid his voyage back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'AngÃÂ©ly in Poitou. He was covered in Norwich Cathedral, yet his tomb has not endure.
