Except for the pinnacle and tower, a significant part of the congregation was remade in the Decorated Gothic style amid the late fourteenth century; Pevsner contended that Sleaford was among those Lincolnshire chapels which exhibit that "For the enhanced style, Lincolnshire is the best area of all". The nave and paths broaden eastwards from the pinnacle. Outside, portions of the paths are exceedingly brightened; the north entryway incorporates shafts, moldings and finials, while the less difficult south entryway has specialties and beast carvings. The northern entryway has a peak which infringes up into a five-light window. Pevsner comments that St Denys' is especially remarkable for its tracery, including that "it is a delayed pleasure to pursue the bricklayer's imagination along the structure". The congregation's entrance on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest additionally takes note of its "especially great mid [14th-century] tracery and trimming". The window over the north entryway is a genuine model; it contains components shared by others of the Decorated style around the congregation, including reticulated ogee curves of differing multifaceted nature. The north transept incorporates a six-light windowÃ¢ÂÂ"one of the incredible streaming structures of the nation", as indicated by Pevsner, Harris and Antram. Simon Jenkins, in his 2012 "Britain's Thousand Best Churches", grants St Denys three stars and says of the window tracery: "This is Lincolnshire at its most well proportioned, best showed in the north transept north window. Words can scarcely do equity to this work... This is a work of limitless multifaceted nature, with varieties rehashed all through the congregation."
