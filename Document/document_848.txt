Over the next years, the Tasmanian and Victorian groups played a few matches. An arrival coordinate was masterminded nearly on the double. In February 1852, nine Tasmanians went to Melbourne and, fortified by three men from Launceston who were occupant in Melbourne, were vanquished by the Victoria group by 61 keeps running at the Melbourne Cricket Club ground. A "choosing diversion", played two years after the fact at Launceston, was won by Tasmania, yet the Victorians just conveyed eight players and needed to go through nearby players to both make the numbers and to go about as the group scorer. The Tasmanians were captained for the last time in top of the line cricket by John Marshall, who was 58 years of age at this point and had showed up as commander in each of the three amusements between the provinces. In mid 1858, a Victorian group came back to Tasmania and played two matches, the two of which were later perceived as five star. In one, they vanquished a group from Launceston, fortified by four cricketers from southern Tasmania; they at that point beat a group from Hobart, made just out of southern Tasmanians. Albeit the two thrashings were substantial, the prominence of these amusements in Tasmania legitimately prompted the arrangement of another club, which later turned into the Southern Tasmanian Cricket Association; it started to compose and create cricket in Tasmania. By and by, the Victorians were neutral by the cricket of the Tasmanians, and their powerlessness to adapt to roundarm quick bowling; the groups did not contend with one another consistently for a long time. Tasmanian cricket stayed less created than that in the remainder of Australia until at any rate the 1880s and neglected to keep pace with changes in the diversion.
