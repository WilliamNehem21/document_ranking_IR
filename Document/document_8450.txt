ILM conveyed the primary "Undertaking" display, which was worked by Magicam in 1978 for "", to Associates and Ferren. Be that as it may, scenes which incorporated the "Undertaking" in the Earth-circling Spacedock stage, just as the Spacedock itself, were taken straightforwardly from ILM's past work in "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home". The "Endeavor" display had been harmed when it was credited out for visiting purposes, which means the 30,000 boards on the model must be repainted by hand. While creation wrapped, Ferren proceeded with work on the miniatures and other optical impacts at his New Jersey studio. The opticals were finished in Manhattan before being sent west; for instance, bluescreen film of the movement controlled miniatures was shot in Hoboken, New Jersey. In New York, the blue screen was supplanted by a moving starfieldÃ¢ÂÂa solitary completed shot of a ship traveling through space required upwards of fifty bits of film. The Great Barrier impacts were made utilizing synthetic concoctions, which were dropped into a vast water tank to make whirls and different responses. The "God segment", in which the bogus god showed up, was made by a quickly pivoting barrel through which light was shone; the outcome showed up on film as a section of light. Ferren utilized a shaft splitter to extend on-screen character George Murdock's head into the chamber, giving the appearance that the bogus god lived inside the section.
