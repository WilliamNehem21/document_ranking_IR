In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100Â m freestyle at the Australian Championships, clocking a time of 51.12Â s. He then combined with Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100Â m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100Â m freestyle in a time of 51.01Â s. He claimed gold in the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.
