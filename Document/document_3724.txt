Somewhere in the range of 13:20 and 14:15, the second and third floods of U.S. airplane assaulted, focusing on "Yamato". Amid this time, "Yamato" was hit by no less than eight torpedoes and up to 15 bombs. The bombs did broad harm to the topside of the ship, including thumping out capacity to the weapon executives and driving the counter airplane firearms to be separately and physically pointed and discharged, enormously diminishing their adequacy. The torpedo hitsÃ¢ÂÂpractically all on the port sideÃ¢ÂÂcaused "Yamato" to list enough that overturning was presently an inescapable peril. The water harm control station had been demolished by a bomb hit making it difficult to counter-flood the exceptionally planned spaces inside the ship's frame to check structure harm. At 13:33, in an edgy endeavor to shield the ship from overturning, "Yamato"s harm control group counter-overwhelmed both starboard motor and engine compartments. This alleviated the peril yet in addition suffocated the few hundred crew members keeping an eye on those stations, who were given no notice that their compartments were going to load up with water. The loss of the starboard motorsÃ¢ÂÂin addition to the heaviness of the waterÃ¢ÂÂcaused "Yamato" to ease back to about . At that equivalent minute, the Americans propelled another 110 air ship from Task Group 58. Twenty Avengers made another torpedo keep running from 60 degrees to port. Yamato began a sharp swing to port however three torpedoes tore into her port side amidships, sticking her assistant rudder in position hard port.
