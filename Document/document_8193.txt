Zhang Heng's water-fueled armillary circle effectsly affected Chinese space science and mechanical building in later ages. His model and its perplexing utilization of riggings extraordinarily affected the water-fueled instruments of later stargazers, for example, Yi Xing (683Ã¢ÂÂ 727), Zhang Sixun (fl.ÃÂ 10thÃÂ century), Su Song (1020Ã¢ÂÂ 1101), Guo Shoujing (1231Ã¢ÂÂ 1316), and numerous others. Water-fueled armillary circles in the convention of Zhang Heng's were utilized in the periods of the Three Kingdoms (220Ã¢ÂÂ 280) and Jin Dynasty (265Ã¢ÂÂ 420), yet the plan for it was incidentally out of utilization somewhere in the range of 317 and 418, because of intrusions of northern Xiongnu wanderers. Zhang Heng's old instruments were recouped in 418, when Emperor Wu of Liu Song (r.ÃÂ 420Ã¢ÂÂ 422) caught the old capital of Chang'an. Albeit still flawless, the graduation marks and the portrayals of the stars, Moon, Sun, and planets were very worn out by time and rust. In 436, the head requested Qian Luozhi, the Secretary of the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar, to reproduce Zhang's gadget, which he figured out how to do effectively. Qian's water-controlled heavenly globe was still being used at the season of the Liang Dynasty (502Ã¢ÂÂ 557), and progressive models of water-fueled armillary circles were structured in ensuing traditions.
