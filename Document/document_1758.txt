Music scholars opine that "Ride the Lightning" displayed more prominent melodic development, with sonically more extensive tunes than "Murder Them All", which was noted for its one-dimensional sound. This was in part due to bassist Cliff Burton's information of music hypothesis. He told Hetfield the best way to expand center notes with integral counter-tunes and how fundamental guitar amicability functioned, which considered the melody arrangements. Hetfield grew all the more socially mindful verses, just as dismal and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich clarified that Metallica picked not to depend carefully on quick rhythms as on the past collection, however to investigate other melodic methodologies that sounded amazing and overwhelming. "Processor" magazine's Kevin Fisher outlined the collection as "extreme whip, obliteration and complete haze" that helped him to remember the speed and intensity of "Execute Them All". Music columnist Martin Popoff saw that "Ride the Lightning" offered "refinement and ruthlessness in equivalent measure" and was viewed as something new at the season of its discharge. Talking about the collection's expressive substance, scholar William Irwin stated: "After "Slaughter Them All", the resistance and hostility turned out to be significantly more engaged as the foe turned out to be all the more unmistakably characterized. Metallica was profoundly worried about different spaces in which the normal man was improperly yet cunningly misled. All the more definitely, they were exceedingly reproachful of people with significant influence".
