Gordon-Cumming was expelled from the military on 10 June 1891, the day after the case shut, and he surrendered his participation of his four London clubs: the Carlton, Guards', Marlborough and Turf. In spite of the fact that he offered to break his commitment for a second time, he wedded his American beneficiary life partner that day; she had remained by him all through the outrage and the couple proceeded to have five kids together. He resigned to his Scottish home and his property in Dawlish, Devon. He never reemerged society and the sovereign "declined to meet any individual who hereafter recognized the Scottish baronet". The pioneer in "The Times" expressed that "He isÃÂ ... denounced by the decision of the jury to social termination. His splendid record is cleared out and he should, in a manner of speaking, start life once more. Such is the unyielding social ruleÃÂ ... He has submitted a human offense. Society can know him not any more." None of Gordon-Cumming's dear companions addressed him once more, albeit some yielded after Edward's passing in 1910; Gordon-Cumming stayed angry about the occasions until his demise in 1930. Clarke held his confidence in his customer and, in his 1918 diaries, composed that "I trust the decision wasn't right, and that Sir William Gordon-Cumming was guiltless".
