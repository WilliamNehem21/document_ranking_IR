In "Marooned", a youthful sailor (called "The Sea Captain") voyages to caution the place where he grew up of the happening to "The Black Freighter", after he endures the demolition of his own ship. He utilizes the collections of his dead shipmates as a stopgap pontoon. When he at last returns home, trusting it to be as of now under the control of "The Black Freighter"s team, he murders a guiltless couple and after that assaults his own better half in their obscured home, confusing her with a privateer. In the wake of acknowledging what he has done, he comes back to the seashore, where he finds that "The Black Freighter" has not come to guarantee the town; it has come to guarantee him. He swims out to ocean and trips on board the ship. As per Richard Reynold, the sailor is "constrained by the direness of his main goal to shed one hindrance after another." Just like Adrian Veidt, he "would like to fight off calamity by utilizing the dead collections of his previous companions as a methods for achieving his objective". Moore expressed that the tale of "The Black Freighter" winds up explicitly depicting "the account of Adrian Veidt" and that it can likewise be utilized as a contrast to different pieces of the story, for example, Rorschach's catch and Dr. Manhattan's self-banish on Mars.
