"Schlesien" presented with the High Seas Fleet through the initial two years of the war. At the episode of the contention, the ship was sent to monitor the German Bight. She at that point rejoined the High Seas Fleet to help the battlecruisers that assaulted Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on 15Ã¢ÂÂ 16 December 1914. Amid the activity, the German fight armada of 12 gunboats and 8 pre-battleships came to inside of a segregated squadron of six British war vessels. Encounters between the opponent destroyer screens persuaded Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl that he was faced with the whole Grand Fleet, thus he severed the commitment and returned home. Two pointless armada propels pursued on 17Ã¢ÂÂ 18 and 21Ã¢ÂÂ 23 April 1915. Another pursued on 17Ã¢ÂÂ 18 May, and another on 23Ã¢ÂÂ 24 October. In March 1916, "Schlesien" was utilized as an objective ship for U-water crafts. On 24Ã¢ÂÂ 25 April, "Schlesien" and her sisters joined the gunboats of the High Seas Fleet to help the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group on a strike of the English coast. While on the way to the objective, the battlecruiser was harmed by a mine. The rest of the battlecruisers directed a short siege of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The objective's perceivability was poor, so the task was before long canceled before the British armada could intercede. Squadron practices in the Baltic pursued from 11 to 22 May.
