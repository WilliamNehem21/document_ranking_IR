The F-111 program experienced huge issues amid the late 1960s. Because of deferrals to the advancement of the RF-111 observation variation of the F-111, of which Australia had requested four, the RAAF considered acquiring eight RF-4C or RF-4E surveillance flying machine and two tankers in mid 1968. The Air Force and government in the long run reasoned that it was too soon to settle on a choice on this issue, and no move was made. The RAAF acknowledged each of the 24 F-111Cs at a function held at Fort Worth, Texas, on 4ÃÂ September 1968. As of now the F-111 program was in emergency inferable from specialized issues with the plan of the flying machine's wing get together, and all F-111s were grounded after an American F-111 smashed on 23ÃÂ September. Consequent testing uncovered further issues with F-111 segments not meeting their expected life expectancy, and the Australian airplane were set away at Fort Worth until these imperfections could be redressed. The RAAF in this manner assessed the F-4E PhantomÃÂ II, Blackburn Buccaneer, LTV A-7 Corsair II and Grumman A-6 Intruder as conceivable trades for the F-111. Just the F-4E was considered to verge on meeting the RAAF's prerequisites, however its moderately short range and absence of landscape following radar and electronic countermeasures were viewed as risky.
