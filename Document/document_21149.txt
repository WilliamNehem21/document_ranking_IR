The main story consisted of 11 parts running through the "Green Lantern" and "Green Lantern Corps" books. Expanding upon the overall story are four one-shots labeled "Tales of the Sinestro Corps", as well as one tie-in with "Blue Beetle" #20. Part One, the one-shot "Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special" #1, was released in June 2007. Parts Two through Ten were released between August and December, alternating between "Green Lantern" #21â25 and "Green Lantern Corps" #14â18, with an epilogue in "Green Lantern" #26. The content of "Green Lantern Corps" #19 was changed to illustrate the battle between Sodam Yat and Superman-Prime in response to the fans' reaction to the story. Geoff Johns announced in October 2007 that the conclusion "Green Lantern" #25 would be delayed two weeks. After the storyline concluded, "Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files and Origins" #1 was released in December. The issue further explored the back story of the opposing groups and listed every member of the Green Lantern Corps and Sinestro Corps.
There was much internal discussion at DC about how the storyline would be collected. Eventually DC decided to release two hardcover volumes (a February 2008 release containing the first five parts of the story and a June 2008 release containing the last six issues) and a June 2008 hardcover collecting the tie-in issues and backstories. This follows DC Comics' recent trend of releasing durable hardcover collections initially, followed later by softcovers.
