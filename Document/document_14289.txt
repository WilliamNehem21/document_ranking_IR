Charles Rosen, in a section on Mendelssohn in his 1995 book "The Romantic Generation", the two acclaims and censures the author. He calls him "the best tyke wonder the historical backdrop of Western music has ever known", whose order at age 16 outperformed that of Mozart or Chopin at 19, the owner at an early age of a "control of extensive scale structure superb by any author of his age", and a "virtuoso" with a "significant" appreciation of Beethoven. Rosen trusts that in the author's later years, without losing his specialty or virtuoso, he "renouncedÃÂ ... his challenging"; yet he calls Mendelssohn's generally late Violin Concerto in E minor "the best union of the Classical concerto convention and the Romantic virtuoso structure". Rosen considers the "Fugue in E minor" (later incorporated into Mendelssohn's Op. 35 for piano) a "perfect work of art"; yet in a similar section calls Mendelssohn "the innovator of religious kitsch in music". By the by, he calls attention to how the emotional intensity of "the crossroads of religion and music" in Mendelssohn's oratorios is reflected all through the music of the following fifty years in the musical shows of Meyerbeer and Giuseppe Verdi and in Wagner's "Parsifal".
