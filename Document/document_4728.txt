Since his demise, McCay's unique work of art has been inadequately saved; much was wrecked in a late-1930s house fire, and more was sold off when the McCays required cash. About 400ÃÂ original illustrations from the film have been protected, found by artist Robert Brotherton in chaos in the texture shop of Irving Mendelsohn, into whose care McCay's movies and work of art had been depended during the 1940s. Other than some cels from "The Sinking of the Lusitania", these "Gertie" illustrations are the main unique liveliness work of art of McCay's to have endure. McCay annihilated a considerable lot of his unique jars of film to make more extra room. Of what he kept, much has not made due, as it was captured on 35mm nitrate film, which break down and is exceptionally combustible away. A couple of youthful artists found the film in 1947 and safeguarded what they could. As a rule no one but sections could be spared, on the off chance that anything by any stretch of the imagination. Of the majority of McCay's movies, "Gertie" is the best saved. Mendelsohn and Brotherton attempted vainly to discover an organization to store McCay's movies until the Canadian film center the CinÃÂ©mathÃÂ¨que quÃÂ©bÃÂ©coise moved toward them in 1967 on the event of that year's World Animation Film Exposition in Montreal. The CinÃÂ©mathÃÂ¨que quÃÂ©bÃÂ©coise has since curated McCay's movies. Of the enduring illustrations, fifteen have been resolved not to show up in surviving duplicates of the film. They seem to originate from a solitary arrangement, likely at the end of the film, and have Gertie demonstrating her head from the gathering of people's privilege and giving a bow.
