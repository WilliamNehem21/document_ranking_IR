Three large islets make up the bulk of Caroline's land area: Nake Islet (1.04Â km or 0.40Â mi) at the north; Long Islet (0.76Â km or 0.29Â mi) at the northeast of the lagoon and South Islet (1.07Â km or 0.41Â mi).
The remaining assembly of small islets, most of which were named during the 1988 ecological survey, conducted by Angela and Cameron Kepler, fall into four major groupings: the South Nake Islets, the Central Leeward Islets, the Southern Leeward Islets, and the Windward Islets (see ). Caroline's islets are particularly ephemeralâ over the course of a century of observation, several of the smallest islets have been documented to appear or disappear entirely following major storms, while the shapes of larger ones have significantly changed.
The central lagoon, roughly , is shallow â at most in depth â and is crossed repeatedly by narrow coral heads and patch reefs. Reef flats generally extend about from shoreâ although some sources report them to extend more than a kilometer from landâ and make boat landings perilous except at high tide. There are no natural landings, anchorages, or deep water openings into the central lagoon; water which spills into the lagoon over shallow channels at high tide is contained within the surrounding reef and remains stable despite ocean tides. Most landings are generally made at a small break in the reef at the northeast corner of the South Islet (visible on the satellite photo above).
