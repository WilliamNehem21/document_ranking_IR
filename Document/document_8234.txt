The ongoing interaction was likewise praised; the "GamePro" survey guaranteed that ""Dungeon Siege"s interactivity is maybe its greatest and most straightforward improvement over past titles in the class." Several commentators contrasted it positively with "Diablo II" (2000), at that point a standout amongst the most well known PC activity pretending diversions, with Adams of IGN asserting that it was fundamentally the same as "Diablo II" with certain progressions and enhancements, and Coffey of "PC Gaming World" expressing that the main thing shielding it from being legitimately appraised as better was that the move to an increasingly strategic interactivity made it excessively unique of an amusement to straightforwardly look at. "PC Gamer"s Vederman, "PC Gaming World"s Coffey, and the GameSpot analyst commended the interactivity as being streamlined and available; they preferred the strategic idea of controlling a gathering of explorers who improved by how they were utilized instead of legitimately controlling their activities and measurements. IGN's Adams, in any case, said that the interactivity could get dull, Vederman of "PC Gamer" felt that the ongoing interaction battle decisions were to some degree constrained, and GameSpy's Suciu detested the linearity of the single-player diversion. Adams further included that a significant number of the strategic decisions in the diversion were irrelevant, as all fights immediately lapsed into fights, and that the freestyle arrangement of leveling was basically equivalent to four character classes as seeking after numerous tracks was incapable.
