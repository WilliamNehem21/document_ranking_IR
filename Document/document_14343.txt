The unranked gathering "Isostylis", with its one species, was renamed as an area in the 1856 course of action of Carl Meissner, and 1870 game plan of George Bentham. In his 1981 correction of the variety, Alex George renamed the gathering as a subgenusÃ¢ÂÂ"Banksia" subg. "Isostylis"Ã¢ÂÂ characterized by the arch formed bloom heads, with "B.ÃÂ ilicifolia" joined by recently depicted species "B.ÃÂ cuneata" and later "B.ÃÂ oligantha". "Banksia ilicifolia" is the main normal individual from that subgenus; the two different species are uncommon and undermined, and are secured under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Connections among "B.ÃÂ ilicifolia" and different individuals from "B."ÃÂ subg. "Isostylis" still stay indistinct. In spite of the fact that DNA examines discovered "B.ÃÂ cuneata" to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 investigation of hereditary disparity inside the subgenus yielded both different conceivable outcomes: a few examinations proposed "B.ÃÂ ilicifolia" as basal, while others recommended "B.ÃÂ oligantha". Biogeographical components recommend that "B.ÃÂ ilicifolia" would be the most basal of the three species: it happens in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most normal, while the others are confined to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where all the more as of late developed species are generally normal.
