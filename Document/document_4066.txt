With the ROK armed force in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's fifth Divisions all progressed consistently south along the eastern streets without experiencing much obstruction. Over the whole front the North Korean Army had effectively directed the South Koreans and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment went about as a development drive, endeavoring to invade further inland as it traveled through the hilly eastern locale of the nation. The rough landscape of the eastern districts of Korea, poor correspondence gear, and problematic resupply lines upset the South Korean opposition. The North Koreans utilized this further bolstering their good fortune in progressing yet they started to encounter similar issues themselves. The fifth Division and the two different units started propelling south gradually and mindfully, sending solid surveillance parties into the mountains to guarantee they would not be undermined from the back. In any case, this progressively mindful development started to give the South Koreans important time to develop further south. By June 28, the 766th had invaded into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was pushing toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong so as to square interchanges among Daegu and Busan, where United States Army powers were arriving trying to help the falling ROK Army.
