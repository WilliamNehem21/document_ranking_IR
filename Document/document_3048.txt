Gascoyne immediately started a private enquiry and kept in touch with the Anglican clergyman at Abbotsville, James Harris. He thought it impossible that the three observers found by George Squires would travel so far "to foreswear themselves for the benefit of this hopeless article" and Harris did not disillusion. The Reverend had the capacity to verify Gibbons' declaration and offer new observers who could profess to have seen Squires well far from Enfield Wash. Gascoyne likewise imagined that a portion of the Canningites questioned the young lady's veracity and had conspired in her rendition of occasions to demonstrate hatred for him; this, he thought, was a political assault on an open authority and he would not let the issue rest. He defended his exercises by looking at his obvious sympathy for the person in question, Mary Squires, with his shock for the trickery of her informer, Elizabeth Canning, however his enthusiasm was impacted to some degree by the demeanors of the time. He considered the conduct of the Canningites wrong for their low station and was increasingly awed by the affirmations of individuals, for example, Alderman Chitty and Reverend Harris, who as courteous fellows and open promoters were assumed progressively dependable.
