In the Southern Hemisphere, summer dispersion dependent on memorable catch information is somewhere in the range of 50ÃÂ°S scope in the South Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans and 60ÃÂ°S in the South Pacific, while winter appropriation is inadequately known, with previous winter whaling grounds being situated off northeastern Brazil (7ÃÂ°S) and Peru (6ÃÂ°S). Most of the "sei" whales got off Angola and Congo, just as other adjacent territories in central West Africa, are thought to have been dominatingly misidentified Bryde's whales. For instance, Ruud (1952) found that 42 of the "sei whale" get off Gabon in 1952 were really Bryde's whales, in light of examination of their baleen plates. The main affirmed chronicled record is the catch of a female, which was conveyed to the Cap Lopez whaling station in Gabon in September 1950. Amid cetacean locating reviews off Angola somewhere in the range of 2003 and 2006, just a solitary affirmed locating of two people was made in August 2004, contrasted with 19 sightings of Bryde's whales. Sei whales are ordinarily appropriated along west to southern Latin America including along whole Chilean coasts, inside Beagle Channel to Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, and conceivably feed in the Aysen area.
