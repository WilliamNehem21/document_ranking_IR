They discovered gooney bird chicks and seals to eat, however in spite of the overall solace of the island contrasted with the little pontoon, they still earnestly expected to achieve the whaling station at Husvik on the opposite side of the island to bring help for the men on Elephant Island. Unmistakably McNish and Vincent couldn't proceed, so Shackleton left them being taken care of by Timothy McCarthy stayed outdoors in the upturned "James Caird", and with Worsley and Crean made the perilous stumble over the mountains. McNish took screws from the "James Caird" and appended them to the boots of the men making the adventure to enable them to hold the ice. He likewise formed a rough sledge from driftwood he found on the shoreline, however it ended up being down to earth. At the point when Shackleton's gathering set off on 18 May 1916, McNish went with them for a couple of hundred yards yet he was unfit to go any further. He shook hands with every one of the men, wished them good karma and after that Shackleton sent him back. Placing McNish in direction of the rest of the men, Shackleton charged him to hang tight for help and if none had dropped before the finish of winter to endeavor to sail toward the east coast. When Shackleton's gathering had crossed the mountains and landed in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's boats, "Samson", to get McNish and different men. In the wake of seeing the anorexic and drawn McNish on his landing in the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the salvage possessed come just in energy for him.
