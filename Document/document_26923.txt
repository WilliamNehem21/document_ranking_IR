On the night of 23 February, "Missouri" and "Wisconsin" turned their big guns on Kuwait's Faylaka Island to support the US-led coalition ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a diversionary assault aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion. As part of this attack, "Missouri" and "Wisconsin" were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after "Missouri" completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, "Wisconsin", while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her guns. As "Wisconsin"s drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would know that they were once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer's distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of "Missouri"s artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to surrender by waving makeshift white flags, an action dutifully noted aboard "Wisconsin". Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone's aircrew called "Wisconsin"s commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, "Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?" This surrender to "Wisconsin"s Pioneer has since become one of the most remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship. "Wisconsin" drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition's ground offensive.
