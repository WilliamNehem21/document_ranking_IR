Davies' scriptwriting was influenced by the improvement of a head cold and invading content imperatives; he was irritated that he had stated "discourse [he had] been biting the dust to express" with a "swoon heart" since he would need to cut it. Since he was behind timetable, he was compelled to drop intends to go to Piper's wedding and practically dropped designs to praise the New Year with his beau. These issues influenced his first draft of the Doctor's discussion with his sidekicks and experience with Davros; he rejected it as "weak poo" which would squander permit payers' cash, and supplanted it with an alternate rendition hours after the fact. The discussion includes the majority of the Doctor's colleagues all the while conversing with the Doctor; Tate, Tennant, and executive Graeme Harper settled on the imaginative choice to have the Doctor overlook any notice of the Daleks in light of the fact that they figured the Doctor's jauntiness in the scene would be generally unseemly. He in the long run completed the content at 1am on New Year's Eve. Cook checked on the last pages of the content and proposed that the scene should air without a trailer; Davies concurred by taking note of that "[the BBC] never convey review circles of the last scene" and that any notices for "Adventure's End" could "simply show loads of Daleks and a rehash of "I'm recovering" [the Doctor's last line in the scene before the recovery procedure starts]. The scene was authoritatively submitted on : the readiness date for "The Stolen Earth" and "Adventure's End".
