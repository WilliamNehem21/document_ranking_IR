Another English taxon, "Ornithopsis hulkei", was named in 1870 by scientist Harry Govier Seeley for vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous Wessex Formation, more youthful than the current types of "Cetiosaurus". Seeley considered "Ornithopsis" to be firmly identified with "Cetiosaurus", yet extraordinary because of the interior bone structure. An extra species, "Ornithopsis leedsii" was named in 1887 by John Hulke for a pelvis, vertebrae and ribs gathered by Alfred Nicholson Leeds, an English rancher and novice fossil authority who for an amazing duration assembled various accumulations of fossils from the Oxford Clay. "O. leedsii", from the Late Jurassic, demonstrated likenesses to more established "Cetiosaurus oxoniensis" just as more youthful "O. hulkei". It was depicted in more detail by Seeley in 1889, where he considered "O. hulkei", "C. oxoniensis" and "O. leedsii" to all be in similar family, bearing the name "Cetiosaurus". However, naturalist Richard Lydekker talked about with Seeley, before the production of Seeley's 1889 paper, that "Cetiosaurus" and "Ornithopsis" were not a similar taxon. Lydekker proposed that Wealden fossils (counting "O. hulkei") had a place with "Ornithopsis" and the Jurassic remains (counting "O. leedsii" and "C. oxoniensis") to "Cetiosaurus". Lydekker in 1895 altered his opinion and alluded the species "O. leedsii" to "Pelorosaurus" (known as of now from the species "P. brevis", once named "Cetiosaurus brevis")Ã¢ÂÂ as "P. leedsi"Ã¢ÂÂ and alluded the variety to Atlantosauridae. Lydekker's grouping of the species was not bolstered by later creators like scientist Arthur Smith Woodward in 1905, who pursued Seeley's characterization plot.
