Different pundits were not as complimentary towards the collection. Charlotte Heathcote of British paper the "Day by day Express" said that, while M.I.A. could "even now make a case for being a standout amongst our most creative, solid specialists", there were "just glints of splendor" on the collection. "Chicago Tribune" essayist Greg Kot gave the collection more than two out of four stars and communicated a blended reaction towards M.I.A's. "[embracing] pop more intensely than any other time in recent memory. "Diversion Weekly"s Leah Greenblatt was reproachful of the collection, expressing that it sounded "dinky and punishingly grating, as though the collection has been submerged and afterward set upon by a stockpile of especially bothered power devices". She proceeded to express that nothing on the collection sounded "really crucial", or as progressive as M.I.A. needed people in general to accept. Stephen TroussÃÂ©, writing in "Whole", depicted the collection as "hostile to climactic" and "smug" and said that it experienced "lessened skylines". Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters noticed M.I.A's. "cocky" as a shortcoming, including that "Maya" does not have "the concentration and certainty of M.I.A's. past collections". Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine noticed that the collection "has the vibe of a vanity venture" and stated "It might be a better than expected collection, yet its tasteful matches her persona just at its shallowest levels, in the slenderness of its thoughts and the regularly strong offensiveness of its message". Chris Richard of "The Washington Post" called it "a muddling blend of mechanical rattle and computerized slush" and noted "there isn't a lot to chime in to".
