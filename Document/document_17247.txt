Nirvana broke into the musical mainstream with its major-label album "Nevermind" in 1991. Despite modest sales estimatesâthe band's record company, DGC Records, forecast sales of 50,000 copiesâ"Nevermind" became a huge commercial success, popularizing the Seattle grunge movement and alternative rock in general. Nevertheless, all three members of Nirvanaâsinger and guitarist Kurt Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohlâlater expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of the album, citing its production as too polished. Early in 1992, Cobain told "Rolling Stone" that he was sure that the band's next album would showcase "both of the extremes" of its sound, saying "it'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others. It won't be as one-dimensional [as "Nevermind"]". Cobain wanted to start work on the album in the summer of 1992, but the band was unable as Cobain and his bandmates lived in different cities, and as the singer and his wife, Courtney Love, were expecting the birth of their daughter, Frances Bean. DGC had hoped to have a new album by the band ready for a late-1992 holiday season release; since work on it proceeded slowly, the label released the compilation album "Incesticide" in December 1992.
