Hurricane Charlie developed on AugustÂ 21 to the southwest of the Cape Verde islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later. For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On AugustÂ 25, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on AugustÂ 28. On AugustÂ 30, Charlie attained peak winds of , although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently turned to a westward drift. On SeptemberÂ 2, Charlie turned to the north and northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by SeptemberÂ 5 Charlie had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on SeptemberÂ 5 without having affected land.
Hurricane Dog is believed to have developed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on AugustÂ 24. Its first observation as a tropical cyclone occurred on AugustÂ 30, when it was a hurricane; the storm is believed to have begun farther east as a Cape Verde-type hurricane, but was not detectable before August 30. At the time, Dog was located east of the Lesser Antilles, and it quickly attained major hurricane status as it moved to the west-northwest. Dog passed through the Lesser Antilles with winds of . It was considered among the worst hurricanes in the history of Antigua, where thousands were left homeless. Damage was estimated at $1Â million (1950Â USD, $ Â USD), and there were two deaths from drowning in the region.
