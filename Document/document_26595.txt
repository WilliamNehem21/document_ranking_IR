The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action. The transition from cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions, forcing many ships to reduce speed to to avoid colliding with each other. During the first stage of the general engagement, "Collingwood" fired eight salvos from her main guns at the crippled light cruiser from 18:32, although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown. Her secondary armament then engaged the destroyer , which was attempting to come to "Wiesbaden"s assistance, but failed to hit her. At 19:15 "Collingwood" fired two salvoes of high explosive (HE) shells at the battlecruiser , hitting her target once before she disappeared into the mist. The shell detonated in the German ship's sickbay and damaged the surrounding superstructure. Shortly afterwards, during the attack of the German destroyers around 19:20, the ship fired her main armament at a damaged destroyer without success and dodged two torpedoes that missed by behind and in front. This was the last time she fired her guns during the battle.
