In the PasiÃÂ³n River locale of PetÃÂ©n, rulers started to be depicted as ballplayers on stelae. Seibal was the main site in the district to delineate its rulers along these lines. Seventeen stelae were raised at Seibal somewhere in the range of 849 and 889, and demonstrate a blend of Maya and outside styles, including a master wearing the hooked veil of Ehecatl, the focal Mexican breeze god, with a Mexican-style discourse scroll rising up out of the mouth. A portion of these have an expressive proclivity with the painted wall paintings at Cacaxtla, a non-Maya site in the focal Mexican province of Tlaxcala. This half and half style appears to demonstrate that the rulers of Seibal were Maya rulers adjusting to changing political conditions by embracing a blend of images starting from both marsh Maya and focal Mexican sources. A portion of the more outside looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Stelae at Oxkintok, toward the north in the Puuc area of the YucatÃÂ¡n Peninsula, partitioned the substance of the stela into up to three dimensions, every one of which contained an alternate scene, for the most part of a solitary assume that could be either male or female. The portrayal of the human figure contrasted from the formal treatment in the south, and were rearranged, coarse portrayals lacking uniqueness among sociopolitical and religious images.
