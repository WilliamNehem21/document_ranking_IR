Foliot was outstanding as a letter essayist, and his letters were later gathered as a book. The principle composition for this accumulation, presently held at the Bodleian Library, should have begun in Foliot's own composition office. Around 250 to 300ÃÂ examples of Foliot's letters have endure, which together with his enduring sanctions gives a sum of practically 500ÃÂ items. The accumulation was imprinted in an advanced version altered by Adrian Morey and Christopher N. L. Brooke and distributed by the Cambridge University Press in 1967, under the title of "The Letters and Charters of Gilbert Foliot". A portion of the letters have showed up in volumes five through eight of "Materials for the History of Thomas Becket", from the Rolls Series, distributed from 1875Ã¢ÂÂ 1885. More seasoned versions showed up in the "Patres ecclesiae Anglicanae" arrangement from the 1840s, and in Migne's "Patrologica" from 1854. The letters spread the greater part of the time of Foliot's open life, and are one of the principle hotspots for the historical backdrop of that period. The student of history David Knowles said of the accumulation that "inferable from its abundance of individual and neighborhood detail [it] is of the best an incentive for the congregation antiquarian". As indicated by Knowles, Foliot's letters illustrate a functioning diocesan and ministerial pioneer who bolstered the Gregorian church changes yet did not interfere in governmental issues past those of the congregation. His letters are regular of the informed letter essayist of his time, refined and cleaned to a work of art.
