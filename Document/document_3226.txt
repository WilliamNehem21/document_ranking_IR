Numismatist and coin seller Q. David Bowers trusts that most Seated Liberty dollars delivered after 1853 were sent to China to pay for extravagance products, including tea and silk. R. W. Julian contended in actuality, that proceeded with creation of the dollar had little to do with exchange with the Orient (where products were paid for in silver), recommending rather that the coins were sent toward the West for use there. Be that as it may, despite the fact that the Mint's Engraving Department sent bites the dust for the dollar to the San Francisco office over and over from 1858 on, the California mint utilized them just once before 1870, striking 20,000 dollars in 1859, a year in which 255,700 were struck at Philadelphia and 360,000 at New Orleans. Generation at New Orleans was upset after 1860 by the Civil War; it didn't strike silver dollars again until 1879, after the finish of the Seated Liberty arrangement. After the flare-up of the war in 1861, inflationary greenbacks were presented, and valuable metal coins evaporated from course. In April 1863, new Mint Director James Pollock contended that the silver dollar be wiped out, noticing in a letter that the coin "never again goes into our money related framework. The few pieces made are for Asiatic and other outside exchange and are not found available for use."
