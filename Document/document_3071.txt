In 1970, British specialist Thomas E. A. Stowell distributed an article entitled "Jack the RipperÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ A Solution?" in the November issue of "The Criminologist". In the article, Stowell recommended that the Ripper was a noble who had contracted syphilis amid a visit toward the West Indies, that it had made him crazy, and that in this perspective he had executed the five sanctioned Jack the Ripper murders. In spite of the fact that Stowell did not straightforwardly name his suspect in the article, he depicted in detail the presume's family and his physical appearance and monikers, all of which indicated Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale. Stowell composed that following a twofold homicide on 30ÃÂ September 1888, his suspect was limited by his very own family in an establishment in the south of England, however later got away to submit a last homicide on 9ÃÂ November before eventually passing on of syphilis. To back up his hypothesis, Stowell drew examinations between the destruction of the ladies and the evisceration of deer shot by the gentry on their bequests. Stowell said his data originated from the private notes of Sir William Gull, a legitimate doctor who had treated individuals from the regal family. Stowell knew Gull's child in-law, Theodore Dyke Acland, and was an agent of Acland's bequest.
