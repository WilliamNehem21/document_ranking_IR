The soonest settlement at the tallness of Ambohimanga was no doubt built up in the fifteenth century, concurring with the landing of the Merina in the good countries. Rice paddies replaced the first valley backwoods by the sixteenth century, and the developing populace close to the valleys around Ambohimanga wound up known by the tribe name Tantsaha ("individuals of the developed land"). As indicated by oral history, in any case, the first to settle the site of the Ambohimanga rova was Andriamborona, the deposed ruler of the good country domain of Imamo, who moved to the then-uninhabited peak in around 1700 joined by his nephew, his better half, and his mom, Ratompobe. Merina ruler Andriamasinavalona (1675Ã¢ÂÂ 1710), who reigned over Imerina from his illustrious compound in Antananarivo, saw a blaze lit by the family on the southern essence of the slope 24 kilometers away. The perceivability of the site from his capital drove Andriamasinavalona to want Ambohimanga as a home for his child, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriamborona and his family consented to move multiple times to various pieces of the slope, including the future site of the illustrious compound of Bevato, in light of sequential solicitations from the lord. For a brief timeframe he and the sovereign lived in neighboring houses at Bevato before Andriamborona and his family at long last left the slope for the far off good country town of Ambatolampy, where he carried on with a mind-blowing remainder; the ruler recovered their bodies for internment at Ambohimanga.
