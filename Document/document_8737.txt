"Voalavo" is a piece of the subfamily Nesomyinae, which incorporates nine genera that are altogether confined to Madagascar. Before the revelations of "Monticolomys" (distributed in 1996) and "Voalavo" (1998), the majority of the known genera inside Nesomyinae were very unmistakable from one another, to such an extent that phylogenetic connections among them since quite a while ago stayed darken. Like "Monticolomys" (firmly identified with "Macrotarsomys"), in any case, "Voalavo" demonstrates clear similitudes to another nesomyine sort, "Eliurus". In their portrayal of "Voalavo", Carleton and Goodman contended that, albeit firmly related, "Eliurus" and "Voalavo" structure separate monophyletic gatherings; yet a 1999 atomic phylogenetic examination by Sharon Jansa and associates, who analyzed cytochrome "b" arrangements among nesomyines and different rodents, found that northern voalavo was all the more firmly identified with Grandidier's tufted-followed rodent than to different types of "Eliurus". This finding raised doubt about the different conventional status of "Voalavo". Notwithstanding, tissue tests of Petter's tufted-followed rodent, a species that is believed to be firmly identified with Grandidier's tufted-followed rodent, were not accessible, so this species couldn't be incorporated into the examination. Information from atomic qualities likewise bolsters the connection between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-followed rodent, however Petter's tufted-followed rodent remains hereditarily unstudied and the ordered issue has not been settled.
