In the same way as other different volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, Mount Cayley has been the hotspot for a few huge avalanches. To date, most geographical investigations of the Mount Cayley field have concentrated on avalanche perils alongside geothermal potential. A noteworthy flotsam and jetsam torrential slide about 4,800ÃÂ years back dumped of volcanic material into the adjoining Squamish valley. This obstructed the Squamish River for an extensive stretch of time. Evans (1990) has shown that various avalanches and flotsam and jetsam streams at Mount Cayley in the last 10,000ÃÂ years may have been brought about by volcanic action. Since the vast trash torrential slide 4,800ÃÂ years back, various progressively minor avalanches have happened at it, including one 1,100ÃÂ years prior and another occasion 500ÃÂ years prior. The two avalanches eventually obstructed the Squamish River and made lakes upstream that went on for a restricted measure of time. In 1968 and 1983, a progression of avalanches occurred that made extensive harm logging streets and timberland stands, however did not result in any setbacks. Future avalanches from Mount Cayley and potential damming of the Squamish River are critical land risks to the overall population, just as to the financial advancement in the Squamish valley.
