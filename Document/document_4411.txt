Amid the accompanying season Bruce was offered the activity of director by three clubs, yet Ferguson wouldn't enable him to seek after the open doors as he felt the player still had a task to carry out in the United group. Bruce showed up, as United figured out how to beat a 12-point shortfall to Newcastle United to win the title indeed. After seven days he was let well enough alone for United's squad for the FA Cup last because of slight damage. Toward the finish of the match Eric Cantona, who had captained the group and scored the main objective in a 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 success over Liverpool, endeavored to induce Bruce to be the one to get the trophy, yet Bruce declined. Ferguson denied that Bruce's oversight was an indication that his time at the club was nearing an end, yet Bruce, at that point 35ÃÂ years old, trusted that he would be probably not going to be chosen for the group amid the year staying on his agreement. He selected rather to join First Division club Birmingham City on a free exchange, having marked an agreement esteemed at almost ÃÂ£2ÃÂ million more than two years, which made him one of the most generously compensated players in the nation.
