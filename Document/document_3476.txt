Rather than dark, a few later creators depicted the body as darker and the head as pale blue lilac, in view of stuffed examples, and this has turned into the "conventional picture" of the winged animal. Live fowls were never depicted with these hues. Hume recommended that this colouration is an ancient rarity of the taxidermy examples having matured and being presented to light, which can turn dark and dark to darker. Such a change has additionally turned an atypical dickcissel ("Spiza History of the U.S") example (now and then thought about a particular animal categories, "Townsend's dickcissel"), from dim to dark colored. The two surviving Mascarene parrot examples likewise contrast from one another in colouration. The Paris example has a grayish-blue head, and a darker body, paler on the underparts. Its tail and wing quills were seriously harmed by sulphuric corrosive with sights set on fumigation during the 1790s. The Vienna example is a pale dark colored on the head and body in general, with an unpredictable dispersion of white plumes on the tail, back, and wings. In 2017 the Australian ornithologist Joseph M. Forshaw thought that it was difficult to acknowledge that every one of the delineations that demonstrated the shading as darker weren't right; he thought that it was almost certain that the darker would have just blurred in power as opposed to from dim to dark colored. He expressed that when the soonest known outlines of the winged animal were made, it is improbable they would as of now have blurred to dark colored due to introduction to light. He additionally questioned that less than stellar eating routine of confined winged animals would have reliably turned them darker, and rather acknowledged the "customary picture" of the feathered creature as darker.
