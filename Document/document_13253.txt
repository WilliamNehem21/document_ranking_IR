Heinlein's talks of his political convictions were reprimanded as "instructional", and the novel was disparaged for "work [that was] embedded in substantial toxic pieces". Writer Ken MacLeod's 2003 investigation of the political idea of "Starship Troopers" expressed that it was "where civics infodumps and records of ruthless training camp preparing far exceed the meager and tensionless battle scenes". Researcher and writer Brunner contrasted it with a "Victorian youngsters' book", while the "Sci-fi Handbook" distributed in 2009 said that the novel gave "convincing pictures of a cutting edge military" and that it brought up vital issues, notwithstanding for the individuals who can't help contradicting its political belief system. In any case, it expressed that the story was powerless as a story of an outsider experience, as it didn't investigate outsider society in any detail, however introduced the Arachnids as anonymous and unremarkable animals that wished to demolish mankind. Boucher, organizer of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction", commented in 1960 that Heinlein had "neglected to embed a story".
