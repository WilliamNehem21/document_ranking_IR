Playing without Abdul-Jabbar for the first time, Johnson won his third MVP award after a strong 1989â90 NBA season in which he averaged 22.3Â points, 11.5Â assists, and 6.6Â rebounds per game. However, the Lakers bowed out to the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals, which was the Lakers' earliest playoffs elimination in nine years. Mike Dunleavy became the Lakers' head coach in 1990â91, when Johnson had grown to be the league's third-oldest point guard. He had become more powerful and stronger than in his earlier years, but was also slower and less nimble. Under Dunleavy, the offense used more half-court sets, and the team had a renewed emphasis on defense. Johnson performed well during the season, with averages of 19.4Â points, 12.5Â assists, and 7.0Â rebounds per game, and the Lakers reached the 1991 NBA Finals. There they faced the Chicago Bulls, led by shooting guard Michael Jordan, a five-time scoring champion regarded as the finest player of his era. Although the series was portrayed as a matchup between Johnson and Jordan, Bulls forward Scottie Pippen defended effectively against Johnson. Despite two triple-doubles from Johnson during the series, finals MVP Jordan led his team to a 4â1Â win. In the last championship series of his career, Johnson averaged 18.6Â points on .431Â shooting, 12.4Â assists, and 8.0Â rebounds per game.
