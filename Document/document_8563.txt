As indicated by Alfred Henry Lewis of Hearst's "Diary", composing on JanuaryÃÂ 12, "The restriction to Hanna was totally complicated by the historical backdrop of yesterday, and for all intents and purposes, went into joint session today to some degree like a steered armed force may take up some fight it couldn't dodge." The 73ÃÂ men vowed to Hanna went to the State House together under the insurance of Hanna followers. Croly related: "Outfitted watchmen were positioned at each essential point. The State House was loaded up with edgy and decided men." In the joint tradition, held in the House Chamber, the diaries of the two houses were perused, specifying the counts from the earlier day. The representatives of the two houses at that point called the rolls. The main votes to change were those which had gone to Warner and Wiley; both were changed to McKisson. Delegate Aquila Wiley was the last individual to cast a ballot; with Hanna having effectively gotten the 73ÃÂ ballots he required for race, Wiley kept up his vote in favor of Lentz. The last count, both for the short and long haul was HannaÃÂ 73, McKissonÃÂ 70, and LentzÃÂ 1. Before the joint tradition deferred, Hanna showed up before it, expressing gratitude toward the administrators for his decision. He expressed, "I doubly thank you in light of the fact that the situation being what it is it comes to me as a confirmation of your certainty".
