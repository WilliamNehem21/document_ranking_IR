In 415 BC, delegates from the Sicilian city of Segesta () touched base at Athens to argue for the help of the Athenians in their war against Selinus. Amid the discussions on the endeavor, Nicias was energetically contradicted to Athenian mediation, clarifying that the crusade would be in all respects exorbitant and assaulting the character and thought processes of Alcibiades, who had risen as a noteworthy supporter of the campaign. Then again, Alcibiades contended that a battle in this new venue would convey wealth to the city and extend the domain, similarly as the Persian Wars had. In his discourse Alcibiades anticipated (over-hopefully, in the sentiment of most history specialists) that the Athenians would almost certainly enroll partners in the area and force their standard on Syracuse, the most dominant city of Sicily. Disregarding Alcibiades' energetic support for the arrangement, it was Nicias, not he, who transformed an unobtrusive endeavor into an enormous crusade and made the victory of Sicily appear to be conceivable and safe. It was at his proposal that the span of the armada was essentially expanded from 60 boats to "140 galleys, 5,100 men at arms, and around 1300 toxophilite, slingers, and light outfitted men". Scholar Leo Strauss underscores that the Sicilian endeavor outperformed everything attempted by Pericles. Very likely Nicias' aim was to stun the gathering with his high gauge of the powers required, at the same time, rather than deterring his kindred residents, his investigation made them even more anxious. Against his desires Nicias was named General alongside Alcibiades and Lamachus, every one of the three of whom were given full powers to do whatever was to the greatest advantage of Athens while in Sicily.
