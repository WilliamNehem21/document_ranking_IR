The essayists likewise utilized subtleties from genuine criminal examinations in their content. Amid one scene in "Phantom of a Chance", a busload of new kid on the block cops straight out of the institute are gotten to research a wrongdoing scene. The New York Police Department utilized the very same strategy while hunting down the remaining parts of a missing young lady in upstate New York in 1987. One scene composed by Tom Fontana, "Three Men and Adena", occurred completely inside the limits of the police cross examination room referred to conversationally by the criminologists as "The Box". Fontana was in part motivated to compose it by remarks made by Barry Levinson amid recording of a cross examination scene in "Gone for Goode", when Levinson said the acting by Braugher and Secor was so great, a whole scene could be shot around it. Fontana recognized a specific measure of hazard in creating such an abnormal scene in just the fifth seven day stretch of the show, yet he stated, "It was vital for [exec producer] Barry Levinson and I to build up that we weren't going to do a similar old demonstrate each week." Multiple police divisions have mentioned duplicates of "Three Men and Adena" for use in instructional meetings because of its exact depiction of the complexities of the police cross examination process.
