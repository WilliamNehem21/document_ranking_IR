Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, "Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing", under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took "about a week". Embracing The Wildhearts' anarchist approach, "while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could", Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a drum machine). A few songs, however, featured local session musicians, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend's future bandmate.
Released on April 4, 1995, "Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing" was not widely recognized in the metal community. The album sold 143Â copies in its first six months, but received favorable reviews from the heavy metal press. Its unusual musical ideasâa synthesis of death, thrash, and industrial metal influencesâprompted Andy Stout from "Metal Hammer" to call it "one of the most disturbing albums you'll hear for a very long time". Nevertheless, Townsend has repeatedly expressed his distaste for the recording. He dismissed the album in the liner notes of the record's 2006 reissue, contending it contained only two great songs. He also deemed its production poor in interviews, referring to the album as "basically a collection
of demos that were remixed". When Century Media advertised the reissue of "Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing" as the "rebirth of a genre-defying classic", Townsend called it "record company bullshit".
