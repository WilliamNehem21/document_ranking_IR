The koala was intensely chased by European pilgrims in the mid twentieth century, generally for its thick, delicate hide. In excess of two million pelts are evaluated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were sought after for use in mats, coat linings, muffs, and as cutting on ladies' articles of clothing. Broad cullings happened in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when more than one million koalas were slaughtered with firearms, toxic substances, and nooses. The open objection over these cullings was likely the primary wide-scale ecological issue that revitalized Australians. Writer and social pundit Vance Palmer, writing in a letter to "The Courier-Mail", communicated the prevalent feeling: "The shooting of our innocuous and adorable local bear is nothing not exactly barbarousÃÂ ... Nobody has ever blamed him for ruining the rancher's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the thorny pear. There is no social bad habit that can be put down to his accountÃÂ ... He manages no game to the firearm manÃÂ ... What's more, he has been nearly rubbed out as of now from certain zones." Despite the developing development to secure local species, the neediness realized by the dry spell of 1926Ã¢ÂÂ 28 prompted the killing of another 600,000 koalas amid a one-month open season in August 1927. In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-bounteous creature had been brought to close eradication in that state, proposing that just 500Ã¢ÂÂ 1000 remained.
