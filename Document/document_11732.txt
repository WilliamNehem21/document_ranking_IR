The Victoria Cross for Australia is the most noteworthy honor in the Australian Honors Order of Precedence. Accordingly, it overshadows all other Australian requests and designs, aside from the Imperial Victoria Cross, with which it shares measure up to priority. This postnominal is substantial just for the beneficiary and isn't exchanged to the beneficiary's beneficiaries. "Convention holds that even the most senior officer will salute a Victoria Cross beneficiary as a sign the very pinnacle of regard for their demonstration of valor." Whilst it has been a custom for a long time to salute a Victoria Cross beneficiary the Australian Army Ceremonial Manual, Volume 1, Annex B to Chapter 13 states "Victoria Cross champs, except if they are serving charged officers in the military, are not saluted". Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston saluted Trooper Mark Donaldson after he got his VC. Under Section 103, Subsection (4), of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Australian Government pays a Victoria Cross Allowance to any administration individual granted the award. The demonstration set this sum at A$3,230 every year. Since 20 September 2005, this sum has been filed every year in accordance with Australian Consumer Price Index increments. This sum is notwithstanding any sum that the veteran might be granted under the general enhancement stipend of $2.10 per fortnight.
