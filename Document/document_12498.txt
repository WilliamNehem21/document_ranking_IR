Refering to "Gatekeepers" as the point where the comic book medium "became an adult", Iain Thomson wrote in his paper "Deconstructing the Hero" that the story achieved this by "building up its saints correctly so as to "deconstruct" the general concept of the legend thus promising us to think about its noteworthiness from the a wide range of edges of the shards left lying on the ground". Thomson expressed that the saints in "Guardians" practically all offer an agnostic standpoint, and that Moore exhibits this viewpoint "as the basic, unvarnished truth" to "deconstruct the eventual legend's definitive inspiration, in particular, to give a common salvation thus achieve a human everlasting status". He composed that the story "builds up its saints decisively so as to inquire as to whether we would not in certainty be in an ideal situation without legends". Thomson included that the story's deconstruction of the legend idea "proposes that maybe the ideal opportunity for saints has passed", which he feels recognizes "this postmodern work" from the deconstructions of the saint in the existentialism development. Richard Reynolds expresses that with no supervillains in the story, the superheroes of "Guards" are compelled to defy "increasingly impalpable social and good concerns", including that this expels the superhuman idea from the ordinary account desires for the class. Reynolds reasons that the arrangement's unexpected mindfulness of the class "all imprint out "Guardians" either as the last key hero content, or the first in another development of the class".
