Aside from the uncovered certainties of his life, little is thought about Deusdedit. Deusdedit's successor as Archbishop of Canterbury, Wighard, had been one of his church. Deusdedit was viewed as a holy person after his passing, with a dining experience day of 14ÃÂ July, in spite of the fact that the Bosworth Psalter, a late tenth or mid eleventh century psalter created at , gives a date of 15 July. His dining experience day is assigned as a noteworthy dining experience day, and is incorporated alongside those of various other early Canterbury diocese supervisors in the Bosworth Psalter. Deusdedit was covered in the congregation of St Augustine's in Canterbury, yet was meant the new monastery church in 1091. A hagiography, or holy person's memoir, on Deusdedit was composed by Goscelin after the interpretation of his relics, yet the work depended essentially for Bede; the composition of the "De Sancto Deusdedit Archiepiscopo" gets by as a component of British Library original copy (ms) Cotton Vespasian B.xx. Due to the late date of the "Sancto", Bede's "Historia" is the fundamental hotspot for what little is thought about Deusdedit. Other than the hagiography, there is meager proof of a clique encompassing him. His holy place made due until the disintegration of the cloisters during the 1530s.
