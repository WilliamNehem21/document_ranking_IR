The four-year relationship with Fenby from 1929 delivered two noteworthy works, and a few littler pieces frequently drawn from unpublished music from Delius' initial profession. The first of the significant works was the instrumental "A Song of Summer", in view of portrayals that Delius had recently gathered under the title of "A Poem of Life and Love". In managing the fresh start of this work, Delius asked Fenby to "envision that we are perched on the bluffs in the heather, watching out over the ocean". This does not, says Fenby, demonstrate that the transcription procedure was quiet and restful; the disposition was generally furious and nerve-wracking. The other significant work, a setting of Walt Whitman ballads with the title "Melodies of Farewell", was a considerably all the more disturbing prospect to Fenby: "the multifaceted nature of reasoning in such a large number of strands, frequently at the same time; the issues of symphonic and vocal equalization; the more extensive territory of conceivable misunderstandingsÃÂ ..." joined to leave Delius and his aide depleted after every session of workÃ¢ÂÂyet both these works were prepared for execution in 1932. Of the music in this last choral work, Beecham composed of its "hard, manly force, reminiscent in state of mind and fiber of a portion of the incredible choral entries in "A Mass of Life"". Payne depicts the work as "supporting and jubilant, with in spots a nearly Holstian clearness".
