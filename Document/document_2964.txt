There is no dependable proof of Eta Carinae being watched or recorded before the 17thÃÂ century, albeit Dutch guide Pieter Keyser portrayed a fourth-extent star at roughly the right position around 1595Ã¢ÂÂ 1596, which was replicated onto the heavenly globes of Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and the 1603 "Uranometria" of Johann Bayer. Frederick de Houtman's autonomous star index from 1603 does exclude Eta Carinae among the other 4thÃÂ magnitude stars in the locale. The soonest firm record was made by Edmond Halley in 1677 when he recorded the star essentially as "Sequens" (for example "following" in respect to another star) inside another heavenly body Robur Carolinum. His "Catalogus Stellarum Australium" was distributed in 1679. The star was additionally known by the Bayer assignments Eta Roboris Caroli, Eta Argus or Eta Navis. In 1751 Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave the stars of Argo Navis and Robur Carolinum a solitary arrangement of Greek letter Bayer assignments inside his group of stars Argo, and assigned three territories inside Argo for the motivations behind utilizing Latin letter assignments multiple times over. Estimated time of arrival fell inside the bottom bit of the ship which was later to turn into the group of stars Carina. It was not commonly known as Eta Carinae until 1879, when the stars of Argo Navis were at long last given the sobriquets of the little girl groups of stars in the "Uranometria Argentina" of Gould.
