In " Robinson v Secretary of State for Northern Ireland", Lords Hobhouse, Hoffmann and Millett said that Mackay, with his dissenting judgment, had "turned out to be the better prophet", with large amounts of inefficiency and expense associated with "Pepper". In the "Spath Holme" judicial review case, Lords Bingham, Hope and Hutton held that "Hansard" could only be used in pursuit of "ascertaining the meaning of a particular word or phrase", rather than simply where a piece of legislation is "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity". In "McDonnell", the Lords further limited the use of "Hansard", saying it could not be used to overrule precedent set before courts were able to reference it, except in exceptional circumstances. "Wilson and others v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry", the first case involving "Hansard" after the Human Rights Act 1998 put further limits on its use; ministerial statements made in Parliament can not be treated as sources of law, only as supporting evidence. This "retreat" from "Pepper" was resisted in the Court of Appeal, primarily by Lord Phillips, who praised the decision following Steyn's lecture in 2000, but has been repeatedly emphasised in the House of Lords and Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. As a result of these changes, Stefan Vogenauer has said that "the scope of Pepper v Hart has been reduced to such an extent that the ruling has almost become meaningless".
