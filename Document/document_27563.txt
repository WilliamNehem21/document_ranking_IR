Following the "Pioneer Zephyr" 9900, two identical trainsets, 9901 and 9902, were built and put into service as the "Twin Cities Zephyr" between Chicago and Minneapolis - St. Paul in April 1935. The four car set 9903 entered service as the "Mark Twain Zephyr" between St. Louis and Burlington, Iowa in October 1935. On May 31, 1936, the trainsets of the "Pioneer Zephyr" and the "Mark Twain Zephyr", 9900 and 9903, were transferred to a new Chicago-Denver service called the "Advance Denver Zephyr" on a 16 hour schedule. They were replaced six months later by two new ten-car trains, pulled by power units 9906 and 9907, named the "Denver Zephyr". The six car sets 9904 and 9905 replaced 9901 and 9902 on the Twin Cities run in December 1936. At that time, the 9901 was reassigned to a new service, the "Sam Houston Zephyr", running between Ft. Worth and Houston via Dallas on trackage jointly owned by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. This was the first streamlined train in Texas, and was joined about a year later by the "Texas Rocket" on alternate timing. The 9902 inaugurated the "Ozark State Zephyr", a joint operation with the Alton Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City, where it was joined by the 9904 on alternate timing about a year later. The last of the classic "Zephyrs," 9908, entered service as the "General Pershing Zephyr" between Kansas City and St. Louis in 1939, replacing the less commodious 9902 set. The 9904 set continued to provide alternate timing on this route across the Show Me State, but had its original name of "Mark Twain Zephyr" restored, despite no longer operating through Samuel Clemens' hometown of Hannibal.
