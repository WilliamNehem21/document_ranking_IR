On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, province assistant since 1897, was arraigned for theft. Smedley surrendered, and Barkley was named to a three-man commission to explore the misfortunes. The commission discovered $1,582.50 missing, and the province's Fiscal Court approved Barkley to settle with the organization that held Smedley's surety bond. In May 1909, Smedley was captured and accused of 20 checks of phony, inciting a review of the province's funds that demonstrated a deficiency of $16,000, just $6,000 of which was responsible to Smedley. The embarrassment gave Republicans an issue for the up and coming effort. In a progression of discussions, Barkley's adversary, Thomas N. Hazelip, asserted that the region's whole Democratic association was degenerate and made charges against past Democratic organizations. Barkley reacted that he had no more obligation regarding those bad behaviors than Hazelip had for the homicide of William Goebel, a Democratic representative who had purportedly been killed by Republican backstabbers in 1900. He indicated his improvement of the region's accounts through investigation of charges exhibited to his office and demonstrated proof that he had satisfied his commitments as province lawyer, a reality Hazelip surrendered. Despite the outrage, Democrats won each district wide office, in spite of the fact that by diminished edges, however Republicans caught a 5-to-3 larger part on the Fiscal Court. Barkley's triumph edgeÃ¢ÂÂ3,184 to 2,662Ã¢ÂÂwas the littlest of any province officer.
