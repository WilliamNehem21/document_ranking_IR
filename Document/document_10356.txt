At around 9:30 the evening of September 27, 1868, Hindman was killed by at least one obscure attackers who terminated through his parlor window while he was perusing his paper with his kids. The black powder rifle shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he kicked the bucket eight hours after the fact because of critical blood misfortune. Prior to his demise, Hindman gave a goodbye discourse to his neighbors and political supporters from the yard of his home. With "immaculate self-restraint", Hindman advised audience members to "join their bravery and assurance to convey harmony to the general population". Hindman alluded to the ongoing political discussion with Powell Clayton as a conceivable inspiration for the shooting and stated, "I don't have a clue who slaughtered me; yet I can say, whoever it was, I excuse him." He asked James H. O'Connor, the spouse of Mollie's stepmother, to "deal with my family and be a defender to my better half and dear minimal ones". After O'Connor acknowledged, Hindman expressed, "I pardon everyone, and expectation they will excuse me." Afterwards, he was too powerless to even think about continueing talking, and he sat down on a parlor. He stayed there until he passed on right on time next morning. The death was reported in every real paper all through the state. William Woodruff of the "Newspaper" said Hindman kicked the bucket as a "capable and recognized man" whose "short however amazing vocation" profoundly affected Arkansan state legislative issues.
