The valid scientific names of each of the individual populations are not universally accepted, and some researchers still consider each species to be a subspecies. The taxonomic status of the various races is not fully resolved.

Chelonoidis nigra darwini 
| synonyms_ref=
All species of GalÃ¡pagos tortoises evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland South America by overwater dispersal. Genetic studies have shown that the Chaco tortoise of Argentina and Paraguay is their closest living relative. The minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair. Survival on the 1000-km oceanic journey is accounted for because the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water. As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the Humboldt Current, which diverts westwards towards the GalÃ¡pagos Islands from the mainland. The ancestors of the genus "Chelonoidis" are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the Oligocene.
