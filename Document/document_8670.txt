Not long after the Austrian settlement was marked, a changed evangelist, Jacob Kaiser, was caught in Uznach and executed in Schwyz. This set off a solid response from Zwingli; he drafted "Ratschlag ÃÂ¼ber lair Krieg" (Advice About the War) for the administration. He illustrated defenses for an assault on the Catholic states and different measures to be taken. Before ZÃÂ¼rich could actualize his arrangements, an appointment from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel touched base in ZÃÂ¼rich. The designation approached ZÃÂ¼rich to settle the issue calmly. Manuel included that an assault would open Bern to encourage risks as Catholic Valais and the Duchy of Savoy circumscribed its southern flank. He at that point noted, "You can't generally bring confidence by methods for lances and halberds." ZÃÂ¼rich, in any case, concluded that it would act alone, realizing that Bern would be obliged to assent. War was pronounced on 8 June 1529. ZÃÂ¼rich had the capacity to raise a multitude of 30,000 men. The Five States were deserted by Austria and could raise just 9,000 men. The two powers met close Kappel, however war was turned away because of the intercession of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who argued for a peace negotiation.
