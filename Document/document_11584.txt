A few of the corrections reacted to legal decisions with which Congress oppose this idea. In 1982, Congress revised the Act to topple the Supreme Court case "Portable v. Bolden" (1980), which held that the general preclusion of casting a ballot separation endorsed in Section 2 restricted just "intentional" segregation. Congress reacted by extending Section 2 to unequivocally boycott any casting a ballot practice that had an unfair "impact", paying little mind to whether the training was sanctioned or worked for a biased reason. The production of this "results test" moved most of vote weakening suit brought under the Act from preclearance claims to Section 2 claims. In 2006, Congress changed the Act to topple two Supreme Court cases: "Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board" (2000), which translated the Section 5 preclearance necessity to deny just casting a ballot changes that were instituted or kept up for a "retrogressive" oppressive reason rather than any prejudicial reason, and "Georgia v. Ashcroft" (2003), which set up a more extensive test for deciding if a redistricting plan had an impermissible impact under Section 5 than evaluating just whether a minority gathering could choose its favored applicants. In 2014, the Voting Rights Amendments Act was acquainted in Congress with make another inclusion equation and revise different arrangements because of the Supreme Court case "Shelby County v. Holder" (2013), which struck down the inclusion equation as unlawful. It was alluded to the Constitution and Civil Justice congressional subcommittee on February 11, 2015, however no move was made on it, and it lapsed.
