Adams began the new decade with a leading role opposite Matthew Goode in the romantic comedy "Leap Year" (2010), which the critic Richard Roeper believed was saved from "truly awful status" by Adams's presence. Her next release of the yearthe boxing drama "The Fighter"was much better received. Directed by David O. Russell, the film tells the story of boxer half-brothers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund (played by Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, respectively); Melissa Leo played their mother and Adams portrayed Ward's aggressive girlfriend, a barmaid named Charlene Fleming. Describing Adams's part as a "tough, sexy bitch", Russell cast her against type to rid her of her girl-next-door image. The role marked a significant departure for her, and she was challenged by Russell's insistence on finding her character's strength in silence. She enrolled in an exotic dance class by the trainer Sheila Kelley to find her character's eroticism. Joe Morgenstern of "The Wall Street Journal" wrote that she is "as tough, tender, smart, and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in "Enchanted". What an actress, and what range!" She received Academy, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actress; she lost the former two to Leo. She expressed a desire to play more dramatic roles in the future.
