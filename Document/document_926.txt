The developers recommended utilizing 3D Studio Max for workmanship and level structure, which would set aside extra cash by enabling the organization to permit a solitary bit of programming, however the lead craftsmen effectively campaigned against this arrangement, trusting that enabling the separate groups to pick the product would enable them to work generally productively. Huebner said this spared the undertaking additional time than some other choice made amid advancement. The dimension originators picked QERadiant to exploit their past experience utilizing the product while chipping away at Id Software's "Shake" arrangement. Id enabled Nihilistic to permit QERadiant and adjust it to make an altered instrument for its 3D surroundings. Since QERadiant was a completed, useful apparatus, it enabled the dimension creators to start creating levels from the venture's begin and afterward send out them into the NOD motor, as opposed to hanging tight for as long as a half year for Nihilistic to build up a custom instrument or learning another 3D level manager. In two years, the three dimension planners worked more than 100 in-amusement situations for "Recovery". They acquired outlines and portrays of structures from medieval Prague and Vienna to more readily speak to that period and areas. The four-man workmanship group driven by Kraaijvanger utilized Alias Wavefront Maya to make 3D craftsmanship. Skeptical's administration needed Kraaijvanger to utilize a more affordable instrument however yielded when the expense was observed to be lower than had been suspected. All through the undertaking, the workmanship group worked more than 1,500 3D models.
