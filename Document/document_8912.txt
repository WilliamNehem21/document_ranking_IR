Despite the fact that the proof in Gibraltar neglected to help Flood's hypotheses of homicide and scheme, the doubt of injustice waited. Protection extortion with respect to Winchester was quickly suspected, on the grounds of paper reports that "Mary Celeste" had been vigorously over-safeguarded. Winchester had the capacity to discredit these claims, and no request was founded by the insurance agencies that issued the arrangements. In 1931 an article in the "Quarterly Review" recommended that Morehouse could have lain in sit tight for "Mary Celeste", at that point tricked Briggs and his team on board "Dei Gratia" and executed them there. Paul Begg, in his record of the puzzle, remarks that this hypothesis overlooks undisputed realities: "Dei Gratia" left New York eight days after "Mary Celeste", was a slower deliver, and would not have gotten "Mary Celeste" before the last achieved Gibraltar. Another hypothesis places that Briggs and Morehouse were accomplices in a connivance to share the rescue procedures. The unconfirmed kinship between the two skippers has been refered to by observers as making such an arrangement a conceivable clarification. Hicks remarks that, "If Morehouse and Briggs had been arranging such a trick, they would not have conceived such a consideration drawing puzzle," and furthermore inquires as to why, if Briggs proposed to vanish forever, he deserted his child Arthur.
