The British zoologist Robert M. Alexander proposed in 1988 that overheating may have been a major issue in "Paraceratherium" because of its size. As per Prothero, the best living analogs for "Paraceratherium" might be vast warm blooded creatures, for example, elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. To help in thermoregulation, these creatures chill off amid the day by resting in the shade or by floundering in water and mud. They additionally scavenge and move essentially around evening time. In view of its vast size, "Paraceratherium" would not have had the capacity to run and move rapidly, however they would have had the capacity to cross expansive separations, which would be fundamental in a domain with a shortage of nourishment. They may along these lines have had vast home ranges and have been transient. Prothero proposes that creatures as large as indricotheres would require substantial home reaches or domains of in any event and that, due to a shortage of assets, there would have been little room in Asia for some populaces or a huge number of almost indistinguishable species and genera. This guideline is called aggressive avoidance; it is utilized to clarify how the dark rhinoceros (a program) and white rhinoceros (a slow eater) abuse diverse specialties in similar zones of Africa.
