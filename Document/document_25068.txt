"Akagi" was armed with ten 50-caliber 20Â cm 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns, six in casemates aft and the rest in two twin gun turrets, one on each side of the middle flight deck. They fired projectiles at a rate of 3â6 rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of ; at 25Â°, this provided a maximum range between . The turrets were nominally capable of 70Â° elevation to provide additional anti-aircraft fire, but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55Â°. The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5Â° loading angle minimized any real anti-aircraft capability. This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and superstructure made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticality of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized.
The ship carried dedicated anti-aircraft armament of six twin 45-caliber 12Â cm 10th Year Type gun mounts fitted on sponsons below the level of the funnels, where they could not fire across the flight deck, three mounts per side. These guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 45Â°, this provided a maximum range of , and they had a maximum ceiling of at 75Â° elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 6â8 rounds per minute.
