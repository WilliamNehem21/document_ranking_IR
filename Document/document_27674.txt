Film noir, to which lower budgets lent themselves, became something of a house style at the studio, indeed, the RKO B "Stranger on the Third Floor" (1940) is widely seen as initiating noir's classic period. Its cinematographer, Nicholas Musuraca, who began at FBO in the 1920s and stayed with RKO through 1954, is a central figure in creating the look of classic noir. Design chief Albert D'Agostinoâanother long-termer, who succeeded Van Nest Polglase in 1941âand art director Walter Keller, along with others in the department, such as art directors Carroll Clark and Jack Okey and set decorator Darrell Silvera, are similarly credited. The studio's 1940s list of contract players was filled with noir regulars: Robert Mitchum (who graduated to major star status) and Robert Ryan each made no fewer than ten film noirs for RKO. Gloria Grahame, Jane Greer, and Lawrence Tierney were also notable studio players in the field. Freelancer George Raft starred in two noir hits: "Johnny Angel" (1945) and "Nocturne" (1946). Tourneur, Musuraca, Mitchum, and Greer, along with D'Agostino's design group, joined to make the A-budgeted "Out of the Past" (1947), now considered one of the greatest of all film noirs. Nicholas Ray began his directing career with the noir "They Live by Night" (1948), the first of a number of well-received films he made for RKO.
