Aristocrates, who was directing a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, captured the fanatic general Alexicles; maddened, the radical chiefs of the 400 requested activity, and made various dangers against Theramenes and his gathering. Incredibly, Theramenes volunteered to lead a power to save Alexicles; the pioneers of the radicals assented, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, imparting his direction to one other moderate and one fanatic, Aristarchus. Whenever Theramenes and his power touched base at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a fierceness, urged the men to assault the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes faked rage too, however when asked by the hoplites whether he suspected that the stronghold on Eetioneia was a smart thought, he reacted that on the off chance that they needed to pull it down, he imagined that would be great. Getting out that everybody who needed the 5,000 to administer rather than the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has proposed that this call was presumably induced by Theramenes' gathering, who needed the 5,000 to administer; the hoplites tearing down the fortress may well have favored an arrival to the vote based system. A few days after the fact, the Peloponnesian armada drew closer Piraeus, be that as it may, finding the strongholds wrecked and the port all around protected, they cruised on to Euboea. A few days after the fact, the 400 were formally ousted and supplanted by a legislature of the 5,000; the most outrageous of the oligarchs fled the city.
