"Tintin in Tibet" is well received by critics from the comics and literary fields. Farr calls it "exceptional in many respects, standing out among the twenty-three completed "Tintin" adventuresÂ ... an assertion of the incorruptible value of bonds of friendship." Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier laud it as "the ultimate "Tintin" book", reaching "a degree of perfection, both in its story and in its stunning art, that has rarely been equaled, before or since" and "arguably the best book in the series". They detail the story's many emotional moments: Haddock's willingness to sacrifice his life for Tintin's, Tharkey's return, the tearful reunion of Tintin and his starving friend Chang, the reverence paid to Tintin by the Grand Abbot and the monks, and the Yeti's sadness while watching the departure of his only friend. "For a comic book to handle such powerful emotions, convey them to the readers, and make them feel what the characters are feeling is a rare and precious achievement." Thompson calls it "a book of overwhelming whiteness and purity", saying that the "intensely personal nature of the story made this HergÃ©'s favourite "Tintin" adventure", adding that if readers wonder whether "the enormous weight [was] lifted from HergÃ©'s shoulders, [this] can be seen in his next book, "The Castafiore Emerald", a masterpiece of relaxation." As "Tintin in Tibet" was translated into 32 languages, Donald Lopez, professor of Buddhist and Tibetan studies, calls it the "largest selling book about Tibet."
