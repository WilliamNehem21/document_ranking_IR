For the initial five books ("Casino Royale", "Live and Let Die", "Moonraker", "Precious stones Are Forever" and "From Russia, with Love") Fleming got comprehensively positive audits. That started to change in March 1958 when Bernard Bergonzi, in the diary "Twentieth Century", assaulted Fleming's work as containing "a firmly checked dash of voyeurism and sado-masochism" and composed that the books indicated "the absolute absence of any moral edge of reference". The article contrasted Fleming ominously and John Buchan and Raymond Chandler on both good and abstract criteria. After a month, "Dr. No" was distributed, and Fleming got unforgiving analysis from analysts who, in the expressions of Ben Macintyre, "adjusted on Fleming, nearly as a pack". The most emphatic of the studies originated from Paul Johnson of the "New Statesman", who, in his audit "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", called the novel "without uncertainty, the nastiest book I have ever perused". Johnson proceeded to state that "when I was 33% of the route through, I needed to stifle a solid drive to discard the thing". Johnson perceived that in Bond there "was a social wonder of some significance", yet this was viewed as a negative component, as the marvel concerned "three essential fixings in "Dr No", all unfortunate, all completely English: the perversion of a student menace, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a baffled immature, and the rough, stiff neck yearnings of a rural grown-up." Johnson saw no encouraging points in "Dr. No", and stated, "Mr Fleming has no artistic aptitude, the development of the book is confused, and whole episodes and circumstances are embedded, and after that overlooked, in a heedless way."
