Directing the change from politically-sanctioned racial segregation minority principle to a multicultural majority rules system, Mandela saw national compromise as the essential assignment of his administration. Having seen other post-frontier African economies harmed by the flight of white elites, Mandela attempted to console South Africa's white populace that they were ensured and spoke to in "the Rainbow Nation". In spite of the fact that his Government of National Unity would be ruled by the ANC, he endeavored to make an expansive alliance by delegating de Klerk as Deputy President and designating other National Party authorities as pastors for Agriculture, Energy, Environment, and Minerals and Energy, just as naming Buthelezi as Minister for Home Affairs. The other bureau positions were taken by ANC individuals, a considerable lot of whomÃ¢ÂÂlike Joe Modise, Alfred Nzo, Joe Slovo, Mac Maharaj and Dullah OmarÃ¢ÂÂhad for some time been friends of Mandela, despite the fact that others, for example, Tito Mboweni and Jeff Radebe, were far more youthful. Mandela's association with de Klerk was stressed; Mandela imagined that de Klerk was deliberately provocative, and de Klerk felt that he was as a rule purposefully embarrassed by the president. In January 1995, Mandela intensely chastised him for granting absolution to 3,500 cops just before the race, and later censured him for protecting previous Minister of Defense Magnus Malan when the last was accused of homicide.
