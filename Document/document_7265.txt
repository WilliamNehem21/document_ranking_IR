Henry reacted with a one-hour discourse, overlooking the topic of harms, yet which concentrated on the unlawfulness of the veto of the Two Penny Act by the ruler's administration. Henry esteemed any lord who revoked great laws, for example, the Two Penny Act, as a "dictator" who "relinquishes OK to his subjects' submission", and the ministry, by testing an unbiased law intended to bring financial help, had appeared at be "adversaries of the network". The restricting advice blamed Henry for injustice, and some took up that cry, yet Henry proceeded, and the judge did nothing to stop him. Henry asked the jury to make a case of Maury, to support any who may try to emulate him, and proposed the jury return harms of one farthing. The jury was out for just minutes, and fixed harms at one penny. Henry was hailed as a saint.
