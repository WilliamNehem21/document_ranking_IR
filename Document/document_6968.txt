Seven states had just withdrawn when Breckinridge sat down as a representative, leaving the staying Southern legislators more dwarfed with all due respect of subjugation. Trying to discover a trade off that would rejoin the states under sacred standards, he asked Lincoln to pull back government powers from the Confederate states so as to deflect war. The congressional session finished on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he kept on upholding quiet compromise of the states and proposed a meeting of fringe states to look for an answer. On April 12, Confederate troops terminated on Fort Sumter, finishing plans for the meeting. Breckinridge prescribed that Governor Beriah Magoffin call a sway tradition to decide if Kentucky would agree with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was picked by the council as one of six representatives to a gathering to choose the state's next activity. The states' rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and S.S. Nicholas. Unfit to concede to considerable issues, the agents suggested that Kentucky embrace an impartial position in the Civil War and arm itself to avert intrusion by either government or Confederate powers. Breckinridge did not bolster this suggestion, however he consented to keep it once it was affirmed by the governing body.
