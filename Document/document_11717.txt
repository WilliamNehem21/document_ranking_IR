Another recorded duplicate of the Gospel of John has likewise been related with Cuthbert, and in some cases thought to be the St Cuthbert Gospel. Holy person Boisil (d. 664) of Melrose Abbey was Cuthbert's instructor. Bede's exposition life of Cuthbert records that amid Boisil's last sickness, he and Cuthbert read day by day one of the seven get-togethers or quaternions of Boisil's composition of the Gospel of John. The message in "Wonder 20" distinguishes this composition with the one at Durham, and says that the two holy people had worn it round their necks, disregarding that it has twelve social events instead of seven. There are further references from Durham to Boisil's book, for example, a rundown of relics in the church in 1389, and some cutting edge researchers were pulled in to the possibility that they were the equivalent, however Brown's palaeographical proof appears to evacuate the likelihood of Boisil's book being the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the eleventh century Boisil's remaining parts had additionally been conveyed to Durham, and cherished by those of Cuthbert. Around a similar time Bede's very own remaining parts were stolen from MonkwearmouthÃ¢ÂÂ Jarrow for Durham, by a "strikingly underhand trap", and set in Cuthbert's box, where they stayed until 1104.
