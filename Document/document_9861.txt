At the point when asked by the telecaster Melvyn Bragg in 1984 if the pictures painted in the wake of Dyer's demise were portrayals of his enthusiastic response to the occasion, Bacon answered that he didn't believe himself to be an "expressionist painter". He clarified that he was "not endeavoring to express anything, I wasn't attempting to express the distress about someone submitting suicideÃÂ ... be that as it may, maybe it comes through without knowing it". At the point when Bragg asked on the off chance that he regularly considered demise, the craftsman answered that he was constantly mindful of it, and that despite the fact that "it's practically around the bend for [me], I don't consider it, on the grounds that there's nothing to consider. When it comes, it's there. You've made them reflect." on the loss of Dyer, Bacon saw that as a feature of maturing, "life turns out to be to a greater extent a desert around you". He revealed to Bragg that he put stock in "nothing. We are conceived and we pass on and that is it. There is nothing else." Bragg got some information about that reality, and after the craftsman revealed to him he didn't take care of business, Bragg argued, "No Francis, you attempt and paint it."
