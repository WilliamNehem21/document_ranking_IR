The hoopoe starling was long. The fledgling's culmen was long, its wing , its tail , and its bone structure about long. It was the biggest of the three Mascarene starlings. An assumed grown-up male (NHMUK 1889.5.30.15) in the Paris gallery has a light slag dim head and back of the neck (lighter on the rear neck), with a long peak a similar shading with white shafts. Its back and tail are slag darker, its wings darker with a grayish wash, and its uppertail secret plumes and posterior have a rufous wash. Its essential coverts are white with dark colored tips, in spite of the fact that the bases (rather than the tips) are darker in different examples. The superciliary stripe, legend, and the greater part of the example's underside is white, with a pale rufous wash on the flanks and undertail coverts. The degree of light rufous on the underside changes by example. The nose and legs are lemon-yellow, with yellow-dark colored hooks. It has an uncovered, triangular territory of skin around the eye, which may have been yellow throughout everyday life. In spite of the fact that the species' iris was portrayed as pale blue dark colored, it has been delineated as darker, yellow or orange.
