During the 1880s, Moore began work on a series of novels in a realist style. His first novel, "A Modern Lover" (1883) was a three-volume work, as preferred by the circulating libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as Mudie's Select Library, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, "A Mummers Wife" (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper "Le Voltaire" published it in serial form as "La Femme du cabotin" in JulyâOctober 1886. His next novel "A Drama in Muslin" was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets; "Literature at Nurse" and "Circulating Morals". In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.
