The Chief, Arbiter and Guilty Spark find that the Ark is building another Halo to supplant the one that the Chief recently crushed. The Chief chooses to enact this Halo; the ringworld would take out the Flood pervasion on the Ark while saving the cosmic system everywhere from demolition. To enact the ring, the Chief salvages Cortana, who has the Activation Index of the obliterated Halo, from "High Charity" and decimates the city. Touching base on the new Halo, Cortana cautions that Gravemind is endeavoring to remake itself on the ring. The Chief, Arbiter, and Johnson travel to Halo's control space to actuate the ring. Blameworthy Spark clarifies that in light of the fact that the ring isn't yet finished, an untimely enactment will crush it and the Ark. At the point when Johnson overlooks his notice, Guilty Spark lethally wounds him to ensure "his" ring. In spite of the fact that the Chief decimates Guilty Spark, Johnson before long kicks the bucket of his wounds. Boss actuates the ring, and escapes the ring's implosion on the UNSC frigate "Forward Unto Dawn". Notwithstanding, the power of Halo's impact causes the slipspace entrance to crumple, bringing about just the front portion of "Forward Unto Dawn", conveying the Arbiter, making it back to Earth.
