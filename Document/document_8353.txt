Besides, he needed to surrender perpetual canonries to a few of the abbots, concessions which would give them a job in the decision of his successors. Another incomplete set-back occurred. Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, had chosen to establish a religious community in his earldom and take up the pay of Menteith's places of worship to do it; the entire of Menteith comprised almost 50% of the ward. Regardless of the Pope's already useful conduct towards Clement's motivation, he allowed the baron authorization to establish the new religious community. The lord built up Inchmahome Priory in the Lake of Menteith in 1238. Walter and Clement came to strife over the new monastery's rights, yet around the same time an understanding was attracted up a gathering of churchmen at Perth. The understanding set a large portion of Menteith's chapels under the control of the duke; nonetheless, Clement got a few concessions, including the privilege to get episcopal levy from the new monastery. Generally, Clement's triumphs were extensive considering the restriction which he confronted, however even after his demise, just 12 of the 26 area chapels in the bishopric were under the religious administrator's immediate control.
