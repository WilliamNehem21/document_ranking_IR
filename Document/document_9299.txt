A choice on light sparing was held in Queensland, Australia, in 1992, following a three-year preliminary of sunshine sparing. It was crushed with a 54.5% "no" vote, with territorial and country zones unequivocally restricted, while those in the metropolitan southeast were in support. In 2005, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores effectively campaigned for the 2007 expansion to U.S. DST. In December 2008, the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) ideological group was authoritatively enrolled in Queensland, supporting the usage of a double time zone course of action for sunshine sparing in South East Queensland, while the remainder of the state keeps up standard time. DS4SEQ challenged the March 2009 Queensland state decision with 32 hopefuls and got one percent of the statewide essential vote, likening to around 2.5% over the 32 electorates challenged. Following a three-year preliminary, over 55% of Western Australians casted a ballot against DST in 2009, with rustic territories firmly contradicted. Queensland Independent part Peter Wellington presented the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into the Queensland parliament on April 14, 2010, in the wake of being drawn nearer by the DS4SEQ ideological group, requiring a choice at the following state decision on the presentation of light sparing into South East Queensland under a double time zone course of action. The Bill was vanquished in the Queensland parliament on June 15, 2011.
