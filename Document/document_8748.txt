Baradwaj Rangan, composing for "The Hindu", said without a human hero, just a scoundrel and a courageous woman, the group of onlookers is "drove through a story that is clever, nostalgic, activity pressed, sentimentalÃ¢ÂÂthere's even a touch of the mysterious tossed in". Additionally for "The Hindu", Malathi Rangarajan stated, "How about we praise the illusion of [Rajamouli's] creative ability that has influenced the housefly to show up as strong as any of our muscle-flexing saints". Karishma Upadhyay of "The Telegraph" called the film "a champ from the main casing to the last" and adulated Rajamouli's screenplay, composing that it made "the ludicrous appear to be genuine, willing you to acknowledge whatever he tosses at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called "Eega" the "best, most crazy, most creative film of the year", and applauded Rajamouli's scripting, the special visualizations and Sudeep's execution, calling the last "honestly amusing". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave "Eega" four stars out of five, and lauded the exhibitions and music; Rajapur was especially energetic about the enhanced visualizations, saying the diligent work put in by the whole group was "unmistakably obvious onscreen". An analyst from Sify called "Eega" an "idealist, comic book-like dream" that "tosses you into an encounter so significant that nothing else truly matters".
