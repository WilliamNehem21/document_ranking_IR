A few variables merged to make conceivable a twenty-penny piece during the 1870s. The first was a deficiency of little change in the far West, where base-metal coins did not circle. Government installments in silver and gold had been suspended amid the financial disorder brought about by the common warÃ¢ÂÂcoins containing valuable metal were stored aside from on the Pacific Coast, and did not go without needing any proof in exchange. In spite of the fact that the base-metal nickel was not generally acknowledged in the far West, the silver half dime had been struck in expanding numbers at the San Francisco Mint until the silver coin, which did not flow in the East, was abrogated by Congress in 1873. A lack of little change came about, particularly as half dimes were utilized in the gems exchange; clients grumbled they couldn't get full change for a thing costing ten pennies for which they paid with a quarter. Costs in the West were in some cases in bits (12 pennies, in view of the old Spanish pilgrim genuine, in spite of the fact that those pieces never again coursed), adding to the change issue. Numismatist David Lange expresses that a shipment of nickels out West could have illuminated everything, except that they probably won't have been acknowledged because of the preference against cash which did not contain valuable metal.
