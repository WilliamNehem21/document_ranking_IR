"The Human Centipede" contains generally couple of shocking pictures; little of the surgery is delineated straightforwardly, no fertilizer is appeared on screen, and as indicated by Kim Newman in "Realm", it is "never entirely as over the top as it takes steps to be." Six expressed that he needed the film to be as real as could be allowed and professed to have counseled a Dutch specialist amid the creation and taping process, bringing about the film being "100% restoratively precise." Six said that the specialist at first needed nothing to do with his film, as he felt Six might have been "insane" and the thought had "nothing to do with therapeutic science." However, the specialist altered his opinion and concluded that he in actuality loved the thought, thus concocted a technique for making a human centipede. Six has asserted that the focal and back individuals from the centipede could make due for quite a long time by enhancing their eating regimen with an IV dribble. The enhancements group was driven by Rob and Erik Hillenbrink, father and child. They structured the last creation of the centipede from portrayals given by the counseling specialist. The on-screen characters who made up the centipede wore solidified clothing, contrasted by Yennie with shorts, which had an elastic hold for the on-screen characters to wear, and for the performing artist behind to chomp, making the deception of the mouth-to-rear-end association. Six stayed discreet how the centipede would be shaped as far as might be feasible, and Yennie guaranteed that even her make-up craftsman did not know, soliciting Yennie what kind from "suit" the on-screen characters would wear.
