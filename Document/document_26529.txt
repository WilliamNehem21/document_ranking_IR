Gilmore's classification was supported by the American palaeontologists Barnum Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer in their 1943 review of the dome-headed dinosaurs, by then known from 46 skulls. From these specimens, Brown and Schlaikjer named the new species "T. sternbergi" and "T. edmontonensis" (both from Alberta), as well as moving the large species "T. wyomingensis" (which was named in 1931) to the new genus "Pachycephalosaurus", along with two other species. They found "T. validus" distinct from "T. formosus", but considered "S. brevis" the female form of "T. validus", and therefore a junior synonym. By this time, the dome-headed dinosaurs were either considered relatives of ornithopods or of ankylosaurs. In 1945, after examining casts of "T. formosus" and "S. validus" teeth, the American palaeontologist Charles M. Sternberg demonstrated differences between the two, and instead suggested that "Troodon" was a theropod dinosaur, and that the dome-headed dinosaurs should be placed in their own family. Though "Stegoceras" was the first member of this family to be named, Sternberg named the group Pachycephalosauridae after the second genus, as he found that name (meaning "thick head lizard") more descriptive. He also considered "T. sternbergi" and "T. edmontonensis" members of "Stegoceras", found "S. brevis" valid, and named a new species, "S. lambei", based on a specimen formerly referred to "S. validus". The split from "Troodon" was supported by Russell in 1948, who described a theropod dentary with teeth almost identical to those of "T. formosus".
