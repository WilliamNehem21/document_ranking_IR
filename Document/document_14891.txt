Like those of different sauropods, the neck vertebrae are profoundly bifurcated; they conveyed neural spines with an extensive trough in the center, bringing about a wide, profound neck. The vertebral equation for the holotype of "A.louisae" is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may shift, even inside species. The cervical vertebrae of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" are stouter and more strong than those of different diplodocids and were observed to be most like "Camarasaurus" by Charles Whitney Gilmore. What's more, they bolster cervical ribs that expand more distant towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are smaller towards the highest point of the neck, making the neck about triangular in cross-area. In "Apatosaurus louisae", the map book hub complex of the first cervicals is about combined. The dorsal ribs are not melded or firmly joined to their vertebrae and are rather approximately verbalized. "Apatosaurus" has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body. The vast neck was loaded up with a broad arrangement of weight-sparing air sacs. "Apatosaurus", like its nearby relative "Supersaurus", has tall neural spines, which make up the greater part the stature of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The state of the tail is uncommon for a diplodocid; it is similarly thin on account of the quickly diminishing stature of the vertebral spines with expanding separation from the hips. "Apatosaurus" likewise had long ribs contrasted with most different diplodocids, giving it a bizarrely profound chest. As in different diplodocids, the tail changed into a whip-like structure towards the end.
