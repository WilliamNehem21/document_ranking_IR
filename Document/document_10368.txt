Despite the fact that the European movies enabled him to travel and gave him a consistent wellspring of salary, he got greater expenses from his less-visit commitment in US films, which he kept on showing up in, clowning that he "knew the fat checks in the pipe-line were interminable". One of the greater charges accompanied Gene Kelly's 1967 movie "A Guide for the Married Man"; he was disillusioned by Kelly's course, later saying "I discovered him a pedantic executive, not as innovative or test as I would have preferred". Terry-Thomas possessed more energy for the performing artist with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, remarking that "I discovered her fairly astute to converse with and felt very broken when I read about the abhorrent auto crash that slaughtered her". A performing artist he experienced issues in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film "Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?", which was delivered by her significant other Martin Melcher. Day would teach Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would "listenÃÂ ... pleasantly, at that point do it my own specific manner, as though the discussion had never occurred"). She would likewise dispatch into spontaneous creations while shooting; chief Hy Averback would mirror a scissor activity despite her good faith to motion to Terry-Thomas that the material would be properly cut from the last print. The outcome was a film that Geoff Mayer called "limp", and Christopher Young portrayed as "such an uneven motion picture, that botches such a significant number of chances for genuine parody".
