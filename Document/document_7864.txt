As oneself pronounced "Pimp General of All England", the swaggering Harris amassed an extensive fortune, yet his rashness ended up being his demise. Provoked by reformers, in April 1758 the experts started to chase down and close "places of sick popularity". Covent Garden was not saved, and the Shakespear's Head Tavern was struck. Harris was gotten, secured up in the nearby compter, and after that detained in Newgate. He was discharged in 1761 and had a few interests in distributing from 1765 to 1766, printing Edward Thompson's "The Courtesan", and later "The Fruit-Shop" and "Kitty's Atlantis", yet he appears to have surrendered this late in 1766. He turned into the owner of the Rose Tavern, not a long way from the Shakespear's Head, however by the 1780s had appointed its hurrying to a worker. The Rose was destroyed around 1790, and for a couple of years Harris ran another bar, the Bedford Head, with his child and little girl in-law. He kicked the bucket at some point in 1792. The Shakespear's Head shut for business in 1804, and after four years the vacant premises were severely harmed in a similar flame that expended the Covent Garden Theater. What remained was subsumed by the neighboring Bedford Coffee House.
