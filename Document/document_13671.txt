While the bill was being discussed, the news broke on February 16, 1946, of the abandonment of Igor Gouzenko in Canada, and the consequent capture of 22 individuals. The individuals from Congress discussing the bill expected that "nuclear privileged insights" were by and large efficiently stolen by Soviet nuclear covert agents. McMahon gathered an official session at which Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and Groves were called to show up. Forests uncovered that the British physicist Alan Nunn May had passed data about the Manhattan Project to Soviet specialists. The more moderate components in Congress currently moved to toughen the demonstration. Segment 10, which was in the past titled "Scattering of Information", presently moved toward becoming "Control of Information". Agent Helen Gahagan Douglas, who supported the McMahon bill in the House, vivaciously safeguarded the segment against counterarguments. She rejected protests that it would "give away the mystery of the bomb", declaring that America's favorable position in atomic weapons must be transitory, while the bill could sustain the U.S. lead in logical research. Truman marked the trade off bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. It set up the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as the controlling body for nuclear vitality.
