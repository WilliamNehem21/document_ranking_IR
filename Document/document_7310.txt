In January 1940, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Jimmy Goble, proposed sorting out the RAAF along practical lines with Home Defense, Training, and Maintenance Commands, yet the Federal government did not take up this arrangement. Goble was supplanted in February by a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, who focussed on fast extension of the RAAF to address the issues of the Empire Air Training Scheme and trusted that Australia's gigantic land mass would make an utilitarian order framework inconvenient. He continued to revamp the Air Force into a geologically based "zone" framework. The jobs of every region order were the equivalent: air barrier, security of neighboring ocean paths, and aeronautical observation. Every zone was driven by an Air Officer Commanding (AOC) who was in charge of the organization and activities all things considered and units inside his limit. Special cases to this approach included airplane stations and the Central Flying School that prepared flying educators, as their scope of obligations crossed territory limits and thusly went under the immediate control of RAAF Headquarters. The static zone framework was basically guarded in nature, however thought to be appropriate to preparing new pilots, who could be told at flying schools and tutored through their underlying squadron postings, all inside the equivalent geological district.
