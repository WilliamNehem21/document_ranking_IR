While steadily intensifying, the system turned toward the north. On AprilÂ 5, the JMA named the system Sudal, after assessing its maximum sustained winds at 65Â km/h (40Â mph ). Concurrently, the JTWC estimated winds of 100Â km/h (65Â km/h ). After crossing over the island of Poluwat, a building ridge to the north caused Sudal to turn west-southwestward. On AprilÂ 6, an eye feature began forming, and the JTWC upgraded Sudal to typhoon strength about southeast of Guam, a small island under possession of the United States. The JMA did not follow suit until late the following day, by which time the eye had become more distinct. Around that time, the typhoon turned toward the northwest, and initially it was thought that Sudal would pass safely north of Yap in the FSM. Instead, it turned to the west-southwest toward the island as the ridge intensified. On AprilÂ 8, the typhoon intensified rapidly; the JTWC reported winds of 215Â km/h (135Â mph ), or the equivalent of a CategoryÂ 4 on the SaffirâSimpson hurricane scale. Weakening slightly as its forward motion slowed, Typhoon Sudal passed about south of Yap at 0000Â UTC on AprilÂ 9, which was its closest approach to the island.
