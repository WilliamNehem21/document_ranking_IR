The conduct of the spotted green pigeon was not recorded, yet speculations have been proposed dependent on its physical highlights. Gibbs found the fragile, part-feathered legs and long tail demonstrative of at any rate mostly arboreal propensities. Subsequent to noticing that the wings were not short all things considered, van Grouw expressed that the fowl would not have been earthbound, not at all like the related Nicobar pigeon. He called attention to that the general extents and state of the flying creature (longer tail, shorter legs, essential plumes most likely achieving the center of the tail) was increasingly like the pigeons of the variety "Ducula". It might thusly have been biologically like those winged animals, have moreover been emphatically arboreal, and kept to the thick shade of woodlands. Paradoxically, the primarily earthbound Nicobar pigeon rummages on the backwoods floor. According to the Nicobar pigeon are commonplace of species that rummage on backwoods floors, while the shaded bill and probably hued eyes of the spotted green pigeon are like those of frugivorous (organic product eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted green pigeon are additionally like those of pigeons that scrounge in trees. The slim bill demonstrates that it benefited from delicate natural products.
