Thirteen years passed before LabillardiÃ¨re published a formal description of "A.Â cuneatus", and in the meantime several further collections were made: Scottish botanist Robert Brown collected a specimen on 30 December 1801, during the visit of HMS "Investigator" to King George Sound; and, fourteen months later, Jean-Baptiste Leschenault de La Tour, botanist to Nicolas Baudin's voyage of exploration, and "gardener's boy" Antoine Guichenot collected more specimens therein. The official account of Baudin's expedition contain notes from Leschenault on vegetation:
LabillardiÃ¨re eventually published the genus "Adenanthos", along with "A.Â cuneatus" and two other species, in his 1805 "Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen". He chose the specific name "cuneata" in reference to the leaves of this species, which are cuneate (triangular). This name has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by LabillardiÃ¨re to the genus. He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the type species of "Adenanthos", but Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson has since chosen "A.Â cuneatus" as lectotype for the genus, since the holotype of "A.Â cuneatus" bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because LabillardiÃ¨re's description of it is the most detailed of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.
