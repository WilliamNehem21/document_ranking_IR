Songbird deals with "Lazarus" at least ten hours out of each day. He utilizes photograph references and advanced devices in the beginning periods of his craft, however the formats and drawing are finished with conventional apparatuses. He is increasingly included with the shading on "Lazarus" than some other comic he has outlined. The logo configuration was finished by Trautmann and Lark. Warbler at first did the majority of the lettering and inking for "Lazarus", yet doing as such made it difficult to discharge new issues on a standard calendar. To give him more opportunity to concentrate on illustration, a portion of the littler assignments like logo and type configuration were given to other individuals. Brian Level helped with inking on issues three through ten, when he was supplanted by Tyler Boss. Starting with issue ten, Jodi Wynne assumed control over the lettering obligations and Owen Freeman began making the spread craftsmanship. Counterfeit promotions found on the back spreads and a considerable lot of the PC screens and holographic pictures in the work of art are made by Trautmann. Songbird and Rucka frequently talk about whether to utilize audio effects in scenes or cutoff their utilization. Songbird does not have any desire to depend on them to pass on data since they may turn into a "bolster" instead of incorporating vital subtleties in the craftsmanship.
