In 119 BC, the government provided the bronze "wushu" (Ã¤ÂºÂÃ©ÂÂ) coin gauging ; the coin remained the standard money in China until the Tang tradition (618Ã¢ÂÂ 907 AD). Amid the concise interruptive Xin tradition (9Ã¢ÂÂ 23 AD) of Wang Mang (45 BCÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ 23 AD), the administration presented a few new divisions in 7, 9, 10, and 14 AD. These new units (counting bronze blade cash, gold, silver, tortoise, and cowry shell monetary forms) frequently had a market value unequal to their weight and corrupted the estimation of coin money. When the boundless common wars following Wang's oust decreased, the "wushu" coin was reintroduced by Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25Ã¢ÂÂ 57 AD) in 40 AD at the prompting of Ma Yuan (14 BCÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ 49 AD). Since commandery-issued coins were frequently of sub-par quality and lighter weight, the focal government shut all commandery mints in 113 BC and allowed the focal government's Superintendent of Waterways and Parks the selective ideal to mint coins. In spite of the fact that the issue of focal government coinage was exchanged to the workplace of the Minister of Finance (one of Nine Ministers of the focal government) by the start of Eastern Han, the focal government's imposing business model over the issue of coinage endured.
