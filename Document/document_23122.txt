The company owned 54Â ships during its 122Â years of existence, many being small cargo vessels. Originally, all of the line's steamboats were of wooden construction with side paddlewheels and used wood logs for fuel. The first boat with an iron hull acquired by the Old Bay Line was the "Georgeanna", in 1860. By the late 1870s, the company had acquired its last paddlewheel steamers: "Florida", "Carolina", and "Virginia". Later, ships would use coal for fuel until the 1930s, when oil began to be used. Beginning with the "Georgia" built in 1887, their ships used the more modern propeller or "screw" design. The "Georgia" also was the first Old Bay Line vessel to be equipped with electric lighting and steam heating. Passenger ships of the line provided large, lavishly furnished staterooms to accommodate passengers on the overnight trip. The "Alabama" built in 1892 represented the inception of modern shipbuilding and design for the Old Bay Line: the first vessel to have a steel hull instead of iron or wood and propelled by a four-cylinder triple-expansion reciprocating engine, the same type engine that all of the line's later steamers would have.
