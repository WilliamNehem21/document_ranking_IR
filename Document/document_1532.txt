Shaw had started his profession in the workplace of William Burn and had later concentrated under Anthony Salvin and George Edmund Street. Salvin had shown him the dominance of inside arranging which was basic for the structure of the substantial and very variegated houses which the Victorian rich pined for. Salvin and Street had instructed him to comprehend the Gothic Revival. At just 24, he won the RIBA Gold Medal and Traveling Studentship. The association among Armstrong and Shaw was made when Armstrong acquired an image, "Ruler Hal taking the crown from his dad's bedside" by John Callcott Horsley, which demonstrated too extensive to even think about fitting into his town house in Jesmond, Newcastle. Horsley, a companion of both, prescribed that Shaw structure an augmentation to the banqueting lobby Armstrong had recently worked in the grounds. At the point when this was finished in 1869, Shaw was approached to propose expansions and enhancements to the shooting lodge Armstrong had worked at Rothbury nearly four years sooner. This was the beginning of the change of the house somewhere in the range of 1869 and 1884. Throughout the following thirty years, Cragside turned into the focal point of Armstrong's reality; thinking back years after the fact, in his maturity, he commented, "had there been no Cragside, I shouldn't talk you todayfor it has been my very life".
