Jackson turned down an idea to keep running for legislative leader of his home state, yet acknowledged John Overton's arrangement to have the governing body name him for president. On July 22, 1822, he was authoritatively designated by the Tennessee lawmaking body. Jackson had come to despise Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford, who had been the most vocal pundit of Jackson in Monroe's bureau, and he would have liked to keep Tennessee's constituent votes from going to Crawford. However Jackson's selection accumulated an inviting reaction even outside of Tennessee, the same number of Americans valued Jackson's assaults on banks. The Panic of 1819 had crushed the fortunes of many, and banks and government officials seen as steady of banks were especially disagreeable. With his developing political reasonability, Jackson rose as one of the five noteworthy presidential hopefuls, alongside Crawford, Adams, Clay, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun. Amid the Era of Good Feelings, the Federalist Party had blurred away, and each of the five presidential contenders were individuals from the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson's crusade advanced him as a safeguard of the ordinary citizens, just as the one competitor who could transcend sectional divisions. On the serious issues of the day, most noticeably the tax, Jackson communicated moderate convictions, and adversaries blamed him for jumbling his positions. At the front line of Jackson's crusade was combatting debasement. Jackson pledged to reestablish trustworthiness in government and to downsize its abundances.
