The ballpark's structure is motivated by Nashville's legacy, as plan components all through the recreation center consolidate melodic and baseball symbolism to interface the recreation center with the city's past. Directional signs are joined by data about previous Nashville players, for example, Al Maul, Tom Rogers, and Turkey Stearnes. The recreation center's suites incorporate shows about Sulfur Dell, the Nashville Vols, a small time group that played there from 1901 to 1961, and in 1963, and other past groups from Nashville. The back of the outfield divider's green metal player's eye has a tin sign denoting the previous area of Sulfur Dell's marquee proclaiming, "Site of Sulfur Dell, Baseball's Most Historic Park, 1870Ã¢ÂÂ 1963". A progression of nine vertical boards on the correct field scenic route give data on the historical backdrop of baseball in Nashville from the 1860s through 1963. Another five boards past left field detail certainties about the ancient times of the site. Light stanchions in the show off and the outfield look like the lights introduced at Sulfur Dell. Subtleties including guitar pick-molded seating signage and the utilization of the Sounds' hues distinguish the ballpark with Nashville's blue grass music legacy and mirror the visual personality of the group.
