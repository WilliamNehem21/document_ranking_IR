At present, both "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" are characterized inside the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson expressed in 2005 that synonymy can't be discounted. Currie and associates, in 2003 and 2017, contended that a synonymy is entirely plausible in the light of new fossil disclosures in the Nemegt Formation. Subsequent to migrating the first "Nemegtosaurus" quarry, these specialists unearthed postcranial bones of the "Nemegtosaurus" holotype including the centrum of a caudal vertebra and rear appendage bones, which permitted, out of the blue, an immediate examination between the "Nemegtosaurus" and "Opisthocoelicaudia" type examples dependent on covering components. These postcranial components were observed to be fundamentally the same as the relating portions of the "Opisthocoelicaudia" holotype. Above all, the found caudal centrum is opisthocoelous Ã¢ÂÂ a symptomatic component of "Opisthocoelicaudia" Ã¢ÂÂ proposing that the two genera were either firmly related or synonymous. Besides, these creators noticed that none of the 32 known sauropod areas of the Nemegt Formation uncovered proof for the nearness of more than one types of sauropod. In her first portrayal, Borsuk-BiaÃÂynicka (1977) contended that diverse sauropod genera having a similar territory is not all that much, as is clear in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and partners, notwithstanding, focused on that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was in a general sense extraordinary, as bigger dinosaurs were available with just couple of species per clade, demonstrating a brutal and topographically limited environment. Authoritative verification for the proposed synonymy is, be that as it may, in any case missing, and extra covering components would be required before "Opisthocoelicaudia" and "Nemegtosaurus" can be formally proclaimed equivalent words.
