Alexios unavoidably understood the significance of having his own armada, and in spite of his distraction with land tasks, he made moves to restore the naval force's quality. His endeavors bore some achievement, particularly in countering the endeavors by Turkish emirs like Tzachas of Smyrna to dispatch armadas in the Aegean. The armada under John Doukas was in this way used to smother revolts in Crete and Cyprus. With the guide of the Crusaders, Alexios had the capacity to recapture the banks of Western Anatolia and grow his impact eastwards: in 1104, a Byzantine squadron of 10 ships caught Laodicea and other beach front towns to the extent Tripoli. By 1118, Alexios had the capacity to pass on a little naval force to his successor, John II Komnenos (1118Ã¢ÂÂ 1143). Like his dad, John II focused on the military and ordinary land-based crusades, however he took care to keep up the naval force's quality and provisioning framework. In 1122, in any case, John would not restore the exchanging benefits that Alexios had allowed to the Venetians. In striking back, the Venetians pillaged a few Byzantine islands, and, with the Byzantine armada unfit to stand up to them, John was compelled to recharge the settlement in 1125. Obviously the Byzantine naval force now was not adequately ground-breaking for John to effectively go up against Venice, particularly since there were other squeezing requests on the Empire's assets. Not long after this occurrence, John II, following up on the exhortation of his money serve John of Poutza, is accounted for to have sliced financing to the armada and exchanged it to the military, preparing ships on a "specially appointed" premise as it were.
