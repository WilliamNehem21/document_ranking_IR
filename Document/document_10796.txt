Grown-up mayflies, or imagos, are generally crude in structure, displaying attributes that were most likely present in the principal flying creepy crawlies. These incorporate long tails and wings that don't overlay level over the belly. Mayflies are fragile looking bugs with a couple of sets of membranous, triangular wings, which are broadly secured with veins. Very still, the wings are held upstanding, similar to those of a butterfly. The rear wings are a lot littler than the forewings and might be minimal or missing. The second portion of the thorax, which bears the forewings, is amplified to hold the principle flight muscles. Grown-ups have short, adaptable reception apparatuses, huge compound eyes, three ocelli and non-practical mouthparts. In many species, the guys' eyes are extensive and the front legs uncommonly long, for use in finding and getting a handle on females amid the mid-air mating. In the guys of certain families, there are two vast tube shaped "turban" eyes that face upwards notwithstanding the horizontal eyes. They are fit for distinguishing bright light and are believed to be utilized amid romance to identify females hovering above them. In certain species, every one of the legs are functionless, aside from the front pair in guys. The mid-region is long and generally barrel shaped, with ten fragments and a few long cerci (tail-like members) at the tip. Exceptionally among bugs, mayflies have matched genitalia, with the male having two aedeagi (penis-like organs) and the female two gonopores (sexual openings).
