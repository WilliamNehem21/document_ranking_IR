There is some proof to recommend a conceivable exhibition in Dubrovnik, in or some time after 1620; a Croatian interpretation of the lyrics was distributed in Ancona in 1633. In any case, the main known recovery of the work came in Venice, in 1640. Open theater musical show had gone to the city in March 1637, when the new Teatro San Cassiano opened with an exhibition of "L'Andromeda" by Francesco Manelli. The prevalence of this and different works prompted more venues changing over their offices for musical show; "L'Arianna" was picked to initiate the Teatro San MoisÃÂ¨ as a musical drama house amid the 1639Ã¢ÂÂ 40 Carnival (the exact date of this execution isn't recorded). A modified adaptation of the lyrics had been distributed in 1639, with significant cuts and amendments from the 1608 rendition to evacuate sections excessively explicitly connected to the Mantuan wedding. The author, who was by then 73 years of age, had obtained extensive eminence in Venice, having been executive of music at St Mark's Basilica since 1613. The devotion in the reexamined and republished lyrics portrays him as "[the] most observed Apollo of the century and the most astounding insight of the sky of humankind". The musical drama was gotten with extraordinary energy by a Venetian crowd effectively acquainted with the regret, which had been distributed in the city in 1623. Inside half a month the performance center supplanted "L'Arianna" with Monteverdi's new musical show "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria", which demonstrated a considerably more noteworthy achievement.
