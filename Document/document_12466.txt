"In Utero" was discharged on September 13, 1993, on vinyl record and tape in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 on vinyl in the United States, with the American vinyl squeezing restricted to 25,000 duplicates. In spite of the fact that the collection was issued on smaller plate in the U.K. on September 14, a full local discharge did not happen until September 21. "In Utero" dÃÂ©buted at number one on the "Board" 200 collection diagram, selling 180,000 duplicates in its first seven day stretch of discharge. In the interim, retail chain stores Wal-Mart and Kmart wouldn't sell the collection. As indicated by "The New York Times", Wal-Mart asserted it didn't convey the collection because of absence of shopper request, while Kmart delegates clarified that the collection "didn't fit inside our stock blend". In truth, the two chains expected that clients would be irritated by the work of art on the collection's back spread. DGC issued another rendition of the collection with improved bundling to the stores in March 1994. This adaptation highlighted altered collection work of art, recorded the name of "Assault Me" as "Whithered stray Me", and incorporated a Scott Litt remix of "Pennyroyal Tea". A representative for Nirvana clarified that the band chose to alter the bundling in light of the fact that as children Cobain and Novoselic were just ready to purchase music from the two chain stores; subsequently they "truly need to make their music accessible to kids who don't have the chance to go to mother and-pop stores".
