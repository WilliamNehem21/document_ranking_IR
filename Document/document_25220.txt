During the seventeenth century the "bonshÅ "was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; possession of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei is said to have dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend to be the result of Benkei's kicking the bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara TÅda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity RyÅ«jin, after saving the god from a giant centipede.
After the HÅkÅ-ji temple burned down at the start of the seventeenth century, Toyotomi Hideyori sponsored its reconstruction in 1610, and commissioned a large bell as part of that process. The bell's inscription drew the ire of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who had become "shÅgun" after wresting power from the Toyotomi clan when Hideyori's father Hideyoshi died. The inscription, ""Kokka ankÅ"" ("Peace and tranquility for the nation"), broke up the characters for the shogun's name () with the kanji character for "peace" (). Tokugawa assumed Toyotomi was implying that peace would require the "dismemberment" of the Tokugawa. He used the subsequent dispute as an excuse to wage war on the Toyotomi clan, resulting in the Siege of Osaka and the eventual destruction of the Toyotomi.
