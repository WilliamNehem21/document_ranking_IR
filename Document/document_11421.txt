The last part of I-8 in California, between Japatul Valley Road and west of Boulevard, was organized in the 1969Ã¢ÂÂ 1970 state spending plan. Because of money related concerns, it was declared in September 1968 that the deadline for finishing the Interstate Highway System would be reached out until 1974, from 1972. The missing segment of I-8 was required to cost $45ÃÂ million and be developed in three sections, with one section being begun every year. The sections between Japatul Valley Road and west of Laguna Junction, and from La Posta Road to west of Boulevard, were deferred for a whole year toward the finish of 1969 because of an across the country exertion to battle swelling by diminishing spending. A fragment from Buckman Springs to Crestwood got subsidizing in May 1970, which would leave just a stretch of the interstate uncompleted when fabricated. The drive time from San Diego to El Centro had been decreased to two hours, as indicated by the California Division of Highways. By AugustÃÂ 1970, the rest of the turnpike had been supported, with the part from Japatul Valley Road to Laguna Junction costing $22ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars), and the Laguna Junction to Crestwood partition costing $15ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars).
