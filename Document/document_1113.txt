Development of the interstate and expressway expansion started in December 2006, with the entire venture at that point called the New Perth Bunbury Highway. The work was embraced by an association of Main Roads, Leighton Contractors, WA Limestone and GHD, known as the Southern Gateway Alliance. The venture comprised of a turnpike standard augmentation to the extent South Yunderup Road in South Yunderup, and a parkway standard double carriageway to Old Coast Road at Lake Clifton. Taking traffic around the eastern side of the Peel-Harvey Estuary before joining the current double carriageway on Old Coast Road diminished the adventure time from Perth to Bunbury. The last street names were not known until mid 2009, when Transport Minister Simon O'Brien uncovered that the area south of Pinjarra Road would be known as Forrest Highway, with the segment toward the north to turn out to be a piece of Kwinana Freeway. The expressway's name honors Sir John Forrest, the state's first head. The Kwinana Freeway augmentation and Forrest Highway were opened on 20 September 2009, with a service held at the trade between the turnpike, interstate, and Pinjarra Road. The streets were formally opened by Premier Colin Barnett, Senator Chris Evans, Transport Minister Simon O'Brien, Member for Canning Don Randall, and the past Transport Minister Alannah MacTiernan. The $705 million venture (equal to $ million in ) was mutually supported by the state and national governments, which contributed $375 million and $330 million separately (proportionate to $ million and $ million in ). At the time it opened, it was Western Australia's biggest ever street foundation venture.
