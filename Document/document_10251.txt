In , an examination station of the Dharma Initiative, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) is caught by the inhabitant Others Greta (Lana Parrilla) and Bonnie (Tracy Middendorf). Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) learns of Charlie's invasion and sends Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff) to the station to execute the three to protect the flag sticking. Mikhail arrives and kills Greta and Bonnie, just to be shot through the chest with a lance firearm by Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) who rises up out of a wardrobe where he had covered up in the wake of plunging down a brief timeframe after Charlie. Getting the code from Bonnie before she passes on (the notes to the center eight of "Good Vibrations" by The Beach Boys), Charlie debilitates the jammer, and is reached by Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) by means of video transmission. Penny illuminates Charlie that she doesn't know Naomi, and did not send the watercraft that Naomi professes to be from. Notwithstanding his damage, Mikhail figures out how to swim out of the station and shoots the window of the sticking room with an explosive, murdering himself and flooding the interchanges room. Charlie locks the way to spare Desmond from suffocating with him, however before he suffocates, Charlie composes on his hand so Desmond can peruse: "NOT PENNY'S BOAT".
