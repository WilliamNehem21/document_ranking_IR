"A. pinnatum" and the other three tree waratah species lie in the subtribe Embothriinae, along with the true waratahs ("Telopea"), "Oreocallis" and the Chilean firetree ("Embothrium coccineum") from South America. Almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal (arising at the ends of branches), and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predates the splitting of the supercontinent Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest that they are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters in the Eocene. "Triporopollenites ambiguus" is an ancient member of the proteaceae known only from pollen deposits, originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of the Tasmanian waratah ("Telopea truncata"), "A. pinnatum" and "Oreocallis grandiflora". Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed "A.Â pinnatum" to be the earliest offshoot within the genus and sister to the other three species. Along with members of other genera in the Embothriinae, "A.Â pinnatum" has crimson pollen, while the other three "Alloxylon" species have yellow pollen. Hence it is likely that the ancestral pollen colour was red, and remained so with the emergence of the genus "Alloxylon", yet changed to yellow after the divergence of "A.Â pinnatum".
