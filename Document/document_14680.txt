In February 1908, "Deutschland" took part in armada moves in the Baltic Sea. With Wilhelm II on board, she was available for the dispatch of the main German gunboat war vessel, , on 7 March, and thereafter conveyed the Kaiser to visit the island of Helgoland in the German Bight, joined by the light cruiser . In MayÃ¢ÂÂ June, armada preparing was directed off Helgoland; Crown Prince Wilhelm, the Kaiser's child, watched the activities on board "Deutschland". In July 1908, "Deutschland" and the remainder of the armada cruised into the Atlantic Ocean to lead a noteworthy preparing voyage. Sovereign Heinrich had squeezed for such a journey the earlier year, contending that it would set up the armada for abroad activities and would separate the tedium of preparing in German waters, however strains with Britain over the creating Anglo-German maritime weapons contest were high. The armada left Kiel on 17 July, went through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal toward the North Sea, and proceeded to the Atlantic. Amid the voyage, "Deutschland" ceased at Funchal, Portugal and Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The armada came back to Germany on 13 August. The harvest time moves pursued from 27 August to 12 September. Soon thereafter, the armada visited beach front German urban communities as a component of a push to expand open help for maritime uses.
