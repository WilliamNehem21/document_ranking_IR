The government created on MayÂ 25 pronounced itself loyal to the deposed King of Spain FerdinandÂ VII, but historians disagree on whether this was sincere or not. Since Mitre, many historians think that this professed loyalty was merely a political deception to gain autonomy. The Primera Junta did not pledge allegiance to the Council of Regency, which was still in operation, and in 1810 it still seemed unlikely that Napoleon would be defeated and Ferdinand returned to the throne (which finally happened on DecemberÂ 11, 1813, with the Treaty of ValenÃ§ay). The purpose of such a deception would have been to gain time to strengthen the position of the patriotic cause and avoid reactions that may have led to a counter-revolution, by making it appear that monarchical authority was still respected and that no revolution had taken place. The ruse is known as the "Mask of FerdinandÂ VII". It was upheld by the Primera Junta, the Junta Grande and the First Triumvirate. The Assembly of YearÂ XIII was intended to declare independence, but failed to do so because of other political conflicts between its members. However, it suppressed mention of FerdinandÂ VII in official documents. Before the declaration of independence of 1816, the supreme directors considered other options, such as to negotiate with Spain or become a British protectorate.
