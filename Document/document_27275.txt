Stowe was partly inspired to create "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by the slave narrative "The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself" (1849). Henson, a formerly enslaved black man, had lived and worked on a 3,700-acre (15Â km) tobacco plantation in North Bethesda, Maryland, owned by Isaac Riley. Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the Province of Upper Canada (now Ontario), where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become self-sufficient, and where he wrote his memoirs. Stowe acknowledged in 1853 that Henson's writings inspired "Uncle Tom's Cabin". When Stowe's work became a best-seller, Henson republished his memoirs as "The Memoirs of Uncle Tom" and traveled on lecture tours extensively in the United States and Europe. Stowe's novel lent its name to Henson's homeâUncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site, near Dresden, Ontario, Canadaâwhich since the 1940s has been a museum. The cabin where Henson lived while he was enslaved no longer exists, but a cabin on the Riley farm erroneously thought to be the Henson Cabin was purchased by the Montgomery County, Maryland, government in 2006. It is now a part of the National Park Service National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program, and plans are underway to build a museum and interpretive center on the site.
