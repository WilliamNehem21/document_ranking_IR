"Bismarck" left the Kiel Fjord on the morning of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, "Bismarck" reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here "Bismarck" conducted a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now GdaÅsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, "Bismarck" reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, "Bismarck" was almost impossible to steer.
In November 1940, Von MÃ¼llenheim-Rechberg was sent to the Naval Gunnery School at Wik to complete his heavy gun training courses, which ended his position as Lindemann's personal adjutant. Lindemann's new adjutant was the signals officer Second Lieutenant Wolfgang Reiner. "Bismarck"s heavy guns were first test-fired in the second half of November, and "Bismarck" was shown to be a very stable gun platform. After the 1940 Christmas celebration on board, Lindemann and the majority of the officers, non-commissioned officers and sailors went on home leave. First gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider relieved Lindemann as "Bismarck"s commander during his absence. Lindemann spent his leave with his wife and daughter and returned on 1 January 1941.
