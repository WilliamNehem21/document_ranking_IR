Prior to the 2014 season, the Sounds, Metro Nashville, and the State of Tennessee concluded an arrangement to fabricate another ballpark to supplant Greer Stadium toward the start of the 2015 season. On August 27, 2014, the Sounds facilitated the last amusement at Greer, a 8Ã¢ÂÂ 5 misfortune to the Sacramento River Cats. In his solitary plate appearance, Nashville catcher Lucas May hit out swinging with a full check and the bases stacked to end the amusement. The participation was a standing-room-just horde of 11,067, the main sellout since 2010, and the biggest group since 2007. The group, driven by veteran small time administrator Rick Sweet, completed the season with a 76Ã¢ÂÂ 67 record, in second spot, more than two amusements behind Memphis. Jimmy Nelson, the Brewers' top prospect toward the beginning of the period, was chosen PCL Pitcher of the Year; he got everything except one of the votes in the wake of posting a group driving 1.46ÃÂ ERA. Tim Dillard set the establishment vocation records for wins (39) and innings pitched (556Ã¢ÂÂ) from 2007 to 2014. The Sounds disjoined ties with the Brewers, with whom they had the longest connection in establishment history, after the 2014 season refering to poor on-field execution from late Brewers Triple-A groups. They had a 723Ã¢ÂÂ 713 record in their ten years as a Brewers partner. By and large, the Sounds' 37-year record remained at 2,728Ã¢ÂÂ 2,573.
