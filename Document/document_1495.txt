Storm Diane was the costliest Atlantic sea tempest of now is the right time. One of three typhoons to hit North Carolina amid the 1955 Atlantic sea tempest season, it framed on AugustÃÂ 7 from a tropical wave between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Diane at first moved west-northwestward with little change in its force, yet started to fortify quickly in the wake of swinging toward the north-upper east. On AugustÃÂ 12, the sea tempest achieved top continued breezes of 105ÃÂ mph (165ÃÂ km/h), making it a Category 2 sea tempest. Bit by bit debilitating in the wake of veering back west, Diane made landfall close Wilmington, North Carolina, as a solid typhoon on AugustÃÂ 17, only five days after Hurricane Connie struck close to a similar zone. Diane debilitated further in the wake of moving inland, so, all things considered the United States Weather Bureau noticed a diminished danger of further decimation. The tempest swung toward the upper east, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record precipitation over the northeastern United States. On AugustÃÂ 19, Diane rose into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, getting to be extratropical two days after the fact and totally dispersing by AugustÃÂ 23.
