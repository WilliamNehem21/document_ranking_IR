Amon Amarth and Unleashed's music could be portrayed as death metal, yet it joins Viking expressive subjects and along these lines the groups are considered to have expanded the extent of Viking metal. While Norse fantasies were for the most part essential for dark metal, particularly the mid 1990s Norwegian scene, just as for the more youthful agnostic metal classification, groups as the Swedish Unleashed began fitting these legends into death metal even before Amon Amarth showed up. Released set a point of reference for a considerable lot of the coming dark metal groups by shying far from the regular passing metal topic of violence and rather concentrating on pre-Christian Swedish heathenism, especially the Viking Age and old Norse religion. Both Amon Amarth and Unleashed, notwithstanding, oppose the Viking metal name. Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth expressed, "It's abnormal to mark a band after the melodious substance on the grounds that, all things considered, Iron Maiden is a Viking metal band, Black Sabbath is a Viking metal band, Led Zeppelin is a Viking metal band." Johnny Hedlund of Unleashed keeps up that the band has constantly played and dependably will play demise metal, remarking, "The Viking verses you will discover on around three to five tunes on each Unleashed collection from 1991 and on. I don't imagine that reality alone re-characterizes our style here and there."
