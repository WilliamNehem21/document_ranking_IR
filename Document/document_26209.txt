In 1990, Moore began working with stage director Andre Gregory on a workshop theatre production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya". Described by Moore as "one of the most fundamentally important acting experiences I ever had", the group spent four years exploring the text and giving intimate performances to friends. Also in 1990, Moore made her cinematic debut as a mummy's victim in "", a low-budget horror that she later described as "terrible". Her next film role, in 1992, introduced her to a wide audience. The thriller "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"Â â in which she played the main character's ill-fated friendÂ â was number one at the US box office, and Moore caught the attention of several critics with her performance. She followed it the same year with the crime comedy "The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag", appearing as the protagonist's kooky sister. Moore continued to play supporting roles throughout 1993, first featuring in the erotic thriller "Body of Evidence" as Madonna's love rival. The film was a failure and widely mocked, and she later regretted her involvement. She had greater success in a 1993 romantic comedy with Johnny Depp. In "Benny & Joon", she played a gentle waitress who falls for Aidan Quinn's character, Benny. Moore also appeared briefly as a doctor in one of the year's biggest hits, the Harrison Ford thriller "The Fugitive".
