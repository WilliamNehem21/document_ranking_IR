From 16 September, the AASC officer at every station revealed the stock dimensions at 18:00 every day. Requests for provisions were sent from the Q Branch at New Guinea Force home office to the Deputy Director of Supplies and Transport. This was coordinated with the number and kind of accessible airplane. Trucks drew the stores from the stops, where they were bundled and arranged for dropping, and took them to the aerodrome, typically Jackson or Kila. As time passed by, standard burden records were created. Bundles of apportions were "balanced"Ã¢ÂÂ organized so they contained a total arrangement of itemsÃ¢ÂÂwith the goal that the loss of certain bundles would not result in surpluses of one product and deficiencies of another. One truck was designated to each plane, in addition to one extra truck in the event that another flying machine wound up accessible. Each plane would be stacked with the substance of one truck. Planes may come back with a few or the majority of their heap, or not take off by any stretch of the imagination. By the day's end, stores staying on airplane would be stacked back onto the trucks, and would be come back to the warehouses. Some were despatched via air supply in August, in September, and in October. New drop zones were created around Efogi, Nauro and Manari. Myola was recovered on 14 October, and Myola 1 and 2 were created as drop zones.
