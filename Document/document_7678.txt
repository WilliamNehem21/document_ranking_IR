The last match of the arrangement was drawn, fundamentally in light of the fact that the pitch vigorously supported batting. MacLaren was associated with another determination debate when the quick bowler Claude Buckenham was let well enough alone for the England group at his affectation. The "Wisden" coordinate report depicted this choice as "so grave a bumble that it is hard to discover words in which to talk about it." The "Wisden" supervisor, Sydney Pardon, remarked: "A lethal bungle was submitted in forgetting BuckenhamÃ¢ÂÂa screw up for which it was commonly comprehended that MacLaren was mindful. Specialists every so often do bizarre things and this was one of the most abnormal. Letting England go into the field in fine climate, on a run of the mill Oval wicket, with no quick bowler aside from Sharp contacted the bounds of lunacy." Further issues emerged over MacLaren's treatment of his bowlers, and "Wisden" proposed "MacLaren was tragically to blame in his administration of the England bowling". Douglas Carr, a 37-year-old, was called into the group after some accomplishment in going before diversions and on the reason that the Australians would be unfit to play his googly. After Carr had starting achievement, MacLaren kept him bowling for a significant lot until the player tired and was effectively rebuffed by the batsmen. In his solitary innings, MacLaren scored 12, and when the match finished, a significant part of the fault for England's disappointments was allocated to him. In the arrangement, he scored 85 keeps running at 12.14. The Oval match was his last Test coordinate; in 35 amusements he had scored 1,931 keeps running at 33.87.
