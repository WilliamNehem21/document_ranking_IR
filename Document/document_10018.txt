A risk to Richard's position still existed, in any case, as the House of Lancaster, spoken to by John of Gaunt and his child Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford. The House of Lancaster not just had more noteworthy riches than some other family in England, they were of regal plummet and, in that capacity, likely contender to succeed the childless Richard. Disunity broke out in the inward circles of court in December 1397, when Bolingbroke and Mowbray ended up entangled in a squabble. As indicated by Bolingbroke, Mowbray had asserted that the two, as previous Lords Appellant, were next in line for illustrious revenge. Mowbray energetically denied these charges, accordingly a case would have added up to injustice. A parliamentary advisory group chose that the two should settle the issue by fight, yet ultimately Richard banished the two dukes rather: Mowbray forever, Bolingbroke for a long time. On 3 February 1399, John of Gaunt passed on. Instead of enabling Bolingbroke to succeed, Richard expanded the term of his outcast to life and dispossessed his properties. The lord felt safe from Bolingbroke, who was dwelling in Paris, since the French had little enthusiasm for any test to Richard and his tranquility arrangement. Richard left the nation in May for another undertaking in Ireland.
