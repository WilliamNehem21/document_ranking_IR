In the spring of 1982, after three exceptional periods of archeological submerged work, arrangements started for raising the ship. The task before long kept running into issues: from the get-go there were challenges with the uniquely crafted lifting gear; jumpers on the venture having a place with the Royal Engineers must be pulled in view of the episode of the Falklands War; and the technique for lifting the frame must be impressively changed as late as June. After the edge was legitimately appended to the body it was gradually lifted on four legs straddling the disaster area site to pull the ship off the seabed. The enormous crane of the canal boat "Tog Mor" was then used to lift the casing and structure on to the exceptionally planned support which was cushioned with water-filled packs. On the morning of 1982, the last lift of the whole bundle of support, body and lifting outline started. At 9:03 the main timbers of the "Mary Rose" broke the surface within the sight of the group, Prince Charles and inquisitive onlookers on water crafts surrounding the site. A second arrangement of sacks under the structure was swelled with air to pad the waterlogged wood lastly the entire bundle was exchanged to the freight ship that would take the frame aground. In spite of the fact that in the long run effective, the activity was near flopping on two events; first when one of the supporting legs of the lifting outline was twisted and must be evacuated and later when a side of the casing, with "an exceptional crunch", slipped in excess of a meter (3ÃÂ feet) and verged on pulverizing some portion of the body.
