"Tokyo Mew" was later authorized for an English-language named discharge by 4Kids Entertainment. In its declaration about the arrangement, 4Kids initially noticed that the show would be renamed to "Hollywood Mew" and that they would be intensely altering and restricting scenes with the goal that watchers would not perceive its Japanese roots. Ensuing 4Kids official statements about the arrangement alluded to the new arrangement as "The Mew Mews" and its unique name "Tokyo Mew". At the point when the arrangement debuted on 4Kids TV on February 19, 2005, it broadcast under the name as "Mew Power". Characters and scenes were renamed, scenes were cut and storylines were adjusted. The music was supplanted with another score and the opening topic was supplanted with the melody "Group Up", performed by Bree Sharp and Mollie Weaver. Twenty-six scenes of "Mew Power" publicized on 4Kids Entertainment in the United States in light of the fact that 4Kids was unfit to get a marketing bargain for the arrangement and the English name had ceased generation. The 4Kids scenes disclosed on YTV in Canada and on the Pop Girl satellite TV slot in the United Kingdom; these included three named scenes not communicate in the United States.
