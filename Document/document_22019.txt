"The Daily Telegraph" and the "Athenaeum", however, greeted the opera with only mixed praise. "The Musical Times" complained that the ongoing collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan was "detrimental to the art-progress of either" because, although it was popular with audiences, "something higher is demanded for what is understood as 'comic opera'". The paper commented that Sullivan had "the true elements of an artist, which would be successfully developed were a carefully framed libretto presented to him for composition". It concluded, however, by saying how much it enjoyed the opera: "Having thus conscientiously discharged our duties as art-critics, let us at once proceed to say that "H.M.S. Pinafore" is an amusing piece of extravagance, and that the music floats it on merrily to the end". "The Times" and several of the other papers agreed that, while the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art. Only "The Figaro" was actively hostile to the new piece. Upon the publication of the vocal score, a review by "The Academy" joined the chorus of regret that Sullivan had sunk so low as to compose music for "Pinafore" and hoped that he would turn to projects "more worthy of his great ability". This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.
