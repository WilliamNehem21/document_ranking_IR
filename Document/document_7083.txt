So far, cleanser musical dramas utilized assault and its related paradigms to, similar to their nineteenth-century acting partners, "evaluate influence connections, particularly the persecution of the poor by the rich and of ladies by men". Hayward trusts that the storyline was at first imperfect since two of the attackers, Todd and Zach, were defamed, which misrepresented assault and "neglected to catch the mind boggling power relations underlyingÃÂ ... brutality towards ladies". The culprits were "basically malicious or out control", so they and their outlooks they spoke to could be rejected. The three characters spoke to three prime examples of the attacker: "the malicious instigator" (Todd); "the great resister" (Powell), and "the go between these spellbound figures" (Zach), yet in addition spoke to a takeoff from how assault was treated in cleanser musical dramas. Streams called the attackers "a confounded option in contrast to the standard cleanser musical show attacker", since they had an alternate association with their unfortunate casualty than in past assault stories and in light of the fact that they were numerous. Todd, whom Brooks called the "abhorrent 'other, was the pioneer and most terrible of the gathering and had a past physical association with Marty. Hayward stated, "What turns out to be particularly clear is that for these characters the demonstration of assault isn't about sex, about ladies, or even about Marty. It is about what takes placeÃÂ ... between men."
