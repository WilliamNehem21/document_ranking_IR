The story broke in July 1872, amidst the presidential crusade. Among those named were Vice President (and previous House Speaker) Schuyler Colfax, Grant's second-term running mate (Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson), Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine, and Garfield. Greeley had little karma exploiting the embarrassment. At the point when Congress reconvened after the decision, Blaine, trying to demonstrate his innocence, requested a House examination. Proof before the uncommon council excused Blaine. Garfield had expressed, in September 1872, that Ames had offered him stock, yet he had more than once declined it. Affirming before the panel in January, Ames asserted that he had offered Garfield ten offers of stock at standard esteem, yet that Garfield had never taken the offers, or paid for them. A year had gone, from 1867 to 1868, preceding Garfield had at long last rejected it. Garfield, showing up before the board of trustees on January 14, 1873, affirmed quite a bit of this. Ames affirmed half a month later that Garfield consented to assume the stock on acknowledgment, and that it was paid for by the organization's tremendous profits. The two men varied over a total of some $300 that Garfield got and later paid back, with Garfield esteeming it a credit and Ames a profit.
