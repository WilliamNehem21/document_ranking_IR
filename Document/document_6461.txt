There are eight conceivable endings. The Sole Survivor is looked with a decision: to wreck Far Harbor, to annihilate the Children of Atom, or to educate the general population of Far Harbor of DiMA's wrongdoing and trigger a quarrel between the Harbormen and Acadia. Should the player explode the warhead, the Harbormen will assume responsibility for the island, while if the player crushes the haze condensers, the Children will wind up prevailing. In the two situations Acadia will be saved, however DiMA will object to the player's activities. Then again, if the player stands up to DiMA over Avery's homicide, Acadia may end up antagonistic. The Sole Survivor can build up a progressively lasting harmony between all gatherings by killing or pursuing endlessly High Confessor Tektus, and permitting DiMA to supplant him with a synth who will receive an increasingly moderate position towards the Harbormen. The Sole Survivor can make the primary groups mindful of Acadia's presence. Assuming this is the case, The Institute, a logical association that made the synths, will send operators to recover the synths, while the Brotherhood of Steel, a semi religious association established in the United States Armed Forces, will dispatch a campaign to eradicate them. The Railroad, a gathering restricted to the presence of The Institute with the point of liberating aware synths, will send an employable to reach Acadia, however the last will dismiss their assistance.
