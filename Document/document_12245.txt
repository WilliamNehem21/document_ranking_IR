Green-banner pit stops started on lap 48. Edwards and Biffle made pit stops on lap 49, giving the lead to Riggs. Hornish hit the turn-two outside divider on the accompanying lap after his right-front tire went down in the tri-oval, and supported harm on his right side front quarter board, yet no flotsam and jetsam fell off his vehicle. After the pit stops, Edwards recaptured the lead and held a five-second lead over Kyle Busch; Martin moved into third spot, Riggs recovered fourth spot, and Harvick climbed to fifth spot by lap 65. Three laps later, a second alert was required when flotsam and jetsam was spotted at turn-two. A large portion of the pioneers, including Edwards, made pit stops. Jeff Burton stayed on the track and drove on the lap-75 restart, in front of Earnhardt and Kyle Busch. On lap 78, Kyle Busch advanced of Earnhardt to come in just short of the leader and started to close the hole to Burton. Kyle Busch passed Burton to recover the lead three laps later, and opened up a 1.3-second preferred standpoint over Burton by the 92nd lap. Earnhardt was passed by Edwards for fifth spot on lap 94 and Biffle advanced beyond Gordon for seventh on a similar lap. Edwards increased fourth spot when he passed Stewart on the 96th lap, and Burton lost second to Kenseth two laps later. On lap 102, Burton tumbled to fourth place after Edwards passed him.
