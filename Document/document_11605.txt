While Leng thinks about that, expressively and musically, "Something" reflects "uncertainty and endeavoring to accomplish a questionable objective", writer Ian Inglis composes of the certain explanations that Harrison makes all through with respect to his affections for Boyd. Alluding to lines in the tune's refrains, Inglis states: "there is an unmistakable and shared trust in the equal idea of their adoration; he muses that [Boyd] 'pulls in me like no other darling' and 'i should simply think about her,' yet he is similarly mindful that she feels the equivalent, that 'some place in her grin, she knows.'" Similarly, when Harrison sings in the center eight that "You're asking me will my affection develop/I don't have a clue, I don't have a clue", Inglis deciphers the words as "not a sign of vulnerability, however a wry reflection that his adoration is now so total that it might essentially be outlandish for it to turn out to be any more noteworthy". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic portrays "Something" as "a brazenly clear and wistful love melody" composed at once "when a large portion of the Beatles' tunes were managing non-sentimental points or displaying mysterious and suggestive verses notwithstanding when they were expounding on affection".
