Argento said that "Tenebrae" was legitimately impacted by two upsetting occurrences that happened 1980. On a break from filmmaking after "Suspiria"s shock achievement, Argento was investing energy in Los Angeles, where a fixated fan called him over and again, to discuss "Suspiria"s effect on him. As indicated by Argento, the calls started enjoyably enough however after a short time turned out to be increasingly stubborn, in the end threatening. The fan asserted that he needed "to hurt Argento such that reflected how much the executive's work had influenced him", and that in light of the fact that the chief had "destroyed his life", he thus needed to demolish Argento's. Albeit no savagery happened to the danger, Argento said he found the experience naturally alarming, and felt unfit to compose. At the counsel of his makers, Argento fled to the beach front city of Santa Monica, where he felt safe enough to continue composing. Be that as it may, following half a month the fan discovered Argento and continued his calls, issuing more dangers. The executive chose to come back to Italy. Argento felt the heightening idea of the fan's dangers were "symptomatic of that city of broken dreams" with its "superstar stalkers and silly wrongdoing". The second occurrence happened amid Argento's stay at The Beverly Hilton, where a Japanese traveler was shot dead in the inn hall. Later becoming aware of a drive-by shooting outside a nearby film, Argento considered the foolishness of the killings: "To kill to no end, that is the genuine awfulness of todayÃÂ ... at the point when that motion has no importance at all it's totally hostile, and that is the kind of climate I needed to place crosswise over in "Tenebrae"."
