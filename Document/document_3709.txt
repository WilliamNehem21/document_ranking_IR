Assessed to be 590 to 650 million years of age, the stars were most likely at the hot end of unearthly class An amid their principle arrangement lifetime, like Vega. They have now depleted their center hydrogen and advanced off the primary succession, their external layers extending and cooling. In spite of the monster radiance class, the optional part is all around unmistakably inside the Hertzsprung hole on the HertzsprungÃ¢ÂÂ Russell outline, as yet growing and cooling towards the red mammoth branch, making it a subgiant in transformative terms. The more monstrous essential has just gone through this stage, when it achieved a most extreme sweep of 36 to multiple times that of the Sun. It is presently a red bunch star which is melding helium to carbon and oxygen in its center, a procedure that has not yet started for the less enormous star. Definite investigation demonstrates that it is nearing the finish of this stage and beginning to grow again which will lead it to the asymptotic mammoth branch. Isotope bounties and turn rates affirm this transformative contrast between the two stars. Overwhelming component plenitudes are extensively equivalent to those of the Sun and the general metallicity is marginally not exactly the Sun's.
