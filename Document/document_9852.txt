Interestingly among theropods, "Ceratosaurus" had little, extended, and unpredictably shaped osteoderms (skin bones) along the midline of its body. Such osteoderms have been found over the neural spines of cervical vertebrae 4 and 5, just as caudal vertebrae 4 to 10, and likely shaped a constant column that may have stretched out from the base of the skull to a large portion of the tail. As recommended by Gilmore in 1920, their situation in the stone lattice likely mirrors their accurate position in the living creature. The osteoderms over the tail were discovered isolated from the neural spines by to , potentially representing skin and muscles present in the middle of, while those of the neck were a lot nearer to the neural spines. Aside from the body midline, the skin contained extra osteoderms, as demonstrated by a by expansive, generally quadrangular plate found together with the holotype; the situation of this plate on the body is obscure. Example UMNH VP 5278 was likewise found with various osteoderms, which have been depicted as undefined fit as a fiddle. Albeit the vast majority of these were found at most 5 m separated from the skeleton, they were not legitimately connected with any vertebrae, dissimilar to in the "C. nasicornis" holotype, so their unique position on the body can't be construed from this example.
