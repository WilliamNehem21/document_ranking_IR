Bianchi crashed into the back of the tractor crane, which made broad harm his vehicle; its move bar was pulverized as it slid underneath. The effect shocked the tractor crane off the ground, causing Sutil's vehicle (suspended noticeable all around by the crane) to tumble to the ground. Marshals moved far from the scene to abstain from being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Computations in July 2015 demonstrated a pinnacle of 254 "g" (2,490ÃÂ m/s), and information from the FIA's World Accident Database, which sources data from hustling mishaps around the world, show that Bianchi's effect happened 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of and an edge of 55 degrees. Bianchi was accounted for oblivious after not reacting to a group radio call or marshals. Marshals revealed the mishap, and security and therapeutic vehicles were dispatched. Bianchi was removed from his vehicle and treated at the accident site before being taken by rescue vehicle to the circuit's therapeutic focus. Transport by helicopter was incomprehensible because of the climate, so Bianchi was taken by emergency vehicle with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15ÃÂ km (9.3ÃÂ mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.
