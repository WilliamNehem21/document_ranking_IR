Dilkes, rather than following Browne's course up the incline, progressed to one side where there was more spread and ground not noticeable to the French. Therefore, the French big guns couldn't be conveyed to tolerate, and Dilkes' detachment figured out how to get close to the highest point of the edge without enduring genuine misfortune. At this point, however, its development had turned out to be disarranged, so Ruffin sent four unit segments trying to clear both Dilkes and the rest of the "Flankers" withdraw the slant. In spite of French desires, the unrefined British line ceased the assaulting sections in their tracks, and the two powers traded fire. Marshal Victor, by then himself on the peak of the edge, raised his hold in two unit segments of grenadiers. These sections were, similarly as with the past four, exposed to serious gun shoot and were conveyed to an end just meters from the British line. The initial four sections had begun to give ground, so Victor endeavored to separate his stores and convey them to their help. Be that as it may, as the two grenadier sections endeavored to get off from their slowed down positions, they went under extra flame from the remainders of Browne's brigade, which had reestablished its very own development. Kept from energizing, the whole French power broke and fled to the valley beneath.
