ÃÂthelbald, King of Wessex (passed on 860) was the second of five children of King ÃÂthelwulf of Wessex. In 850 ÃÂthelbald's senior sibling ÃÂthelstan crushed the Vikings in the main recorded ocean fight in English history, yet he isn't recorded a while later and presumably kicked the bucket in the mid 850s. The following year ÃÂthelwulf and ÃÂthelbald caused another annihilation on the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea. In 855 ÃÂthelwulf went on journey to Rome and he delegated ÃÂthelbald lord of Wessex, while ÃÂthelberht, the following most established child, progressed toward becoming King of Kent, which had been vanquished by Wessex thirty years sooner. At the point when ÃÂthelwulf came back to England in 856, ÃÂthelbald would not surrender the crown. Most students of history trust that ÃÂthelbald kept on being ruler of Wessex while ÃÂthelberht surrendered Kent to his dad, however a few researchers feel that Wessex itself was partitioned, with ÃÂthelbald administering the west and his dad the east, while ÃÂthelberht kept Kent. At the point when ÃÂthelwulf kicked the bucket, in 858 ÃÂthelbald proceeded as (or turned out to be once more) lord of Wessex and his sibling continued (or continued) his majesty of Kent.
