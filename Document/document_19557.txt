Just south of the hamlet of Peru, the short NYÂ 442 terminates at RouteÂ 22. In the hamlet itself, after the Little Au Sable River crossing, NYÂ 22's other suffixed route, NYÂ 22B, branches off further inland. NYÂ 22 continues north of Peru, and returns to the Northway's side again in a mile. After another , it has its first exit on the Northway near the now-closed Plattsburgh Air Force Base. It continues northeastward, crossing the Saranac River into Plattsburgh, the first city and most populous community NYÂ 22 has passed through since White Plains.
NYÂ 22 runs along South Catherine Street for a few blocks, then divides into one-way couplets for the first time since Westchester County, with northbound traffic moving a block to the east to follow Oak Street, while southbound traffic comes down North Catherine Street. It parallels USÂ 9 for a couple of blocks, intersecting NYÂ 3 (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway. Just after the exit, NYÂ 374 begins along the westbound route as NYÂ 22 turns to the north once again.
