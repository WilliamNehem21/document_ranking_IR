On the January 30 episode of "Raw", the returning Chris Jericho attacked Punk and Daniel Bryan during their champion vs. champion match, giving Bryan the win. The following week on "Raw", Jericho explained his actions by dismissing the WWE roster as imitations of himself and singling out Punk for calling himself "the best in the world", a moniker Jericho used the last time he was in WWE. Their rivalry continued through Elimination Chamber on February 19, when Punk retained the WWE Championship in the namesake structure, but while four competitors were eliminated Jericho was unable to continue the match after being kicked out of the chamber by Punk, causing temporary injury. The next night on "Raw", Jericho earned a match against Punk on April 1 at WrestleMania XXVIII<ref name="Raw SuperShow 2/20/12 Results"></ref> and in a bid to psychologically unsettle him revealed Punk's father was an alcoholic and alleged that his sister was a drug addict, asserting that Punk's straight edge philosophy was paranoia to avoid the same vices and vowing to make Punk turn to alcohol by winning the title from him. John Laurinaitis added the stipulation that the WWE Championship could change hands via disqualification, which led to Jericho inciting Punk into using a weapon, but Punk resisted and retained the title. On the April 2 and 9 episodes of "Raw", Punk retained the WWE Championship against Mark Henry after losing to him via countout and disqualification, being attached by Jericho following both matches and doused with alcohol. On the April 16 episode of "Raw", Punk pinned Henry in a no disqualification, no countout match to retain the title. After repeated altercations, the feud between Jericho and Punk culminated in a Chicago street fight on April 29 at Extreme Rules, where Punk defeated Jericho to retain the WWE Championship.
