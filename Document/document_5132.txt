Old Greek and Roman essayists, who portrayed Egyptian religion late in its history, recorded a significant part of the Osiris fantasy. Herodotus, in the fifth century BCE, referenced pieces of the fantasy in his depiction of Egypt in "The Histories", and after four centuries, Diodorus Siculus gave an outline of the legend in his "Bibliotheca historica". In the mid second century AD, Plutarch composed the most total old record of the fantasy in "On Isis and Osiris", an examination of Egyptian religious convictions. Plutarch's record of the fantasy is the variant that cutting edge prominent compositions most habitually retell. The works of these established creators may give a misshaped perspective on Egyptian convictions. For example, "On Isis and Osiris" incorporates numerous understandings of Egyptian conviction that are impacted by different Greek theories, and its record of the legend contains parcels with no known parallel in Egyptian convention. Griffiths inferred that few components of this record were taken from Greek folklore, and that the work all in all did not depend straightforwardly on Egyptian sources. His associate John Baines, then again, says that sanctuaries may have kept composed records of legends, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have attracted on such sources to compose his account.
