The pieces highlighted on "Agharta" were a piece of a regular set rundown for the gathering, yet their exhibitions of each occasionally changed nearly to the point of being unrecognizable from show to show. This, alongside the track names, prompted the broad misjudging that the music was generally or altogether extemporized and unstructured. Lucas clarified that the band began every execution with a "very characterized compositional premise" before creating it further in an exceptionally organized yet "extremely free way"; the "Directly Off" section was ad libbed from the first account's E-level riff. Davis had the band play around a solitary harmony in a piece for a few minutes with varieties as every part performed in an alternate time signature; Foster may share been playing for all intents and purpose time and Mtume in compound duple meter or septuple time, while the guitarists would comp in another rhythm by and large. "That is a great deal of perplexing crap we were working off this one harmony", Davis commented. From Lucas' point of view, this sort of "organized act of spontaneity" brought about huge interchange between the beat area and enabled the band to ad lib "much something beyond the notes that were being played in the performances; we were ad libbing the whole melody as we came."
