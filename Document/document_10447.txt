"The Man in the Moone" was distributed five months after "The Discovery of a World in the Moone" by John Wilkins, later religious administrator of Chester. Wilkins alludes to Godwin once, in a dialog of spots in the Moon, yet not to Godwin's book. In the third release of "The Discovery" (1640), notwithstanding, Wilkins gives a rundown of Godwin's book, and later in "Mercury" (1641) he remarks on "The Man in the Moone" and "Nuncius Inanimatus", saying that "the previous content could be utilized to open the privileged insights of the last mentioned". "The Man in the Moone" rapidly turned into a global "wellspring of funniness and satire": Cyrano de Bergerac, utilizing Baudoin's 1648 interpretation, satirize it in "L'Autre Monde: oÃÂ¹ les ÃÂtats et Empires de la Lune" (1657); Cyrano's explorer really meets Gonsales, who is still on the Moon, "debased to the status of pet monkey". It was one of the motivations for what has been known as the main sci-fi message in the Americas, "Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures Aligned to the Meridian of MÃÂ©rida of the YucatÃÂ¡n by an Anctitone or Inhabitant of the MoonÃÂ ..." by Manuel Antonio de Rivas (1775). The Laputan language of Jonathan Swift, who was a far off connection of Godwin's, may have been impacted by "The Man in the Moone", either straightforwardly or through Cyrano de Bergerac.
