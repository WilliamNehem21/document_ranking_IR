The Russian technique since 1897 had been for boats from the Baltic Fleet to be requested to the Far East if war with Japan broke out, while the First Pacific Squadron in Port Arthur would stay away from a general armada fight until fortifications arrived. On 15 October 1904, "Oslyabya" set sail for Port Arthur from Libau as von FÃÂ¶lkersam's leader, alongside different vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron, under the general order of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky. Antiquarian Mark Schrad said that: "This epic adventure was the longest voyage of a coal-fueled warship armada ever." En course to Denmark, the ship was marginally harmed when the destroyer slammed into her. At the point when his boats achieved the port of Tangier, Morocco, on 28 October, Rozhestvensky requested his more established war vessels, under the order of von FÃÂ¶lkersam, to experience the Mediterranean and Red Sea to meet with his principle constrain in Madagascar. Rozhestvensky drove his squadron, including "Oslyabya", down the Atlantic shoreline of Africa, adjusting Cape Horn, and achieved the island of Nosy Be off the northwest bank of Madagascar on 9 January 1905, where they stayed for two months while Rozhestvensky concluded his coaling game plans. At this point Port Arthur had surrendered to the Japanese and he couldn't depend on resupplying there, nor rendezvousing with the First Pacific Squadron. Rozhestvensky's brought together squadron cruised for Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 16 March and achieved it just about a month later to anticipate the outdated boats of the Third Pacific Squadron, directed by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov. These came to Camranh Bay on 9 May and the joined power cruised for Vladivostok on 14 May.
