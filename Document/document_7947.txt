On 8 April 1940 eight air ship of 1./ZGÃÂ 76, under the order of "StaffelkapitÃÂ¤n" Werner Hansen, conveyed northward from Jever to Westerland on Sylt in anticipation of activity "WeserÃÂ¼bung", the attack of Norway. The German arrangement for the assault required a land and/or water capable strike on the Norwegian capital, Oslo, and six noteworthy ports from Kristiansand in the south to Narvik in the north. All the while, Junkers 52 (JuÃÂ 52) transport flying machine would drop parachute troops to verify Oslo's Fornebu air terminal. Extra JuÃÂ 52s were planned to touch base at Fornebu twenty minutes after the parachute drop, by which time the runway must be in German hands. 1./ZGÃÂ 76 was to give air spread and ground-assault support for the two waves. Eight BfÃÂ 110 "ZerstÃÂ¶rer" of 1./ZGÃÂ 76 took off at 7:00 in the first part of the day, wanting to synchronize their landing in Fornebu with the parachute drop at 8:45. The separation from Westerland to Fornebu implied this was a single direction activity; the BfÃÂ 110s couldn't hold enough fuel for the arrival trip. Their fuel was determined to give them 20 minutes flying time over Fornebu, and the pilots would need to arrive at Fornebu once the runway had been seized.
