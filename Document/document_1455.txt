"Irritator" had straight or just faintly recurved tapered teeth, bearing forcefully characterized yet unserrated edges. Woodwinds (the long way edges) were available on its tooth crowns, a typical dental quality among spinosaurids. The two sides of "Irritator"s teeth were fluted, as in "Spinosaurus", while "Baryonyx" showed them just on the lingual (internal confronting) side of its teeth. "Irritator"s teeth were round in cross area, instead of the horizontally straightened state of most theropod teeth. The finish (first layer of the teeth) was dainty, with a finely wrinkled surface likewise saw in "Baryonyx." Both of "Irritator"s maxillae protect nine teeth, despite the fact that the left maxilla's tooth crowns are increasingly unblemished, and there are hints of a tenth tooth in the stone network. The teeth were profoundly embedded into the jaw and broadly divided towards the front of the maxilla. The first and second safeguarded maxillary teeth were the biggest, at and in crown length. The seven residual teeth turned out to be continuously littler towards the back, one of the last ones estimating in assessed crown length. CT checks performed on the example uncovered substitution teeth on the two sides of the upper jaw. Their underlying foundations ran profound into the maxillae and merged near the midline, about achieving the highest point of the skull. In light of examinations with "Irritator"s relatives, the maxillae were presumably fixed with an aggregate of 11 teeth each, like the quantity of 12 teeth in MSNM V4047, an upper jaw fossil alluded to "Spinosaurus". The rearmost tooth of the "Irritator" example's left maxilla was not yet completely ejected, and just its tip was unmistakable.
