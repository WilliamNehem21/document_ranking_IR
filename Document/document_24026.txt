The importance of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev asked him to conduct Stravinsky's new "Les noces" with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following on from there. Monteux told the impresario "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, but I have to do what ze composer 'as written." Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of "The Nation", B. H. Haggin, while admitting that Monteux was generally regarded as one of the giants of conducting, wrote of his "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 Carleton Smith wrote, "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'Â â the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras." In his 1967 book "The Great Conductors", Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Monteux, "[A] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly." Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's "passion and charisma". When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) in one word, Monteux replied, "Damned professional".
