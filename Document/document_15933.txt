"Oryzomys peninsulae" was first collected in 1896 and Oldfield Thomas described it in 1897 as a full species of "Oryzomys". It was retained as a distinct species related to "O.Â couesi" and "O.Â palustris" until 1971, when Philip Hershkovitz swept it, and other outlying populations of the same species group, as subspecies under an expanded concept of "O.Â palustris". Raymond Hall concurred in the second edition (1981) of "Mammals of North America", arguing that "O.Â peninsulae" differed less from mainland "Oryzomys" populations (currently classified as "O.Â couesi mexicanus") than some other forms he included in "O.Â palustris" differed from each other. After studies of the contact zone between North American "O.Â palustris" and Central American "O.Â couesi" in southern Texas and northeastern Tamaulipas (by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994) made clear that the two are distinct from each other, "O.Â peninsulae" remained as a subspecies of "O.Â couesi". In 2009, Michael Carleton and JoaquÃ­n Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed the classification of western Mexican "Oryzomys" and used morphological and morphometrical data to characterize four distinct "Oryzomys" species in the region. "O.Â peninsulae" and another isolated population, "O.Â nelsoni" from the Islas MarÃ­as, were both retained as separate species, as was "O.Â albiventer" from montane mainland Mexico. They kept the population in the coastal lowlands as a subspecies, "O.Â couesi mexicanus", of "Oryzomys couesi".
