"Hit the Lights" depended on an incomplete Leather Charm tune composed by Hetfield and Hugh Tanner. Hetfield had conveyed most of the melody to Ulrich, and the two worked out various game plans. Performed at 160 beats for every moment, "Hit the Lights" opens with blur in contorted guitars and a short screech by Hetfield. The melody is driven by the sixteenth note rehashed fundamental riff and the ceaseless eighth note catch drum hits. The verses praise substantial metal itself and are sung with short and piercing vocals. The tune closes with a few extensive guitar performances by Hammett, who performed cleaner and progressively melodic forms of Mustaine's leads. "The Four Horsemen" is a patch up of the Mustaine-wrote "The Mechanix", which initially had verses about engaging in sexual relations at a service station. A changed variant of his piece with the first verses showed up on Megadeth's presentation "Executing Is My Business... furthermore, Business Is Good!" (1985). Despite the fact that Mustaine advised Metallica not to utilize any of his music, Hetfield composed verses about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and included a scaffold and neatly picked guitar solo in the center. Mustaine said the extension was enlivened by the fundamental riff in Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama".
