Post-production wrapped on May 21, 2007, only two days before it aired on television. The score was composed by series musician Michael Giacchino, while popular music was also featured throughout the episode. Charlie also sings a song in the episode that was written by Dominic Monaghan, who plays him. A "Lost" season finale is approximately twice as long the average "Lost" episode. Due to the episode's length, it was split into two parts in some countries and when released on DVD. Unlike most episodes, this episode did not feature a "previously on "Lost"â¦" recap at the start of the episode when it first aired; however, it was originally preceded by a clip-show titled "", which recapped the third season. Cuse said that he and Lindelof think the finale is "very cool [and] we're very proud of it." Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, called "Through the Looking Glass" "one of the best episodes" of the series. Buena Vista Home Entertainment released "Through the Looking Glass" on the season's DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets on December 11, 2007 in Region 1. A featurette called ""Lost": On Location" features cast and crew discussing production of select episodes, including "Through the Looking Glass". The episode was rerun for the first time on January 30, 2008 with on-screen text in the lower third of the screen, similar to VH1's "Pop-up Video". These pop-ups were not written by "Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writers due to the 2007â2008 Writers Guild of America strike; they were written by the marketing company Met/Hodder. This enhanced edition was viewed by almost 9 million Americans.
