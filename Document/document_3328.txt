The subfamily Indricotheriinae, to which "Paraceratherium" has a place, was first delegated piece of the family Hyracodontidae by the American scientist Leonard B. Radinsky in 1966. Already, they had been viewed as a subfamily inside Rhinocerotidea, or even a full family, Indricotheriidae. In a 1999 cladistic investigation of tapiromorphs, the American scientist Luke Holbrook observed indricotheres to be outside the hyracodontid clade, and composed that they may not be a monophyletic (common) gathering. Radinsky's plan is the predominant speculation today. The hyracodont family contains since quite a while ago legged individuals adjusted to running, for example, "Hyracodon", and were recognized by incisor attributes. Indricotheres are recognized from different hyracodonts by their bigger size and the inferred structure of their noses, incisors and canines. The most punctual known indricothere is the canine measured "Forstercooperia" from the center and late Eocene of western North America and Asia. The dairy animals estimated "Juxia" is known from the center Eocene; by the late Eocene the variety "Urtinotherium" of Asia had nearly achieved the extent of "Paraceratherium". "Paraceratherium" itself lived in Eurasia amid the Oligocene time frame, 23 to 34 million years back. The variety is recognized from different indricotheres by its substantial size, nasal entry point that would have bolstered a solid nose, and its down-turned premaxillae. It had likewise lost the second and third lower incisors, lower canines, and lower first premolars.
