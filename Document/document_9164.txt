In January, Todd discharged another arrangement called G-3. Like the past Metropolitan Opera proposition, this arrangement subdivided the complex into eight squares with a court amidst the middle square. It was like his October 1929 arrangement for the Met, with one noteworthy change: the musical show house was supplanted with a 50-story building. The 50-story tower was incorporated in light of the fact that its bigger floor zone would give vast benefits, and its focal area was picked on the grounds that Todd trusted that the focal point of the complex was too significant to even consider wasting on low-ascent structures. Plans for another Metropolitan Opera expanding on the site were all the while being contrived, including one proposition to put a place of business over the musical show office. Be that as it may, this was viewed as progressively far-fetched because of the Met's hesitance to move to the complex. A proposition to make streets that crossed the complex corner to corner was quickly considered, however it was dropped in light of the fact that it included decommissioning city avenues, which must be done after long discourses with city authorities. Plan G-3 was introduced to the Metropolitan Square Corporation's supervisors in February. At the time, Todd suspected that G-3 was the most reasonable proposition for the complex.
