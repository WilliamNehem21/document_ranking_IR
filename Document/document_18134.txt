James Douglas, editor of the "Sunday Express", did not agree. Douglas was a dedicated moralist, an exponent of muscular Christianity, which sought to reinvigorate the Church of England by promoting physical health and manliness. His colourfully worded editorials on subjects such as "the flapper vote" (that is, the extension of suffrage to women under 30) and "modern sex novelists" helped the "Express" family of papers prosper in the cutthroat circulation wars of the late 1920s. These leader articles shared the pages of the "Sunday Express" with gossip, murderers' confessions, and features about the love affairs of great men and women of the past.
Douglas's campaign against "The Well of Loneliness" began on 18 August, with poster and billboard advertising and a teaser in the "Daily Express" promising to expose "A Book That Should Be Suppressed". In his editorial the next day, Douglas wrote that "sexual inversion and perversion" had already become too visible and that the publication of "The Well" brought home the need for society to "cleans[e] itself from the leprosy of these lepers". For Douglas the sexological view of homosexuality was pseudoscience, incompatible with the Christian doctrine of free will; instead, he argued, homosexuals were damned by their own choiceÂ â which meant that others could be corrupted by "their propaganda". Above all, children must be protected: "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel. Poison kills the body, but moral poison kills the soul." He called on the publishers to withdraw the book and the Home Secretary to take action if they did not.
