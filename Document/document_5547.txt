Subsequent to accepting fuel from 07:00 on 20 September, the units of the corps started to progress on Grodno in various waves. At 13:00, 50 tanks from the 27th Brigade achieved the southern edges of the city, starting the Battle of Grodno. By 14:00, the second Brigade had taken SokÃÂ³ÃÂka, and its development units had come to DÃÂbrowa. Toward the day's end, cruiser units of the fourth Rifle Division and contingents of the twentieth Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade, which had all been postponed by fuel deficiencies, had achieved the city. Grodno was safeguarded by an understrength power of up to 3,000 Polish officers, gendarmes, and volunteers who had cut off the ties over the Neman. The 27th Brigade's observation legion propelled the primary assault with 12 tanks and a defensively covered vehicle, and was later joined by two tank regiments with a sum of 36 tanks. By 19:00, two forces of the thirteenth Rifle Division's 119th Rifle Regiment had touched base at Grodno, and on the morning of 21 September they were fortified by two units of the fourth Rifle Division's 101st Rifle Regiment and the mechanized separation of the sixteenth Rifle Corps, the last of which was subjected to the corps for the term of the fight. Before the finish of 20 September, the consolidated powers had caught the southern piece of Grodno.
