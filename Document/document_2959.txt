The class is recognized from different cheirogaleids by the toothrows on its maxilla (upper jaw), which are parallel and don't combine towards the front of the mouth. The fork-checked lemur dental recipe is ; on each side of the mouth, top and base, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molarsÃ¢ÂÂan aggregate of 36ÃÂ teeth. Their upper first incisor (I) is long and bended towards the center of the mouth (one of a kind among lemurs), while the second upper incisor (I) is little with a hole (diastema) between the two. The upper canines are substantial, with their tips bended. Their upper foremost premolars (P) are caniniform (canine-formed) and more articulated than in some other living lemur. The following upper premolar (P) is little, with a solitary, pointed cusp that contacts the lingual cingulum (a peak or edge on the tongue side), which circles the base of the tooth. The two cusps on the last upper premolar (P) are an expansive paracone and a littler protocone. Like different cheirogaleids, their first lower premolar (P) is caniniform and substantial, while the cingulids (edges) on the three lower premolars are progressively created contrasted with most different cheirogaleids. The initial two upper molars (M) have a created hypocone, and the buccal cingulum (a peak or edge on the cheek side) is all around created on every one of the three upper molars. The molars are generally little contrasted with different cheirogaleids, with the second upper and lower molars (M and M) having diminished usefulness contrasted with those of mouse lemurs.
