In 2017, Lithuanian specialist Darius Mockus offered a 1-million-Euro reward to any individual who could locate the first report and offer it to the State of Lithuania. The offer's due date was set to 16 February 2018, when Lithuania will celebrate the 100th commemoration of its announcement of autonomy. On 29 March 2017, Vytautas Magnus University educator Liudas MaÃÂ¾ylis reported he had discovered the first record in the Federal Foreign Office Political Archive in Berlin, Germany, written by hand in the Lithuanian language and marked by the twenty. He likewise declared that he had discovered the German-language variant of the 16 February 1918 record and the Act of 11 December 1917. The last shows nineteen marks (without that of Pranas Dovydaitis). Germany affirmed the reports' genuineness on the next day and they were shown openly by two authorities Ã¢ÂÂ Michael Roth, the German Minister of State for Europe, and Deividas Matulionis, Lithuania diplomat in Germany. On 5 October 2017, Lithuania Minister of Foreign Affairs Linas LinkeviÃÂius and Germany Minister of Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel consented to an arrangement that the first Act of Independence will be shown for a long time in the House of the Signatories where it was initially marked, making it the primary image of the Lithuania's Centenary of the Restoration of the State festivities. On 22 December 2017, specialists from the Lithuanian Police Forensic Research Center after an intensive investigation declared that the manually written act was composed by one of the signatories Jurgis ÃÂ aulys hand.
