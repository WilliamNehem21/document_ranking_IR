In the interim, German botanist Karl Friedrich von Gaertner had begat the name "Pentadactylon angustifolium" in 1807 from an example in the accumulation of Joseph Banks to portray what ended up being similar species. The variety name got from the Greek "penta-" "five" and "dactyl" "fingers", and alludes to the five-lobed cotyledons. The horticulturist Joseph Knight portrayed this species as the tight leaved ("Persoonia angustifolia") in his dubious 1809 work "On the development of the plants having a place with the normal request of Proteeae", however the binomial name is ill-conceived as it postdated Andrews' depiction and name. Carl Meissner portrayed a populace from the Tambo River in Victoria as a different assortment, "Persoonia linearis" var. "latior" in 1856, yet no assortments or subspecies are perceived. German botanist Otto Kuntze proposed the binomial name "Linkia linearis" in 1891, from Cavanilles' unique portrayal of the class "Linkia" however the name was inevitably dismissed for "Persoonia". In 1919, French botanist Michel Gandoger depicted three species all since reallocated to "P.ÃÂ linearis"; "P. phyllostachys" from material gathered at Mount Wilson sent to him by the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and "P.ÃÂ walteri" and "P.ÃÂ breviuscula" from Melbourne-based plant gatherer Charles Walter, whose records have been addressed. The short-leaved material of "P.ÃÂ breviuscula" was noted to have been gathered in Queensland yet this is currently thought to have been mistakenly recorded. Gandoger depicted 212 taxa of Australian plants, practically all of which ended up being species effectively portrayed.
