Hewett drove his side in their first County Championship coordinate beginning on 18 May 1891. In spite of the fact that the club had played top of the line cricket a couple of years sooner, the title had just been shaped the past season. Their introduction in the challenge was hindered by downpour and completed a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's solitary innings with 31. Somerset's next match was against ruling region champions Surrey. Lionel Palairet, Bill Roe and Sammy Woods were all absent for different reasons, leaving Hewett with an exhausted side and just two genuine bowlers; Ted Tyler and George Nichols. Surrey achieved 449, and after that bowled Somerset out twice, for 37 in every inning. At the point when Surrey made a trip to Taunton later that season, in all likelihood anticipating that a simple win should verify a second continuous title, Hewett top-scored for his group with 55 in the principal innings as Somerset achieved 194. Woods, Nichols and Tyler at that point verified a 40 run first-innings lead for the home side who included another 331 keeps running in their second-innings, Hewett contributing 42. A similar trio of Somerset bowlers continued to bowl the bosses out for a second time, the last wicket falling a little ways from the end of play, and their group recorded a 130-run triumph. Hewett had a tranquil season with the bat, notwithstanding his 55 against Surrey he passed 50 on just a single other event; against Middlesex two weeks after the fact. He totalled 514 keeps running amid the season at a normal of 19.76; his most reduced normal when playing at least eight innings in a season.
