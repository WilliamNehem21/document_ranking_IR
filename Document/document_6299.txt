Equity William O. Douglas conveyed the supposition of the court. In a 6-2 choice, the decision of the U.S. Court of Claims was confirmed, deciding that the clan held its chasing and angling rights under the bargain. Douglas noticed that Public Law 280 had been sanctioned and was completely in power for around seven years before the Termination Act ended up viable. The segment of that law that managed Wisconsin gave that chasing and angling rights in "Indian Country" were shielded from state guideline and activity. Along these lines from 1954 until end in 1961, the Menominee's chasing and angling rights were not meddled with by Wisconsin. The Termination Act expressed that every single government resolution managing the clan were never again in power, however Douglas noticed that it was quiet with respect to arrangements. The demonstration did not explicitly address the chasing and angling rights, and Douglas expressed that the U.S. Incomparable Court would "decrease to interpret the Termination Act as an underhanded method for revoking the chasing and angling privileges of these Indians." He noticed that in a comparable bill for the Klamath Tribe, there was an exchange on paying the clan to purchase out their chasing and angling rights, an unmistakable sign that Congress knew about the suggestions. Douglas thought that it was difficult to trust that Congress would expose the United States to a case for pay without an unequivocal explanation with that impact. He found that without a particular repeal of those rights, the clan held those rights.
