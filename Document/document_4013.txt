Jeff Burton headed to his carport on lap 218 when a carburetor issue made him run slower than his adversaries; Earnhardt and Stewart maintained a strategic distance from a disaster area on that lap. Four laps later, the fifth alert turned out when David Gilliland reached Ward Burton thusly two; in spite of the fact that Burton spun, he abstained from reaching the stopping point. Johnson kept up his lead at the lap-227 restart. The 6th alert was given on lap 231 when Sorenson spun in the wake of slamming into Riggs, making Mike Skinner contact the left front quarter of Harvick's vehicle and Travis Kvapil to turn sideways. Biffle supported harm to his vehicle's nose, and turn three was briefly blocked. Harvick, Kahne, Vickers and Biffle went to pit street for fixes, while the pioneers stayed on the track. Johnson drove on the lap-238 restart. Four laps later Kvapil reached the divider in the wake of being knock and Tony Raines' vehicle had a cut tire from contact with Ragan, inciting the seventh alert. The vast majority of the pioneers, including Johnson, again made pit stops. On lap 244, it was declared that Jeff Burton had resigned from the race. Gordon turned into the pioneer at the restart, in front of Hamlin, Elliott Sadler, Kurt Busch and Nemechek.
