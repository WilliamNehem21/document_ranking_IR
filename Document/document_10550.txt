The show's title grouping and signature tune have remained for the most part predictable all through its run, with seven exemptions. Amid the Fionna and Cake scenes (viz. season three's "Fionna and Cake", season five's "Awful Little Boy", season six's "The Prince Who Wanted Everything", season eight's "Five Short Tables", and season nine's "Fionna and Cake and Fionna") the arrangement runs an alternate introduction grouping that reflects the first, with the significant exemption that every one of the characters are sexual orientation twisted, and the subject is sung by previous storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri. In like manner, the introduction to the arrangement's three miniseries are every one of a kind: the prologue to the Marceline-driven "Stakes" (2015) puts a large portion of the accentuation on Marceline, and the signature tune is sung by Olivia Olson; the prologue to "Islands" (2017) embraces a nautical topic, features the essential characters in the miniseries, and is sung by Jeremy Shada; and the introduction to "Components" (2017) highlights symbolism mirroring the four essential components in the "Experience Time" universe (that is: fire, ice, ooze, and sweet) and is sung by Hynden Walch. The acquaintances with the visitor enlivened scenes "A Glitch Is a Glitch" and "Evolved way of life" are every one of a kind, including activity civility of David OReilly and Masaaki Yuasa, individually. At last, the arrangement finale, "Join Me", includes a presentation offering watchers a look at future Ooo, one thousand years after Finn and Jake. This introduction includes the new characters Shermy and Beth, and is sung by the last mentioned (voiced by Willow Smith).
