Also, being on that favored journey in the consecrated city of Rome and seeing its extraordinary and antiquated landmarks and perusing the incredible deeds of the Romans as portrayed by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and different experts of historyÃÂ ...

In any case, in perspective on the way that our city of Florence, girl and posterity of Rome, was mounting and seeking after incredible purposes, while Rome was in its decay, I thought it legitimate to follow in this narrative the birthplaces of the city of Florence, so far as I have had the capacity to recuperate them, and to relate the city's further improvement at more prominent length, and in the meantime to give a concise record of occasions all through the world as long however it see fit, in the desire for whose support I attempted the said endeavor instead of in dependence all alone poor minds.
