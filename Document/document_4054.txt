Regardless of the tempest's seriousness, it was neither the costliest nor the most grounded to influence the northeastern United States. It was debilitating as it made its nearest way to deal with land, and the most elevated tides happened amid the neap tide, which is when tide ranges are insignificant. The most noticeably bad of the tempest impacts remained seaward. A float upper east of Nantucket, which was west of "Andrea Gail" last known position, recorded an ascent in wave stature in 10 hours while the extratropical storm was still quickly escalating. Two floats close to the Massachusetts coast watched record wave statures, and one watched a record wind report. The United States Coast Guard safeguarded 25 individuals adrift at the tallness of the tempest, including 13 individuals from Long Island Sound. A New York Air National Guard helicopter of the 106th Air Rescue Wing dumped amid the tempest, south of Montauk, New York, after it was unfit to refuel in flight and came up short on fuel. After the helicopter had endeavored a salvage amidst the tempest, a 84-man group on the Coast Guard Cutter "Tamaroa" arrived and saved four individuals from the team of five following six hours in hypothermic waters. The survivors were pilots Dave Ruvola and Graham Bushor, flight engineer Jim Miolli, and pararescue jumper John Spillane. The fifth part, pararescue jumper Rick Smith, was never found. They were altogether highlighted on the show I Shouldn't be Alive.
