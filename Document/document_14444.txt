Cruttwell's expert notoriety has been eclipsed by the consideration given to his quarrel with Waugh, the genuine criticalness of which, as indicated by Geoffrey Ellis' true to life sketch, may have been misrepresented. Cruttwell's encounters as an officer were with the end goal that he spent his whole profession expounding on war, as indicated by another biographer. "In "A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World" (1937) he wracks his cerebrums for quiet changes that were not dependent upon war". His remaining as a military student of history is generally founded on his 1934 Great War history, which Ellis adulates as "most outstanding for its blunt and valiant decisions on those distinguished as the foremost performing artists (military, maritime and political) in that shocking clash". The work was broadly commended in the press at the season of production; "The Naval Review" suspected that its depiction of the Battle of Jutland was "praiseworthy": "for the individuals who wish to pick up an unmistakable yet not very point by point thought of the general course of the war, and of the relations of the distinctive pieces of it to each other, the book ought to be significant". Against this, the Royal United Services Institute's audit thought the book under-sourced and the nature of its composition poor in spots. All the more as of late, author and supporter Humphrey Carpenter has scrutinized the book as ailing in humankind, showing "no familiarity with the horrifying level of enduring it annals". All things considered, student of history Llewellyn Woodward thought of it as "the most significant investigation of any war in present day times", and the motivation for his own Great War history of 1970, while strategist Colin S. Dark depicts Cruttwell as "the most adjusted of the students of history of that contention".
