On Christmas Day 820, Leo was killed in the castle house of prayer by authorities under the course of Michael the Amorian, who was immediately delegated head. At about a similar time, Thomas propelled an insubordination in the Anatolic Theme. Sources are separated on the accurate sequence and intentions of the revolt. George the Monk, the hagiographic sources, and a letter from Michael II toward the western sovereign Louis the Pious case that Thomas had ascended against Leo before Michael's usurpation. This order is trailed by practically all later Byzantine recorders like Genesios, "Theophanes Continuatus", and Skylitzes, just as various present day researchers like John B. Cover and Alexander Kazhdan. In his investigation of Thomas and the revolt, Paul Lemerle rejects this course of events as a later endeavor by Michael to legitimize his revolt as a reaction to Leo's inability to stifle the insubordination, and to exonerate himself of the early thrashings endured by the majestic powers. Some ongoing examinations pursue Lemerle and favor the record of Symeon LogothetesÃ¢ÂÂfor the most part considered the most precise of the tenth century sourcesÃ¢ÂÂas per which Thomas revolted a couple of days after the homicide of Leo and in response to it.
