"Crowded: The Beginning" does not happen on Earth. Or maybe, the amusement happens in a planetary arrangement of twenty-five anonymous planets before the occasions of the past titles; in any case, the universe inside the diversion is apparently detached with the real world. While a significant number of the planets are prevalently prairies dabbed with trees, different universes include uncontrollably unique landscapes, for example, a volcanic world and a planet for the most part secured by water. These universes are possessed by four human clans, spoken to by their shading: the green "Matak", the yellow "Chumara", and the red "Dakini". The fourth blue clan, constrained by the player, is never authoritatively referenced by name. Every one of the clans is commonly unfriendly to each other, however collusions exist on certain universes. The thinking for the threats is never clarified other than the beginning cutscene expressing that the other (non-player) clans "would pulverize us". While every one of the clans are led by a solitary female shaman, no different females are found in the diversion, aside from in cutscenes; every one of the adherents enrolled in the amusement are male. Notwithstanding the sorted out clans are 'wildmen', unbiased characters who bunch in gatherings around trees and water. In spite of the fact that they can't assault or be assaulted, players can utilize the Shaman's Convert spell to bring wildmen under her clan's control.
