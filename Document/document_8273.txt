The scene has been generally welcomed by commentators. Television Guide positioned it No. 7 on its rundown of the ten best "Star Trek" scenes for the magazine's festival of the establishment's 30th commemoration. In a review survey, Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" adulated the scene for rapidly setting up the reason and stakes, just as transforming Tasha Yar's passing into one of the scene's "most grounded passionate beats ... Tasha's assurance to pass on with significance before the finish of [the episode] changes her from a slip into something progressively respectable and pitiful." interestingly, Tor Books' Keith DeCandido composed that while the visitor stars were brilliant, Tasha Yar's arrival for a "television demise" is the scene's real blemish: "It is, to put it plainly, a scripted demise, and you can see the doll strings", he composed. Film commentator Jordan Hoffman composed that the scene is "overwhelming, PhilipÃÂ K. Dick-ian stuff that really takes some idea to pursue andÃÂ ... all triumphs include some significant downfalls", and that it is a fan most loved scene all things considered. Similarly, "Lair of Geek" analyst James Hunt lauded the scene for finding the human stakes in the story, lifting it above standard sci-fi time travel stories.
