Rob Lowing of "The Sun Herald" called the film "likeable but average". The "Chicago Sun-Times" Roger Ebert and "The Washington Post"s Rita Kempley gave the film negative reviews, calling the film "a mess" and "a shambles", respectively. "The New York Times" Caryn James considered the film to be disappointing to fans and non-fans alike, while Chris Hicks of the "Deseret News" disagreed, feeling that the film approached issues in the same vein as the television series and that fans would enjoy it. Ansen and Lowing considered Shatner's direction during action sequences weak, with Lowing adding that the second half of the film felt directionless. Hicks wrote that the film's broad humor gave the film an inconsistent tone. In contrast, Chris Dafoe of the Toronto "The Globe and Mail" called it "the most intentionally funny" episode of the film series. "The Christian Science Monitor"s David Sterritt stated that at its best, "The Final Frontier" showed "flashes" of the humor that propelled "The Voyage Home", and Lowing deemed Shatner's direction at its best during comedic moments.
Critics such as "Newsweek"s David Ansen judged the principal characters' performances satisfactory; "these veterans know each other's moves so well they've found a neat comic shorthand that gets more laughs out of the lines than they deserve", Ansen wrote. Stan James of "The Advertiser" wrote that Warner was wasted in his role and most characters lacked any "drive and motivation". In comparison, Luckinbill's Sybok received praise from critics such as "USA Today"s Mike Clark, who wrote that "he has the voice and stature of the golden screen's most scintillating intellectual villains", although he felt that he never seemed threatening or suspenseful. James considered Sybok the most "distinctive, compelling villain" of the series since Khan Noonien Singh in "".
