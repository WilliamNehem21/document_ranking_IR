In the accompanying scene Agnes has been moved by the Prefect's distress, and appealed to God for the child to be reestablished to life, which a heavenly attendant has done. The humble Procopius stoops before her, while she inclines down to let him know "Vade amplius noli peccare" ("Go forward and sin no more"; from ). Anyway the consequence of the supernatural occurrence was that (in William Caxton's interpretation) "the diocesans of the icons made an incredible disunity among the general population, with the goal that all they cried: Take away this sorceress and witch that turned men's brains and alieneth their minds". The Prefect is presently thoughtful to Agnes yet fears he will lose his position on the off chance that he does nothing, so leaves the issue in the hands of another authority; the two are seen talking together, with words from "Nihil invenio cause in eam" ("I discover no reason against her") above. The last scene demonstrates her suffering; she was condemned to be scorched yet the blazes part far from her so that at last the judge arranges her murdered by a lance. Her final words, from , are "In manus tuas domine commendo animam meam" ("Into your hands, O Lord, I praise my soul").
