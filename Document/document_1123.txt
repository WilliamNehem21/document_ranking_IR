At the point when Charlotte joined Frederick I in habitation at Ludwigsburg in 1798, the isolating dividers were expelled to shape one suite. Thouret just rolled out little improvements to the ruler's suite from 1802 to 1806, basically adding damask to the essential waiting room and to the get together and group of onlookers rooms. Broad redesigns, enduring from 1816 to 1824, came after the ruler completely settled herself at Ludwigsburg. Charlotte's gathering of people chamber contains her position of royalty, red silk dividers, and compositions of Cybele, Minerva, and represented ideals by over the entryways and in the lunettes of the mirrors. The neighboring room was rebuilt in 1824 with marbled green pilasters and a nook containing red silk from 1760. The investigation is unordinary for a Neoclassical inside in view of its substantial mirrors. At last, there is the mid year consider and the ruler's library, redesigned in 1818 with blue damask and Rococo overdoors that continue into the library toward the west. The whole condo is outfitted in the Biedermeier style by Johannes KlinckerfuÃÂ, whose work Charlotte herself secured with weaving.
