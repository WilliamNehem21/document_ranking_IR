ThÆ¡'s approach to removing Diá»m supporters from positions of influence drew criticism from both supporters and opponents of the deposed president. Some felt he was not vigorous enough in removing pro-Diá»m elements from authority, whereas others felt that the magnitude of the turnover of public servants was excessive and bordering on vengeance. A number of officials suspected of having engaged in corruption or Diá»mist oppression were indiscriminately arrested without charge, most of whom were later released. ÄÃ­nh and the new national police chief, General Mai Há»¯u XuÃ¢n, were given control of the interior ministry. The pair were accused of arresting people en masse, before releasing them in return for bribes and pledges of loyalty. Not all officials under Diá»m could automatically be considered pro-Diá»m, yet there were calls for further removals of the old guard. The government was criticised for firing large numbers of district and provincial chiefs directly appointed by Diá»m, causing a breakdown in law and order during the abrupt transition of power. One high profile and heavily criticised non-removal was that of General Äá» Cao TrÃ­, the commander of the ARVN I Corps who gained prominence for his particularly stringent anti-Buddhist crackdown in the central region around Huáº¿. TrÃ­ was simply transferred to the II Corps in the Central Highlands directly south of the I Corps region.
