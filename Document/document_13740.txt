Numerous speculations have been created to clarify the film's vague closure. Senior member Cundey purposely gave an unpretentious light to the eyes of the uninfected characters. In a meeting with Blumhouse he stated, "There's dependably an eye light, we call it, a little sparkle in the eye of the on-screen character. It gives life." Other hypotheses seize on the absence of obvious breath from Childs in the Antarctic air, in spite of the fact that this has been clarified as an issue with the scene lighting. Keith David stated, "When I watched it again, I wouldn't question Ã¢ÂÂ I've never asked, I haven't seen John [Carpenter], however whenever I see John I need to solicit him, 'The amount of that was placed in post?' Everything [Kurt] says, you see some smoke. Obviously, presently I see it. Prominently, there's none leaving mine." Another hypothesis hypothesizes that the jug that MacReady provides for Childs is really an extra molotov mixed drink and subsequently contains gas. As to hypothesis, Kurt Russell has stated, "John Carpenter and I dealt with the completion of that film together quite a while. We were both taking the group of onlookers directly starting over from the beginning. Toward the day's end, that was the position these individuals were in. They simply knew nothing." Carpenter abridged, "Presently, I do know, at last, who the Thing is, yet I can't let you know."
