After the achievement of the Imperial Economic Conference, Lyons delegated Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom it was to remain his and Ethel's home for the remainder of their lives. His first undertaking in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia's blossoming government obligations, the reimbursement of which was devastating Depression-time Australia. More than two years, he consulted with the Westminster Bank and the British Government for credit transformations worth ÃÂ£84 million, which spared Australia a huge number of pounds in enthusiasm more than quite a long while and alongside the Ottawa Agreements were critical in easing the Australian government's budgetary troubles. Bruce was asked at a few points amid the 1930s to come back to Australia by UAP sponsor and other political figures, who trusted that he could supplant Lyons as head administrator. He himself had scrutinized Lyons' wellbeing and ability to execute the job adequately, however he demonstrated little enthusiasm for returning. In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was drawn nearer by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to come back to Australia and expect the administration of the administration, which was battling under the debilitated Lyons, however he either straight declined or set conditions for his arrival, (for example, an all-party government behind him) that were difficult to meet.
