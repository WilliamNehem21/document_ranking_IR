In the east, the Bijapur-Shahji forces had better success; in 1639, they took possession of gold-rich Kolar district and soon of Bangalore, a city founded a century earlier by Kempe Gowda I, and to become, two centuries later, a hub of British presence. Next, moving down the Eastern Ghats, the range of mountains rising behind the coastal plains of southeastern India, they captured the historic towns of Vellore and Gingee. Returning north through the east-central "maidan" plain (average elevation ), they gained possession of the towns of Ballapur, Sira, and the hill fortress of Chitaldroog. (See .)
A new province named "Caranatic-Bijapur-Balaghat", consisting of possessions such as Kolar, Hoskote, Bangalore, and Sira, and situated above (or westwards of) the Eastern Ghats range, was soon incorporated into the Sultanate of Bijapur and granted to Shahji as a jagir, or temporary gift. The possessions "below" the Ghats, such as Gingee and Vellore became part of another province, named "Carnatic-Bijapur-Payanghat", whose first governor was none other than Shahji again. When Shahji died in 1664, his son, Venkoji, from his second wife, who meanwhile had become the ruler of Tanjore farther south, inherited these territories. This twist of fate, however, did not sit well with ShivajiâShahji's oldest son, from his first wifeâwho now led an expedition southwards to claim his fair share. Shivaji's quick victories resulted in a partition, whereby both the "Carnatic-Bijapur" provinces became his dominions, and whereas Tanjore was retained by Venkoji. (See .)
