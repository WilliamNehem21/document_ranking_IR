Most bacterial species are either spherical, called "cocci" ("sing". coccus, from Greek "kÃ³kkos", grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called "bacilli" ("sing". bacillus, from Latin "baculus", stick). Some bacteria, called "vibrio", are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called "spirilla", or tightly coiled, called "spirochaetes". A small number of other unusual shapes have been described, such as star-shaped bacteria. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.
Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells, others associate in characteristic patterns: "Neisseria" form diploids (pairs), "Streptococcus" form chains, and "Staphylococcus" group together in "bunch of grapes" clusters. Bacteria can also group to form larger multicellular structures, such as the elongated filaments of "Actinobacteria", the aggregates of "Myxobacteria", and the complex hyphae of "Streptomyces". These multicellular structures are often only seen in certain conditions. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells in a process known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500Â micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; for example, about one in ten cells migrate to the top of a fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.
