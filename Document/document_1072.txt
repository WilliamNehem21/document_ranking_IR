After the passings of Mary and Joseph Priestley, Joseph Priestley, Jr. what's more, his better half, Elizabeth Ryland, kept on living in the house until 1811, at which time they emigrated to Britain and sold the home. The house went through different hands amid the nineteenth century. Judge Seth Chapman acquired the house from Joseph Priestley Jr. on May 13, 1815 for US$6,250 ($ÃÂ  in 2019). Chapman passed on December 4, 1835, and Rev. James Kay, minister of the Northumberland Unitarian gathering, and his family lived in the house straightaway. James Kay passed on September 22, 1847 and his widow most likely lived in the house until her October 2, 1850 demise. Charles H. Kay, child of James, had bought the house in 1845, a couple of years before his folks' demises. In April 1865 Charles Kay's kids sold the house to Henry R. Campbell for $2,775 ($ÃÂ  in 2019). Florence Bingham bought the house from Campbell for $5,679.53 on January 18, 1868 ($ÃÂ  in 2019), and Bingham's beneficiaries sold it to T. Hugh Johnson for $2,000 on October 7, 1882 ($ÃÂ  in 2019). Kate Scott purchased the house for $3,000 on April 11, 1888 ($ÃÂ  in 2019). In 1911 the last private occupant moved out of the house, and it was sublet to the Pennsylvania Railroad for its specialists (an expansive railroad yard was worked in Northumberland as of now). This prompted a general decrease in the house and its grounds.
