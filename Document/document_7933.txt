The triumph over Tammany prepared for Tilden's race to a two-year term as representative in 1874. As a prevalent, reformist legislative head of a substantial swing state, Tilden was a characteristic contender for the administration in 1876, when one of the fundamental issues was the debasement of the organization of President Ulysses S. Concede. He was selected on the second poll, and crusaded on a stage of change and sound cash (for example the highest quality level). His adversary was Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, in like manner noted for his trustworthiness and hard-cash sees. After the firmly challenged race, with the inquiry still uncertain, Congress and President Grant consented to present the question to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would decide the destiny of the debated discretionary votes. Tilden contradicted the thought, however numerous Democrats upheld it as the best way to maintain a strategic distance from a second Civil War. The commission casted a ballot 8Ã¢ÂÂ 7 to honor Hayes the debated votes. Congressional Democrats submitted in Hayes' decision, yet at a value: the new Republican president pulled back government troops from Southern capitals after his initiation. Tilden was crushedÃ¢ÂÂburglarized, as he would like to think and that of his supporters.
