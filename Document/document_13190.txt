Both "Andrea Doria" and "Caio Duilio" went into drydock in the late 1930s for broad modernizations; this work endured until October and April 1940, individually. At that point, Italy had entered World War II in favor of the Axis powers. The two boats joined the fifth Division based at Taranto. "Caio Duilio" took an interest in a watch proposed to get the British ship and an escort destined for Malta, yet neither one of the targets was found. She and "Andrea Doria" were available amid the British assault on Taranto the evening of 11/12 November 1940. A power of twenty-one Fairey Swordfish torpedo-aircraft, propelled from , assaulted the boats moored in the harbor. "Andrea Doria" was unharmed in the assault, however "Caio Duilio" was hit by a torpedo on her starboard side. She was grounded to keep her from soaking in the harbor and impermanent fixes were affected to enable her to head out to Genoa for lasting fixes, which started in January 1941. In February, she was assaulted by the British Force H; a few warships endeavored to shell "Caio Duilio" while she was in dock, however they scored no hits. Fix work endured until May 1941, when she rejoined the armada at Taranto.
