Williams had needed to make a repulsiveness amusement for a long time preceding "Phantasmagoria", and had begun to structure one on a few events, however none happened as expected. She felt the PC diversion industry and programming innovation had not yet achieved the point where a powerful and alarming PC amusement could be made. Therefore, she chose to hold up until CD-ROMs were quicker and could deal with genuine performing artists, which she accepted was significant for a frightfulness diversion since she felt the player must most likely understand the character to fear for them. Williams had been thinking about a few awfulness story thoughts for quite a long time before making the diversion. In one, the champion answers a mystical performer's commercial for an associate and lands the position, however the conjurer ends up being crazy. Another was set previously, with the female hero getting associated with the otherworldly existence of a mystical performer character. That thought advanced into a lady being hitched to a man who is attracted to an unusual house that recently had a place with illusionists and is spooky by apparitions. The last story as it shows up in the diversion has a contemporary setting, yet consolidates components from present day fiction, nineteenth century writing, and exemplary blood and gore movies of the 1950s.
