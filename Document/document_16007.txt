These lemurs are territorial, with territory size dependent upon food availability, though territories typically cover . Because of their fast movement, individuals can easily defend their territories by traversing it within 5Â minutes. Territory overlap is minimal between males, and the same pattern is seen in females, though males and females may overlap their territories. In areas where territory overlap occurs ("meeting areas"), several neighbors may gather and vocalize together without aggression. Multiple family groups may gather in these meeting areas, and females will often socialize with the other females and young. Unlike other lemurs, fork-marked lemurs do not scent-mark, and instead use vocalizations during territorial confrontations. They are considered very vocal animals, and have a complex range of calls. On average, males make approximately 30Â loud calls per hour, and are most vocal at dusk and dawn. Their high-pitched, whistling calls help researchers identify them in the field. As well as their stress call and fighting call, they emit a "Hon" call (contact call between male-female pairs), "Ki" and "Kiu" calls (more excited contact calls that identify the caller), and a "Kea" call (a loud call shared between males in adjacent territories). Females also make a ""bleating"" call when they have infants.
