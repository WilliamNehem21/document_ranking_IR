While the hurricane was still in the Gulf of Mexico on September 28, the Norwegian barque "Saturn" foundered off Key West. Her crew was rescued by a steamship and brought to New York City. As the storm came ashore, the Cedar Keys were struck by a storm surge that victims often erroneously called a "tidal wave." Yankeetown received an even higher storm surge of . The main street through the center of Cedar Keyâthe most populous island in the Cedar Keys island chainâwas severely flooded by of water, which invaded every building and left large sinkholes when it receded. Sidewalks along the street were washed out. The surge of water undermined the foundations of stone buildings, weakening many of them to the point of collapse, while sweeping away weaker structures. Inside the buildings left intact, mud was sometimes found several feet deep. The hurricane also contaminated wells with seawater and debris, so residents were forced to travel for clean water. Hardest-hit were the small outlying islands, which were fully submerged by the storm surge and "completely cleared out". Survivors often braced against young, supple trees that were able to withstand the storm's force, or used pieces of debris as flotation devices.
