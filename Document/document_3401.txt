The dental recipe is (two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in the upper jaw, and three incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in the lower jaw). Since the predecessors of "P. raceyi" lost the main upper incisor and first and third upper and lower premolars, the upper incisors are assigned I2 and I3 and the premolars are assigned P2 and P4 (uppers) and p2 and p4 (brings down). I2 has an all around grown second cusp notwithstanding the primary cusp and I3 about achieves the tallness of the second cusp of I2. The strong upper canine bears a solitary cusp. P2 is unmistakable and is dislodged somewhat towards the inward side of the toothrow. P4 does not contact the canine. The first and second upper molar (M1 and M2) are about similarly substantial, yet M3 is littler. Every one of the lower incisors bears three cusps and the third (i3) may contact the lower canine (c1). The last tooth has a second cusp, which achieves higher than i3. The p2 contacts the back of c1 and accomplishes between 59-100% the crown zone of p4. The initial two lower molars (m1 and m2) have the back gathering of cusps (talonid) bigger than the front one (trigonid), and m3 is again littler.
