Succeeding Gielgud as driving man at the Old Vic, Richardson had a changed season, in which there were obvious triumphs scattered with basic disappointments. James Agate was not persuaded by him as the overbearing Petruchio in "The Taming of the Shrew"; in "Julius Caesar" the entire cast got lukewarm surveys. In "Othello" Richardson isolated the faultfinders. He stressed the conceivable appeal of the deadly Iago to a degree that Agate thought "great Richardson, however unconcerned Shakespeare", while "The Times" stated, "He never stalked or murmured like a plain lowlife, and, truth be told, we have only occasionally observed a man grin and grin and be a scalawag so enough." His greatest accomplishment of the period was as Bottom in "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Both Agate and Darlington remarked on how the performing artist changed the character from the blundering laborer to the mysteriously changed animal on whom Titania gushes. Agate composed that the vast majority of the individuals who had filled the role up to this point "appear to have thought Bottom, with the ass' head on, was a similar Bottom, just more interesting. Shakespeare says he was 'deciphered', and Mr Richardson interpreted him." With Sybil Thorndike as a visitor star and Richardson as Ralph, "The Knight of the Burning Pestle" was a hit with gatherings of people and commentators, similar to a recovery of "Twelfth Night", with Edith Evans as Viola and Richardson again playing Sir Toby, completing the season to reestablished acclaim.
