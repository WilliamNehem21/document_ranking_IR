On 3 June, the destroyers "Wildfang" and "CsikÃ³s", along with "93Â F" and "96Â F", briefly encountered three Italian MAS boats off the mouth of the Tagliamento river in the far north of the Adriatic. On 23 September, "77Â T" and "78Â T" were laying a minefield off Grado in the northern Adriatic when they had a brief encounter with an Italian MAS boat. The following night, "94Â F" and three other torpedo boats again had a short and inconclusive engagement with Italian torpedo boats in the northern Adriatic. On 29 September, "90Â F", "94Â F" and "98Â M" were accompanying a squadron of four destroyers supporting an air attack on the Italian airfield at Ferrara by flying boats. After destroying an Italian airship, the squadron withdrew at high speed in the darkness, but was intercepted by an Italian squadron of eight destroyers that had been sent to support an Italian air raid on Pola. In the resultant 45 minute chase towards Parenzo, two Italian destroyers and three Austro-Hungarian destroyers were damaged, and "94Â F" was hit by splinters. As the squadron retreated through the minefields off Parenzo, "98Â M" was also hit by Italian fire, resulting in one casualty.
