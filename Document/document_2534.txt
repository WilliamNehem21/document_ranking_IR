In spite of the fact that the 2000 release of the Coincraft inventory of British coins says the wartime stop was because of an excess of pennies, numismatist Kerry Rodgers, in his 2016 article on the cash crisis in Fiji amid the Second World War, refered to a pioneer authoritative record such that it was to monitor copper for weapons. Starting with the 1942 generation of 1940-dated pennies, the structure was changed, as tin was a basic war material, uncommon in light of the fact that the majority of it originated from Malaya, so pennies from that point until some other time in 1945 are 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, and 2.5 percent zinc. Such coins stain to a shading unique in relation to the prewar coins, and they were treated with sodium thiosulphate to give them a darker tone. That substance, named "hypo", had been utilized to obscure every one of the 1934 pennies before issue and the vast majority of the 1935 mintage, "Hypo" would be utilized again in 1946, staining the coins to demoralize the storing of new pennies. Despite the fact that the prewar compound was reestablished in 1945, the Mint turned around itself in 1959, made pennies out of that wartime structure for the rest of the coin's pre-decimal history without concoction treatment, and proceeded with its utilization for the new decimal bronze pieces.
