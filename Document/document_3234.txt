Different students of history, including Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, express that Deusdedit kicked the bucket on 14 July 664. The primary contention was advanced by Grosjean, who asserted that Bede had the sanctification date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would regularly have been decided for a sanctification. Grosjean contends that the best strategy for settling the contentions is to simply take 14ÃÂ July 664 as the date of death, and figure in reverse with the length of rule given by Bede, which gives a sanctification date of 12ÃÂ March 655. Thacker and Abels concur by and large, in spite of the fact that Thacker does not give a particular sanctification date past March. Abels adds to Grosjean's contentions Bede's relationship of Deusdedit's demise with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as happening around the same time. Bede expresses that the plague of 664 started not long after the obscuration on 1ÃÂ May. Nothing in Bede repudiates the date of 14ÃÂ July 664 for Eorcenberht; in this way, Abels believes that date to be the best fit for the accessible information. The antiquarian D. P. Kirby concurs that Deusdedit kicked the bucket in 664, in spite of the fact that he doesn't give an exact date inside that year.
