Like different ankylosaurids, "Ankylosaurus" had cervical half-rings (defensive layer plates on the neck), however these are known just from pieces, making their careful game plan unsure. Craftsman proposed that when seen from over, the plates would have been combined, making a rearranged V-shape over the neck, with the midline hole likely being loaded up with little ossicles (round hard scutes) to consider development. He trusted the width of this protection belt was too wide to even consider having fitted exclusively on the neck, and that it secured the base of the neck and proceeded onto the shoulder locale. Arbor and Philip J. Currie couldn't help contradicting Carpenter's understanding in 2015 and brought up that the cervical half-ring pieces of example AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the route proposed via Carpenter (however this could be because of breakage). They rather recommended that the sections spoke to the remaining parts of two cervical half-rings, which shaped two semi-roundabout plates of shield around the upper piece of the neck, as in the firmly related "Anodontosaurus" and "Euoplocephalus". Arbor and Mallon expounded on this thought, depicting the state of these half-rings as "constant U-molded burdens" over the upper piece of the neck, and proposed that "Ankylosaurus" had six keeled osteoderms with oval bases on every half-ring. Different ankylosaurids regularly have numerous littler osteoderms encompassing these bigger ones.
