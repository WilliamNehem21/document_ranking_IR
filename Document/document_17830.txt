"Isopogon anemonifolius" grows as a woody shrub to in height, but is restricted to around on exposed heaths and headlands. The leaves are long and fork after into three segments, and then often fork a second time. The leaf tips are pointed. Leaves can vary markedly on single plants, though some leaves are undivided. Leaf surfaces are generally smooth, though occasionally covered with fine hair. Its flat leaves distinguish it from the terete (round in cross section) leaves of "Isopogon anethifolius"; they are also broader, at wide compared with the 1Â mm (Â in) wide leaves of the latter species. The new growth and leaves of "I. anemonifolius" may be flushed red to purple in colour, particularly in winter. The globular inflorescences appear any time from July to January, being most abundant in October. They are in diameter, and grow terminally at the tips of branches, or occasionally axillary (arising on short stems off branches). The individual flowers are around long. They are straight stalkless structures arising from a basal scale. The perianth, a tube that envelopes the flower's sexual organs, splits into four segments, revealing a thin delicate style that is tipped with the stigma. At the ends of the four perianth segments are the male pollen-bearing structures known as anthers. Arranged in a spiral pattern, the flowers open from the bottom of the flowerhead inwards. Flowering is followed by the development of the round fruiting cones, which have a diameter of . The seed-bearing nuts are smallâup to acrossâand lined with hairs.
