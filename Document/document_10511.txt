After 1551, the Reformation progressed further, with the endorsement and consolation of Edward, who started to apply increasingly close to home impact in his job as Supreme Head of the congregation. The new changes were likewise a reaction to analysis from such reformers as John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, and the Scot John Knox, who was utilized as a clergyman in Newcastle upon Tyne under the Duke of Northumberland and whose proclaiming at court incited the ruler to contradict stooping at fellowship. Cranmer was likewise affected by the perspectives on the mainland reformer Martin Bucer, who kicked the bucket in England in 1551, by Peter Martyr, who was instructing at Oxford, and by other outside scholars. The advancement of the Reformation was further speeded by the sanctification of more reformers as religious administrators. In the winter of 1551Ã¢ÂÂ 52, Cranmer modified the "Book of Common Prayer" in less questionable reformist terms, changed group law, and arranged a doctrinal explanation, the Forty-two Articles, to illuminate the act of the improved religion, especially in the troublesome matter of the fellowship administration. Cranmer's definition of the transformed religion, at long last stripping the fellowship administration of any thought of the genuine nearness of God in the bread and the wine, adequately abrogated the mass. As indicated by Elton, the production of Cranmer's modified petition book in 1552, upheld by a second Act of Uniformity, "denoted the landing of the English Church at Protestantism". The supplication book of 1552 remains the establishment of the Church of England's administrations. In any case, Cranmer was unfit to execute every one of these changes once it turned out to be clear in spring 1553 that King Edward, upon whom the entire Reformation in England depended, was kicking the bucket.
