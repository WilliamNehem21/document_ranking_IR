The skeleton was collected on a farm named "Pocho Sastre" near Bajada Moreno in the Telsen Department of Chubut Province, Argentina. Because it was embedded in a large hematite concretion, a very hard kind of rock, preparation was complicated and progressed slowly. In 1985, Bonaparte published a note presenting "Carnotaurus sastrei" as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw. The generic name (Latin "carno" [carnis] â "flesh" and "taurus" â "bull") refers to the bull-like horns, while the specific name "sastrei" honors Angel Sastre, the owner of the ranch where the skeleton was found. A comprehensive description of the whole skeleton followed in 1990. After "Abelisaurus", "Carnotaurus" was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered. For years, it was by far the best-understood member of its family, and also the best-understood theropod from the Southern Hemisphere. It was not until the 21st century that similar well-preserved abelisaurids were described, including "Aucasaurus", "Majungasaurus" and "Skorpiovenator", allowing scientists to re-evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of "Carnotaurus". The holotype skeleton is displayed in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, Bernardino Rivadavia; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world. Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life-sized sculpture of "Carnotaurus" that was previously on display at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This sculpture, ordered by the museum during the mid-1980s, is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin.
