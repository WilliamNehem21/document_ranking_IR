Tracey Ross was originally hesitant to audition for another soap opera after her stint as Diana Douglas on "Ryan's Hope" from 1985 to 1987, which she compared to "working in a morgue" because the show was constantly threatened with cancellation. She initially rejected the offer to play Eve Russell, but she was repeatedly contacted by NBC about the role over several months before her agent convinced her to audition for "Passions"' casting director Jackie Briskey. Ross said later that she did not realize that "Passions" was supposed to be "wacky" until the character Grace Bennett floated out of her bedroom window. Based on the first week's scripts, she described "Passions" as "my kind of show" owing to the supernatural and fantasy elements. Ross played the role from the series debut on July 5, 1999 to its finale on August 7, 2008. In 2003, actresses Amanda Maiden and Kimberly Kevon Williams played the character in flashbacks to her childhood and her time as a nightclub singer. Ross described "Passions" as the opposite of "Ryan's Hope"; "Passions", she felt, was "the spring of a soap opera" because of the cast and crew's excitement about future storylines, while "Ryan's Hope" was "the winter of one" due to the fear of cancellation.
