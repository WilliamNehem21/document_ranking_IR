Similarly as with "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors", Aksys Games confined "Ideals' Last Reward" for its North American discharge. Nobara Nakayama deciphered the diversion's content from Japanese to English, which was then restricted by manager Ben Bateman. Bateman later expressed that beating different interpretation issues was one of the hardest parts of altering "Righteousness' Last Reward". In spite of the fact that Uchikoshi had composed the amusement in light of the English-language gathering of people, which kept away from a few plot-related interpretation issues, a couple of jokes did not make an interpretation of appropriately and must be changed amid restriction. There were likewise two characters who "talked like creatures" in the Japanese variant of the diversion: Zero III, who included "- usa" as far as possible of its sentences, which is the principal half of "usagi" (the Japanese word for "rabbit"); and Sigma, who included "- nya" (the Japanese likeness in sound for the sound felines make) as far as possible of his sentences at whatever point he discussed felines. Bateman fathomed this by composing rabbit and feline themed plays on words. Another test for Bateman was monitoring the story minutes from each stretching way. It was vital to know whether data with respect to each character had been uncovered yet to the player in that course of events, as this would eventually influence the word decision and frame of mind of each line of discourse.
