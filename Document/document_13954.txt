Osgood's better half ventured in and took steps to sue Ellet except if she formally apologized for her implications. She withdrew her announcements in a letter to Osgood saying, "The letter appeared by Mrs Poe "probably been a phony"" made by Poe himself. She put all the fault on Poe, recommending the occurrence was on the grounds that Poe was "inordinate and subject to demonstrations of lunacy". Ellet spread the gossip of Poe's madness, which was taken up by different foes of Poe and announced in papers. The St. Louis "Reveille" revealed: "talk is available for use in New York, such that Mr. Edgar A. Poe, the artist and creator, has been unsettled, and his companions are going to put him under the charge of Dr. Brigham of the Insane Retreat at Utica." The embarrassment inevitably faded away just when Osgood rejoined with her better half. Virginia, nonetheless, had been influenced by the entire undertaking. She had gotten mysterious letters about her significant other's supposed careless activities as ahead of schedule as July 1845. It is assumed that Ellet was included with these letters, and they so aggravated Virginia that she supposedly proclaimed on her deathbed that "Mrs. E. had been her killer."
