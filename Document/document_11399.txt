The red myzomela was portrayed in three artworks in a lot of early representations known as the Watling illustrations, done in the main long periods of European settlement of Sydney somewhere in the range of 1788 and 1794. In view of these, English ornithologist John Latham portrayed it as three separate species in 1801. He based the portrayal of "Certhia sanguinolenta" on a juvenile male shedding into grown-up plumage with inadequate red colouration, considering it the sanguineous creeper. In a similar distribution he portrayed "Certhia dibapha", the cochineal creeper, and "C. erythropygia", the red-rumped creeper. English naturalist James Francis Stephens called it "Meliphaga sanguinea" in 1826 as a substitution name for Latham's "Certhia sanguinolenta". John Gould decided Latham's three names to be the one animal categories in 1843, embracing the primary composed binomial name as the legitimate one and consigning the others to synonymy, however the name "Myzomela dibapha" was every so often utilized, especially in New Caledonia. In 1990, Ian McAllan suggested that the primary illustration did not affirm the species personality and proposed the name "Myzomela dibapha" to subsequently be the most seasoned truly distributed name, anyway Richard Schodde countered in 1992 that the illustration of a juvenile male couldn't be of some other species, implying that "M. sanguinolenta" should stand. He included that the option proposed name had not been being used since the 1850s. The Wakolo myzomela, Sulawesi myzomela, Banda myzomela, and New Caledonian myzomela were all recently viewed as conspecific with the red myzomela. There are no perceived subspecies nor provincial varieties; contrasts in watched plumage are because of wear in the wake of shedding.
