Adult moths prefer white or whitish-yellow flowers as a nectar source, which indicates that visual cues play a large role in their selection. Most flowers visited are inflorescences of small flowers or have dense filaments, giving them the appearance of a bottle brush, often because of the conspicuous projecting stamens as in many Leguminosae (Mimosoideae, Myrtaceae and Combretaceae). However, not all white flowers elicit a response: the white and showy flowers of "Omphalea oppositifolia" are not visited by the adult moths. Nectar sources include the flowers of:
All these flowers are white, with the exception of "Camellia sinensis" which has a yellow centre, and all either have dense filaments or are formed of tight clusters of small flowers.
This spectacular moth is considered one of the most impressive and beautiful Lepidoptera, rivalling almost any of the butterflies in brilliance of colouring and form. It is featured in most coffee table books on the Lepidoptera, and is much sought after by collectors. It is collected in the wild, and raised commercially for the international butterfly trade; its wings were used to make jewellery in the Victorian era.
The Madagascan sunset moth appeared on a 6 maloti postage stamp in the Lesotho Postal Services "Butterflies of Africa" issue of 20 August 2007. Only one of the four species of host plants, "Omphalea oppositifolia", is used to raise the moth commercially, mainly using plants collected in the wild, but also some cultivated for the purpose.
