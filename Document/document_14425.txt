Smith, Field and others met in Salisbury on 13 March 1962 and consented to join against Whitehead as the Rhodesian Front (RF). The Front went from previous UFP men, including Smith, who upheld steady change and a legislature dependent on legitimacy and discretionary capabilities, to the Dominion Party's all the more conservative individuals, some of whom held segregationist sees not unlike those of South Africa's National Party. In the midst of these distinctions, the early RF alliance was flimsy, best case scenario. Its individuals were united by their normal resistance to Whitehead's guarantees of quick track change, which they concurred would prompt a Congo-style national emergency, the trip of the white network and eventually the nation's obliteration. In the more extensive Cold War setting, the passionately hostile to socialist RF sought to speak to a professional Western defense in Africa, close by South Africa and Portugal, notwithstanding what they saw as Soviet and Chinese expansionism. Smith affirmed that the RF attempted to foil "this frantic thought of a hand-over, of a rat of the European and his civilisation, in reality of all that he had put into his nation". "The white man is the ace of Rhodesia," he said; "[he] has constructed it and means to keep it".
