"Psilocybe pseudoaztecorum", found in India, differs from "P.Â aztecorum" in the morphology of the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia. The characteristic filamentous neck present in the cystidia of "P.Â aztecorum" is absent in "P.Â pseudoaztecorum". "P.Â pseudoaztecorum" had been previously described by K.Â Natarajan and N.Â Raman as "P.Â aztecorum", but they published the taxon with a new name after consultation with GuzmÃ¡n. Fresh specimens of "P.Â aztecorum" resemble "P.Â pelliculosa", but this latter species is found only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. Like "P.Â aztecorum", the caps of the South African species "P.Â natalensis" also bleach to nearly white when dried. The closely related "P.Â baeocystis" also bleaches in color to white when dry. Found in northwest North America from British Columbia to Washington and Oregon, "P.Â baeocystis" has thinner cheilocystidia than "P.Â aztecorum" (typically measuring 20â32 by 4.4â6Â Î¼m) and its pleurocystidia, when present, are found only near the gill edge. "P.Â quebecensis", known only from Quebec, Canada, has pleurocystidia measuring 12â25 by 5â10Â Î¼m. Although the phylogeny of the species comprising section "Aztecorum" is not known with certainty, GuzmÃ¡n has suggested that "P.Â aztecorum" was the ancestor of "P.Â baeocystis" in northwestern North America and of "P.Â quebecensis" in northeastern North America.
