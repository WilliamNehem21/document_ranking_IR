The boundary clauses of the Ãthelstan A charters were written in correct Old English, so it is unlikely that he was of foreign origin. The witness lists of the Ãthelstan A charters consistently place Bishop Ãlfwine of Lichfield in Mercia in a higher position than his rank warranted. King Ãthelstan was probably brought up in Mercia, and in Sarah Foot's view he was probably intimate with Ãlfwine before King Edward's death; as Ãlfwine disappeared from the witness lists at the same time as the Ãthelstan A charters ended, she suggests that he may have been Ãthelstan A. Keynes thinks it more likely Ãthelstan A was a king's priest from Mercia, who acquired his learning in a Mercian religious house and respected Ãlfwine as a fellow Mercian; that Ãthelstan A entered Ãthelstan's service before he became king and was in permanent attendance on him. David Woodman also considers a Mercian origin likely, pointing out that some Mercian ninth-century charters have borrowings from Aldhelm, an important source of Ãthelstan A's style. Woodman also puts forward the alternative idea that Ãthelstan A had a connection with Glastonbury Abbey in Wessex, which appears to have been a centre of learning at this time, and certainly housed many of the texts which informed Ãthelstan A's idiosyncratic Latin style.
