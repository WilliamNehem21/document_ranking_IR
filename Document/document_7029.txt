Anne's more seasoned sister Mary had moved to the Netherlands after her marriage to William of Orange. Protestant restriction to James was along these lines progressively centered around Anne and George rather than Mary, who was beneficiary possible. The social and political gathering focused on George and Anne was known as the "Cockpit Circle" after their London habitation. On 5 November 1688, William attacked England in an activity, known as the "Brilliant Revolution", which at last removed King James. George was cautioned by the Danish agent in London, Frederick Gersdorff, that William was collecting an intrusion armada. George educated Gersdorff that James' military was offended, and therefore he would deny any order under James, however just fill in as an uncommissioned volunteer. Gersdorff's elective intend to empty George and Anne to Denmark was dismissed by George. George went with the King's troops to Salisbury in mid-November, yet different nobles and their officers before long abandoned James for William. At every abandonment, George clearly shouted, ""Est-il conceivable?"" (Is it conceivable?). He surrendered James on 24 November, and favored William. "So 'Est-il conceivable' is gone as well", James evidently commented. In his journals, James rejected George's absconding as insignificant, saying the loss of one great trooper was of more result, yet Gersdorff asserted the abandonment significantly irritated the King. The abandonment of George and different nobles was instrumental in shaving endlessly the King's help. In December, James fled to France, and early the next year William and Mary were proclaimed joint rulers, with Anne as beneficiary possible.
