The film was roused by real "Duck and Cover" films from the 1960s, in which youngsters were told to stow away under tables or incline toward dividers on account of an atomic weapon assault; Parker and Stone, in the same way as other faultfinders of the movies, found the strategies horrendously shortsighted and did not trust they would really help on account of such an assault. Jimbo and Ned are portrayed as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military clash between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that endured from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is extremely youthful to have taken an interest in the war, cases to have flashbacks to his encounters in it. Patrick Duffy, the American TV on-screen character best known for his jobs in the shows "Dallas" and "Well ordered", shows up in the scene as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone asserted there was no specific reason Duffy was picked as the leg aside from that he is such a dull on-screen character: "He's simply too tasteless. Like, how would you be able to perhaps be a devotee of Patrick Duffy?"
