From mid 1929 Anderson lived with Annie Burr Jennings, a rich Park Avenue old maid upbeat to have somebody she expected to be a little girl of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. At that point an example of foolish conduct started that finished in her pitching fits, executing her pet parakeet, and on one event going around exposed on the rooftop. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court marked a request submitting her to a psychological medical clinic. Before she could be removed, Anderson secured herself her room, and the entryway was broken in with a hatchet. She was persuasively taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she stayed for somewhat over a year. In August 1932, Anderson came back to Germany joined by a private attendant in a bolted lodge on the liner "Deutschland". Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an extra a half year's consideration in the mental wing of a nursing home at Ilten close Hanover. On landing in Ilten, Anderson was evaluated as rational, yet as the room was paid ahead of time, and she had no place else to go, she remained on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.
