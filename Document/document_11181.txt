The King Island emu ("Dromaius novaehollandiae minor") is a terminated subspecies of emu that was endemic to King Island, in the Bass Strait between terrain Australia and Tasmania. Its nearest relative might be the terminated Tasmanian emu ("D. n. diemenensis"), as they had a place with a solitary populace until under 14,000 years back, when Tasmania and King Island were as yet associated. The little size of the King Island emu might be a case of separate dwarfism. The King Island emu was the littlest of every known emu, and had darker plumage than the territory emu. It was dark and darker, and had stripped blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the territory. The subspecies was particular from the in like manner small Kangaroo Island emu ("D. n. baudinianus") in various osteological subtleties, including size. The conduct of the King Island emu presumably did not contrast much from that of the territory emu. The feathered creatures assembled in groups to scavenge and amid rearing time. They benefited from berries, grass and kelp. They ran quickly, and could safeguard themselves by kicking. The home was shallow, and comprised of dead leaves and greenery. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were brooded by the two guardians.
