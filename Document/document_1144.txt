In the mean time, Sullivan may have been thinking about an arrival to light musical show: "Cox and Box", his first comic musical show, had gotten a London restoration (co-featuring his sibling, Fred Sullivan) in September 1874. In November, Sullivan made a trip to Paris and reached Albert Millaud, one of the librettists for Jacques Offenbach's operettas. Be that as it may, he came back to London with hardly a penny and chipped away at accidental music for the Gaiety Theater's generation of "The Merry Wives of Windsor". By mid 1875, Carte was overseeing Selina Dolaro's Royalty Theater, and he required a short musical show to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's "La PÃÂ©richole", which was to open on 30 January (with Fred Sullivan in the cast), in which Dolaro featured. Carte had approached Sullivan to create something for the theater and promoted in "The Times" in late January: "In Preparation, a New Comic Opera formed explicitly for this auditorium by Mr. Arthur Sullivan in which Madame Dolaro and Nellie Bromley will show up." But around a similar time, Carte additionally recollected Gilbert's "Preliminary by Jury" and realized that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to make "Thespis". He recommended to Gilbert that Sullivan was the man to compose the music for "Preliminary".
