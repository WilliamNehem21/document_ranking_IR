Gaga and Cooper co-composed and delivered the greater part of the melodies on the soundtrack for "A Star Is Born", which she demanded they perform live in the film. Its lead single, "Shallow", performed by the two, was discharged in September and has achieved number one out of a few nations including the United States. The tune earned Gaga an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Original Song, just as the Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media. The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, including 19 unique melodies, and got commonly positive surveys; Mark Kennedy of "The Washington Post" considered it a "five-star wonder" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "The Guardian" named it a "moment works of art loaded with Gaga's enthusiastic may". Gaga got a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music for her work on the collection. Industrially, the soundtrack appeared at number one in the US, making Gaga the main lady with five US number one collections during the 2010s, and breaking her tie with Taylor Swift as the most for any female craftsman this decade. It furthermore beat the graphs in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. Soon thereafter, Gaga declared her commitment to headhunter Christian Carino whom she had met in mid 2017. They finished the commitment in February 2019.
