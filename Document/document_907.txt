"Agharta" has experienced positive basic reassessment, starting in 1980 when Davis came back to the jazz scene. Of the collections reporting his 1973Ã¢ÂÂ 75 band, it was considered by numerous faultfinders to be the best, everything considered. For Giddins, it had turned out to be one of his most loved collections from the trumpeter's electric time frame, as he reexamined its components of show, constant pressure, and what he thought about the best exhibitions of Fortune and Cosey's professions. "There truly isn't a minute when the music neglects to mirror the ministrations of the alchemist himself", he later said. Davis biographer Jack Chambers trusted it demonstrated much better than the majority of his other electric collections; the "Maiysha" and "Jack Johnson" fragments specifically "mysteriously brought into center the melodic powers over which many idea Davis had lost control". In "" (1981), Christgau considered it to be his best music since "Jack Johnson", an "irate, separated, out of control" record based on the septet's virtuosic execution, especially Foster's "honest show of hacks" and Fortune's execution, which he regarded the best woodwind playing on a Davis collection from this decade. Thinking about the trumpeter's 1970s show chronicles in "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" (1992), J. D. Considine fought that "Agharta"s "then again nervy, idyllic, trancelike, and rough" music had persevered through the progression of time best.
