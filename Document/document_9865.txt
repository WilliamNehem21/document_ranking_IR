"Brachiosaurus" is known just from the Morrison Formation of western North America (following the reassignment of the African species). The Morrison Formation is translated as a semiarid domain with particular wet and dry seasons, and level floodplains. A few other sauropod genera were available in the Morrison Formation, with contrasting body extents and encouraging adjustments. Among these were "Apatosaurus", "Barosaurus", "Camarasaurus", "Diplodocus", "Haplocanthosaurus", and "Supersaurus". "Brachiosaurus" was one of the less plentiful Morrison Formation sauropods. In a 2003 study of more than 200 fossil territories, John Foster revealed 12 examples of the variety, practically identical to "Barosaurus" (13) and "Haplocanthosaurus" (12), however far less than "Apatosaurus" (112), "Camarasaurus" (179), and "Diplodocus" (98). "Brachiosaurus" fossils are discovered just in the lower-center piece of the far reaching Morrison Formation (stratigraphic zones 2Ã¢ÂÂ 4), dated to about 154Ã¢ÂÂ 153 million years prior, not at all like numerous different kinds of sauropod which have been found all through the arrangement. On the off chance that the extensive foot revealed from Wyoming (the northernmost event of a brachiosaurid in North America) belonged to "Brachiosaurus", the sort would have secured a wide scope of scopes. Brachiosaurids could process intense vegetation with their wide delegated teeth, and may in this manner have secured a more extensive scope of vegetational zones than for instance diplodocids. Camarasaurids, which were comparative in tooth morphology to brachiosaurids, were likewise across the board and are known to have relocated occasionally, so this may have additionally been valid for brachiosaurids.
