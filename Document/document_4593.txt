The main "Catopsbaatar" example which saves the postcranial skeleton is PM120/107, which is fragmentary. It incorporates components which are obscure, or not completely saved, in different multituberculates. One lumbar vertebra (the fifth or 6th, from between the rib confine and the pelvis) had a spinous procedure which was strong in side view and long when seen from above. The clavicle was somewhat less bended than that of "Kryptobaatar" (looking like a twisted pole which broadened at each end), and estimated about . The upper piece of the scapulocoracoid was moderately wide in side view, and the lower part was extremely tight. It was most likely about long when complete. The saved piece of the humerus (upper arm bone) was about long. Its pole was triangular in cross-area, moderately slender when seen from above, and a large portion of its width was involved by the intertubercular groove. This section was delimited as an afterthought by the peak of the more noteworthy tubercle, whose center part framed the deltopectoral peak. The ulnar condyle, where the ulna of the lower arm enunciated with the humerus, was more conspicuous than the outspread condyle (where the sweep explained), oval, and delimited from the spiral condyle by a furrow. The sweep was about long, with a conspicuous head. Its pole was smooth, compacted start to finish, and oval in cross-segment. The ulna was compacted sideways, compliment than the sweep, and about long as safeguarded.
