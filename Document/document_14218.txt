Heinlein draws a similarity between the human culture in the novel, which is wealthy however should be watchful against the colonialist risk of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Analysts have proposed that the Arachnids are Heinlein's simple for socialists. Attributes used to help this incorporate the mutual idea of the Arachnids, which makes them equipped for an a lot higher level of coordination than the people. Bug society is once expressly portrayed as socialist, and is in addition delineated as socialist ordinarily; this has been perused as inferring that those with an alternate political belief system are closely resembling outsider creatures. The related themes of outsider attack, nationalism, and a disregard for one's own needs amid war, are available, as are different parts of U.S. pop culture of the 1950s. Analysts have contended that Heinlein's depiction of outsiders, just as being a reference to individuals in socialist nations, summons the figure of speech of an arrival to the boondocks. The idea of the wilderness incorporates a social-Darwinist contention of continually battling for survival, even to the detriment of indigenous individuals or, on account of "Starship Troopers", of outsiders. Heinlein recommends that without regional development including brutal triumph of different races, people would be obliterated. Researcher Jamie King has expressed that Heinlein does not address the subject of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and contends that Heinlein has set up a general public intended to be constantly at war, and to continue extending its domain.
