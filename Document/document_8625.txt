Nielsen composed three concertos: the Violin Concerto, Op. 33 is a center period work, from 1911, which exists in the custom of European elegance, though the Flute Concerto (without creation number) of 1926 and the Clarinet Concerto, Op. 57 which followed in 1928 are late works, affected by the innovation of the 1920s and, as per the Danish musicologist Herbert Rosenberg, the result of "an incredibly experienced writer who realizes how to evade inessentials." Unlike Nielsen's later works, the Violin Concerto has an unmistakable, song situated neo-traditional structure. The Flute Concerto, in two developments, was composed for the flute player Holger Gilbert-Jespersen, an individual from the Copenhagen Wind Quintet which had debuted Nielsen's Wind Quintet (1922). As opposed to the fairly conventional style of the Violin Concerto, it mirrors the advanced patterns of the period. The main development, for instance, switches between D minor, E-level minor and F major before the flute goes to the fore with a cantabile subject in E major. The Clarinet Concerto was likewise composed for an individual from the Copenhagen Wind Quintet, Aage Oxenvad. Nielsen extends the limits of instrument and player to the most extreme; the concerto has only one nonstop development and contains a battle between the soloist and the symphony and between the two essential contending keys, F major and E major.
