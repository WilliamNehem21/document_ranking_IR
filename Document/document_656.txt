The other line in the long run procured by the CL&N was the Middletown and Cincinnati Railway (M&C, not to be mistaken for the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad talked about before). Paul J. Sorg, proprietor of a tobacco plant east of Middletown, was discontent with the administration given by the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad (at that point free) and Cincinnati and Springfield Railway (Big Four framework), the two of which skirted the focal point of town. Sorg and partners joined the M&C in mid 1890, and overviewed a line from Middletown, which lay in the Great Miami River valley, southeast to a point that would be known as Middletown Junction on the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania framework). Development on most of the course, which crossed the CL&N at Hageman, was finished by September 1891, and a bracket connect over the Little Miami River opened in mid 1892, connecting the line to the Pennsylvania. Access into focal Middletown was deferred until December, when it was at long last ready to cross the CH&D to its stop. Instead of the CL&N and DL&C, the M&C was straight and level, giving a smooth ride, and turned a sensible benefit. The income was insufficient, be that as it may, to satisfy the bonds, and the M&C entered receivership in July 1894. The holders of liens against the property purchased the line at abandonment in October for $335,000, consolidated the Middletown and Cincinnati "Railroad" in December, and chose Sorg president.
