An ensuing examination found a reproduced motor disappointment methodology was being led, which included an individual from the group pulling back the throttle switch for motor No. 4 before taking off. Specialists found that if the throttle switch was pulled back excessively far, it would make the propeller invertÃ¢ÂÂa component intended to moderate the air ship after landing. When the arrival gear was raised, the team would need to bring a metal banner up in the cockpit to bring the propeller edges once again into the right position, since a wellbeing gadget kept electric power from working the turning instrument at the foundations of the sharp edges except if the air ship was on the ground or the banner was physically raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) closed one of the flight group connected full capacity to No. 4 motor, figuring this would bring the airplane out of the expanding bank. Since the cutting edges were turned around and the banner was not raised, that expanded the switch push from No. 4 motor, causing the DC-6 to winding wild. Since the plane was so near the ground, the suddenness of the bank and jump implied the flight team got no opportunity to recuperate the air ship before effect.
