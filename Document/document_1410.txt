Blackburn's feelings lay with the Confederacy at the flare-up of the Civil War. Too old to even consider enlisting in the Confederate Army, he went about as an agent for Kentucky representative Beriah Magoffin to acquire weapons from Louisiana for the protection of Kentucky, however he neglected to verify the arms. In mid 1862, he was relegated to the staff of Major General Sterling Price as a specialist. Mississippi Governor John J. Pettus designated him as one of two officials to regulate the consideration of the state's injured troopers in February 1863. In the wake of verifying adequate medicinal supplies for the injured, Blackburn made a trip to Richmond, Virginia, to meet with Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon and offered to fill in as General Inspector of Hospitals and Camps without taking remuneration or a position. At the point when the offer was cannot, Governor Pettus requested that Blackburn travel to Canada to gather arrangements for barricade sprinters there. Blackburn and his better half left Mississippi for Halifax, Nova Scotia, in August 1863, at that point proceeded to Toronto (in what was then the Province of Canada) where they stopped in a boardinghouse. On one event, Blackburn was on board a barricade running boat conveying ice from Halifax to Mobile, Alabama, when the ship was caught by the Union Navy. Association authorities accepted Blackburn was a regular citizen traveler on the vessel and discharged him, after which he came back to Canada.
