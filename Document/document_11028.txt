Present-day Rock Springs has a populace pushing 20,000. The previous settlement is an undeniable city. The territory that once included Camp Pilot Butte is situated on the north bank of Bitter Creek, in the northwest piece of the city. The camp secured sections of land of Union Pacific property; the procession ground was in the focal point of a present-day city square limited by Soulsby Street on the west, Pilot Butte Avenue on the east, Bridger Avenue on the north and Elias Avenue on its south. In 1973, the region where the military post once existed was recorded on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a historically significant area. Around then, there were just two staying unique structures. The two structures were claimed by the Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church in Rock Springs. The structures are never again surviving, and the property is never again recorded on the National Register. The zone that was once Chinatown, only north of where Camp Pilot Butte once stood, had an open primary school worked over piece of it. When all is said in done, the areas in Rock Springs related with the slaughter have been encompassed and consumed by the city's development.
