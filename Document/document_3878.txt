A prior rendition of "Full on Idle", "Title TK"s eighth track, was discharged on the Amps' "Pacer" in 1995. In a 1997 meeting, Deal communicated an enthusiasm for re-trying numerous Amps tunes, in part since she didn't feel "Pacer" was very much recorded. Bryant opined that the two adaptations of "Full on Idle" sound nearly the equivalent, yet "The Village Voice"s Jessica Grose composed that the Breeders' interpretation is recognizably slower. In Cibula's view, this variant contains components of blue grass music, cumbia, and ska. "The Guardian"s Betty Clarke refered to the line "Comply with your colorist, dye everything without end" for instance of "Title TK"s diverting, askew verses. On "Evil Foxx", Deal over and over sings "Has anybody seen the iguana?" She has clarified this just like a reference to purchasing weed: "Have you at any point purchased a sack of weed? You stroll in, and the pot vendor has an unfilled terrarium ... Each time I go to a pot seller's home, there's no iguana." Another line, "I'm in lager class each Thursday night", alludes to the liquor mindfulness classes that Richard Presley went to in the wake of being found driving while alcoholic. Phares portrayed the melody as having a "hot threat", and Berger contrasted the drum part with shots and entryway thumping.
