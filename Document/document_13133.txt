The Patent Office dismissed his application saying that it was anything but another compound.

At the encouraging of his better half, he made the primary arrangement of treated steel flatware for her own utilization. The principal bit of treated steel was produced by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes lab. It was an extensive meat blade and was given to the Haynes Museum by the group of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he professed to have made tempered steel since she didn't appreciate cleaning their silver silverware. English metallurgist Harry Brearley freely created an indistinguishable composite around a similar time and connected for an American patent and found that one previously existed. Brearley had additionally made different developments for the metal, yet they were of little incentive without the tempered steel patent. He searched out Haynes and the two chose to pool their discoveries in a solitary organization to deliver the composite. Haynes sold his hardened steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, an organization Brearley had made with the help of financial specialists in Pennsylvania. In return he and his bequest got sovereignties on its creation until the patent terminated in 1930. The stock he got as installment enabled him to pick up a seat among the organization's top managerial staff and he introduced his child, March, to speak to him.
