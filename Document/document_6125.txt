In May 1940, amid World War II, the United Kingdom started an intrusion of politically impartial Iceland, dreading it would some way or another tumble to the powers of Nazi Germany which had as of late vanquished Denmark. Iceland's indigenous populace was commonly contradicted to the British occupation, rather inclining toward troops of the United States, which was unbiased at that stage in the war. Iceland consented to a protection arrangement with the United States in which United States troops would be positioned on the island country. The U.S. Marine Corps quickly collected the first Provisional Marine Brigade in Charleston, South Carolina, to move to Iceland as a major aspect of the understanding. The detachment was first actuated on 14 July 1941. Its components were taken from the second Marine Division, which was preparing at Marine Corps Base San Diego and Camp Elliott, both in San Diego, California. This conveyed the power up to a quality of 4,095 men. They were the first of 28,000 men involving Iceland under Major General Holland M. Smith and his first Marine Division. While the first Marine Division was building its powers, however, the Provisional Brigade would hold Iceland. In any case, needs before long changed and the first Marine Division was moved somewhere else. The first Provisional Marine Brigade was rather joined by units of the United States Army.
