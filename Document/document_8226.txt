Biscayne Bay denotes the southernmost degree of the Atlantic obstruction islands, spoken to by Key Biscayne, and the northernmost degree of the Florida Keys at Elliott Key. The keys are recognized from the hindrance islands by the coral limestone that reaches out to the islands' surface under a dainty facade of topsoil, while the obstruction islands are ruled by wave-saved sands that spread a large portion of the limestones. Biscayne Bay lies between low edges of oolitic Miami Limestone on the west, shaping Cutler Ridge, and the coral-based Key Largo Limestone that underlies Elliott Key and the keys toward the south. The Miami Limestone was stored in violent tidal pond waters. The Key Largo Limestone is a fossilized coral reef framed amid the Sangamonian interglacial time of around 75,000 to 125,000ÃÂ years back. The Miami Formation accomplished its present structure fairly later, amid a frosty period in which new water united and established the tidal pond stores. The Key Largo Limestone is a coarse stone shaped from stony corals, between in thickness. As an outcome of their birthplaces as reefs, the shorelines of Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key are rough. Noteworthy sandy shorelines are discovered just at Sands Key.
