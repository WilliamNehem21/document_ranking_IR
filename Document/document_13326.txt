California Chrome's first begin was in a lady race at Hollywood Park in April 2013, where he put second by a length. After three weeks, he won a lady race by lengths. In the two races, he was ridden by Alberto Delgado. About a month later, California Chrome was entered in the Willard L. Delegate Memorial Stakes. He was one of four ponies appointed to convey , the most elevated impost given by the handicapper. Alberto Delgado was out with a broken lower leg, so Corey Nakatani was his rider. The foal was second for the initial three furlongs yet completed fifth in a field of nine. His next two races were at Del Mar course. Delgado returned as his racer, and California Chrome scored his second vocation win in the Graduation Stakes, a race constrained to California-reared ponies, winning by lengths. He conveyed a similar load over a similar separation as his past race, yet this time he wore signals and kept running on Lasix without precedent for his profession. Next was his originally evaluated stakes race, the seven-furlong, Grade I Del Mar Futurity. He ran unequivocally yet completed 6th after he got captured in rush hour gridlock in a field of 11 steeds and was coincidentally smacked in the face by another racer's whip. After two months, California Chrome kept running in the Golden State Juvenile Stakes on November 1 at Santa Anita Park, and at , was the longest race he had run. He was alloted the number 1 present position and had on trust that the various ponies will stack. He ended up on edge, raised in the door, was last out, battled all through the race, and again completed 6th.
