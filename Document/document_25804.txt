The organisation of corporate enterprises became common in the 11th century. Almost all arts and crafts were organised into guilds and work was done on a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names below their creations.
Merchants organised themselves into powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations to be largely unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the "Manigramam", the "Nagarattar" and the "Anjuvannam". Local guilds were called "nagaram", while the "Nanadesis" were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business with pleasure. The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled "Ainnurruvar", also known as the 500 "Svamis" of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and "Mahajanas" of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations ("Vira Bananjudharma" or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions ("prasasti"). Five hundred such excavated "Prasasti" inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.
