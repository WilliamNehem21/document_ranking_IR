In 341ÃÂ BC Demosthenes was sent to Byzantium, where he looked to recharge its coalition with Athens. On account of Demosthenes' strategic moves, Abydos additionally went into a union with Athens. These improvements stressed Philip and expanded his annoyance at Demosthenes. The Assembly, be that as it may, dismissed Philip's complaints against Demosthenes' direct and impugned the harmony bargain; so doing, as a result, added up to an official assertion of war. In 339ÃÂ BC Philip made his last and best offer to vanquish southern Greece, helped by Aeschines' position in the Amphictyonic Council. Amid a gathering of the Council, Philip blamed the Amfissian Locrians for barging in on blessed ground. The directing officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the meeting of an Amphictyonic Congress to perpetrate a brutal discipline upon the Locrians. Aeschines concurred with this suggestion and kept up that the Athenians ought to take part in the Congress. Demosthenes anyway turned around Aeschines' drives and Athens at long last went without. After the disappointment of a first military trip against the Locrians, the late spring session of the Amphictyonic Council gave order of the association's powers to Philip and requested that he lead a second journey. Philip chose to act without a moment's delay; in the winter of 339Ã¢ÂÂ 338ÃÂ BC, he went through Thermopylae, entered Amfissa and crushed the Locrians. After this huge triumph, Philip quickly entered Phocis in 338ÃÂ BC. He at that point turned south-east down the Cephissus valley, seized Elateia, and reestablished the fortresses of the city.
