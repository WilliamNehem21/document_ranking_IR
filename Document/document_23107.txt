Alternatively, Lindemann may have left his combat position when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and prior to the lethal hit on the command position, in order to give the command to abandon the ship. The surviving "Matrose" Paul Hillenâwho had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that he had seen a group of 20â30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving "Maschinengefreiter"âRudolf RÃ¶mer, who at the time was already in the waterâclaimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near "Bismarck"s forward 38Â cm turret, "Anton". He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.
