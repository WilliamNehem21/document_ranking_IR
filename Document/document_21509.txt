Young completed 30Â of 40Â passes for 267Â yards and carried the ball 19Â times for 200Â yards and 3Â rushing touchdowns. His 467Â total yards set a new Rose Bowl and BCS Championship Game record. He won the Rose Bowl "Most Valuable Player" (MVP) award for the second consecutive year, joining Ron Dayne, Bob Schloredt, and Charles White as the only two-time winners but the only player from outside the Big Ten or Pac-10. David Thomas' tenÂ receptions set a UT record for most receptions in a game by a tight end.
Prior to the game, commentators had postulated that the 2005 USC team was one of or even "the" "greatest team of all-time". ESPN analysts were virtually unanimous in their declaration of the 2005 USC Trojans as the best offense in the history of college football, despite the fact that they were in second place behind Texas in terms of points scored during the season. ESPN analysts Mark May and Kirk Herbstreit declared, before the 2005 Rose Bowl had even been played, that the 2005 USC Trojans were the secondÂ best college football team of the past 50Â years. May placed them behind only the 1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers; Herbstreit behind only the 2001 Miami Hurricanes. This led to Texas fans at the Rose Bowl mockingly chanting "BestÂ ... TeamÂ ... Ever" during the post-game celebration. Stewart Mandell of "Sports Illustrated" observed, "ESPN spent the better part of Christmas season comparing that Trojans squad to some of the most acclaimed teams of all time only to find out that they weren't even the best team that season."
