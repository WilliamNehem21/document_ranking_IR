Shannon discovered that dependent on GPS facilitates from the 1994 Deepquest undertaking, "no less than 33% of the two sections of land of prompt destruction containing the two noteworthy parts of the vessel is in U.S. waters due to a mistake in the situation of the U.S.Ã¢ÂÂ Canada limit line appeared official lake diagrams."
