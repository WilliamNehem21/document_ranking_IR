In this manner, Tom Astor said the arrival of the film: "was useful, however it didn't compensate for any shortfall, it lost a portion of its faction claim without increasing any standard believability." The magazine stopped production in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken adversely of their encounters making the film, calling it "somewhat of a sore point" for them. "The content was lousy," Hewlett reviewed, "me and Alan continued modifying it and putting "Grange Hill" jokes and Benny Hill jokes in, and they clearly weren't getting it. They neglected to film around ten noteworthy scenes so we needed to vitalize themÃÂ ... it was an appalling background." Talalay griped that the studio meddled essentially in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been "in a state of harmony" and on great terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made huge slices to the film, which she had no influence over. Diminish Milligan composed an adjustment comic in 1995, and a novelization of the film by Martin Millar was distributed in 1996.
