In 1916, there was consideration centered around Ruth for his pitching, as he occupied with continued pitching duels with the expert of the Washington Senators, Walter Johnson. The two met multiple times amid the season, with Ruth winning four and Johnson one (Ruth had a no choice in Johnson's triumph). Two of Ruth's triumphs were by the score of 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0, one of every a 13-inning diversion. Of the 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 shutout chose without additional innings, AL President Ban Johnson expressed, "That was a standout amongst the best ball games I have ever observed." For the season, Ruth went 23Ã¢ÂÂ 12, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, the two of which drove the alliance. Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set a group record for left-handers that would stay unmatched until Ron Guidry tied it in 1978. The Red Sox won the flag and World Series once more, this time overcoming the Brooklyn Robins (as the Dodgers were then known) in five recreations. Ruth began and won Game 2, 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1, in 14 innings. Until another round of that length was played in 2005, this was the longest World Series diversion, and Ruth's pitching execution is as yet the longest postseason complete amusement triumph.
