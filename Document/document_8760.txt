Jackson's underlying job was to give score to Trevor's missions, and he took impact from craftsmen, for example, The Mars Volta and Queens of the Stone Age. When he discovered that the group would work off one another's work, he voiced worry that the completed item could be disconnected. In the wake of offering his work to the group be that as it may, he was especially inspired by Froese's commitments. "Edgar developed the music, made it into an entire other thing", Jackson said. Froese had introduced funk sounds with Jackson's hip-jump impacts. Froese and Jackson at that point sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who intensely examined it. The Alchemist opined, "We were examining, taking a piece structure here, a piece from thereÃÂ ...ÃÂ We pitched stuff up, slashed it, changed it. At that point we picked the tracks that worked and everybody came in and layered on that". DJ Shadow at that point combined the group's manifestations and coordinated it to the ongoing interaction. Pavlovich considered "how to make the hip-bounce and shake score not seem like they were instrumentals of tunes on the radio, yet rather something one of a kind to the score" a test.
