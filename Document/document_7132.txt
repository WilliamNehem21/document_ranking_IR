In 1903, Palairet played eleven five star matches. His solitary century of the period came against Surrey, when he scored 114 in the second innings, having struck 50 years in the first. He passed 50 on three different events, and completed the year with 637 keeps running at 35.38. He seemed all the more as often as possible the next year, in which he scored 1,000 top notch keeps running in a season for the last time of his vocation. He opened the season with a century against Gloucestershire, scoring 166 runs. Amid the Bath cricket celebration, he scored 111, and imparted an opening association of 161 to Braund amid a ten-wicket misfortune to Lancashire. Against Worcestershire soon thereafter, he scored the second, and last, top of the line twofold century of his vocation. Opening the batting for Somerset, he achieved 203; more than Worcestershire had overseen in their first innings, before being expelled. Somerset won the match by an innings and 114 runs. The cricket history specialist David Foot depicts 1904 and the resulting few seasons as undistinguished for Somerset; among at that point and the First World War, the club never completed higher than tenth in the County Championship. Palairet missed a large portion of the cricket in 1905 and 1906, to focus on his work as a land specialist for the Earl of Devon. He played multiple times in 1905; against the visiting Australians, Kent and Warwickshire, while in 1906 he played one match, against Yorkshire. Toward the finish of 1906, Woods, who had captained Somerset since 1894, resigned. Regardless of his constrained appearances over the past couple of years, Palairet was selected as Woods' substitution for 1907.
