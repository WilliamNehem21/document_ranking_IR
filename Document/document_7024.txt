Taking after a dark colored wooden top, the epigeous (over-the-ground) organic product body might be up to 6ÃÂ cm (2.4ÃÂ in) high. The top, at first raised then more channel molded (infundibuliform) with a discouraged focus and moved edge (subsequently the regular name), might be ruddy , yellowish-or olive-dark colored in shading and ordinarily 4Ã¢ÂÂ 12ÃÂ cm (1.6Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ in) wide; the top distance across does not get bigger than . The top surface is at first wool and later smooth, getting to be sticky when wet. The top and capÃÂ margin at first serve to secure the gills of youthful organic product bodies: this is named pilangiocarpic improvement. The restricted earthy yellow gills are decurrent and forked, and can be stripped effectively from the tissue (similar to the case with the pores of boletes). Gills further down toward the stipe become progressively unpredictable and anastomose, and can even take after the pores of bolete-type parasites. The growth obscures when wounded and more established examples may have darkish patches. The delicious yellowish substance has a gentle to faintly acrid or sharp smell and taste, and has been depicted too seasoned after cooking. Of comparable shading to the top, the short stipe can be warped and decreases toward the base.
