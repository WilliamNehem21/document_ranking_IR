Subside Bartholow of "GameSpot" outlined "Fiendishness Makers" as "a great amusement that will leave players needing more". He enjoyed the supervisors, which made the player utilize every accessible expertise, yet felt they were brief and effectively unraveled with regards to a short amusement with instructional exercises as one fifth of its dimensions. He didn't consider the closure expansion an appropriate reward for coming back to the dimensions, and anticipated that most players would not complete the diversion more than once. "Amusement Informer" reverberated Bartholow's remarks about the diversion's curtness, and named the diversion's seven-occasion olympics as a feature. Sushi-X of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" composed that the amusement felt inadequate and deplored that "a better than average player can complete the diversion in less than three hours", however "People to come" said the amusement was "surely sufficiently long". The amusement's continuous reuse of a little choice of tiles, objects, audio cues, soundtracks, and insipid foundations (contrasted with the "great" supervisor fight livelinesss and impacts) drove "GameSpot" Bartholow to recommend that "Naughtiness Makers" was restricted by its cartridge space. He reasoned that the "better than average" amusement would be "really superb ... on another medium". Zachary Miller of "Nintendo World Report" revealed that the designs did not age well into 2010. "Electronic Gaming Monthly" composed that the diversion is "unquestionably a sleeper hit". As "No-nonsense Gamer" Ryan Cartmel put it, the amusement went "generally unnoticed".
