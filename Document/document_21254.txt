"Ghost of Sparta" was announced on May 4, 2010, on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony, Ready at Dawn utilized "state-of-the-art visual technologies" that allowed "higher quality environments and characters." "Ghost of Sparta" offers "over 25% more gameplay" than "Chains of Olympus", while adding more enemies on screen and more boss encounters. Development of "Ghost of Sparta" took 23 months to complete. Due to Weerasuriya's schedule at Ready at Dawn, he could not return to direct; Dana Jan, the lead level designer for "Chains of Olympus", became director for "Ghost of Sparta". At Comic-Con 2010, Jan noted that when development began in 2008, the goal was to make the game bigger than "Chains of Olympus", which had apparently pushed the PSP to its functional limits. Jan stated that "Ghost of Sparta" took the PSP to its "absolute capacity", with another feature being more on-screen foes. The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from "God of War III". The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com, which became the official site for "Ghost of Sparta" on May 4. Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between "God of War" and "God of War II" was because "It seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void."
