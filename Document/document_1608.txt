The Anthony Roll was initially a lot of three separate vellum rolls. It exists today as a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is saved in its unique structure. The three unique rolls were made up out of a sum of 17 singular films stuck to the back of the following layer. The layers were of a width of 70ÃÂ cm (27 ÃÂ½ inches) and a tallness differing from 79 to 96ÃÂ cm (31 to 37 ÃÂ¾ inches). Subsequent to getting the first and third moves Pepys had his agents cut the moves up and bound in a solitary volume as a book, presently known as Pepys 2991. The change of the two rolls made a level page structure, and a portion of the ornamentation that was cut in procedure was replicated into the volume by hand. Pepys likewise embedded edited compositions between the two rolls and a condensing table that was not Anthony's, yet pre-dated Pepys' official of the rolls. This extreme treatment of the first record has harmed a portion of the outlines and is today censured. The initial three delineations of the "Henry Grace ÃÂ  Dieu", "Mary Rose" and "Diminish Pomegranate" were very huge to fit on one page and were hence changed over to two-page spreads. The subsequent curve down the focal point of the delineations prompted perceptible loss of detail. In spite of this, there are no designs to endeavor a diversion of the first structure of the first and third rolls. The second move, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its unique condition except for a composed underwriting by Mary Fox from 1857 and some harm brought about by an utilization of synthetic substances to uncover blurred composition.
