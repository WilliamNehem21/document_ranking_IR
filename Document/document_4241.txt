Gibbons said he purposely built the visual look of "Guards" with the goal that each page would be recognizable as a feature of that specific arrangement and "not some other comic book". He attempted to attract the characters a way not the same as that usually found in funnies. The craftsman endeavored to draw the arrangement with "a specific load of line, utilizing a hard, solid pen that didn't have much regulation regarding thick and meager" which he trusted "would separate it from the standard rich, liquid sort of comic book line". In a 2009 meeting, Moore reviewed that he exploited Gibbons' preparation as a previous surveyor for "counting unbelievable measures of detail in each small board, so we could arrange each seemingly insignificant detail". Gibbons portrayed the arrangement as "a comic about funnies". Gibbons felt that "Alan is progressively worried about the social ramifications of [the nearness of super-heroes] and I've gotten engaged with the specialized ramifications." The story's other world setting enabled Gibbons to change subtleties of the American scene, for example, including electric vehicles, somewhat extraordinary structures, and flash hydrants rather than flame hydrants, which Moore stated, "maybe gives the American readership a shot here and there to see their own way of life as a pariah would". Gibbons noticed that the setting was freeing for him since he didn't need to depend essentially on reference books.
