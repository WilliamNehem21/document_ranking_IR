Khan as often as possible shows up on postings of the most prevalent, trendy and compelling individuals in India. He has consistently included among the main ten on "The Times of India"s rundown of the 50 most attractive men in India, and in a 2007 survey by the magazine "Eastern Eye" he was named the hottest man in Asia. Khan is frequently alluded to as "Brand SRK" by media associations on account of his many image underwriting and business adventures. He is one of the most generously compensated Bollywood endorsers and a standout amongst the most unmistakable superstars in TV promoting, with up to a six percent offer of the TV notice showcase. Khan has embraced brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer. Books have been distributed about him, and his ubiquity has been archived in a few verifiable movies, including the two-section narrative "The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan" (2005), and the Discovery Travel and Living station's ten-section miniseries "Living with a SuperstarShah Rukh Khan" (2010). In 2007, Khan turned into the third Indian performer to have his wax statue introduced at London's Madame Tussauds exhibition hall, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan. Extra forms of the statue were introduced at Madame Tussauds' galleries in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and Washington.
