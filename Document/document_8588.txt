Striggio's fundamental hotspots for his lyrics were Books 10 and 11 of Ovid's "Transforms" and Book Four of Virgil's "Georgics". These gave him the fundamental material, however not the structure for an organized dramatization; the occasions of acts 1 and 2 of the lyrics are secured by a negligible 13 lines in the "Transforms". For help in making a sensational structure, Striggio drew on different sourcesÃ¢ÂÂPoliziano's 1480 play, Guarini's "Il minister fido", and Ottavio Rinuccini's lyrics for Peri's "Euridice". Musicologist Gary Tomlinson comments on the numerous similitudes among Striggio's and Rinuccini's writings, taking note of that a portion of the discourses in "L'Orfeo" "compare intently in substance and even in locution to their partners in "L'Euridice"". The pundit Barbara Russano Hanning composes that Striggio's sections are more obvious than those of Rinuccini, in spite of the fact that the structure of Striggio's lyrics is all the more fascinating. Rinuccini, whose work had been composed for the merriments going with a Medici wedding, was obliged to modify the legend to give a "cheerful closure" reasonable for the event. On the other hand, on the grounds that Striggio was not composing for a formal court festivity he could be progressively steadfast to the soul of the legend's decision, in which Orfeo is slaughtered and dismantled by unhinged maenads or "Bacchantes". He picked, truth be told, to compose a to some degree quieted adaptation of this wicked finale, in which the Bacchantes undermine Orfeo's pulverization however his genuine destiny is left in uncertainty.
