In the Middle Ages, knighthood was frequently deliberated with expound functions. These normally included the knight-to-be scrubbing down (potentially representative of profound cleansing) amid which he was told in the obligations of knighthood by increasingly senior knights. He was then put to bed to dry. Dressed in an uncommon robe, he was driven with music to the sanctuary where he went through the night in a vigil. At first light he made admission and went to Mass, at that point resigned to his bed to rest until it was completely sunshine. He was then brought before the King, who in the wake of training two senior knights to clasp the goads to the knight-choose's heels, secured a belt around his midriff, at that point struck him on the neck (with either a hand or a sword), accordingly making him a knight. It was this honor which was the fundamental demonstration in making a knight, and a more straightforward function created, giving knighthood simply by striking or contacting the knight-to-be on the shoulder with a sword, or "naming" him, as is as yet done today. In the early medieval period the distinction appears to have been that the full functions were utilized for men from increasingly unmistakable families.
