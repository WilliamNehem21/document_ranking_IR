Borglum was occupied between the entry of the bill and the finish of May 1924, first taking a shot at the Children's Founders Roll decoration, and after that the half dollar. The Children's Founders Roll was available to white youngsters up to the age of 18 who contributed one dollar to the structure of the landmark. Borglum should in any case have been calibrating the landmark's structure; Jackson's stance on the award contrasts from that on the coin. Not at all like the issued coin, Borglum's models demonstrated the front piece of Davis' pony, in spite of the fact that the Confederate president is concealed, and walking warriors show up out of sight. Borglum met with Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon who addressed first why "In God We Trust" showed up straightforwardly over Lee's head; Borglum reacted that it was to pay tribute to the Confederates' confidence. Mellon at that point asked what the thirteen stars on the front spoke to; Borglum answered that those on the north side of the MasonÃ¢ÂÂ Dixon line could think about them to speak to the thirteen unique provinces (those south of it, the suggestion was, could believe them to be a tribute toward the Southern states). Mellon giggled and gave primer endorsement. On July 2, Mellon demonstrated the plans to President Coolidge; they were then sent to the Commission of Fine Arts for its individuals' sentiments.
