"Catopsbaatar" mandible was powerful and extended. The diastema (hole between the front and cheek teeth) was curved, and reached out for 20 percent of the dentary bone (the primary bone of the lower jaw). Seen from over, the diastema framed a wide rack which slanted downwards on the inward side of the jaw. The little mental foramen was near the upper center edge of the diastema. The coronoid procedure of the mandible seems to have been moderately more and smaller than in different djadochtatherioideans. It was isolated from the alveolar procedure (where the teeth are contained) by a wide depression. The mandibular condyle (which enunciated with the skull) was marginally over the dimension of the molars. The front piece of the masseretic peak was noticeable, shaping a lump known as a masseretic projection. The heartiness of this peak and the nearness of the projection shifts among related genera. The masseteric fovea (pit) before the masseteric fossa was most likely more unmistakable than in different djadochtatherioids. Every 50% of the mandibular symphysis (where the two parts of the mandible associate) was formed like a topsy turvy tear. The pterygoid fossa on the inward side of the mandible was extremely expansive, and involved a large portion of the rear piece of the dentary. The lower some portion of this fossa had a limit, known as the pterygoideus rack.
