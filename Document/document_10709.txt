"The Whitehall Mystery" was a term instituted for the revelation of a headless middle of a lady on 1888 in the storm cellar of the new Metropolitan Police base camp being worked in Whitehall. An arm having a place with the body was recently found skimming in the stream Thames close Pimlico, and one of the legs was in this way found covered close where the middle was found. Different appendages and head were never recuperated and the body was never distinguished. The mutilations were like those in the Pinchin Street case, where the legs and head were disjoined yet not the arms. The Whitehall Mystery and the Pinchin Street case may have been a piece of a progression of homicides called the "Thames Mysteries", submitted by a solitary sequential executioner named the "Middle executioner". It is far from being obviously true whether Jack the Ripper and the "Middle executioner" were a similar individual or separate sequential executioners dynamic in a similar territory. The "business as usual" of the Torso executioner varied from that of the Ripper, and police at the time limited any association between the two. Elizabeth Jackson was a whore whose different body parts were gathered from the stream Thames over a three-week time span in June 1889. She may have been another casualty of the "Middle executioner".
