"Lactifluus volemus" was the sort types of the segment "Dulces" in subgenus "Lactarius", and is right now grouped in "Lactifluus" segment "Lactifluus". The gathering around this "L. volemus" incorporates species with a dry top, bottomless latex, and a white or pale cream spore print. Since the firmly related "L.ÃÂ corrugis" has covering morphological characters, incorporating comparable colouration in the top and stem, it has been hard to dependably recognize the two species. The trouble in recognizing the two is exacerbated by the way that the two species have a few shading frames: Japanese examples of "L.ÃÂ volemus" may have a red top, a yellow top with a long stem, or a velvet-like surface; the tops of "L.ÃÂ corrugis" might be either red, normally rust-hued. In 2005, Japanese scientists cleared up the connections between these two species and others in area "Dulces" utilizing atomic phylogenetics, and by contrasting contrasts in unsaturated fat creation, morphology, and taste. The shading variations gather phylogenetically into various subclades, recommending that they may should be considered as "various species, subspecies, or assortments". A 2010 sub-atomic investigation of "L.ÃÂ volemus" of northern Thailand found that 79 tried examples could be partitioned into 18 particular phylogenetic species; six of these were depicted as new species: "Lactifluus acicularis", "L.ÃÂ crocatus", "L.ÃÂ distantifolius", "L.ÃÂ longipilus", "L.ÃÂ pinguis" and "L.ÃÂ vitellinus".
