Notwithstanding the quick development of the Vengeance drive, by late 1942 the RAAF knew that the sort was old and other Allied flying corps' encounters had shown that jump bombarding was a wasteful strategy. Battle involvement in Europe demonstrated that committed jump planes were exceptionally defenseless against assault from contender flying machine, particularly when planning to plunge on targets. Maybe a couple USAAF officers viewed plunge aircraft as viable, however they were every now and again utilized by the United States Navy. A USAAF squadron outfitted with Douglas A-24 Banshee jump aircraft was conveyed to New Guinea in April 1942, however was pulled back from battle toward the finish of May that year in the wake of flying just a couple of battle fights. The USAAF viewed this sort as unsuited to conditions in the theater, however the US Navy worked it all around effectively from its plane carrying warships as the Douglas SBD Dauntless. The USAAF wanted to utilize warrior planes and light aircraft to help ground troops in New Guinea. Warrior aircraft were considered especially helpful as they could strafe and skip bomb Japanese positions just as utilize jump bombarding strategies. So also, by late 1942 the RAAF liked to utilize the light aircraft that it was currently starting to get to give strategic help to the Army. A request for 150 Curtis Shrike plunge planes was dropped after the initial ten of these flying machine were conveyed to Australia in November 1942, making the Vengeance the main committed jump aircraft worked by the RAAF.
