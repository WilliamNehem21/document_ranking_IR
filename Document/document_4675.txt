Sanford discovered his years in the Senate disappointing. He was worried about the runaway shortage spending of the period, and he sought after monetary advancement for Central America as an option in contrast to Republican-driven military arrangements. He drove the Duke-based International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development, a team of researchers and pioneers that distributed "Destitution, Conflict, and Hope: A Turning Point in Central America" (otherwise called the Sanford Commission Report since he was "the important impetus of the commission's work") in 1989 with the standards for advancing harmony, majority rule government and impartial advancement in Central America. Sanford served on various Senate panels: Select Committee on Ethics (Chair); Special Committee on Aging; Budget; Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs including the Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy and Subcommittee on Securities; and Foreign Relations including Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs (Chair), Subcommittee on African Affairs, and Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace Corps Affairs. He was a main commentator of American association in the Gulf War. He had a liberal casting a ballot record in contrast with his Democratic associates from the South, and he battled effectively against the section of a protected revision disallowing banner consuming with a counter-crusade advancing the United States Bill of Rights. However Sanford thought his achievements in the Senate withered against those he made as representative, and he truly pondered resigning and seeking after different ventures before choosing to keep running for re-appointment. His casting a ballot record was reliably more liberal than that of any of his ancestors, being given an American Conservative Union rating of 12%.
