After the ship's arrival from its journey, a gathering was met on board "Argus" on 19 May to consider changed landing courses of action. It was chosen that a more extended arrangement of wires was required, and the arrival well framework was relinquished for slopes that could be raised and brought down as required. Fueled palisades were likewise required in favor of the flight deck to help hold flying machine on board that had not locked in a wire. The reconsidered framework was effectively tried on board the transporter later in the year and "Argus" capturing gear was altered in like manner in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, amid which the ship conveyed ten Parnall Panther spotter and surveillance air ship and three Fairey IIIC observation air ship. Likewise, the ship's after lift was for all time secured in the raised position and of counterbalance were added to make up for the extra weight of the gear high in the ship. This voyage was considered effective as 45 arrivals were made, just two of which brought about genuine mishaps, a mishap rate equivalent to those of land-based units. The time required to dispatch two flying machine and land one on board was forty minutes amid this voyage, principally on the grounds that the revolving motors of the time were hard to begin.
