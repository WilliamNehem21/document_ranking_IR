Dumbledore" (2004) by Caius Marcius.</ref> The primary such spoof was a brief vaudeville introduced at the Opera Comique in 1882, called "The Wreck of the Pinafore" by H. Lingard and Luscombe Searelle; the musical drama's characters are wrecked on a desert island. It was portrayed by "The Era" as "mostly momentous for its impudence".
