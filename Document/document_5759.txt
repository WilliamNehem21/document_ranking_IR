Around 3ÃÂ a.m., Col. Everett Peabody, ordering Brig. Gen. Benjamin Prentiss' first Brigade, sent a watch of 250 infantry men from the 25th Missouri and the twelfth Michigan out on observation watch, persuaded that the consistent reports of Confederate contacts throughout the most recent couple of days implied there was a solid probability of a huge confederate power in the region. The watch, under the direction of Maj. James E. Powell, met fire from Confederates who at that point fled into the forested areas. A brief span later, 5:15ÃÂ a.m., they experienced Confederate stations kept an eye on by the third Mississippi Battalion, and an energetic quarrel endured over 60 minutes. Arriving dispatchers and hints of gunfire from the engagement alarmed the closest Union troops, who framed fight line positions before the Confederates had the capacity to contact them; in any case, the Union armed force direction had not sufficiently arranged for an assault on their camps. At the point when Prentiss discovered that Peabody had conveyed a watch without his approval he was offended and blamed the Colonel for inciting a noteworthy commitment infringing upon Grant's requests, yet he before long acknowledged he was confronting an ambush by a whole Confederate armed force and hurried to set up his men for resistance. By 9ÃÂ a.m. Association powers at Pittsburg Landing were either drawn in or advancing toward the bleeding edge. Both Peabody and Powell were before long slaughtered in the resulting battling.
