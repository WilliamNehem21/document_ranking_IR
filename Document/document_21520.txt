Rivera rebounded in 2008 and began the year with 16Â consecutive scoreless innings pitched and 28Â consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06Â ERA and 23Â saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher as a tribute to him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on SeptemberÂ 15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on SeptemberÂ 21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason for the first time in his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.
