In 2010, an uncommon Honus Wagner was found in a case left by the sibling of Sister Virginia Muller who left the entirety of her assets to the Baltimore-based School Sisters of Notre Dame. The card accompanied her sibling's manually written note: "Albeit harmed, the estimation of this baseball card should increment exponentially all through the 21st century!" The Roman Catholic nuns sold the card, which in spite of its poor condition was relied upon to get somewhere in the range of $150,000 and $200,000. On November 4, 2010, the last deal cost surpassed the desires for barkers at Dallas-based Heritage Auction Galleries and sold for $262,000 to Doug Walton, an authority and card-shop proprietor. Walton, be that as it may, never paid, and Heritage Auction Galleries along these lines reached one of its long-lasting customers, Nicholas DePace, a New Jersey cardiologist, who quickly consented to purchase the card at a similar cost. On December 20, 2010, in the wake of taking its 19.5 percent purchaser's premium, the closeout house sent $220,000 by bank wire to the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The religious request had effectively declared that the returns from the deal would go to its services in excess of 30 nations.
