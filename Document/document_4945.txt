Nimoy visited Meyer's home and recommended, "[What if] the divider descends in space? You know, the Klingons have dependably been our stand-ins for the Russians..." Meyer reviewed that he answered "'Oh, hold up a moment! Alright, we begin with an intergalactic Chernobyl! Huge blast! We got no more Klingon Empire...!' And I just spilled out the entire story!" The story purposely included references to the contemporary political atmosphere; the character of Gorkon depended on Mikhail Gorbachev, while the death storyline was Meyer's thought. He thought it was conceivable that the Klingon pioneer who turned delicate towards the adversary would be executed like comparable peacemakers from the beginning of time: Anwar El Sadat, Gandhi, and Abraham Lincoln. Nimoy's enlisting of Meyer was not just helpful in light of the fact that Meyer knew the material and could compose quick (having delivered "The Wrath of Khan"s screenplay in twelve days), however if Meyer somehow happened to guide it would balance any rancor from Shatner, whose rage would have been excited if Nimoy come back to coordinate his third "Star Trek" include after "" and "The Voyage Home". Meyer said that when he began chip away at the screenplay it didn't strike him that he would coordinate the film. Meyer's significant other was the principal individual to recommend that he should coordinate.
