In 1997, Charig and Milner showed direct dietary proof in the stomach locale of the "B. walkeri" holotype. It contained the principal proof of piscivory in a theropod dinosaur, corrosive scratched scales and teeth of the regular fish "Scheenstia mantelli" (at that point characterized in the sort "Lepidotes"), and rubbed bones of a youthful "Iguanodon". An obvious gastrolith (gizzard stone) was likewise found. They likewise introduced incidental proof for piscivory, for example, crocodile-like adjustments for getting and gulping prey: long, tight jaws with their "terminal rosette", like those of a gharial, and the downturned tip and score of the nose. In their view, these adjustments proposed that "Baryonyx" would have gotten little to medium-sized fish in the way of a crocodilian: grasping them with the indent of the nose (giving the teeth a "cutting capacity"), tilting the head in reverse, and gulping them recklessly. Bigger fish would be parted ways with the paws. That the teeth in the lower jaw were littler, more swarmed and various than those in the upper jaw may have helped the creature grasp sustenance. Charig and Milner kept up that "Baryonyx" would fundamentally have eaten fish (in spite of the fact that it would likewise have been a functioning predator and astute scrounger), yet it was not prepared to be a full scale predator like "Allosaurus". They proposed that "Baryonyx" basically utilized its forelimbs and expansive paws to catch, murder and tear separated bigger prey. In 2004, a pterosaur neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth inserted in it announced by Buffetaut and partners affirmed that the last were not only piscivorous.
