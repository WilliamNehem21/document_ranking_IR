A RAAF group headed by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Charles Read, was sent to the United States in May 1970 to arrange the rent plans. Subsequent to thinking about the proposed arrangement, Read prescribed that it proceed; as indicated by RAAF student of history Alan Stephens this choice "charmed RAAF senior officers and aircrews". The Cabinet thusly endorsed the rent of 24 Phantoms for a long time at a complete expense of $US 41.554 million (counting preparing, save parts and specialized guidance) and the formal consent to do as such was marked on 29ÃÂ June 1970. The USAF assigned this venture "Harmony Reef". The terms of the rent understanding enabled the Australian Government to buy the Phantoms inside and out if the F-111C program was dropped, yet in addition enabled the USAF to request the quick return of the flying machine and their help hardware in case of a national crisis. Laird furnished Fraser with a composed responsibility that this alternative would not be worked out, and it was never exposed. Laird additionally guaranteed that USAF tankers would be made accessible to help the Australian Phantoms amid emergencies, subject to American national prerequisites and the terms of significant understandings between the two nations.
