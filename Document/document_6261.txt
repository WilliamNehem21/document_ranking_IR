Key staff enrolled to work at Fort Halstead included John Challens, who initiated on 1 January 1948. By mid-1948, it turned out to be certain that Penney's underlying assessment that he would require 220 staff was off kilter, and that he would require almost 500. This implied taking work force from different tasks, however rejecting some completely. In October 1948, Penney presented a solicitation for building up another, discrete site for HER on grounds of wellbeing, security and economy. This was endorsed, however it took an additional a half year to find an appropriate site. An airbase, RAF South Cerney in Gloucestershire was picked, yet the RAF would not surrender the site. A previous airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was then chosen. In the meantime, it was chosen to isolate HER from the Armaments Research Establishment (ARE). This brought about an excruciating bureaucratic fight over faculty like Challens, whose skill was needed for research on both atomic weapons and guided rockets. At last, HER kept 25 of the 30 key staff that ARE needed, including Challens. The site was taken over on 1 April 1950. Penney ended up Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER). The primary phase of work at Aldermaston was finished in December 1951, yet the plutonium preparing building was just given over in April 1952, the month that the principal plutonium was expected to land from Windscale. At the pinnacle of development in 1953, more than 4,000 faculty were dealing with the site.
