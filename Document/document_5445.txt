At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky was visited by Tatiana Melnik, "nÃÂ©e" Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, the leader of the Russian displaced person office in Berlin, and the little girl of the magnificent family's close to home doctor, Dr. Eugene Botkin, who had been killed by the socialists close by the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a kid and had last addressed her in February 1917. To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, despite the fact that "the mouth has changed and coarsened detectably, and in light of the fact that the face is so lean, her nose looks greater than it was." In a letter, Melnik stated: "Her frame of mind is innocent, and inside and out she can't be figured with as a dependable grown-up, yet should be driven and coordinated like a tyke. She has overlooked dialects, yet has when all is said in done lost the intensity of exact narrationÃÂ ... indeed, even the least complex stories she tells incongruously and erroneously; they are actually just words hung together in outlandishly ungrammatical GermanÃÂ ... Her deformity is clearly in her memory and visual perception." Melnik announced that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and assumed that any powerlessness on her part to recall occasions and her refusal to communicate in Russian was brought about by her hindered physical and mental state. Either incidentally through a true want to "help the patient's powerless memory" or as a major aspect of an intentional act, Melnik instructed Tschaikovsky with subtleties of life in the royal family.
