"Bharattherium bonapartei" is known from an aggregate of eight detached teeth. Among the seven teeth in their example, Wilson and partners probably recognized five as fourth lower molariforms (mf4)Ã¢ÂÂ in light of the fact that gondwanathere premolars and molars can't be recognized, they are all things considered known as "molariforms"Ã¢ÂÂ one as a third lower molariform (mf3) and one as a lower incisor (i1). These judgments were made based on examinations with an example of the South American gondwanathere "Sudamerica ameghinoi", in which every one of the eight molariform positions are known. Nonetheless, the vast number of mf4s drove Wilson and associates to presume that the criteria utilized for recognizing "Sudamerica" tooth positions may not make a difference straightforwardly to "Bharattherium". Prasad and partners did not allocate their two "Bharattherium" teeth to any tooth position, however recommended that they may speak to various tooth positions and that one may originate from the upper and the other from the lower side of the jaw. As is normal for sudamericids, "Bharattherium" molariforms are hypsodont (high-delegated) and have a level occlusal (biting) surface on a high tooth, with wrinkles that reach out down the stature of the tooth. "Bharattherium" molariforms are the littlest of any sudamericid; those of "Lavanify", for instance, are about 35% bigger. Not at all like "Sudamerica" molariforms, those of "Bharattherium" decrease towards the top.
