Clark came back to the European theater and the Balkans following his USSOUTHCOM position when he was delegated to U.S. European Command in the late spring of 1997 by President Clinton. He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the first candidate for the position. The Army had officially chosen another general for the post. Since President Clinton and General Shalikashvili trusted Clark was the best man for the post, he in the long run got the designation. Shalikashvili noted he "had an extremely solid job in [Clark's] last two employments." Clark noted amid his affirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services board of trustees of the 105th Congress that he trusted NATO had moved since the finish of the Cold War from shielding Europe from the Soviet Union to moving in the direction of progressively broad strength in the district. Clark additionally tended to issues identified with his then-current direction of USSOUTHCOM, for example, support for the School of the Americas and his conviction that the United States must proceed with help to some South American countries to adequately battle the War on Drugs. Clark was immediately affirmed by a voice vote a similar day as his affirmation hearing, giving him the order of 109,000 American troops, their 150,000 relatives, 50,000 regular people supporting the military, and all American military exercises in 89 nations and regions of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The position made Clark the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), which allowed him by and large direction of NATO military powers in Europe.
