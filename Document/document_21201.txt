Kapoor followed her success in "Bodyguard" and "Ra.One" with a role in Shakun Batra's directorial debut "Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu" (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows the story of two strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: "Riana knows what she is doing. Even though she does not have a house or a job, she is a positive person [...] very similar to the way I am." The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of in India and abroad. "The Hollywood Reporter" found her "endearingly natural"; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that "after doing ornamental roles in films like "Bodyguard" and "Ra.One", it is nice to see the spunky actress in her element again since "Jab We Met"." She next appeared in "Agent Vinod", an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. When asked why she had taken the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before.
