Prior to the last tradition in 1792, an advisory group made out of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin answered to the Elkhorn Baptist Association for denying subjection in the constitution at that point being drafted for the new state. Servitude was a noteworthy issue in the 1792 tradition that concluded the archive. Representative David Rice, a Presbyterian serve, was the main voice against the consideration of bondage assurances in the new constitution, while George Nicholas contended most strenuously for them. Garrard empowered his individual clergymen and Baptists to cast a ballot against its consideration. The movement to erase Article 9 of the proposed report, which ensured the privileges of slave proprietors, flopped by a vote of 16Ã¢ÂÂ 26. Every one of the seven Christian clergymen who filled in as agents to the tradition (counting Garrard) casted a ballot for erasing the article. Five Baptist laymen resisted Garrard's directions and casted a ballot to hold Article 9; their votes gave the important edge to its incorporation. Student of history Lowell H. Harrison composed that the abolitionist servitude votes of the priests may have represented the appropriation of an arrangement that denied clergymen from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and different priests clearly communicated no dispute against this arrangement.
