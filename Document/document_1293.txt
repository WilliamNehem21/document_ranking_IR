Composing for "The A.V. Club", Keith Phipps evaluated the scene an A-, discovering it "practically like an augmentation of the pilot". Phipps felt the scene highlighting Mulder's capturing to be "one of the scariest minutes from the arrangement's initial days, as much for what it recommends with respect to what it appears". Composing for site Den of Geek, Matt Haigh explored the scene decidedly, applauding its choice not to respond to the majority of the inquiries that it inquires. Haigh noticed that "the way that we are left as ignorant regarding what truly occurred as Mulder and Scully just improves the survey involvement", observing such puzzle to be "an uncommon thing to be sure" on system TV. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Needing to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen", evaluated the scene five stars out of five, observing it to be "considerably more positive about its pacing and tone" than the past scene. Shearman and Pearson felt that the scene was "a skilfully scripted story of concealment and neurosis", and noticed that "it sets up the general topics of the show so well, it nearly appears to be a groundwork".
