On 9 July 1916, the scout cruiser , "54 T", "73 F" and another torpedo boat raided the Otranto Barrage, the Allied naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters, and damage to two more. Ten days later, "65 F" and "66 F" sank the Italian submarine "Balilla" off Lissa. On 8 October, "68 F" encountered the Italian off San Giovanni di Medua, but after a brief chase was able to reach the cover of a shore battery. On 16 November 1917, "61 T" and "65 F" were part of a minesweeping force supporting the bombardment of a Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo near the mouth of the Piave. All boats were due to have their aft torpedo tube replaced by a single Å koda L/30 anti-aircraft gun in late 1918, but it is not clear whether this actually occurred. "52 T" ran aground near Split in December 1918. Following World War I, the "Kaiman"-class boats were allocated to Great Britain, Italy and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). Great Britain and Italy scrapped their boats, but the Yugoslavs retained "54 T", "60 T", "61 T" and "69 F" as "T12", "T9", "T10" and "T11" respectively. All four were discarded and broken up between 1928 and 1930.
