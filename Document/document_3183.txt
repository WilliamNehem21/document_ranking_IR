Around this time, a gathering of Austral Africa Company miners, driven by Alfred Haggard, moved toward Lobengula's south-western outskirt, wanting to pick up their own Matabeleland mining concession; on learning of this, the ruler regarded one of the terms of the Rudd Concession by permitting Maguire to go at the leader of a Matabele "impi" to dismiss Haggard. While Robinson's letter to Knutsford advanced toward England via ocean, the Colonial Secretary took in of the Rudd Concession from Cawston and Gifford. Knutsford wired Robinson on 17 December to inquire as to whether there was any fact in what the London syndicate had informed him regarding the concurred exchange of 1,000 MartiniÃ¢ÂÂ Henrys: "If rifles some portion of thought, as announced, do you think there will be peril of inconveniences emerging from this?" Robinson answered, again recorded as a hard copy; he encased a moment from Shippard in which the Bechuanaland official clarified how the concession had occurred, and communicated the view that the Matabele were less experienced with rifles than with "assegais", so their receipt of such weapons did not in itself make them mortally hazardous. He then contended that it would not be political to give Khama and different boss guns while denying them of Lobengula, and that an appropriately outfitted Matabeleland may go about as an impediment against Boer obstruction.
