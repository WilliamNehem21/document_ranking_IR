Amid September and October, Sherman and Hood got away with tomfoolery in north Georgia (and Alabama) as Hood undermined Sherman's correspondences toward the north. In the long run, Sherman won endorsement from his bosses for an arrangement to cut free from his interchanges and walk south, having prompted Grant that he could "make Georgia yell". This made the danger that Hood would move north into Tennessee. Trivializing that danger, Sherman supposedly said that he would "give [Hood] his proportions" to go toward that path as "my business is down south". In any case, Sherman left powers under Maj. Gens. George H. Thomas and John M. Schofield to manage Hood; their powers in the end crushed Hood's military in the clashes of Franklin (November 30) and Nashville (December 15Ã¢ÂÂ 16). In the interim, after the November decisions, Sherman started a walk with 62,000 men to the port of Savannah, Georgia, living off the land and causing, by his very own gauge, more than $100 million in property harm. Sherman called this unforgiving strategy of material war "hard war," frequently observed as a types of complete war. Toward the finish of this crusade, known as Sherman's March to the Sea, his troops caught Savannah on December 21, 1864. Sherman at that point dispatched a renowned message to Lincoln, offering him the city as a Christmas present.
