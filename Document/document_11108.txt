The zones around Malvern Hill facilitated quite a bit of Lee's military the night after the fight. A portion of the Confederates were close enough to hear the sounds made by the Army of the Potomac withdrawing under front of dimness, and see the lights of Northerners helping their injured. The day after the Battle of Malvern Hill, Lee and Stonewall Jackson met President Jefferson Davis at Poindexter ranch. They considered quickly seeking after McClellan; in any case, in perspective on the downpour and disarray, Davis and Lee esteemed substantial scale quest for McClellan's military excessively unsafe. Jackson dissented, saying, "They have not all escaped on the off chance that we go following them." Jackson even had the assortments of the dead moved so his officers had an unmistakable line of assault while seeking after McClellan. In any case, Davis and Lee idea it important to rest the military. They didn't totally preclude an interest however; Lee even arranged J. E. B. Stuart to survey McClellan's situation for future assaults. Lee arranged Theophilus Holmes to move to Drewry's Bluff, and chose to keep the men on Malvern Hill through July 3 to prevent any potential Union assault against that area.
