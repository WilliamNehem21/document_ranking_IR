Adding neighborhood shading to the Klingon connect was a worn out doglike animal the impacts group insultingly called "Fifi Rebozo". Ken Ralston felt that giving the Klingon chief a pet would include environment, and shaped a reptilian puppy worked into the content as Kruge's mascot. The creature's hair was produced using shoddy wig clippings; animal chief David Sosalla splashed the material with cement and laid clusters of the bothered hide onto the painted manikin body to influence the creature to show up "beat-up and moth-eaten". Amid recording, Sosalla and group sprinkled the animal with water to make it look progressively terrible. The creature was a hand manikin; Ralston worked the head and body by putting his arm into an opening on the animal's side while covered up inside Kruge's order seat. Three aides worked links that opened the creature's eyes and made it growl; the animal's head was sufficiently vast for Ralston to accommodate his hand inside the spring-stacked jaw to work it. A large number of the creature's expected developments were limited; the group did not move its ears since it made the as far as anyone knows unpleasant animal "charming". For the creature's downfall amid the Klingons' battle with the "Endeavor", an extra "dead" manikin was made, however Ralston utilized the "live" one for the scene.
