The security of cores rapidly diminishes with the expansion in nuclear number after curium, component 96, whose half-life is four requests of greatness longer than that of any resulting component. All isotopes with a nuclear number over 101 experience radioactive rot with half-existences of under 30 hours. No components with nuclear numbers over 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. This is a direct result of the consistently expanding Coulomb repugnance of protons, with the goal that the solid atomic power can't hold the core together against unconstrained parting for long. Counts propose that without other balancing out elements, components with in excess of 104 protons ought not exist. Be that as it may, scientists during the 1960s recommended that the shut atomic shells around 114 protons and 184 neutrons ought to neutralize this precariousness, making an "island of solidness" where nuclides could have half-lives achieving thousands or a large number of years. While researchers have still not achieved the island, the negligible presence of the superheavy components (counting oganesson) affirms this balancing out impact is genuine, and when all is said in done the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the anticipated area of the island. Oganesson is radioactive and has a half-life that seems, by all accounts, to be not exactly a millisecond. Regardless, this is still longer than some anticipated qualities, therefore giving further help to the possibility of this "island of strength".
