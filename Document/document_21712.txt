When Martill and colleagues first described "Irritator challengeri", the holotype was still extensively encased in calcareous rock matrix. Researcher Diane M. Scott from the University of Toronto assumed the task of fully cleaning out the skull, allowing for a detailed redescription in 2002. Written by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, this inspection of the now fully prepared specimen negated many of Martill and colleagues' original observations, which were based on misinterpretations of the damaged and largely concealed skull. The estimated length of the complete skull was shorter than previously proposed. What was originally thought to be a prominent head crest proved to be an unattached, indeterminate bone fragment. Furthermore, additional skull bones were identified. As in the previous study, Sues and colleagues regarded the African genus "Spinosaurus" as the most similar taxon to "Irritator", because they shared many dental features, including mostly straight conical tooth crowns, thin enamel, well-defined edges with no , and lengthwise fluting. Since little was known of "Spinosaurus"s skull at the time, these similarities were enough for the authors to suggest a possible junior synonymy of "Irritator" with "Spinosaurus". Sues and colleagues noted that more overlapping skull material was needed for further diagnosis. As more of "Spinosaurus"s skull became known, later research maintained separation of the two taxa.
