Since the beginning Le Mesurier had been keen on acting and performing; as a youngster he had as often as possible been taken toward the West End of London to watch Ralph Lynn and Tom Walls perform in the well known arrangement of shams at the Aldwych Theater. These encounters fuelled an early want to make a vocation on the stage. In the wake of leaving school he was at first convinced to pursue his dad's profession, as an articled assistant at Greene and Greene, a firm of specialists in Bury St Edmunds; in his extra time he participated in nearby beginner dramatizations. In 1933 he chose to leave the lawful calling, and in September he enlisted at the Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art; an individual understudy was Alec Guinness, with whom he turned out to be dear companions. In July 1934, the studio organized their yearly open revue in which both Le Mesurier and Guinness participated; among the judges for the occasion were John Gielgud, Leslie Henson, Alfred Hitchcock and Ivor Novello. Le Mesurier got a Certificate of Fellowship, while Guinness won the Fay Compton prize. After the revue, instead of stay at the studio for further educational cost Le Mesurier accepted an open door to join the Edinburgh-based Millicent Ward Repertory Players at a compensation of ÃÂ£3.10s (ÃÂ£3.50) seven days.
