Gardner was executed on June 18, 2010, at 12:15ÃÂ am Mountain Daylight Time by a terminating squad at Utah State Prison in Draper. He was set handcuffed on a dark metal seat with a hood covering his head. Sandbags were organized around him to retain ricochets. The terminating squad was comprised of five unknown volunteers who were confirmed cops. The officers remained about from Gardner, going for a white target situated over his heart. One of their .30-gauge Winchester rifles was chosen indiscriminately and stacked with a non-deadly wax slug so they would not know with assurance who discharged the lethal shots. As per the Utah Department of Corrections, the squad utilized a commencement rhythm starting with five and at the same time terminating directly before two. His dim blue jumpsuit made it hard to see the blood from his injuries. A therapeutic inspector evacuated Gardner's hood to uncover his dormant face. Subsequent to confirming Gardner's absence of heartbeat at the neck and pupillary light reflex, the therapeutic analyst articulated him dead at 12:17ÃÂ am. He was the primary individual to be executed by terminating squad in the United States since the execution of John Albert Taylor 14 years sooner. A memorial coin was dispatched for jail staff who took an interest in the execution.
