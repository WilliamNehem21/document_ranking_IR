In 2008, S.R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" recorded "Anbe Sivam" among the "main five directorial adventures of SundarC." In a 2008 meeting with "The Times of India", SundarC. expressed that "Anbe Sivam" "changed [him] by and by and expertly", making him an increasingly sure individual and adjusting his viewpoint towards life. He later repudiated his announcement in the wake of uncovering that the film's disappointment drove him to turn out to be practically bankrupt and he stayed unpaid for his work. The Income Tax Department solidified his financial balances for a year as he was not ready to make good on his government obligations. He conceded that while he got acclaims for the film after its dramatic run, he would not make a film like "Anbe Sivam" any longer and that he continueed making business film, which he felt better coordinated his interests. In 2013, Haricharan Pudipeddi of the Indo-Asian News Service office, included "Anbe Sivam" in his rundown of "Kamal's most misjudged movies". He trusted the explanation behind the film's business disappointment was that gatherings of people misconstrued the "snide suggestions related with agnosticism". On Haasan's birthday, 7 November 2015, Latha Srinivasan of "Day by day News and Analysis" considered "Anbe Sivam" to be one of the "films you should watch to get a handle on the broadness of Kamal Haasan's collection". The character of Nallasivam was positioned fourth in "The Times of India's" rundown of "Kamal Haasan's main 10 awe-inspiring symbols".
