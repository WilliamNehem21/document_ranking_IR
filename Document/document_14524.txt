On June 12, 2014, the PANYNJ recognized that the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York County District Attorney, and United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey were exploring its redirection of $1.8ÃÂ billion to subsidize the Pulaski Skyway and other New Jersey roadway restoration ventures. These request were identified with how this financing, which was made at the encouraging of the Christie organization, was possibly distorted in archives identified with bond deals. State laws require the PANYNJ to burn through cash just identified with its own offices, except if it gets endorsement from legislators in New Jersey and New York. The PANYNJ reports express that the Pulaski Skyway was assigned as additionally giving access to the Lincoln Tunnel, despite the fact that it is miles from the passage and does not interface with it legitimately. In December 2014, United Airlines recorded a grievance with the Federal Aviation Administration that asserts that since 2004 the PANYNJ has redirected more than $2 billion from the metro territory air terminals to non-airplane terminal uses and that in 2014 alone it burned through $181 million to fix the Pulaski Skyway and $60 million on the Wittpenn Bridge, NJDOT-possessed and - worked structures.
