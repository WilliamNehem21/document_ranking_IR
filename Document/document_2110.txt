The ship experienced a few changes in her combat hardware all through her profession, most essentially going with her "remaking" in 1536 (see underneath), when the quantity of people killing firearms was decreased and a second level of carriage-mounted long weapons fitted. There are three inventories that rundown her firearms, dating to 1514, 1540 and 1546. Together with records from the arsenal at the Tower of London, these show how the setup of firearms changed as weapon making innovation developed and new arrangements were concocted. In 1514, the combat hardware comprised for the most part of people killing firearms like the bigger breech-stacking iron "killers" and the little "serpentines", "demi-slings" and stone weapons. Just a bunch of firearms in the main stock were sufficiently incredible to gap foe boats, and most would have been upheld by the ship's structure as opposed to laying on carriages. The inventories of both the "Mary Rose" and the Tower had changed drastically by 1540. There were presently the new cast bronze "guns", "demi-guns", "culverins" and "sakers" and the created iron "port pieces" (a name that demonstrated they discharged through ports), all of which required carriages, had longer range and could do genuine harm to different boats. The examination of the 1514 stock joined with clues of basic changes in the ship both show that the gunports on the primary deck were surely a later expansion.
