"Political Animals and Animal Politics" was reviewed by Garner for "Environmental Values", and the philosophers Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer, Josh Milburn, and Dan Hooley for "Environmental Ethics", the "Political Studies Review" and the "Journal of Animal Ethics" respectively. Garner lamented the absence of many of the key voices in the political theory literature on animal ethicsâsuch as Cochrane, Donaldson and Kymlicka, O'Sullivan, Tony Milligan, Kimberly Smith or Garner himselfâin the book, meaning that "Political Animals and Animal Politics" "takes on the role of an observer of this debate rather than directly contributing to it in a leading sense". He also felt that the book offered little consideration of the details of the work of these leading theorists, identifying the absence of discussion of Cochrane's interest-based rights approach, a superficial consideration of Regan's account of animal rights, an oversimplification of his own position and a lack of context to understand the respective work of Kimberly Smith and O'Sullivan. He considered Wissenburg's chapter to be the only one that engages with the debate about the political turn in general, but noted that Wissenburg's approach is a negative one; Garner considered this unsurprising, given that Wissenburg is a green political theorist with little sympathy for "animal political theory".
