Similarly as with Telltale's different items, "Stories of Monkey Island" was created and discharged in five rambling sections; Grossman disclosed that Telltale likes to recount stories along these lines, instead of as constant accounts that are unreasonably long for individuals to play easily. Be that as it may, in contrast to their past diversions, every scene isn't an independent story; it is a solitary part in a bigger plot. This enabled Telltale to propel the story like that of a TV arrangement, in which character connections create in the brains of the group of onlookers more than a while. Every scene is intended to delight without anyone else, with a wonderful end; be that as it may, it at that point gives a cliffhanger to "entice the player somewhat more". As per Grossman, "Stories of Monkey Island" is set after a "nonexistent" "Monkey Island 5", which he sees as "a blockbuster, epic 40-hour colossal experience like the prior amusements". Its story would have pursued Guybrush's activities in the time between "Departure from Monkey Island" and "Stories of Monkey Island"; the start of "Stories of Monkey Island" would have denoted its decision. Grossman kept up that both the story and ongoing interaction of "Stories of Monkey Island" were intended to be available for newcomers to the arrangement, and remarked that "learning of the characters and their history will add a nostalgic layer to the guileful references, however is in no way, shape or form vital".
