"Propensities (Stay High)" was generally welcomed by generally faultfinders. Harley Brown of "Announcement" composed that the track is "a standout amongst the most effectively recognizable pop melodies [she has] heard in ongoing memory: everybody's gotten high, perhaps eaten an excessive number of Twinkies, and lamented life choices, however not every person makes an extremely eminent tune about it". Pitchfork's Carrie Battam expressed that the track's snare and generation make the verses "sound smoothly dismal rather than unfortunate". In her audit of "Ruler of the Clouds", Battam called it "a major, sticky melody, however not all that enormous that it shocks your faculties or numbs you into happiness". Ewald Arndt of FDRMX said that "Propensities (Stay High)" is "so amusing to tune in to" in spite of its pitiful subjects. AllMusic's Heather Phares called it "the "Ruler of the Clouds'" champion track, while Sam Lansky of Idolator expressed that it "has a tad bit of the surface of Kesha's no-screws given gathering young lady pop however with the languorous misery of Robyn" and that "It'll stall out in your mind, which is correct where it has the right to be." Nick Murray named it as "Truth Serum"s best track, and contrasted it and the music of American rapper Kendrick Lamar.
