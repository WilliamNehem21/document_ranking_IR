Volcanism at WÃÂdejebato seems to have happened amid two stages over a timespan of around 20 million years. The principal stage occurred amid the Cenomanian (100.5 Ã¢ÂÂ 93.9 million years prior); it was portrayed by hazardous ejections and might be the wellspring of 93.9Ã¢ÂÂ 96.3 multi year old volcanic flotsam and jetsam found in the surroundings of WÃÂdejebato. The second stage happened amid the Campanian somewhere in the range of 78.4 and 85 million years back amid chron 33R; it gives off an impression of being a piece of a volcanic occasion that influenced various different islands and seamounts in the Marshall Islands and at WÃÂdejebato went on for no less than four million years. The second stage seems to have been an optional volcanic scene. Volcanic rocks examined at WÃÂdejebato all have a place with the second stage, most likely because of inspecting inclination as the examples all originate from the summit district. Structural proof shows that Pikinni shaped in the meantime as WÃÂdejebato, while the northern parasitic cone might be under 80 million years of age. A prior proposition by Schlanger "et al." 1987 visualized Eocene (56 Ã¢ÂÂ 33.9 million years back) emissions at WÃÂdejebato however today the more established ages are viewed as right.
