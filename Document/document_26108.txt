Timothy Henry HoÊ»olulu Pitman was born MarchÂ 18, 1845, in Hilo, HawaiÊ»i, the first son and second child of Benjamin Pitman and KinoÊ»oleoliliha. Originally a native of Salem, Massachusetts, Pitman's father was an early pioneer, businessman and sugar and coffee plantation owner on the island of HawaiÊ»i, who profited greatly from the kingdom's booming whaling industry in the early 1800s. On his father's side, he was a great-grandson of Joshua Pitman (1755â1822), an English-American carpenter on the ship "Franklin" under Captain Allen Hallett during the American Revolutionary War. On his mother's side, Pitman was a descendant of KameÊ»eiamoku, one of the royal twins (with Kamanawa) who advised Kamehameha I in his conquest of the Hawaiian Islands, and also of the early American or English sea captain Harold Cox, who lent his name to George "Cox" Kahekili KeÊ»eaumoku II, the Governor of Maui. Henry HoÊ»olulu Pitman shared his Hawaiian name with his maternal grandfather HoÊ»olulu who, along with his brother Hoapili, helped conceal the bones of King KamehamehaÂ I in a secret hiding place after his death. In the Hawaiian language, the name "HoÊ»olulu" means "to lie in the sheltered waters". His siblings were Mary Pitman Ailau (1838â1905), Benjamin Franklin Keolaokalani Pitman (1852â1918) and half-sister Maria KinoÊ»ole Pitman Morey (1858â1892).
