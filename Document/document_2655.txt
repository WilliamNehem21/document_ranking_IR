In the wake of coming back from Rome, Robert would not sanctify Spearhafoc, the Abbot of Abingdon and the lord's goldsmith, as his successor to the parish of London, asserting that Pope Leo IX had illegal the sanctification. More likely than not the grounds were simony, the buy of religious office, as Leo had as of late issued announcements against the training. In declining to sanctify Spearhafoc, Robert may have been following his own advantages against the desires of both the ruler and Godwin, as he had his very own competitor, a Norman, as a top priority. At last Robert's favored applicant, William the Norman, was blessed rather than Spearhafoc. Robert additionally found that a few terrains having a place with Canterbury had fallen into Godwin's hands, however his endeavors to recuperate them through the shire courts were fruitless. Canterbury had lost control of certain incomes from the shire of Kent to Godwin amid Eadsige's residency as diocese supervisor, which Robert fruitlessly endeavored to recover. These disagreements about the bequests and incomes of the archbishopric added to the rubbing among Robert and Godwin, which had started with Robert's race. Robert's race had disturbed Godwin's support controls in Canterbury, and now Robert's endeavors to recuperate lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury tested the lord's monetary rights. Occasions reached a crucial stage at a chamber held at Gloucester in September 1051, when Robert blamed Earl Godwin for plotting to slaughter King Edward. Godwin and his family were ousted; a short time later Robert guaranteed the workplace of sheriff of Kent, presumably on the quality of Eadsige, his forerunner as ecclesiastical overseer, having held the workplace.
