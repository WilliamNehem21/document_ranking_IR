At the point when rebel powers entered the royal residence, the NgÃÂ´ siblings were absent, having gotten away before to a supporter cover in Cholon. The siblings had kept in correspondence with the revolutionaries through an immediate connection from the safe house to the royal residence, and misdirected them into trusting that they were still in the castle. The NgÃÂ´ siblings before long consented to surrender and were guaranteed safe outcast; in the wake of being captured, they were rather executed in the back of a shielded faculty bearer by ARVN officers on the adventure back to military home office at TÃÂ¢n SÃÂ¡n NhÃ¡Â»Â©t Air Base. While no formal request was led, the obligation regarding the passings of the NgÃÂ´ siblings is generally put on Minh's guardian, Captain NguyÃ¡Â»Ân VÃÂn Nhung, and on Major DÃÂ°ÃÂ¡ng HiÃ¡ÂºÂ¿u NghÃÂ©a, both of whom monitored the siblings amid the excursion. Minh's military partners and US authorities in Saigon concurred that Minh requested the executions. They hypothesized different thought processes, including that the siblings had humiliated Minh by escaping the Gia Long Palace, and that the siblings were slaughtered to keep a later political rebound. The commanders at first endeavored to conceal the execution by recommending that the siblings had ended it all, however this was negated when photographs of the NgÃÂ´s' carcasses surfaced in the media.
