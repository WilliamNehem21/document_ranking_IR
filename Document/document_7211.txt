Illustrious Air Force (RAF) substantial aircraft led a progression of fruitless attacks on "Tirpitz" not long after the ship touched base in Norway from Germany in January 1942. "Tirpitz" was at first based at FÃÂ¦ttenfjord close Trondheim, which lay inside scope of British aircraft flying from Scotland. The main strike occurred on 30 January, and included nine Handley Page Halifax and seven Short Stirling aircraft. Because of cover over the objective region, just a single of the aircraft located "Tirpitz" and none caused any harm. One Halifax collided with the ocean on its way back to Scotland, yet its team were saved. The following assault on FÃÂ¦ttenfjord occurred on 30 March, with the assaulting power involving 33 Halifaxes. The activity was again baffled by substantial mists over the objective territory. Four of the Halifaxes were shot down, and two others smashed while coming back to base. Another assault was mounted by 30 Halifaxes and 11 Avro Lancasters the evening of 27/28 April. "Tirpitz" was found and assaulted by the air ship of the primary wave, yet no harm was caused and five substantial aircraft were lost. The last attack in this arrangement occurred the following night, and included 21 Halifaxes and 12 Lancasters. The assailants discovered "Tirpitz" canvassed in a defensive smokescreen, and the warship again gotten away harm; two British air ship were decimated.
