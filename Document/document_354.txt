In 1957 Ferman propelled a buddy magazine, "Adventure Science Fiction", which was expected to concentrate on more activity situated fiction than "F&SF". Boucher was unfit to take on the additional work, so Robert P. Plants, who had been the overseeing proofreader for "F&SF", turned into "Adventure's" editorial manager, with Boucher in a warning job. Soon thereafter Ferman sold "Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine" to Bernard Davis, who was leaving Ziff-Davis to begin his own distributing adventure. Ferman held "F&SF", however Boucher left, and Mills turned into the editorial manager of "F&SF" while remaining overseeing supervisor of Queen's magazine. Plants remained for more than three years, leaving toward the finish of 1961 to invest more energy filling in as an artistic specialist, and Ferman supplanted him with Avram Davidson, whose name initially showed up on the masthead with the April 1962 issue. Joseph Ferman's child Edward had worked for the magazine as a publication right hand during the 1950s, however left in 1959 to pick up experience somewhere else; he returned in 1962, and worked under Davidson as overseeing editorial manager. In 1963 Ted White, later the supervisor of "Astounding Stories", wound up partner proofreader, and remained with the magazine until 1968.
