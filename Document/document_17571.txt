In 1930, Gernsback decided to merge "Science Wonder Stories" and "Air Wonder Stories" into "Wonder Stories". The reason for the merger is unknown, although it may have been that he needed the space in the printing schedule for his new "Aviation Mechanics" magazine. Bleiler has suggested that the merger was caused by poor sales and a consequent need to downsize. In addition, "Air Wonder Stories" was probably focused on too specialized a niche to succeed. In an editorial just before "Science Wonder Stories" changed its name, Gernsback commented that the word "Science" in the title "has tended to retard the progress of the magazine, because many people had the impression that it is a sort of scientific periodical rather than a fiction magazine". Ironically, the inclusion of "science" in the title was the reason that science fiction writer Isaac Asimov began reading the magazine; when he saw the August 1929 issue he obtained permission to read it from his father on the grounds that it was clearly educational. Concerns about the marketability of titles seem to have surfaced in the last two issues of "Science Wonder", which had the word "Science" printed in a color that made it difficult to read. On the top of the cover appeared the words "Mystery-Adventure-Romance", the last of which was a surprising way to advertise a science fiction magazine.
