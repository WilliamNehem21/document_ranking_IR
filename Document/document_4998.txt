Angelou portrays her composition procedure as controlled. Starting with "Confined Bird", she has utilized the equivalent "composing custom" for a long time. She gets up at five in the first part of the day and registers with a lodging, where the staff has been told to expel any photos from the dividers. She composes on lawful cushions while lying on the bed, with a jug of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, "Roget's Thesaurus", and the Bible, and leaves by the early evening. She midpoints 10Ã¢ÂÂ 12 pages of material daily, which she alters down to three or four pages at night. Angelou experiences this procedure to "charm" herself, and as she said in a 1989 meeting with the BBC, to "remember the distress, the anguish, the "Sturm und Drang"". She puts herself back in the time she is expounding on, amid horrendous encounters like her assault in "Confined Bird", to "tell the human truth" about her life. Angelou has expressed that she plays cards to achieve that spot of charm, to get to her recollections all the more viably. She has expressed, "It might take an hour to get into it, yet once I'm in itÃ¢ÂÂha! It's so delectable!" She doesn't discover the procedure cathartic; rather, she has discovered alleviation in "coming clean".
