Strip was the principal English bowler to step through 100 Examination wickets against Australia. When universal matches were generally uncommon, his 20 Test matches were an impressive accomplishment, and it was abnormal for a player to visit Australia as frequently as he did: he went there multiple times. His principle rival as a spinner and for a spot in the England group was Johnny Briggs; Peel bowled quicker, which made him harder to hit. Archie MacLaren, who captained England from the late 1890s and was a colleague and chief of Briggs, portrayed Peel as "the cleverest bowler of my time". MacLaren expressed that Peel completely gotten strategies and could spot shortcomings in a batsman's strategy. He finished up: "I place Peel first on my rundown of incredible left-gave bowlers by virtue of his awesome judgment, his fiendish cunning and his extraordinary common capacity." When Rhodes assumed control over the job of left-arm turn bowler in the Yorkshire group, there was some discussion over who out of Peate, Peel and Rhodes was the best left-arm spinner to play for Yorkshire. Antiquarians see Peel as a major aspect of a durable chain of fruitful Yorkshire left-arm spinners, gone before by Peate and prevailing by Rhodes.
