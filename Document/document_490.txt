The diversion's sound group was made out of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and sound executive Eric Brosius. As indicated by Brosius, every individual from the sound division did "everything", without clear boundaries between jobs. Like "Hoodlum", "Criminal II" includes a sound motor that mimics engendering continuously. To accomplish this impact, each dimension's geometry was input both to the dimension manager and to a "separate [sound] database", which mapped how solid would sensibly engender dependent on "the physical room qualities [... and] how all the diverse rooms and zones are associated together". For instance, clamor voyages unreservedly through an open entryway however is blocked when the entryway is shut. The group utilized the new "impediment" highlight in EAX 2.0 to make "Hoodlum II"s sound condition increasingly sensible and to enable the player to tune in through entryways. The diversion includes progressively audio effects, music and discourse than the first "Criminal". "Hoodlum II"s score, likewise with that of its antecedent, was intended to "obscure surrounding [sound] and music" together. Be that as it may, Brosius later expressed that, while "Thief"s soundtrack is made out of "basic and entrancing" circles just a couple of moments long, "Criminal II" includes longer and "all the more insightfully" developed pieces. He trusted that this technique had positive perspectives, however that it brought about a less vivid sound condition.
