In 1951, an altered volume, "Parts of Archeology in Britain and Beyond: Essays Presented to O. G. S. Crawford", was distributed, having been altered by Grimes and conveyed out to stamp Crawford's 65th birthday celebration. Checking on the collection for "Artifact", J. v. d. Waals and R. J. Forbes depicted it as "a wonderful birthday present". A considerable lot of Crawford's partners stressed over him, mindful that he lived alone at his cabin in NurslingÃ¢ÂÂwith just the organization of his older maid and felinesÃ¢ÂÂand that he needed either a vehicle or phone. It was there that he kicked the bucket in his rest the evening of 28Ã¢ÂÂ 29 November 1957. He had orchestrated a portion of his letters and books to be pulverized, while others were to be sent to the Bodleian Library, with the stipulation that some of them would not be opened until the year 2000. His body was covered in the congregation burial ground at Nursling. As per his guidelines, the title "Editorial manager of "Times long past"" was recorded on his headstone, mirroring his craving to be recalled fundamentally as a prehistorian. On Crawford's demise, the editorship of "Days of yore" was taken on by Daniel.
