Feed's association in the endeavors to have a waterway joining the seas in Central America returned to his time as Assistant Secretary of State under Hayes, when he filled in as interpreter for Ferdinand de Lesseps in his endeavors to show the American government putting resources into his channel organization. President Hayes was just inspired by the possibility of a channel under American control, which de Lesseps' undertaking would not be. When Hay progressed toward becoming Secretary of State, de Lesseps' undertaking in Panama (at that point a Colombian territory) had crumpled, as had an American-run venture in Nicaragua. The 1850 ClaytonÃ¢ÂÂ Bulwer Treaty (between the United States and Britain) disallowed the United States from structure a Central American waterway that it only controlled, and Hay, from right off the bat in his residency, looked for the expulsion of this limitation. Be that as it may, the Canadians, for whose remote strategy Britain was as yet accessible, saw the trench matter as their most noteworthy influence to get different debate settled to support them, convinced Salisbury not to determine it autonomously. Quickly before Hay got down to business, Britain and the U.S. consented to set up a Joint High Commission to arbitrate disrupted issues, which met in late 1898 yet gained moderate ground, particularly on the Canada-Alaska limit.
