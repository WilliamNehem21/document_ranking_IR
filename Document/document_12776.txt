The Philadelphia pilot plant consumed of space on a site one square west of Broad Street, close to the Delaware River. The plant comprised of 102 sections, known as a "rack", organized into a course of seven phases. The plant was proposed to have the capacity to deliver one gram for every day of uranium advanced to 6% uranium-235. The external copper tubes were cooled by water streaming among them and the outer 4-inch steel funnels. The internal nickel tubes were warmed by high weight steam at and . Every segment thusly held about of uranium hexafluoride. This was driven by vapor weight; the main working parts were the water siphons. In task, the rack devoured 11.6 MW of intensity. Every segment was associated with a repository of uranium hexafluoride. On account of the perils engaged with taking care of uranium hexafluoride, all work with it, for example, recharging the repositories from the delivery chambers, was practiced in an exchange room. The segments at the Philadelphia plant were worked in parallel rather than in arrangement, so the Philadelphia pilot plant in the long run delivered over of uranium hexafluoride advanced to 0.86 percent uranium-235, which was given over to the Manhattan Project. The Philadelphia pilot plant was discarded in September 1946, with salvageable hardware being come back to the NRL, while the rest was dumped adrift.
