In a VideoGamer.com list of the ten best "Final Fantasy" characters, Lightning was placed sixth; writer Yin-Poole found her interesting in her own right despite her similarities to Cloud. In 2011, IGN ranked Lightning among the best characters in the "Final Fantasy" series, saying that she demonstrated that "a delicate balance can exist between strength and tenderness, even in the midst of ... incredible acrobatic feats." Lightning was ranked eighth in a similar list by GameZone's Heath Hooker: points of praise were her visual appearance and determination, which made her "one of the strongest female leaders of the "Final Fantasy" series" in Hooker's opinion. Cheat Code Central listed her as one of the top ten "badass" women of video games for her independence, which the writer felt distanced her from previous "Final Fantasy" heroines. Lightning ranked second in AfterEllen's list of the "hottest" video game characters. In "Game Informer"s list of top ten heroes of 2010, Lightning was ranked eighth and praised as the only protagonist in "Final Fantasy XIII" who "seemed capable of taking on the corrupt government of Cocoon": another comment was that her "no-nonsense approach to her mission makes her the game's standout hero". She was included in two lists by "Complex", which ranked her as the 19th greatest "Final Fantasy" character and the 39th greatest heroine in video game history.
