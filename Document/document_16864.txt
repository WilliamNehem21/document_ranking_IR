The final portion of I-8 in California, between Japatul Valley Road and west of Boulevard, was prioritized in the 1969â1970 state budget. Due to financial concerns, it was announced in September 1968 that the target date for completing the Interstate Highway System would be extended until 1974, from 1972. The missing portion of I-8 was expected to cost $45Â million and be constructed in three parts, with one part being started each year. The segments between Japatul Valley Road and west of Laguna Junction, and from La Posta Road to west of Boulevard, were delayed for an entire year at the end of 1969 due to a nationwide effort to fight inflation by reducing spending. A segment from Buckman Springs to Crestwood received funding in May 1970, which would leave only an stretch of the freeway uncompleted when built. The drive time from San Diego to El Centro had been reduced to two hours, according to the California Division of Highways. By AugustÂ 1970, the remainder of the freeway had been funded, with the part from Japatul Valley Road to Laguna Junction costing $22Â million (about $ in dollars), and the Laguna Junction to Crestwood portion costing $15Â million (about $ in dollars).
