By 2000, Mukerji wanted to avoid being type-cast as a "standard Hindi film heroine" and thus decided to portray more challenging roles in addition to the archetypical glamorous female lead. However, none of her film releases in 2000 were particularly notable. In "Badal" and "Bichhoo", two male-centric action dramas (both featuring Bobby Deol in the lead), she played roles that were met with little acclaim from the critics but were successful at the box-office. A supporting role in Kamal Haasan's bilingual film "Hey Ram" proved more rewarding. The film was a partly fictionalised account of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination and Mukerji portrayed the character of Aparna Ram, a Bengali school teacher who is raped and murdered during communal riots in Calcutta. The controversial subject matter of "Hey Ram" led to poor box office earnings, but the film was critically acclaimed and selected as India's official entry to the Oscars that year. Mukerji found success in the comedy "Hadh Kar Di Aapne" but her next "Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye" failed critically and commercially. The romantic comedy "Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega", however, earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare and was well received by the critics and audiences. Padmaraj Nair of "Screen" found Mukerji's role to be "too meagre for her to prove herself" but added that "she is quite adequate in whatever scenes she has been given".
