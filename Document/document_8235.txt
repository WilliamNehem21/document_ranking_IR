The Rosemonts compose with eagerness about their gathering with Andre Breton and Surrealist assemble individuals amid a stay in Paris in December 1965-May 1966. Penelope expounds on this vital period in her life in the books "Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights" and in her self-portraying work "Dreams and Everyday Life: Andre Breton, Surrealism, Rebel Worker, SDS, and the Seven Cities of Cibola, A 1960s Notebook" while Franklin talks about it in his book, "An Open Entrance into the Shut Palace of Wrong Numbers". In the " Surrealist Experiences", Penelope Rosemont expounds on an early gathering of Surrealists that had officially framed in Chicago, the Rebel Worker gathering, before they met Breton and truth be told, this was the driving force to go to Paris, to meet the Surrealists they had been comparing with. She composes that the underlying arrangement was to go to London first and after that to Paris. She expresses "on account of a dastardly British movement administrator," they were expelled to Paris. That occasion was random on the grounds that the surrealist presentation L'Ecart absolu was occurring at the time; she went to a New Years Eve party sorted out by surrealists;and she had the capacity to converse with Breton before he "turned out to be genuinely sick a couple of months after the fact."
