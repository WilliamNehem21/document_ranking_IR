All pinnipeds are flesh eating and ruthless. All in all, they for the most part feed on fish and cephalopods, trailed by scavangers and bivalves, and after that zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like ocean winged animals. While most species are generalist and crafty feeders, a couple are authorities. Models incorporate the crabeater seal, which essentially eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats primarily shellfish, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which practice on squid, and the whiskery seal and walrus, which feed on mollusks and other base staying spineless creatures. Pinnipeds may chase singularly or agreeably. The previous conduct is common when chasing non-tutoring fish, moderate moving or stable spineless creatures or endothermic prey. Singular rummaging species more often than not misuse beach front waters, sounds and streams. A special case to this is the northern elephant seal, which benefits from fish at extraordinary profundities in the vast sea. What's more, walruses feed singularly however are frequently close different walruses in little or vast gatherings that may surface and make a plunge harmony. At the point when vast schools of fish or squid are accessible, pinnipeds, for example, certain otariids chase helpfully in huge gatherings, finding and grouping their prey. A few animal categories, for example, California and South American ocean lions, may rummage with cetaceans and ocean fowls.
