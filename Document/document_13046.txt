On the presumption Roosevelt would not look for a third term, Willkie had been discussed as a conceivable Democratic presidential hopeful as ahead of schedule as 1937. He raised his stock impressively when on January 3, 1938, he discussed Assistant Attorney General Robert H. Jackson on the radio show, "Town Meeting of the Air". With the theme of the discussion being the participation between people in general and private segments, Willkie seemed to be an agent with a heart, while Jackson seemed dull. A flood of positive press makes reference to for Willkie proceeded through 1938 and into 1939, coming full circle with a good main story in "Time" magazine in July 1939. Willkie was at first contemptuous of the numerous letters he got encouraging him to keep running for president, yet before long altered his opinion. Van Doren thought Willkie could be president, and attempted to convince her contacts. In the wake of facilitating the Willkies for an end of the week, "Fortune" magazine overseeing supervisor Russell Davenport wound up persuaded Wendell Willkie had presidential timber; he gave the magazine's April 1940 issue to Willkie, and later filled in as his crusade director. In that issue, Willkie composed an article, "We The People: A Foundation for a Political Platform for Recovery," encouraging both significant gatherings to exclude hostile to business approaches from their gathering stages, secure individual rights, and contradict outside animosity while supporting world exchange. This piece won him praise and supporters from the press.
