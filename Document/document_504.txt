Diem invested little energy in point by point protection and approach exchanges with Australian authorities amid the outing, on account of his broad gatherings with Catholic pioneers. Despite the fact that Diem had flagged his aims to talk about safeguard relations amid the visit, these did not emerge. Toward the finish of the visit, Diem and Menzies discharged a two-sided articulation, declaring that they would expand the size of the Colombo Plan, a program under which Asian understudies could think about abroad in Western countries. Be that as it may, there was little detail in the declarations identifying with hostile to socialism, with just broad articulations of Australian help, including a promise to build the measure of non-military guide for the South Vietnamese Civil Guard and regular citizen help hardware. Diem had recently expressed that if North Vietnam assaulted the south, he would send the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to arrive in the Red River Delta in the north and strike back. This was in opposition to the air assault plans of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), which had pledged to protect the south under the arrangements of the Manila Treaty. In spite of the open explanations of help, the Australian government never shared the subtleties of the SEATO plans with Diem.
