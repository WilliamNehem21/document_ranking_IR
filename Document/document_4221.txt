No.ÃÂ 1 Wing was rebuilt from July 1944. On 1ÃÂ July, No.ÃÂ 452 and No.ÃÂ 457 Squadrons were exchanged to No. 80 Wing RAAF, which had been framed to lead hostile activities in the NEI under the order of Clive Caldwell. They were supplanted by two British units; No.ÃÂ 548 and No.ÃÂ 549 Squadrons RAF. This put the wing in a remarkable position: the majority of its flying squadrons were currently British units. The new RAF squadrons had been framed in Australia, because of a further gathering between H.V. Evatt and Winston Churchill in July 1943, at which Evatt had mentioned extra RAF units. They were shaped from British pilots and Australian ground group at Lawnton, Queensland on 15ÃÂ December 1943 however did not get their Mark VIII Spitfires until April the following year. No.ÃÂ 548 Squadron was at first positioned at Livingstone Airfield, and its air echelon touched base there on 10 June after a trip in which four Spitfires made constrained arrivals when they ran low on fuel. No. 549ÃÂ Squadron's air echelon touched base at Strauss Airfield on 16 June and its back echelon finished its development from Queensland on 14 July. On 20ÃÂ July, two No.ÃÂ 54 Squadron Spitfires working out of Truscott Airstrip shot down a Dinah. This was the last Japanese air ship to be wrecked over Northern Australia.
