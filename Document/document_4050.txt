The U.S. Naval force was littler than the Royal Navy in 1919, yet transports set down under its wartime development program were all the while being propelled, and their later development gave the American ships a mechanical edge. The "two-control standard" of 1889 required a Royal Navy sufficiently able to take on any two different forces. In 1909, this was downsized to a strategy of 60% prevalence in battleships. Rising strains over the U.S. Naval force's structure program prompted warmed contentions between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, and the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson in March and April 1919, in spite of the fact that, as far back as 1909, the legislature coordinated that the United States was not to be viewed as a potential adversary. This choice was reaffirmed by Cabinet in August 1919 so as to block the U.S. Naval force's structure program from turning into a legitimization for the Admiralty starting one of its own. In 1920, the First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Walter Long declared a "one-control standard", under which the approach was to keep up a naval force "notÃÂ ... second rate in solidarity to the Navy of some other power". The one-control standard wound up authority when it was freely reported at the 1921 Imperial Conference. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 fortified this strategy.
