French botanist Ãtienne Pierre Ventenat described the golden everlasting as "Xeranthemum bracteatum" in his 1803 work "Jardin de Malmaison", a book commissioned by Napoleon's first wife JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais to catalogue rare plants that she had collected and grown at the ChÃ¢teau de Malmaison. The Latin species name "bracteatum" refers to the papery bracts (often mistakenly called petals) of the flower heads. Henry Charles Andrews transferred it to the genus "Helichrysum" based on the morphology of its receptacle in 1805, and it was known as "Helichrysum bracteatum" for many years. Leo Henckel von Donnersmarck described it as "Helichrysum lucidum" in 1806, and Christiaan Hendrik Persoon as "Helichrysum chrysanthum" in 1807. It was given the name "Bracteantha bracteata" in 1991, when Arne Anderberg and Laurie Haegi placed the members that are known as strawflowers of the large genus "Helichrysum" into a new genus "Bracteantha", and designated "B.Â bracteata" as the type species. However, they were unaware that Russian botanist Nikolai Tzvelev had already placed "X.Â bracteatum" in the new, and at the time monotypic, genus "Xerochrysum" the previous year. This name was derived from the Greek words "xeros" "dry", and "chrysum" "golden", likely relating to the nature of the distinctive bracts. Confusion existed for a decade, with "Bracteantha" appearing in literature and the horticultural trade until it was clarified in 2002 that the latter name took precedence. Strawflower is the popular name for "X.Â bracteatum" in Europe, while in Australia it is known as an everlasting or paper daisy. An alternate name in 19th-century Europe was "immortelle". "X.Â bracteatum" itself is very variable and may represent several cryptic species. Alternately, the Tasmanian species "Xerochrysum bicolor" may be combined with it in future taxonomic revisions.
