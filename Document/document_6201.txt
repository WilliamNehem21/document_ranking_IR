In spite of the fact that the species is broadly disseminated, it is locally uncommon in all areas, making fossas especially powerless against elimination. The impacts of natural surroundings fracture increment the hazard. For its size, the fossa has a lower than anticipated populace thickness, which is additionally compromised by Madagascar's quickly vanishing woodlands and waning lemur populaces, which make up a high extent of its eating regimen. The loss of the fossa, either locally or totally, could essentially affect biological system elements, perhaps prompting over-touching by a portion of its prey species. The all out populace of the fossa living inside secured zones is assessed at under 2,500ÃÂ adults, yet this might be an overestimate. Just two secured zones are thought to contain at least 500 grown-up fossas: Masoala National Park and Midongy-Sud National Park, despite the fact that these are likewise thought to be overestimated. Too little populace data has been gathered for a formal populace practicality investigation, however appraises propose that none of the secured zones bolster a feasible populace. On the off chance that this is right, the termination of the fossa may take as much as 100ÃÂ years to happen as the species bit by bit decreases. All together for the species to endure, it is evaluated that in any event is expected to keep up littler, transient suitable populaces, and at any rate for populaces of 500 grown-ups.
