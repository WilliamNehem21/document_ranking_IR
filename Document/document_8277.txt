Leyland missed a considerable measure of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, scarcely playing in July, and missing the Test arrangement against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 keeps running at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Wounds kept on disturbing him in 1938. He scored 1,884 top of the line keeps running at 43.81, yet a shoulder strain right off the bat in the season antagonistically influenced his structure. He was not chosen for the initial three Tests against Australia, not least as the England side contained a few promising batsmen. Be that as it may, he had his best season with the ball. A progression of hard, dry wickets gave less chances to customary spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32. Right off the bat in the season, he took eight for 63 against Hampshire, the best figures of his vocation. Similarly as his batting structure returned, and when he was probably going to be reviewed to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. Be that as it may, he recouped so as to play in the last Test of the arrangement. Australia's triumph in the fourth Test had given the group a 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 lead.
