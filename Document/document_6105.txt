The Natchez executed practically the majority of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and just around 20 figured out how to get away. A large portion of the dead were unarmed. Ladies, youngsters, and African slaves were for the most part saved; many were bolted inside a house on the feign, watched by a few warriors, from where they could see the occasions. As indicated by Dumont de Montigny's record of the assault, ladies seen protecting their spouses from the viciousness, or attempting to vindicate them, were abducted or murdered. One lady's unborn infant was purportedly torn from her before she herself was executed. A year after the occasion, the count of dead was put at 138 men, 35 ladies and 56 kids, or around 230 in general. A few researchers contend that the Natchez saved the African slaves because of a general feeling of liking between the Natchez and the Africans; a few slaves even joined the Natchez against their lords, while others took the risk to disappear to opportunity. A gathering of Yazoo individuals who were going with Commandant du CodÃÂ¨re stayed unbiased amid the contention yet were enlivened by the Natchez revolt. When they came back to Fort St. Pierre, they demolished the stronghold, executing the Jesuit minister and 17 French officers.
