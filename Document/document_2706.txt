At 7:00 P.M. on May 31, J. Donald Cameron met the Republican National Committee's last gathering before the opening of the tradition. Of the forty-six men at the gathering, Cameron tallied just sixteen partners. The remainder of the men were hostile to Grant delegates who had chosen to join forces against Cameron. Colorado representative Jerome B. Chaffee was the first to raise the unit rule at the gathering. Chaffee gave Cameron a written by hand movement that was arranged by William E. Chandler. Cameron anticipated this, and realized he needed to discover some blame in Chaffee's movement. Cameron got Chaffee's movement out of request. After being addressed by Chaffee, Cameron clarified that the board of trustees could just select an impermanent administrator to the tradition, and couldn't cast a ballot on the unit rule issue (which he said had a place with the Rules Committee). Cameron then utilized George Cornelius Gorham, a California Stalwart agent who as secretary of the United States Senate had turned into a specialist on parliamentary methodology, to legitimize his decision. One by one, hostile to Grant assigns ineffectively attempted to request Cameron's movement. Gorham broadcasted that as board of trustees administrator, Cameron could do "as he saw fit." Marshall Jewell, a Connecticut agent and national advisory group part who had served in Grant's organization as Postmaster General, talked facing Cameron's decisions. Cameron did not remark, and after that required a concise break. After the break, he recognized a movement from William E. Chandler to choose George Frisbie Hoar, an impartial representative and agent from Massachusetts, as the tradition's brief executive.
