Ãrbenz was initially confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory of a small garrison of 30 soldiers over the 180 strong rebel force outside Zacapa strengthened his belief. By 21 June, Guatemalan soldiers had gathered at Zacapa under the command of Colonel VÃ­ctor M. LeÃ³n, who was believed to be loyal to Ãrbenz. LeÃ³n told Ãrbenz that the counter-attack would be delayed for logistical reasons, but assured him not to worry, as Castillo Armas would be defeated very soon. Other members of the government were not so certain. Army Chief of Staff Parinello inspected the troops at Zacapa on 23 June, and returned to the capital believing that the army would not fight. Afraid of a U.S. intervention in Castillo Armas' favor, he did not tell Ãrbenz of his suspicions. PGT leaders also began to have their suspicions; acting secretary general Alvarado MonzÃ³n sent a member of the central committee to Zacapa to investigate. He returned on 25 June, reporting that the army was highly demoralized, and would not fight. MonzÃ³n reported this to Ãrbenz, who quickly sent another investigator. He too returned the same report, carrying an additional message for Ãrbenz from the officers at Zacapaâasking the President to resign. The officers believed that given U.S. support for the rebels, defeat was inevitable, and Ãrbenz was to blame for it. He stated that if Ãrbenz did not resign, the army was likely to strike a deal with Castillo Armas, and march on the capital with him.
