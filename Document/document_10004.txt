Defilement in the mail station likewise shouted out for change. In April 1880, there had been a congressional examination concerning defilement in the Post Office Department, in which profiteering rings supposedly stole a huge number of dollars, verifying fake mail contracts on star courses. In the wake of acquiring contracts with the most minimal offer, expenses to run the mail courses would be raised and benefits would be partitioned among ring individuals. That year, Hayes halted the execution of any new star course contracts. Not long after getting to work, Garfield got data from Attorney General MacVeagh and Postmaster General James of postal defilement by a supposed star course instigator, Second Assistant Postmaster-General Thomas J. Brady. Garfield requested Brady's renunciation and requested indictments that would finish in preliminaries for trick. At the point when informed that his gathering, including his very own battle supervisor, Stephen W. Dorsey, was included, Garfield guided MacVeagh and James to establish out the defilement in the Post Office Department "deep down", paying little heed to where it may lead. Brady surrendered and was in the end prosecuted for connivance. After two "star course" ring preliminaries in 1882 and 1883, the jury discovered Brady not blameworthy.
