In January 1973, Representative Richard C. White presented enactment for dedicatory dollars and half dollars for the 1976 United States Bicentennial. On June 6, Mint Director Mary Brooks affirmed before a congressional council, and reacting to worries that just the two least-mainstream groups would be changed, consented to help the impermanent overhaul of the quarter also. On October 18, 1973, President Richard Nixon marked enactment commanding an impermanent update of the three sections for all coins issued after July 4, 1975, and struck before January 1, 1977. These pieces would bear the twofold date 1776Ã¢ÂÂ 1976. Notwithstanding course pieces, Congress commanded that 45ÃÂ million Bicentennial coins be struck in 40%ÃÂ silver. Frightful of making low-mintage pieces which may be stored as the penny as of late had been, along these lines making a deficiency of quarters, in December 1974 the Mint acquired congressional endorsement to keep striking 1974-dated quarters, half dollars and dollars until Bicentennial coinage started. Likewise, there are no 1975-dated quarters. Right around two billion Bicentennial quarters were struck, as the Mint looked to guarantee that there would be a lot of gifts of the commemoration. The Mint sold the silver sets, in both uncirculated and evidence, for over 10 years before completion deals toward the finish of 1986. Jack L. Ahr's provincial drummer, which had showed up on the Bicentennial quarter, was supplanted after 1976 by Flanagan's unique turn around.
