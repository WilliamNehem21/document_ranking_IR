In 1937, Jenner experienced a gathering of men from the Glanton Exclusive Brethren remaining before the National Australia Bank on Collins Street. One of the men was participating in outdoors lecturing. Jenner intruded on the man to state that he would tune in to the man's uplifting news gave that he was permitted to share some uplifting news first. The man concurred, so Jenner showed the gathering of Brethren how to play craps there on the asphalt. One of the Brethren welcomed Jenner into his home for tea and educated him concerning the gospel. Jenner changed over to Christianity and, when he returned home, revealed to Jessie that she was a delinquent headed for hellfire and along these lines needing salvation. As per Wilson's history of Jenner, Jessie suspected that Jenner had turned out to be hyper or crazy. They had a youthful little girl named Ann by this point and Jenner was betting so much that he was not accommodating his family. For both of these reasons, Jessie left Jenner and moved to Corowa to take a shot at a homestead, taking Ann with her. She said that she would return just when Jenner recovered his mental soundness. On a few events, he forcefully revealed to Jessie's siblings that they expected to move toward becoming Christians, which incensed them. On one of these events, their discussion ended up physical and they started punching one another. The siblings rejected Jenner and were never accommodated to him. He kept in touch with his family back in England advising them of his transformation and requesting that they become Christians as well, yet he got no answer.
