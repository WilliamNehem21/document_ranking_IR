The legend of the pig-faced woman was revived once more in 1865, in Sheridan Le Fanu's novel "Uncle Silas". "Uncle Silas" tells the story of Maud Ruthyn, a wealthy heiress in her late teens who lives in a secluded house, whom a number of scheming men aim to marry to secure her money. The book includes a "Bretagne ballad" about the pig-faced woman, sung to Maud by her scheming governess Madame de la Rougierre as Rougierre leads her to a secret meeting with her cousin Dudley, who also has designs on her fortune. (No other record of the "Bretagne ballad" exists, and it was almost certainly written by Le Fanu himself.)
While Maud is described in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, "Uncle Silas" is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and the legend of the wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money. Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the "Dublin University Magazine", and would certainly have been familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.
