From a cricketing perspective, most faultfinders concurred that D'Oliveira ought to likely have been chosen dependent on his score at the Oval, his past record, and the handiness of his bowling. The selectors forgot him, in any case, choosing that his bowling was not sufficiently able to characterize him as an all-rounder. Oborne calls attention to that, made a decision in cricketing terms, this was "not a shock". D'Oliveira had a few opponents as a batsman, and of the spots accessible, one went to Ken Barrington, who had a decent Test record, and the other to Keith Fletcher, who was a lot more youthful than D'Oliveira. Oborne passes judgment on both of these choices reasonable. No one at the determination meeting bolstered including D'Oliveira. A portion of those present said later that, regardless of his earlier confirmations to D'Oliveira, Cowdrey restricted his choice at the gathering, which affected others there. Fraser-Sampson recommends that Cowdrey, who later attempted to legitimize his job in occasions, may have deep down upheld D'Oliveira's consideration, yet denounced it out of an absence of certainty and conclusiveness. It is additionally conceivable, contends Fraser-Sampson, that if May had known about the genuine situation, he may have trusted in Cowdrey, a dear companion; this would have left Cowdrey, who was quick to lead a group to South Africa, in a troublesome and clashed position. Fraser-Sampson closes: "A long way from being the antagonist of the piece, Cowdrey may just have been a good man pushed past the points of confinement of his character and overpowered by occasions."
