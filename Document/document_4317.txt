When the site of a manor had been selectedÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ whether a key position or one planned to rule the scene as a characteristic of powerÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the structure material must be chosen. An earth and timber stronghold was less expensive and simpler to erect than one worked from stone. The costs engaged with development are not all around recorded, and most enduring records identify with regal strongholds. A chÃÂ¢teau with earthen bulwarks, a motte, timber safeguards and structures could have been built by an incompetent workforce. The wellspring of labor was most likely from the nearby lordship, and the occupants would as of now have the essential aptitudes of felling trees, burrowing, and working timber important for an earth and timber mansion. Perhaps pressured into working for their ruler, the development of an earth and timber mansion would not have been a channel on a customer's assets. As far as time, it has been assessed that a normal measured motteÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ high and wide at the summitÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ would have taken 50ÃÂ people about 40ÃÂ working days. An astoundingly costly motte and bailey was that of Clones in Ireland, worked in 1211 for ÃÂ£20. The surprising expense, with respect to different palaces of its sort, was on the grounds that workers must be imported.
