No less than two arrangements of basaltic andesite magma streams are saved south of Tricouni Peak. One of these successions, known as Tricouni Southwest, makes a precipice on the eastern side of a north-south drifting channel with a profundity of adjoining the High Falls Creek mouth. The eastern flank of the magma stream, outside the High Falls Creek channel, has an increasingly consistent structure. A few fine-scale columnar joints and the general structure of the magma stream propose that its western segment, along the length of the channel, ponded against icy ice. Close to its southern unit, magma overflowed into splits in the frigid ice. This has been recognized by the presence of tower like cooling developments, albeit huge numbers of these buildings have been annihilated by erosional forms. Different highlights that demonstrate the magma ponded against cold ice incorporate its curiously thick structure and its precarious bluffs. Thusly, the Tricouni Southwest magma stream was ejected about 10,000ÃÂ years back when the local Fraser Glaciation was withdrawing. The clarification for the western bit showing ice-contact highlights while the eastern bit does not is likely in light of the fact that its western flank lies in a north-south slanting channel, which would have had the capacity to keep up littler measures of sun powered warmth than its unsheltered eastern flank. Therefore, the western segment of the magma stream records glaciation amid a period when the eastern inclines were free from icy ice.
