Garrow's estate was valued at Â£22,000 after his death near Ramsgate, Kent, including Â£12,000 in the Bank of England, Â£5,000 in three insurance policies and Â£5,000 secured by mortgages â a total of Â£ in 2019 terms. Garrow's will was written in 1830 and contained only two demands; to set up a trust and to be buried in his birthplace, Hadley, with his uncle, his father's younger brother William (who had left Garrow the best part of his fortune). The trust contained his entire estate, with the trustees being Leonard Smith, a merchant, Edward Lowth Badeley of Paper Buildings, Inner Temple and William Nanson Lettsom of Gray's Inn. The money was divided between Joseph Garrow, Garrow's nephew, who received Â£1,000, Â£200 to each of the children of Garrow's sister, Â£2,000 to the sister and Â£300 a year to the widow of Garrow's son. Eliza, Garrow's daughter, received Â£300 a year from the interest on the trust, with an additional provision of Â£200 for the joint use of Eliza and her husband. The estate was structured by a legal professional, and as such no death duties were paid. The second instruction was ignored: Garrow was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence, Ramsgate, his parish church.
