In harvest time 1706 Handel went to Italy. He remained for significant lots in Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice, making incessant visits to the musical drama houses and show lobbies. He acquired acquaintances with driving artists, among them Arcangelo Corelli, Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti, and Agostino Steffani, and met various artists and entertainers. From these colleagues Handel took in the fundamental qualities of Italian music, specifically (as per Dean and Knapp) "familiarity with the treatment of Italian refrain, precise declamation and adaptable symphonious cadence in recitative, ... drawing the important refinement among vocal and instrumental material and, most importantly, the arrival of [his] brilliant melodic blessing". Handel's first Italian musical drama, "Rodrigo", demonstrated a fragmented handle of Italian style, with a lot of Keiser's Hamburg impact still obvious; it was anything but a triumph when debuted in Florence, in late November or early December 1707. He pursued this by a protracted visit to Rome, where musical drama exhibitions were then prohibited by ecclesiastical pronouncement, and sharpened his abilities through the creation of cantatas and oratorios. In Rome, Handel met Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani, an ambassador and extra time librettist; the consequence of this gathering was a cooperation which delivered Handel's second Italian musical drama, "Agrippina". After this present work's triumphant debut at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo in Venice, on 26 December 1709, Handel progressed toward becoming, says biographer P. H. Lang, "world well known and the icon of a ruined and proficient gathering of people".
