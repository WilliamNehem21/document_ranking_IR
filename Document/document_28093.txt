Unlike most troodontids, "Xixiasaurus" did not have on its teeth, and their (front and back edges) were instead smooth and sharp, as in "Byronosaurus". "Xixiasaurus" had four closely packed teeth in each premaxilla, as in most other theropods, with roughly oval (tooth-sockets). The premaxillary teeth were smaller than the hindmost teeth of the maxilla. There was a distinct constriction between the crown and root of the premaxillary and frontmost ten maxillary teeth. The inner surfaces of the premaxillary tooth crowns were convex and the outer surfaces were somewhat concave, which created a D-shape when viewed in cross-section, a feature shared with a few other troodontids. It was distinct among troodontids in having 22 teeth in each maxilla (though not all teeth were preserved in the holotype, their number can be determined from the alveoli); other genera had either a higher or lower maxillary tooth count than "Xixiasaurus". The first seven maxillary teeth were tightly packed and much smaller than those further back, and had distinct constrictions between their crowns and roots. The outer surfaces of the crowns had distinct grooves close to the carinae, similar to "Urbacodon". The teeth curved backwards and were compressed from side to side, and the bases of the crowns were less expanded behind the tenth maxillary tooth. As in "Byronosaurus", the maxillary teeth were (differentiated), with the fifteenth tooth being largest.
