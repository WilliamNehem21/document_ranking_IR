It has never been solidly settled how the flame on "Situate" broke out, yet one basic record is that containers of oil and paint had been left on the stern, rather than being legitimately stowed subsequent to painting of the ship's frame had been finished in the blink of an eye before the fight. Consuming wadding from one of the British boats is accepted to have glided onto the stern and touched off the paint. The flame quickly spread through the chief of naval operations' lodge and into a prepared magazine that put away body ammo, which was intended to consume more wildly in water than in air. Then again, Fleet Captain HonorÃÂ© Ganteaume later announced the reason as a blast on the quarterdeck, gone before by a progression of minor flames on the primary deck among the ship's pontoons. Whatever its beginning, the shoot spread quickly through the ship's apparatus, unchecked by the discharge siphons on board, which had been crushed by British shot. A second burst at that point started at the bow, catching many mariners in the ship's abdomen. Resulting archeological examination discovered flotsam and jetsam dissipated over of seabed and proof that the ship was wracked by two gigantic blasts in a steady progression. Several men dove into the ocean to get away from the flares, yet less than 100 endure the impact. English water crafts got around 70 survivors, including the injured staff officer LÃÂ©onard-Bernard Motard. A couple of others, including Ganteaume, figured out how to achieve the shore on pontoons. The rest of the team, numbering in excess of 1,000 men, were slaughtered, including Captain Casabianca and his child, Giocante.
