At 12:30 pm, "Bellerophon" slice through the foe line, sneaking by the stern of the Spanish 74-firearm "Monarca" and terminating two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, "Bellerophon" crashed into the French 74-weapon "Aigle", hitting "Aigle"s port quarter with her starboard bow, and ensnaring the two boats' yards. Bolted together, they traded broadsides at short proximity, with fighters on board "Aigle" clearing "Bellerophon"s decks with gun shoot and projectiles. Cumby saw that the officers were being focused on, and that Cooke's unmistakable epaulets stamped him out. Cumby asked him to take them off, just for Cooke to answer "It is past the point of no return presently to take them off. I see my circumstance however I will bite the dust like a man." "Bellerophon" was presently supporting flame from "Aigle" and three different boats, the Spanish "San Juan Nepomuceno" and "Bahama", and the French "Swiftsure". "Bellerophon"s fundamental and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and slaughtered. An onlooker recorded that He had released his guns in all respects every now and again at the adversary, who as regularly endeavored to board, and he had executed a French officer alone quarterdeck. He was in the demonstration of reloading his pistolsÃÂ ... when he got two black powder gun balls in the bosom. He promptly fell, and upon the officer going up and inquiring as to whether he should bring him down beneath, his answer was "No, given me a chance to lie unobtrusively one moment. Advise Lieutenant Cumby never to strike."
