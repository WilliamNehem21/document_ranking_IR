Indeed, even after the King's Company got their new all around designated playhouse in Drury Lane in 1674, they couldn't exploit it, as they came up short on the funding to mount focused spectaculars. Rather, they endeavored to all the while gain by and kill at the Duke's best mid-1670s contributions by mounting a few vaudevilles or farces of them, composed by Thomas Duffett. The records for the mid-1670s are especially inadequate, and neither definite dates nor the open response to Duffett's pieces are known, however even the printed forms, pale shadows of Duffett's tragedy exhibitions, have demonstrated profoundly interesting to current commentators. The first of them, "The Empress of Morocco", satirized at the same time Settle's "Ruler of Morocco" and the rich new Dorset Garden creation of Davenant's "Macbeth" adjustment, with Duffett's three witches flying in over the pit on sweepers at the high purpose of the activity, trailed by the plunge of Heccate over the Stage "in a heavenly chariot, decorated with pictures of damnation and fallen angels, and made of a vast wicker bin". "The Mock Tempest" enhances the shower of flame over the group of onlookers in the Dorset Garden pseudo-Shakespearean whirlwind scene with a downpour of "flame, apples, nuts".
