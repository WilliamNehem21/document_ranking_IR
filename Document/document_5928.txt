By the mid 1990s, "Sesame Street" was, as Davis put it, "the undisputed heavyweight hero of preschool TV". "Diversion Weekly" announced in 1991 that the show's music had been regarded with eight Grammys. The show's predominance, in any case, was before long tested by another PBS TV program for preschoolers, "Barney and Friends", and "Sesame Street's" evaluations declined. The makers of "Sesame Street" reacted, at the show's twenty-fifth commemoration in 1993, by extending and updating the show's set, calling it "Around the bend". New human and Muppet characters were presented, including Zoe (performed by Fran Brill), child Natasha and her folks Ingrid and Humphrey, and Ruthie (played by comic Ruth Buzzi). The "Around the bend" set was destroyed in 1997. Zoe, one of only a handful couple of characters that endure, was made to incorporate another female Muppet on the show: her spunky and brave identity was planned to break female generalizations. As indicated by Davis, she was the primary character created on the show by promoting and item advancement pros, who worked with the scientists at the CTW. (The journey for a "break-out" female Muppet character proceeded into 2006 with the making of Abby Cadabby, who was made following nine months of research.) In 1998, without precedent for the show's history, "Sesame Street" sought after subsidizing by tolerating corporate sponsorship. Customer advocate Ralph Nader, who had been a visitor on the show, asked guardians to dissent the move by boycotting the show.
