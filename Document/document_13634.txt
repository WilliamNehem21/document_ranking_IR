Gerard progressed toward becoming Archbishop of York in December 1100. No source specifies him being contributed by the lord, yet as Anselm asked Pope Paschal II to give Gerard his pallium, which he would have been probably not going to do if Gerard had been contributed by Henry, that plausibility appears to be remote. At Whitsun in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm's help, denied Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, of the terrains of the see of Durham, in light of the fact that Ranulf had deserted to Henry's senior sibling Robert Curthose, who additionally asserted the English position of authority. Gerard then ousted Ranulf from his ministerial office. Not long after his interpretation to York, Gerard started a long question with Anselm, guaranteeing break even with power with the Archbishop of Canterbury and declining to make a calling of accepted dutifulness to Anselm, some portion of the long CanterburyÃ¢ÂÂ York debate. At the 1102 Council of Westminster, Gerard apparently kicked over the littler seat given to him as Archbishop of York, and wouldn't be situated until he was furnished with one as vast as Anselm's. He went to Rome in 1102 to get his pallium from the pope, to whom he introduced the lord's side against Anselm in the debate encompassing inaugurations. The pope ruled against the lord, however Gerard and two different clerics announced that the pope had guaranteed them that the different ecclesiastical declarations against the lay instatement of diocesans would not be implemented. Their case was denied by Anselm's agents and the pope, who suspended Gerard until he abnegated.
