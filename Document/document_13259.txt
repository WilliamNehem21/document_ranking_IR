The holotype example is the main known "Xixiasaurus" fossil, and comprises of a practically total skull aside from the rearmost segment, just as an incomplete right forelimb. The association between the (temple bone) and (bone running at the upper length of the nose) bones is uprooted, and part of the is missing. The greater part of the nose is saved, with the of the correct side being all around protected. Just the front piece of the left (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) and a portion of its broken teeth are saved. In spite of the fact that few teeth are absent from the two jaws, their unique number can be resolved in the upper jaw, since their attachments there are safeguarded. The forelimb (of which every safeguarded part are ) comprises of the center piece of the and (bones of the lower arm), the furthest point of the second and third (hand bones), the total first finger, and the first of the second finger. In 2014, the scientist Takanobu Tsuihiji and associates expressed that a bone LÃÂ¼ and partners had initially distinguished as the (some portion of the ) of "Xixiasaurus" was rather part of the or (the primary bones of the upper jaw), in view of examination with the vomer of the more total troodontid "Gobivenator".
