In December 2010, it was reported that the film would be called "Paradise", named after John Milton's poem "Paradise Lost", but Scott considered that this would convey too much information about the film. Fox CEO Thomas Rothman suggested "Prometheus", which was confirmed as the title in January 2011. A release date was scheduled for , but weeks later the release was postponed until . With the name confirmed, the production team began to publicly distance the film from its "Alien" origins, and were deliberately vague about the connection between the films, believing it would build audience anticipation for "Prometheus". Scott stated that "while "Alien" was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of "Alien"s DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative." In June 2011, Scott and Lindelof confirmed that "Prometheus" takes place in the same universe as the events of the "Alien" series. In July 2011, Scott stated that "by the end of the third act you start to realize there's a DNA of the very first "Alien", but none of the subsequent [films]."
