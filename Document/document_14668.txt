Cotes depicted Robey as having "an extraordinary essentialness and tremendous direction of the [role]. He never vacillated, he needed to take his gathering of people by the throat and make them mindful on the double since he couldn't play himself in."

The press were complimentary of his execution, and he later credited his prosperity to Littler and her support.
