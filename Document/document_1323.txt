Work on the Mirage substitution program continued in 1975, and the Tactical Fighter Project Office was built up in 1976 to deal with the way toward choosing the RAAF's next warrior. A solicitation for proposition was issued in November that year and pulled in eleven reactions. By March 1977 the workplace had concentrated on the F-15 Eagle, General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, Dassault Mirage 2000 and Panavia Tornado, just as the McDonnell Douglas F-18A and F-18L; the F-18A was a bearer based contender created from the YF-17 for the United States Navy, and the F-18L was a land-based variation of this structure. The Grumman F-14 Tomcat was likewise considered by the task office, yet was viewed as unacceptable and never put on the official waitlist. In November 1978 the F-15 and Tornado were expelled from the rundown of air ship being considered. The Tornado was barred as it was mainly a strike flying machine and had constrained aerial capacity. While the F-15 was an amazing flying machine that met or surpassed practically the majority of the RAAF's necessities, it was trusted that the aviation based armed forces did not require a contender with such propelled abilities and that bringing it into administration could destabilize Australia's area.
