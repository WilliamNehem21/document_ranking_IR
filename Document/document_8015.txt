In 1896, Yorkshire won their second County Championship. Hirst hit a century against Leicestershire and nine different scores more than fifty; this improvement in his batting took him past 1,000 keeps running out of the blue, and his normal of 28.05 was considerably higher than he had accomplished beforehand. With the ball he took 104 wickets, at the more costly normal of 21.61, to finish the twofold of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets out of the blue. In any case, a few commentators in Yorkshire were troubled that his batting had improved, trusting that the additional exertion included would decrease his adequacy as a bowler. They believed an amazing bowling assault to be essential to the group's prosperity, more so than a solid batting line-up, and communicated the feeling that Hirst should focus on one control instead of partitioning his vitality. Throughout the following couple of seasons, these feelings of dread were demonstrated to some degree, "Wisden" noticing in 1901 that he was a less successful bowler than beforehand. In 1897, Hirst finished the twofold once more. He scored 1,535 keeps running at a normal of 35.69, with a century and 11 fifties, and took 101 wickets at a normal of 23.22. These exhibitions were adequate to win him choice for the Players against the Gentlemen in the esteemed matches at The Oval and Lord's, in the two of which he scored half-hundreds of years.
