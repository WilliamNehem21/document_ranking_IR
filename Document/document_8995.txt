John Williams created the film's score, which earned him an Academy Award and was later positioned the 6th most prominent score by the American Film Institute. The primary "shark" topic, a basic exchanging example of two notesÃ¢ÂÂdifferently distinguished as "E and F" or "F and F sharp"Ã¢ÂÂ turned into a great bit of tension music, synonymous with moving toward peril (see driving tone). Williams portrayed the topic as "pounding endlessly at you, similarly as a shark would do, instinctual, steady, relentless." The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. At the point when asked by Johnson for what valid reason the tune was written in such a high register and not played by the more proper French horn, Williams reacted that he needed it to sound "somewhat more compromising". At the point when Williams initially shown his plan to Spielberg, playing only the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have snickered, imagining that it was a joke. As Williams saw likenesses among "Jaws" and privateer motion pictures, at different focuses in the score he evoked "privateer music", which he called "basic, however fun and engaging". Calling for fast, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of "La mer" by Claude Debussy also of Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring".
