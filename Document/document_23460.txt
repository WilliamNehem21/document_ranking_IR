Sheppard's tale was revived in the first half of the 19th century. A melodrama, "Jack Sheppard, The Housebreaker, or London in 1724", by W. T. Moncrieff was published in 1825. More successful was William Harrison Ainsworth's third novel, entitled "Jack Sheppard", which was originally published in "Bentley's Miscellany" from January 1839 with illustrations by George Cruikshank, overlapping with the final episodes of Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist". An archetypal Newgate novel, it generally remains close to the facts of Sheppard's life, but portrays him as a swashbuckling hero. Like Hogarth's prints, the novel pairs the descent of the "idle" apprentice into crime with the rise of a typical melodramatic character, Thames Darrell, a foundling of aristocratic birth who defeats his evil uncle to recover his fortune. Cruikshank's images perfectly complemented Ainsworth's taleâThackeray wrote that "...Mr Cruickshank really created the tale, and that Mr Ainsworth, as it were, only put words to it." The novel quickly became very popular: it was published in book form later that year, before the serialised version was completed, and even outsold early editions of "Oliver Twist". Ainsworth's novel was adapted into a successful play by John Buckstone in October 1839 at the Adelphi Theatre starring (strangely enough) Mary Anne Keeley; indeed, it seems likely that Cruikshank's illustrations were deliberately created in a form that were informed by, and would be easy to repeat as, tableaux on stage. It has been described as the "exemplary climax" of "the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially".
