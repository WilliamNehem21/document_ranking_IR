Pellew promptly turned seawards with an end goal to get away from the shore and flagged Reynolds to take action accordingly. Albeit the two boats had experienced extreme harm the fight and climate, they had the capacity to make the get some distance from land, "Amazon" toward the north and "Relentless", at the request of its Breton pilot, toward the south. At first it was trusted that the land spotted was the island of Ushant, which would have given the boats a lot of ocean room in which to move. Anyway at 06:30, with the sky helping, it ended up obvious on the "Tireless" that there were breakers toward the south and east, showing that the three boats had floated amid the night into Audierne Bay. On finding his circumstance, Pellew was resolved to bring his ship westwards, endeavoring to work his ship out of peril by beating against the breeze. Hurried fixes must be made to the harmed apparatus before it was protected to modify their course. Because of her northwards turn, "Amazon" had even less space to move than "Inexhaustible" and by 05:00 she had struck a sandbank. In spite of the fact that the frigate stayed upstanding, endeavors more than a few hours to bring her off fizzled; at 08:00 Reynolds requested his men to plan to desert transport.
