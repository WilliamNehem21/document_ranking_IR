The park has a single trail that leads from the information center in Manantenina to the highest peak. The path into the rain forest is divided into three treks that vary in length and lead to each of the three main camps, each of which is situated at different altitudes and offer views of their own distinctive flora and fauna.

The first camp, Camp Mantella, is further along the path. The camp is in the lowland rain forest above the Manantenina River at an elevation of .
