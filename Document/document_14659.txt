The scene "Sibling from Another Series" presents Bob's sibling Cecil. After essayist Ken Keeler was doled out to compose a scene including Sideshow Bob, he drew motivation from scenes of "Frasier". He chose to consolidate components of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and structured Cecil to take after Grammer's sibling on "Frasier". Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who depicted Frasier Crane's sibling Niles. Penetrate remarked, "Regularly, I would not accomplish something like this. However, how regularly do you get an opportunity to work with a performing artist like Kelsey Grammer and, all the more vitally, play his sibling?" Several of "Frasier" makers were approached to audit the first content and give criticism. Their remarks were certain; they just communicated worry with an exceptionally short scene in which Cecil converses with an obvious character whom he alludes to as "Maris". In "Frasier", Maris Crane is a concealed character, and the makers of "Frasier" asked that the scene be evacuated. A considerable lot of the connections among Bob and Cecil depended on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was attracted to look like David Hyde Pierce, while holding a visual closeness to Sideshow Bob. As indicated by executive Pete Michels, it was hard to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, on account of their humorously curiously large feet.
