In February 1945, Walters was promoted to acting air commodore and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Northern Command, directing its operations in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville until the end of the war. Headquartered at Madang in Papua New Guinea, Northern Command had previously been a large mobile formation known as No.Â 9 (Operational) Group but had evolved into a garrison force, its mobile function supplanted by No.Â 10 (Operational) Group (later First Tactical Air Force). Northern Command's operational formations included No.Â 71 Wing in northern New Guinea, No.Â 74 Wing at Port Moresby, and No.Â 84 Wing on Bougainville. No.Â 71 Wing, commanded by Group Captain Val Hancock, supported the Australian 6thÂ Division during the AitapeâWewak Campaign, despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their Bristol Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs. No.Â 84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the Bougainville Campaign, and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report, the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters. In September, Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in Wewak.
