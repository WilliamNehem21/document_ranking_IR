The preliminaries with "Chesma" significantly influenced the covering security structure of the "Borodino"- class ships. The Krupp established defensive layer plates were resized to coordinate the edges and offer help for their joints; they were additionally bolted together with mortise-and-join joints to all the more likely disperse the stun of a shell's effect. The waterline belt secured the center of the ship. It had a complete tallness of , of which was over the plan waterline and underneath. The rest of the segment of the waterline was secured by plates. The upper belt was thick and had a stature of . It diminished to 75ÃÂ millimetres forward of the casemates and stretched out right to the bow. The back segment of the forecastle deck was ensured by an upward expansion of the upper belt in the territory of the forward barbettes and the upper casemates. Those casemates were secured by 100-millimeter transverse bulkheads. Behind the side shield was an inboard longitudinal chip bulkhead that was thick between the center and lower decks and diminished to between the center and upper decks. The bulkhead slanted far from the edge of the lower deck to the lower edge of the shield belt with an absolute thickness of 75ÃÂ millimetres partitioned between a 50-millimeter plate of Krupp non-established protective layer (KNC) layered over a 25-millimeter nickel-steel plate. The forward end of the defensively covered fortress was ensured independently and the transverse bulkhead was in this manner just 75ÃÂ millimetres thick. The back bulkhead had no other security and was thick between the center and lower decks, diminishing to 75ÃÂ millimetres at the dimension of the defensive layer belt.
