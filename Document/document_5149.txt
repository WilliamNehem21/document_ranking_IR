These were promptly trailed by the five "Kaiser Friedrich III"- class warships, of which "Kaiser Barbarossa" was a part. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s bottom was set down on 3 August 1898, at the Schichau-Werke in Danzig, under development number 640. She was requested under the agreement name "An" as an expansion to the armada. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was propelled on 21 April 1900.

Ocean preliminaries started on 4 May 1901, amid which two tests were recorded: a 50-hour continuance test and a 6-hour speed test. The previous created a supported speed of , while the last observed a most extreme speed of , and on 10 June she was dispatched into the armada in Kiel.
