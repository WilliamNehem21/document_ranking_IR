Five other "Armillaria" species are found in Australia. Within the range of "A.Â luteobubalina", "A.Â hinnulea" is restricted to gully habitats. "A.Â fumosa" is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations. "A.Â luteobubalina" and "A.Â montagnei" share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour, but the latter species has an olive-tinged cap, larger spores (9.5â11 by 5.5â7Â Âµm compared to 6.5â7.5 by 4.5â5.5Â Âµm) and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in "A.Â luteobubalina". The morphology of the vegetative structures of "A.Â limonea" is distinctly different than "A.Â luteobubalina", and can be used to distinguish the two species. "A.Â novae-zelandiae" has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below the ring and is found in wet forests, and "A.Â pallidula" is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical Australia arising from dead tree stumps or the roots of dead or living trees. "A.Â luteobubalina" is the only "Armillaria" species which occurs in Western Australia. Distinguishing Australian species is economically important, because "A.Â luteobubalina" is more pathogenic than the other members of the genus. A molecular diagnostic test, developed in 2002, can accurately identify each species using DNA extracted from its mycelia. Before this, species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season. This technology also revealed a variation in the molecular material of "A.Â luteobubalina" that suggested sexual reproduction.
