Mendes' melody decisions "advance through the historical backdrop of American prevalent music". Mill operator contends that albeit some might be over natural, there is a parodic component at work, "following through on [the film's] consolation that watchers look nearer".

The verses, which discuss "mansions copying", can be viewed as an allegory for Lester's perspective on AngelaÃ¢ÂÂ"the blushing, dream driven outside of the 'American BeautyÃ¢ÂÂas it copies away to uncover "the tentative, little breasted young lady who, similar to his better half, has tenaciously built up a bogus open self".
