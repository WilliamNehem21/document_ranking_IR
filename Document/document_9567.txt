Gas Powered Games' arrival of the Siege Editor sparked the ascent of a modding network around the amusement; even before discharge a few modding bunches declared goals to utilize the motor to make vast scale mods changing diversions from the "Ultima" arrangement of pretending recreations. After the amusement's discharge, various mods were made, including a few "absolute change" mods that made entirely new recreations and stories, for example, "The Lands of Hyperborea" and "Essential". Gas Powered Games discharged one mod of their own in July 2002 titled "Yesterhaven", made by six originators more than about a month and a half, which gave a short multiplayer storyline to low-level characters wherein they protected a town from three topical maladies of beasts. It was followed up by "Legends of Aranna", a full extension pack created by Mad Doc Software and discharged on November 11, 2003 for Windows and Mac OS X by Microsoft. The development pack included minimal new ongoing interaction other than new territories, animals, and things, however highlighted a totally isolated story from the first diversion. In "Legends", the player controls another anonymous rancher; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by an animal called the Shadowjumper, they set off to recover it. In the wake of battling their way through beasts in frigid slopes, wildernesses, and islands, the player lands at the magical Great Clock, a monster ancient rarity which controls Aranna's seasons. There they rout the Shadowjumper and recover the Staff of Stars. It got commonly more negative audits than the first, with commentators adulating the measure of substance yet condemning the absence of changes to the base ongoing interaction.
