In May 2011, Sussex County administrators proposed the U.S. Parkway be updated completely along its present arrangement, with the expansion of an upper east detour of Millsboro to interface USÃÂ 113 and DEÃÂ 24 that could be developed for the most part through state-claimed land. Regardless of resistance to its favored option, DelDOT finished the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the MillsboroÃ¢ÂÂ South zone in July 2013; the archive perceived the noteworthy restriction to the Blue Alternative. In 2015, DelDOT reported that the Blue Alternative was never again being considered. Rather, US 113 would be redesigned along its present arrangement as a major aspect of a Modified Yellow Alternative. Notwithstanding, in contrast to the first Yellow Alternative, which would update US 113 to a road and highlighted a few trades, US 113 would not turn into an interstate under the changed arrangement. Rather, just a few intersection would be dispensed with, US 113 would be extended to six paths between its convergences with DE 20 on either side of Millsboro, and a two-path upper east detour of Millsboro proposed in 2011 would be assembled and associate with US 113 at an incomplete cloverleaf trade close to the northern US 113Ã¢ÂÂ DE 20 intersection. In December 2016, DelDOT finished a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement in which the Modified Yellow Alternative is the organization's favored option.
