Crowds responded more candidly than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's execution. Anya's unpolished honesty was like a plot contort, as watchers did not expect the profundity of affectability that she depicted in her monolog, which Whedon considers "the core of the experience" and pundit Noel Murray repeats as the "general purpose of the scene in bolded, capital letters". Xander's punching the divider and harming his hand served to give the four in this scene something to focus on, to divert their defenselessness, which was another aspect of the physicality of managing the emergency. Whedon utilized another long following shot from Joyce's face in the funeral home after the specialist down the corridor to talk with Buffy and the Scoobies to concrete the truth of their being so close in closeness, rather than slicing shots to give the likelihood that it was a piece of another set found elsewhere. The vampire that assaults Dawn in the funeral home was a touch numerous watchers removed to be from spot for the scene. This scene differentiates the more dream related passings basic in the arrangement with Joyce's practical demise. Besides, like Xander's stopping ticket and the hints of life outside Buffy's home, in Sunnydale vampires are an ordinary encounter, and it was proposed to demonstrate that life for Buffy proceeds.
