Similar to the case in Boston, Lee Smith's first diversion with St. Louis went ineffectively as he surrendered two keeps running in his solitary inning of pitching. He recouped immediately, enrolled a 0.00 ERA for the whole month of July, and completed his incomplete season with St. Louis with a 2.10 ERA and 27 spares. The Cardinals, be that as it may, were at a depressed spot in 1990, completing in last spot for the main time since 1918. In 1991, St. Louis corrected their ship, and Smith amassed spares at a record pace. With his compensation generally multiplied to almost $2.8 million, Smith achieved 40 puts something aside without precedent for his vocation. On September 28, he grabbed spare number 45 to tie Bruce Sutter's National League record from 1984 (Coincidentally, when Sutter and Smith achieved 45 spares in their individual seasons, both were ex-Cubs pitching for St. Louis against the Cubs). Smith asserted the class record for himself three days after the fact and completed the season with a vocation high 47 spares. One distinction for him in 1991 was strolls as he surrendered just 1.60 strolls per nine innings, by a wide margin the best in his vocation to that point. Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Award, got the most noteworthy thought for group MVP in his profession, and completed second in Cy Young Award casting a ballot behind just Tom Glavine, who had a breakout 20-win season in 1991.
