The following morning, loyalist members of "Georgii Pobedonosets" retook control of the ship and ran her aground in Odessa harbor. The crew of "Potemkin", together with "Ismail", decided to sail for ConstanÈa later that day where they could restock food, water and coal. The Romanians refused to provide the supplies, backed by the presence of their small protected cruiser "Elisabeta", so the ship's committee decided to sail for the small, barely defended port of Theodosia in the Crimea where they hoped to resupply. The ship arrived on the morning of 5 July, but the city's governor refused to give them anything other than food. The mutineers attempted to seize several barges of coal the following morning, but the port's garrison ambushed them and killed or captured 22 of the 30 sailors involved. They decided to return to ConstanÈa that afternoon.
"Potemkin" reached its destination at 23:00 on 7 July and the Romanians agreed to give asylum to the crew if they would disarm themselves and surrender the battleship. "Ismail"s crew decided the following morning to return to Sevastopol and turn themselves in, but "Potemkin"s crew voted to accept the terms. Captain Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at noon and hoisted the Romanian flag and then allowed the ship to enter the inner harbor. Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that the "Potemkin"s Kingston valves be opened so she would sink to the bottom.
