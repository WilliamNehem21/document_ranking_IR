The land and/or water capable power accepted the open door to re-stow its gear. This took eleven days. Having not yet refueled, "Intrepid" rode excessively high in the water, and was unfit to dispatch its LCUs, so the weight of the exertion at first must be conveyed by helicopters. Two Wessexes, three Sea Kings and a Boeing CH-47 Chinook bolstered the exertion. Deficiencies of lifting rigging and load nets hampered the exertion, as did the erratic unique stowage of stores. At times, load had moved amid the voyage to Ascension. Somewhere in the range of 138 Wessex, 40 Chinook and 40 Sea King fights were flown on a solitary day. The LSLs "Sir Galahad" and "Sir Percivale" were loaded with two days' supply of ammo, fuel and apportions. Four more days' supply was stowed on "Stromness", and sixteen on "Elk". Units were issued with provisions and gear they would require for a land and/or water capable ambush. In the mean time, "Courageous", "Atlantic Conveyor", "Norland" and "Europic Ferry" left the UK on 25 and 26 April, and "Sir Bedivere", which came to Marchwood on 25 April, cruised for Ascension on 27 April. The five LSLs, conveying the greater part of the Commando Logistic Regiment, gauged stay and set out for the Falkland Islands on 1 May, alongside "Pearleaf" and escorted by the frigate . "Norland" landed at Ascension on the morning of 7 May, and withdrew for the Falklands that night. "Canberra", "Tidepool" and "Elk" had left the earlier day, and the last ship, the LPD "Fearless", withdrew Ascension on 8 May.
