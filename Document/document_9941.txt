The primary state constitution energized state inclusion in interior upgrades like streets. The Panic of 1837 crushed the new state's endeavors, and the legislature defaulted on bond installments. Private development organizations assembled streets beginning in 1844 to fill the void in long-remove street development left by the flight of the government. The primary streets were corduroy streets; to fabricate these, logs of all sizes were put over the street. The holes between the logs were filled in with littler logs or earth. In swampy or damp territories, brush was set down first for waste. In time, the logs would spoil, leaving vast holes to the roadway that would get wagon wheels or draft creature feet. Afterward, streets were worked with oak boards. The board street organizations must be contracted by the state after section of enactment in 1848. As per the board street law, these organizations needed to construct their streets to a lot of least determinations. These particulars incorporated into complete width, a street surface wide with at any rate made of boards. Later changes to the law enabled the organizations to substitute rock for the boards. Beginning with the authorization of another state constitution in 1850, the state was denied from being "a section to, or intrigued by, any work of interior improvement"; this arrangement finished the express government's association in Michigan's streets.
