On 28 December 1982 "New Jersey" was formally recommissioned at Long Beach, California, her new homeport. The recommissioning of "New Jersey" marked a return of the world's last battleships after a 13-year absence from the world's oceans.
"New Jersey"s modernization was unique in that she was to be the only reactivated "Iowa"-class battleship to lose a gun turret. At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to remove "New Jersey"s No. 3 16Â in gun turret (located aft of the superstructure). In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems: a vertical launching missile magazine which would have enabled "New Jersey" to carry an additional 48 Tomahawk or Harpoon missiles, or using the space generated by a removed gun turret for aircraft related updates centering on VTOL or V/STOL type aircraft. These ideas were ultimately dropped, and "New Jersey" retained her No. 3 gun turret during her 1980s career.
Over the next several months the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher (ABL) mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and a quartet of the United States Navy's Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. "New Jersey" also received eight RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, which are remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16"/50 Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities.
