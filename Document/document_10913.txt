In 1926, when the U.S. Expressway framework was reported, there was a hole in USÃÂ 50 among Ely and Thistle, Utah. At the time, the conditions of Utah and Nevada were fighting about which of the old auto trails would be cleared and utilized for the new U.S. Expressway framework. Utah authorities would not clear the segment of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. They saw this course as being costly to work, with no advantage for the state. Nevada authorities, and the Lincoln Highway Association, begged Utah specialists to change their position, notwithstanding offering assets to help balance the extra expense of clearing that course. Be that as it may, the Lincoln thruway coordinated explorers bound for both southern and northern California on a course far from Utah urban communities, towards focal Nevada. Utah rather cleared the Wendover Cutoff, some portion of the Victory Highway (current Interstate 80), that just coordinated traffic for northern California out of the state. The decision not to clear the Lincoln Highway would guide voyagers destined for southern California to utilize the Arrowhead Trail (current Interstate 15). This course serves various networks in Utah, however just Las Vegas and a couple of other communities in Nevada. The last hit to the first course of the Lincoln Highway was the arrangement of the Dugway Proving Ground, an army installation utilized for weapons testing, which shut the region to the general population. The Lincoln Highway was re-steered to Salt Lake City along a meandering course by means of Wendover and the Bonneville Salt Flats. This course was at first numbered USÃÂ 50 from Ely to Wendover and USÃÂ 40/50 crosswise over western Utah, however has been renumbered USÃÂ 93, US 93 Alternate and I-80.
