Pusey, the influential "high church" Anglican theologian associated with the Oxford Movement, wrote a letter of support to MÃ¼ller, reproduced in "The Times". In his view, Boden's intentions would be best advanced by electing MÃ¼ller. Missionaries could not win converts without knowing the details of the religion of those with whom they were dealing, he wrote, and MÃ¼ller's publications were "the greatest gifts which have yet been bestowed" on those in such work. He added that Oxford would gain by electing him to a position where MÃ¼ller could spend all his time on work "of such primary and lasting importance for the conversion of India." Beckerlegge finds Pusey's support noteworthy, since Pusey would not have agreed with MÃ¼ller's particular "broad" approach to Christianity, and was thus providing a judgment on the academic abilities of the candidate best placed to advance missionary work in India. One anonymous writer of a letter to the press in support of MÃ¼ller, shortly before the election, expressed it thus: "A man's personal character must stand very high, and his theological opinions can afford but little ground for animadversion on either hand, when he unites as his unhesitating supporters Dr. Pusey and Dr. Macbride"Â â a reference to John Macbride, described in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" as "a profoundly religious layman of the 'old' evangelical school". However, Dowling describes MÃ¼ller as "impercipient of the subtle twists of theological argument, the fine shadings and compunctions of Victorian religious feeling"Â â a weakness that was held against him.
