Today, Crane is viewed as a standout amongst the most inventive authors of the 1890s. His companions, including Conrad and James, just as later authors, for example, Robert Frost, Ezra Pound and Willa Cather, hailed Crane as one of the best inventive spirits of his time. His work was depicted by Wells as "the primary articulation of the opening personality of another period, or, in any event, the early unequivocal period of another activity." Wells said that "past debate", Crane was "the best author of our age, and his troublesome demise was a hopeless misfortune to our writing." Conrad composed that Crane was a "craftsman" and "a soothsayer with a present for rendering the critical on the outside of things and with an exceptional understanding into crude feelings". Crane's work has demonstrated rousing for future essayists; not just have researchers drawn similitudes between Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms" and "The Red Badge of Courage", yet Crane's fiction is thought to have been a vital motivation for Hemingway and his kindred Modernists. In 1936, Hemingway wrote in "The Green Hills of Africa" that "The great essayists are Henry James, Stephen Crane, and Mark Twain. That is not the request they're great in. There is no structure for good scholars." Crane's verse is thought to have been an antecedent to the Imagist development, and his short fiction has likewise impacted American writing. "The Open Boat", "The Blue Hotel", "The Monster" and "The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky" are commonly considered by commentators to be instances of Crane's best work.
