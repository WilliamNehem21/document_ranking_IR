Douglas rehearsed for the entire of his profession in a commonplace district town, and the vast majority of his works were amassed in Cheshire and North Wales, yet he "directed a training which accomplished national prestige". He was never an individual from the Royal Institute of British Architects, yet his works highlighted as often as possible in national distributions, including "Building News", "The Builder", "The Architect", and "The British Architect", the remainder of which especially applauded a large number of his works. Some of Douglas' works were shown at the Royal Academy and showed up in "Institute Architecture". Douglas' eulogy in "The British Architect" alluded to him as having "accomplished a notoriety which has since a long time ago put him in the front position of living engineers". In the arrangement "The Buildings of England", Nikolaus Pevsner portrayed him, without reservation, as "the best Cheshire draftsman". In the buddy arrangement "The Buildings of Wales: Clwyd", Hubbard communicated the sentiment that he was "the most vital and dynamic neighborhood designer of the period". Basic recognition was not bound to Britain; Douglas' works were acclaimed by the French engineer Paul SÃÂ©dille, and Muthesius composed of his "quintessential authority of structure". In spite of this, the main authority acknowledgment he got in his lifetime was an award for Abbeystead House, which was appeared at a display in Paris.
