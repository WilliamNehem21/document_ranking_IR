Cap's underlying journey took him to the shore of the Colony of Virginia, close to the passageway of the Chesapeake Bay, where he caught and looted four vessels, and consumed the Barbadian ship "Turbet" to keep updates on his violations from his home island. He at that point cruised north to New York City, taking two additional boats, and grabbing maritime supplies and discharging prisoners at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had come back to the Carolinas, where he assaulted two additional boats, a brigantine from Boston and a Barbadian sloop. He stripped the brigantine, yet conveyed the payload filled Barbadian sloop to a channel off North Carolina to use for lurching and fixing the "Vengeance". After the Barbadian sloop's handle was utilized to pitch the "Retribution", the ship was destroyed for timber, and the remaining parts were then singed. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then a notorious privateer lair on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. "On the way", he experienced, battled, and got away from a Spanish warship. The "Vengeance" was severely harmed, Bonnet was truly injured, and a large portion of the group of the sloop was slaughtered or injured in the experience. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet supplanted his losses and refitted the "Retribution," expanding the sloop's weapon to twelve firearms.
