After World War I started in 1914, it was Borah's view that the U.S. should keep totally out of it and he voted in favor of enactment mentioned by Wilson notwithstanding deadly implement shipments to the belligerents. Borah was disturbed when Wilson allowed credits to Great Britain and France subsequent to rejecting them advances, as the credits filled a similar need, assisting the war. He was cautious in help of the nonpartisan privileges of the United States, and was offended both by the 1915 sinking of the "Lusitania" by the Germans and by encroachments against Americans by British powers. Borah was talked about as a conceivable possibility for president in 1916, however increased little help: the Old Guard hated him nearly as much as they did Roosevelt, while others addressed whether a man so free from the control of the gathering could lead its positions. Borah expressed he came up short on the cash to run. He worked off camera to discover an applicant that would rejoin the Republicans and holdout Progressives: an individual from a joint board of trustees of the two gatherings' traditions to look for re-unification, Borah accomplished an agreeable gathering when he tended to the Progressive tradition. The Republicans designated Charles Evans Hughes, and Progressive pioneers reluctantly sponsored him, however some previous Roosevelt supporters would not bolster Hughes. Borah battled for the Republican presidential hopeful (something he would do just yet again, for Hoover in 1928), yet Wilson barely won re-appointment.
