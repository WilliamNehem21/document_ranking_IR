California Chrome delivered to New York on May 20 out of a semi-trailer horse van together with Ride On Curlin. They had a police escort through New York City from the Throgs Neck Bridge to Belmont Park. The press announced that Art Sherman trusted the incorrectly spelled seat materials at the Derby and Preakness were a lucky trinket, and that he explicitly approached Belmont Park for another incorrectly spelled fabric alongside a legitimately spelled variant. The principal week California Chrome spent at the Belmont track was commonly uneventful, other than jogging past an opossum that meandered onto the track the morning of May 23. The pony gave little consideration to it, yet the press jumped on the story; the creature was named "Good for nothing Possum", and somebody made a Twitter represent the animal. Delgado remarked, "I can reveal to you he adores this track, and I don't see him (having) any issue getting a mile and a half." On May 31, Espinoza touched base to give the yearling a short exercise known as a "breeze". Steed and racer were welcomed by an expansive unexpected of fans and press at about 6:30ÃÂ a.m., and ran a "sharp" half-mile () authoritatively timed at 47.69 seconds. A clocker for the "Day by day Racing Form" expressed, "He will be hard to beat. I believe we will have a Triple Crown victor."
