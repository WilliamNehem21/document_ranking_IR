At the finish of the 1920 season, Paschal's agreement was acquired by the Boston Red Sox, with a choice to keep him in the event that he met certain playing desires. He showed up in nine amusements for the Red Sox; his first diversion brought three hits against pitcher JosÃÂ© Acosta of the Washington Senators, and in all out he batted .357 with five runs batted in (RBI), however the Red Sox trusted he needed handling background and he came back to Charlotte. In August 1921, Paschal was sold to the Rochester Red Wings. Be that as it may, while sliding in an amusement on August 20, 1921, he endured a broken leg which sidelined him for the remainder of the period and voided the agreement with the Red Wings. He was hitting .317 at the season of the damage. In 1922, Paschal played in 142 amusements, hitting .326 with 18 homers and improved these figures in 1923, accomplishing 200 hits, 22 triples, and 26 grand slams in 141 diversions for a batting normal of .351, the fourth best in the group. Paschal started the 1924 season with the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association. He scored 136 runs, while batting .341 and taking 24 bases.
