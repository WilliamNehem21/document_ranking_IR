Boucher and McComas' unique objective for the new magazine was to impersonate the recipe that had made "Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine" effective: great reprints, alongside quality fiction that stayed away from the overabundances of the pulps. The underlying proposition required the magazine to incorporate dream, yet not sci-fi. Indeed, even before the dispatch, the editors discovered they were experiencing difficulty choosing precisely where the limit lay, so when in February 1949 Joseph Ferman, Spivak's general chief, requested that they add sf to the lineup as an approach to widen the readership, they were upbeat to go along. The main issue included just a single story that could be called sci-fi: Theodore Sturgeon's "The Hurkle is a Happy Beast"; it additionally included reprints from the smooth magazines by authors, for example, Richard Sale, and Guy Endore. The inside design was very unique in relation to the current dream and sf magazines: there were no inside representations, and the content was imprinted in a solitary section, rather than two as was common somewhere else. There was a book audit section, however no letters page. As per sf student of history Mike Ashley, this "set "F&SF" separated, giving it the air and expert of a predominant magazine". The logo structure and format were crafted by Mercury Press' specialty executive, George Salter, whose foundation was in book plan as opposed to in mash magazines. Salter stayed with the magazine until 1958. He was in charge of a significant number of the strange early covers; these offered approach to work by different specialists, yet his structure for "F&SF" stayed unblemished for a considerable length of time, and as Ashley would see it the consistency of appearance has been "one of the real selling focuses" of the magazine.
