In 1962 he appeared in Wendy Toye's comedy film "We Joined the Navy" before reuniting with Peter Sellers in "Only Two Can Play", Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel "That Uncertain Feeling" by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962â"Waltz of the Toreadors"âLe Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy "The Wrong Arm of the Law". Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that "I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year he appeared in a third Sellers film, "The Pink Panther", as a defence lawyer, and in the second and last of Tony Hancock's starring vehicles, "The Punch and Judy Man". Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.
