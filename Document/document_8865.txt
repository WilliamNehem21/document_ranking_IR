Roberts kept in touch with a few of the stone carvers, and discovered Aitken keen on making the $50 pieces. The Mint Director's provisional arrangements with Aitken for the huge gold coins and with Buffalo nickel planner James Earl Fraser for the honor decoration finished when Roberts surrendered in November to take a financial activity; McAdoo designated Dr. Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. Dewey and McAdoo did small with respect to the PanamaÃ¢ÂÂ Pacific coins until Congress started to pass the approving enactment toward the beginning of January 1915. When it had passed the two houses, and was anticipating Wilson's mark, Dewey orchestrated a gathering in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. The approving demonstration required the Mint to start conveying coins by the opening date of the reasonable, February 20, 1915, and in spite of the fact that this demonstrated illogical, the Mint still acted rapidly. McAdoo endorsed the decisions of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter hawk, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21. Every one of the four craftsmen were at that point at work, and Aitken reacted to the notice of his employing by submitting plans, which were like the genuine coins.
