Around then the Greek world was in strife inferable from the activities of the Catalan Company, a gathering of hired fighters, veterans of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, initially enlisted by the Byzantine Empire against the Turks in Asia Minor. Shared doubt and squabbles prompted war with the Byzantines; ousted from their base in Gallipoli in 1307, the Catalans battled and ravaged their route west through Thrace and Macedonia, until, squeezed by Byzantine troops under Chandrenos, they entered Thessaly in mid 1309. The last chief of the Company, Bernat de Rocafort, had imagined the rebuilding of the Kingdom of Thessalonica with himself at its head, and had even gone into arrangements for a marriage partnership with Guy II. Nothing happened to these arrangements, as Rocafort's undeniably tyrannical standard prompted his affidavit. From that point forward, the Company was led by an advisory group of four, helped by a twelve-part gathering. The landing of the Company's 8,000 men in Thessaly made concern its Greek ruler, John II Doukas. Having recently abused the passing of Guy II to disavow the overlordship of the Dukes of Athens, John swung to Byzantium and the other Greek realm, the Despotate of Epirus, for help. Vanquished by the Greeks, the Catalans consented to go calmly through Thessaly towards the Frankish realms of southern Greece.
