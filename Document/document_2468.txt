The Mysore court was home to a few eminent specialists ("vidwan") of the time. Veena Sheshanna, a court performer amid the standard of Maharaja Chamaraja X, is viewed as one of the best types of the veena. His accomplishments in traditional music won Mysore a chief spot in the specialty of instrumental Carnatic music and he was given the honorific "Vainika Shikhamani" by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. Mysore Vasudevacharya was a prominent artist and writer in Sanskrit and Telugu from Mysore. He holds the special refinement of being disparaged by four ages of Mysore rulers and rulers and for being court artist to three of them. H.L. Muthiah Bhagavatar was another performer writer who embellished the Mysore court. Considered a standout amongst the most critical arrangers of the post-Tyagaraja period, he is credited with around 400 organizations in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil under the pseudonym "Harikesha". Among musician, T. Chowdiah rose as a standout amongst the most cultivated types of the time. He is known to have aced the seven-stringed violin. Chowdiah was delegated court artist by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV in 1939 and got such titles as "Sangeeta Ratna" and "Sangeeta Kalanidhi". He is credited with pieces in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit under the nom de plume "Trimakuta".
