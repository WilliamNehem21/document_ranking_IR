Repeat Records, the Kinks' US name, formulated an expound, multi-leveled limited time crusade for "Arthur" in mid 1969. The most popular part of the program included a promotion bundle entitled "God Save The Kinks". The set highlighted different things, including a customer's manual for the band's collections, a sack of "grass" from the "Daviesland park", and a LP entitled "At that point, Now and Inbetween". The set was joined by a positive letter from Hal Halverstadt of inventive administrations at Warner/Reprise, some portion of which read, "... [We are led] to trust that The Kinks might not have had it by any means... The Kinks are to be bolstered, supported, cheered. Furthermore, spared." The battle was authoritatively propelled on 3 July, at a gathering between Ray Davies and Reprise administrators in Burbank, California. Repeat considered seeding false stories in the press to make a "prohibit" picture for the gathering as a feature of the battle, including pieces about cannabis ownership and salary tax avoidance. Beam called the thought "frantic", and the program was dropped. A few pieces, be that as it may, were utilized in the press unit for "Arthur's" discharge, with titles including "English Pop Group Arrested on Rape Rap".
