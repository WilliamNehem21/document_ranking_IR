The Mint struck more than 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, dramatically increasing its biggest yearly creation for a dollar coin. Regardless of an expanded mintage in 1972 to more than 170 million, and in spite of what "CoinAge" magazine named "close gallant measures with respect to the Mint", the piece did not circle. In a 1974 article for "CoinAge", numismatist Clement F. Bailey noticed, "the flow estimation of the coin has been nil". Numerous Eisenhower dollars were set aside as gifts by non-authorities. All things considered, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks cautioned that orders for 1971-S verification dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She credited the postponement to the vast open interest and to creation challenges which she demonstrated had been adjusted. In excess of 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in confirmation and uncirculated, with about 7 million in evidence. In May 1972, Treasury Secretary John Connally, affirming before a Senate board of trustees, depicted the benefits the Mint had made on the silver rendition of the Eisenhower dollar as "only unconscionable", with the normal benefit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increment as creation turned out to be increasingly proficient. Mint authorities felt that lessening the cost would outrage the individuals who had just acquired the pieces.
