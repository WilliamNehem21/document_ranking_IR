The climactic sword battle among Veerasimhan and Sasankan has been contrasted with the battle in the 1894 novel, "The Prisoner of Zenda". In 1976, American film student of history William K. Everson looked at the humorists in "Chandralekha" to Laurel and Hardy. In spite of the fact that Randor Guy considers the film's drum-move scene the first of its sort in Indian film, the 1947 film "Naam Iruvar" incorporates a scene when the lead on-screen character's more youthful sister moves on drums to the Tamil writer Subramania Bharati's "Kottu Murase"; French film history specialist Yves Thoraval composed that it "prefigured the move that "Chandralekha" made well known the following year." According to American film pundit Jonathan Rosenbaum, the film "has a place with a similar youth continuum" as Fritz Lang's 1959 movies "The Tiger of Eschnapur" and "The Indian Tomb" (which were set in India). In his 2009 book, "50 Indian Film Classics", film pundit M. K. Raghavendra composed that "Chandralekha" was built in a way which "empowers its account to consolidate components drawn from for all intents and purposes any sort of type." According to Guy, the setting of the tune "Naattiya Kuthirai" with Sundari Bai (counting her move and outfit) were propelled by the 1943 melodic film "Coney Island". Film researcher Uma Vangal composed that the film mirrors Vasan's "vision of a genuinely majority rule country, in view of equivalent rights for people" by depicting "a reality where people cooperate to set up a legitimate principle".
