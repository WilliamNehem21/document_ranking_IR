Concede was tapped to fill in as regimental officer, yet longed for a battle job; when at last permitted, he drove a mounted force charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma. He exhibited his equestrian capacity at the Battle of Monterrey via conveying a dispatch past sharpshooters while hanging off the side of his steed, keeping the creature among him and the adversary. Before leaving the city he halted at a house involved by injured Americans, giving them affirmation he would send for help. Polk, careful about Taylor's developing prominence, partitioned his powers, sending a few troops (counting Grant's unit) to shape another military under Major General Winfield Scott. Going via ocean, Scott's military arrived at Veracruz and progressed toward Mexico City. The military met the Mexican powers at the clashes of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City. For his fortitude at Molino del Rey, Grant was brevetted first lieutenant on September 30. At San CosmÃÂ©, men under Grant's heading hauled a dismantled howitzer into a congregation steeple, reassembled it, and assaulted adjacent Mexican troops. His courage and activity earned him his second brevet advancement to skipper. On September 14, 1847, Scott's military walked into the city; Mexico surrendered the huge domain, including California, to the U.S. on February 2, 1848.
