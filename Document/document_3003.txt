In the weeks paving the way to the November 3, 2003, Lansing City Council meeting, organizations that would be influenced by the venture raised protests to the extent of the task. One entrepreneur circled a request marked by 23 organizations soliciting the city to defer part from the general undertaking. The venture was nicknamed in the press "Lansing's 'Huge Dig'" in light of the fact that the sewer and utility work required unearthings in the avenues downtown. Some underlying resistance depended on a bogus supposition that the task would close the whole length of the avenues without a moment's delay, rather than in stages. MDOT's unique beautification venture was postponed five years, and the city's ordered sewer partition venture was optimized. This consolidated undertaking, got ready for 2004Ã¢ÂÂ 05, was intended to avoid uncovering similar lanes twice inside 10Ã¢ÂÂ 15 years. The vast majority of the entrepreneurs communicated worries that toward the finish of the task their organizations probably won't get by to appreciate the advantages of the downtown beautification. The city hall leader endeavored to get the city committee to delay a vote to stop the issuance of bonds for the city's part of the general undertaking. City chamber individuals condemned MDOT's "[inflexibility] about changing the designs to suit organizations." MDOT answered that the agreement offers were at that point out and that it was past the point where it is possible to change the extent of the undertaking.
