The scene likewise underscores another subject of the period: Buffy's reaction to powers that she can't battle. All through the season she experiences the considerably more dominant goddess Glory, however Joyce's passing abandons her inclination the most defenseless. In Joyce's passing there is no underhanded power to battle; she just bites the dust, and Buffy, with all her capacity, is not well prepared to get a handle on the tremendousness of her circumstance. In her stun, Buffy retreats to a virtuous mess, calling to her mom when she doesn't reply: "Mom?ÃÂ ... Mom?ÃÂ ... Mother?" Emma Caulfield was likewise provided the guidance for her voice to ascend to an untainted pitch toward the finish of her discourse to give a similar impact. As indicated by "Buffy" researcher Rhonda Wilcox, the topics of development and confronting grown-up obligations start with the flight of Buffy's sweetheart Riley Finn six scenes previously, and take shape in the first scene in which Buffy acknowledges she needn't bother with a beau to be satisfied. Toward the finish of that scene she is defied with Joyce's demise, which is completely investigated in "The Body". Confronting obligations turned into the real topic of the 6th season. One pundit expresses, "Intense as it seemed to be, murdering off Joyce was the sensible method to bring Buffy and Dawn nearer together, disjoin Buffy's last connections to girlhood and accentuate Buffy's powerlessness to acknowledge the cutoff points of her capacity, a common topic this season."
