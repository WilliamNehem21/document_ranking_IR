In the wake of leaving the D-League, Clinkscales marked in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-proficient American Basketball League (ABL), with no sign that he joined some other group since his residency with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a misfortune to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his partners) persevered through money related and local troubles. He lived with five different partners in a duplex house in Bay County, Florida. Due to budgetary issues, the class neglected to pay the playersÃ¢ÂÂwith Clinkscales exclusively accepting a check of $400Ã¢ÂÂand dropped a few amusements on its timetable. Later in the season, the players' duplex was evidently rented by Breeze's head mentor, Ty Fisher. A neighborhood agent recorded a common claim against Fisher to expel the players, and district sheriff appointees before long driven them out the house. While living in the zone, the players got help from a neighborhood occupant, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a Dollar Tree store. Gainer gave them nourishment and washed their garments. Regardless of their poor living conditions, the players neglected to get any guide by the group, with no contact or confirmation from class CEO Steve Haney.
