The free acid () and monohydrated calcium salt () forms of HMB have different pharmacokinetics. HMB-FA is more readily absorbed into the bloodstream and has a longer elimination half-life (3Â hours) relative to HMB-Ca (2.5Â hours). Tissue uptake and utilization of HMB-FA is higher than for HMB-Ca. The fraction of an ingested dose that is excreted in urine does not differ between the two forms.
After ingestion, is converted to following dissociation of the calcium moiety in the gut. When the HMB-Ca dosage form is ingested, the magnitude and time at which the peak plasma concentration of HMB occurs depends on the dose and concurrent food intake. Higher HMB-Ca doses increase the rate of absorption, resulting in a peak plasma HMB level (C) that is disproportionately greater than expected of a linear dose-response relationship and which occurs sooner relative to lower doses. Consumption of HMB-Ca with sugary substances slows the rate of HMB absorption, resulting in a lower peak plasma HMB level that occurs later.
HMB is eliminated via the kidneys, with roughly of an ingested dose being excreted unchanged in urine. The remaining of the dose is retained in tissues or excreted as HMB metabolites. The fraction of a given dose of HMB that is excreted unchanged in urine increases with the dose.
