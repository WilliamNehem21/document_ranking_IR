"Persoonia levis" was depicted and given the name "Linkia levis" by Antonio JosÃÂ© Cavanilles in 1798. His portrayal depended on plant material gathered by Luis NÃÂ©e in the region of Port Jackson (Sydney) in April 1793 amid the Malaspina Expedition. The species was put in the variety "Persoonia" by Karel Domin in 1921. The variety names "Linkia" and "Persoonia" had been instituted in 1798, yet the last was formally rationed. The species name is the Latin descriptor "", signifying "smooth", and alludes to the bare foliage. Christiaan Hendrik Persoon begat the name "Persoonia salicina" for it in his 1805 work "Summary Plantarum", and questioned whether Cavanilles' "Linkia levis" was in certainty "P.ÃÂ lanceolata". Robert Brown utilized Persoon's name in his 1810 work "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen", and resounded Persoon's contemplations on Cavanilles' unique name and example. In the 1995 "Vegetation of Australia" amendment of the variety, Peter John Weston audited the mounted material of "Linkia levis", and found that Cavanilles had mounted material from both "P.ÃÂ levis" and "P.ÃÂ lanceolata". He set one example of the three, which was unmistakably "P.ÃÂ levis", as the lectotype, which adjusted the material to the portrayal. Regular names incorporate expansive leaved geebung, willow geebung and smooth geebung. The term geebung is gotten from the Dharug language word "geebung".
