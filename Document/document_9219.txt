The skull of "Stegoceras" was generally triangular fit as a fiddle when seen from the side, with a moderately short nose. The frontal and parietal bones were thick and shaped a raised vault. The suture between these two components was pulverized (just faintly noticeable in certain examples), and they are all in all named the "frontoparietal". The frontoparietal arch was expansive and had a moderately smooth surface, with just the sides being rugose (wrinkled). It was limited above and between the orbita (eye attachments). The frontoparietal limited at the back, was wedged between the squamosal bones, and finished in a wretchedness over the at the back of the skull. The parietal and squamosal bones framed a thick rack over the occiput named the parietosquamosal rack, whose degree shifted between examples. The squamosal was huge, not part of the vault, and the back part was swollen. It was ornamented by unpredictably divided tubercles (or round outgrowths), and a line of hubs (handles) reached out along its upper edges, finishing in a pointed tubercle (or little horn) on each side at the back of the skull. An internal column of littler tubercles ran parallel with the bigger one. Aside from the upper surface of the arch, a significant part of the skull was ornamented with hubs, many masterminded in lines.
