"Kaga", like "Akagi", was finished with three superimposed flight decks, the main transporters to be structured so. The British bearers changed over from "substantial light cruisers", , and , each had two flight decks, however there is no proof that the Japanese duplicated the British model. All things considered, it was an instance of merged advancement to improve dispatch and recuperation cycle adaptability by permitting concurrent dispatch and recuperation of flying machine. "Kaga"s principle flight deck was long and wide, her center flight deck was just about long and begun before the extension, and her lower flight deck was roughly long.

At any rate the regularly expanding development in air ship execution, size and weight amid the 1930s implied that even the base flight deck was never again ready to oblige the take-off roll required for the new ages of flying machine being handled and it was plated over when the ship was modernized in the mid-1930s. "Kaga"s primary flight deck was totally level until a conning tower was included amid the modernization.
