Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1853 in February of that year. The demonstration brought down the silver load of the coins running from the half dime to half dollar by 6.9%, however the dollar stayed unaffected. The 1853 demonstration wiped out the act of storing silver bullion to be struck into coin, with the exception of into the dollar for which a begetting charge of .5% was forced. As indicated by the Senate report recorded with the bill which turned into the Coinage Act, these progressions were expected as a transitory catalyst, with the free coinage of silver to be reestablished when bullion costs ended up stable. Sources shift in their clarification with respect to why Congress exempted the dollar from the silver coinage redesign: numismatic history specialist R.W. Julian recommends that it was done because of its status as the "leader" of American coins. As indicated by Don Taxay in his history of the Mint and coinage, "the silver dollar, which it [the act] left unaltered to protect a bi-metallic cash, kept on being sent out and was infrequently utilized in business. Without acknowledging it, the nation had entered onto the best quality level." Julian concurred, taking note of that the demonstration initiated an accepted highest quality level in the United States, since it required silver coinage to be paid for in gold. The silver dollar kept on flowing pretty much nothing; amounts were sent west start in 1854 to fill in as "little change" in California. Silver costs stayed high into the 1860s, and minimal silver bullion was displayed for striking into dollars. To serve gatherers, singular examples were made accessible to general society by the Mint at an expense of $1.08.
