"Yet again, with Feeling" got far reaching basic recognition from media and faultfinders when it circulated, amid abroad syndication, and in memories of the best scenes of "Buffy" after the arrangement finished. Despite the fact that Salon.com essayist Stephanie Zacharek states "(t)he melodies were just half-essential, best case scenario, and the singing capacity of the show's normal cast went just from the genuinely great to the not very good", she likewise attests that it works "flawlessly", paces itself smoothly, and is "smart and influencing". Zacharek's apathetic appraisals of the music and cast's singing capacities were not shared by different journalists. Debi Enker in Australia's "The Age" expresses, "Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Tara (Amber Benson) are awesome, Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) battle valiantly, and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) scarcely sings a note". Tony Johnston in "The Sunday Herald Sun" composes that Gellar "battles on a portion of her higher notes, yet her move schedules are wonderful, Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn uncovers arousing move moves path past her delicate years, and James Marsters' Spike brings out a kind of Billy Idol shout to camouflage his absence of vocal proficiencyÃÂ [...] The remainder of the cast blend and match like instant Broadway troupers." Johnston checks "I'll Never Tell" as one of the scene's "champion minutes". Connie Ogle in "The Miami Herald" calls the melodies "preferable and unquestionably progressively shrewd over the greater part of the ones you'll hear on Broadway nowadays".
