As opposed to laud for "Iridion"s illustrations, its real interactivity was by and large panned. IGN's Craig Harris composed that "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will awe with every one of its belongings, yet that is about it." He noticed that the player is constrained to shooting and avoiding, making ongoing interaction monotonous. Harris and Concepcion griped that on a little screen separations are difficult to pass judgment; the player's ship is hit by slugs that have all the earmarks of being out yonder. Buddy and "Amusement Informer"s Jay Fitzloff condemned the specialty arrangement, as the player's view was regularly clouded by their very own ship. Lopez additionally gave "Iridion" low stamps, cautioning that "after the underlying 'goodness' wears off, you'll be screwed over thanks to a vacant encounter." "Edge" saw that "Iridion" is "a sweet number that will engage, if just for a week or somewhere in the vicinity". Allgame's Skyler Miller said "Iridion 3D" was just an innovation demo and granted it two out of five stars. An increasingly positive survey originated from GamePro, whose analyst summed up his experience by composing that "in case you're searching for some exemplary shooter activity on your new GBA, "Iridion 3D" will possess all the necessary qualities pleasantly without overwhelming you."
