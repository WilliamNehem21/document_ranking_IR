Hallie Rubenhold's 2005 book "The Covent Garden Ladies" sets out her translation of the story behind "Harris' List". She asserts that John HarrisonÃ¢ÂÂalso called Jack Harris, a sagacious specialist and pimp who worked at the Shakespear's Head Tavern in Covent GardenÃ¢ÂÂwas the rundown's originator. Conceived maybe around 1720Ã¢ÂÂ 1730, Harris evidently had master learning of whores working in Covent Garden and past, just as access to leased rooms and premises for his customers' utilization. He tracked the ladies he pimped and the properties he approached, perhaps as a little record or scratch pad. Derrick, having recently wrote "The Memoirs of the Shakespear's Head", and perhaps at the same time its partner piece, "The Memoirs of the Bedford Coffee House", was likely acquainted with the Shakespear's Head. The previous book subtleties "Jack, a waiterÃÂ ... who manages the Venereal Pleasures of this Dome", and its creator likely considered Harris as he continued on ahead. Which of the two men initially thought to create "Harris' List" is obscure, yet likely for an erratic installment Harris enabled his name to be connected to it. With his nitty gritty information of Covent Garden, and with assistance from different partners, Derrick was consequently ready to compose the primary version of "Harris' List" in 1757. As a hopeful creator and social climber he favored not to relate himself freely with such sketchy material, and his name along these lines does not show up on any releases.
