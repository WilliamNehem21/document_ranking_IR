In the long run, Johnston's staff individuals saw him drooping in his seat. One of them, Tennessee representative Isham Harris, inquired as to whether he was injured, and the general answered "Indeed, and I dread genuinely." Earlier in the fight, Johnston had sent his own specialist to think about the injured Confederate troops and Yankee detainees, and there was no medicinal staff at his present area. An assistant helped him off his pony and laid him down under a tree, at that point went to get his specialist, however did not have any significant bearing a tourniquet to Johnston's injured leg. Before a specialist could be discovered, Johnston seeped to death from a torn popliteal vein that made inner draining and blood gather unnoticed in his riding boot. Jefferson Davis believed Johnston to be the best broad they had (this was two months before Robert E. Lee developed as the overwhelming Confederate general). Johnston was the most noteworthy positioning officer from either side to be murdered in battle amid the Civil War.

Beauregard requested Johnston's body covered for mystery to abstain from bringing down resolve and continued assaults against the Hornet's Nest. This was likely a strategic blunder, on the grounds that the Union flanks were gradually dismantling back to frame a half circle line around Pittsburg Landing. In the event that Beauregard had concentrated his powers against the flanks, he may have crushed the Union armed force at the arrival, and afterward diminished the Hornet's Nest position at his recreation.
