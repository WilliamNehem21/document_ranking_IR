Van Eyck gives Mary three jobs: Mother of Christ, the embodiment of the "Ecclesia Triumphans" and Queen of Heaven, the last evident from her gem studded crown. The artistic creation's close smaller than usual size appears differently in relation to Mary's unreasonably expansive stature contrasted and her setting. She physically commands the basilica; her head is practically level with the roughly sixty feet high exhibition. This bending of scale is found in various other van Eyck's Madonna sketches, where the curves of the generally gothic inside don't permit headroom for the virgin. PÃÂ¤cht depicts the inside as a "position of royalty room", which envelopes her as though a "conveying case". Her momentous stature mirrors a convention coming to back to an Italo-Byzantine sort Ã¢ÂÂ maybe best known through Giotto's "Ognissanti Madonna" (c. 1310) Ã¢ÂÂ and accentuates her relationship with the church building itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as "the Madonna in a congregation", however rather as similitude, exhibiting Mary "as the Church". This thought her size speaks to her epitome as the congregation was first proposed by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Craftsmanship antiquarians in the nineteenth century, who thought the work was executed right off the bat in van Eyck's profession, credited her scale as the slip-up of a moderately youthful painter.
