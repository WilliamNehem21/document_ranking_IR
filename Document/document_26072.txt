"Tiger" remained in service with the Royal Navy after the Armistice with Germany and she had a flying-off platform added on 'B' turret's roof in 1919. The ship collided with the battleship in late 1920 while assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. "Tiger" survived the culling of older capital ships following the Washington Naval Treaty, although she was placed in on 22 August 1921. The ship was refitted in March 1922 with a rangefinder fitted on 'X' turret, her original pair of 3-inch AA guns replaced by four guns, and the flying-off platform on 'Q' turret was removed. On 14 February 1924, "Tiger" was recommissioned and became a seagoing training ship, a role she served in throughout the 1920s. Her last major period of activity came in 1929, when went into dockyard hands for refit. While "Hood" was out of commission, "Tiger" returned to active service to keep the Royal Navy's three-ship Battlecruiser Squadron (normally made up of "Hood" plus the smaller and ) up to strength. Although by the 1930s "Tiger" was still in reasonable condition, the decision was taken to discard her following the London Naval Conference of 1930 as part of an overall reduction in world battleship fleets. Under the command of Captain Kenneth Dewar from 1928 to 1929, her final commander was Arthur Bedford, and she remained in service with the fleet until "Hood" came out of refit in early 1931, at which time she was taken out of commission in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty.
