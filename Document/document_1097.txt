Bak noted, however, that Stengel was a "horrendous and innovative" seat racer, preliminaries the other group with whatever may lose their execution. Stengel had poor relations with Robinson; each loathed the other and was a vocal faultfinder. One generally cited Stengel remark was about catcher Elston Howard, who turned into the principal dark Yankee in 1955, eight years after Robinson had broken the shading obstruction, "they at long last get me a nigger, I get the special case who can't run". Howard, however, denied that Stengel had yelled racial designations at the Dodgers, and said "I never felt any preference around Casey". Al Jackson, a dark pitcher with the Mets under Stengel, agreed, "He never treated me with anything besides regard". As indicated by Bill Bishop in his record of Stengel, "Casey used language that would positively be viewed as hostile today, however was very normal vernacular in the fifties. He was unrestrained in his recognition of dark players like Satchel Paige, Larry Doby and Howard". Aware of evolving times, Stengel was progressively cautious in his selection of words while with the Mets.
