"Meet Kevin Johnson" had an offer of good surveys, with commentators acclaiming the character advancement and enthusiastic battles of Michael. Alan Sepinwall of "The Star-Ledger" discovered this "center part" to be "very great" with "a fine execution from Mr. Perrineau". Sepinwall composed that Michael's "battle to manage the blame from his Faustian deal to spare Walt was another moving case of how the authors this season are truly endeavoring to expand on the enthusiastic effect of everything that is occurred previously." The "San Francisco Chronicle"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tim Goodman reverberated this commendation and alluded to "Gay Tom" as "an interesting and amusing turn". Cynthia Littleton of "Assortment" composed that "Perrineau plays it without flaw more often than notÃ¢ÂÂno hysterics or landscape biting, only a man attempting to make the best decision, more often than not." In a four-out-of-five-star survey, Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones commended the absence of intrusion to the flashback and remarked that "[Michael's] self-destructive situation was very much passed on and there were a lot of stuns and excites en route". Dan Compora of SyFy Portal delighted in observing dead characters in flashbacks and lauded Perrineau's execution and character's story, while reprimanding the underutilization of the remainder of the principle cast. In a general positive survey for the scene, "The Huffington Post's" Jay Glatfelter had blended affections for the disclosure of Tom's sexual introduction, composing that "It appeared somewhat strangely put, sort of like 'How about we make one of our characters gay only for its hell' yet at the same time it's cool that the show has a superbly typical Ã¢ÂÂ¦ not super gay character."
