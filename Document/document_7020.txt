The prompt issue with McClellan's war technique was that he was persuaded the Confederates were prepared to assault him with overpowering numbers. On August 8, trusting that the Confederacy had more than 100,000 troops confronting him (as opposed to the 35,000 they had really conveyed at Bull Run half a month sooner), he announced a highly sensitive situation in the capital. By August 19, he assessed 150,000 dissident fighters on his front. McClellan's resulting efforts were firmly affected by the exaggerated foe quality evaluations of his mystery administration boss, investigator Allan Pinkerton, yet in August 1861, these appraisals were completely McClellan's own. The outcome was a dimension of outrageous alert that sapped the activity of McClellan's military and frightened the administration. Student of history and biographer Stephen W. Singes saw that McClellan's activities would have been "basically stable" for a leader who was as dwarfed as McClellan suspected he seemed to be, yet McClellan in actuality seldom had not exactly a two-to-one preferred standpoint over the armed forces that restricted him in 1861 and 1862. That fall, for instance, Confederate powers ran from 35,000 to 60,000, though the Army of the Potomac in September numbered 122,000 men; toward the beginning of December 170,000; by year end, 192,000.
