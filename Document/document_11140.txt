Upon its discharge, "Pru" got positive input from music faultfinders. Ed Hogan applauded Pru's experimentation with melodic kinds. In talking about its numerous impacts, Colin Ross composed that the collection never sounded uneven or incoherent. He lauded the vocalist for imparting a scope of feelings, by turns appearing to be "honest, confident, unsure, elated and helpless", adulating specifically the collection's instrumentation and verses. A "Bulletin" essayist portrayed "Pru" as "sparkl[ing] with beautifully imaged melodies about affection won, lost and foreseen". "USA Today's" Steve Jones commended the entertainer for the "wonderful profundity in her poetics about delight and catastrophe". Jones composed that the collection showed that Pru had a reasonable feeling of what she needed to accomplish for her profession and sound. "Ebony"s Lynn Norment portrayed her as having a "rich, natural voice and melodious ability", reacting decidedly to the craftsman's persuasions from sacred writing and verse. An author for "Sister 2 Sister" complimented Pru for her capacity to pass on feeling to the audience, and recognized "Prescience of a Flower" as their most loved track from the collection. The "Houston Press"' Craig D. Lindsey applauded Pru's music and live exhibitions, portraying her tunes as "heartfelt, gritty and natural" and the direct opposite to music, for example, Destiny's Child's 1999 single "Bills, Bills, Bills". The collection was designated "[a]rtfulÃÂ ... stunningÃÂ ... attractive" by a commentator from "Individuals".
