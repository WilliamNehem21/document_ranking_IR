The amusement's advancement group needed to make a diversion including Shadow to determine plot puzzles that started with the character's presentation in "Sonic Adventure 2". The group felt that Shadow's structureÃ¢ÂÂpropelled by movies, for example, "Black market", "Constantine", and the "Eliminator" arrangementÃ¢ÂÂwould make the story darker and take into consideration components, for example, vehicles and weapons, generally thought to be unseemly for a "Sonic" amusement. Sonic Team's Yuji Naka expressed in a meeting with GameSpy that he needed to utilize Shadow as the amusement's primary character because of his ubiquity among fans and being the best fit for a "weapon activity" diversion. The amusement includes a few CG-enlivened cutscenes created by Blur Studio. The amusement likewise contains obscenities, including examples of "damn" and "damnation" spoken by Shadow and different characters, for example, Espio, the G.U.N. Leader, Knuckles, and Sonic. Foulness and the utilization of weapons, the two firsts for the "Sonic" arrangement, created pre-discharge discussion. The ESRB doled out the diversion a rating of E10+ for "dream savagery" and "gentle language".
