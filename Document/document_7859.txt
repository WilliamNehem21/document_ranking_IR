The property of juncture is characterized as pursues. Initial, a point, line or circle is thought to be digression to itself; thus, if a given circle is now digression to the next two given articles, it is considered an answer for Apollonius' concern. Two particular geometrical items are said to "meet" on the off chance that they share a point for all intents and purpose. By definition, a point is digression to a circle or a line in the event that it crosses them, that is, on the off chance that it lies on them; in this way, two particular focuses can't be digression. On the off chance that the edge between lines or circles at a convergence point is zero, they are said to be "digression"; the crossing point is known as a "digression point" or a "point of juncture". (Tangent" gets from the Latin present participle, "tangens", signifying "contacting".) by and by, two unmistakable circles are digression in the event that they meet at just a single point; on the off chance that they cross at zero or two, they are not digression. Similar remains constant for a line and a circle. Two unmistakable lines can't be digression in the plane, albeit two parallel lines can be considered as digression at a point at limitlessness in inversive geometry (see underneath).
