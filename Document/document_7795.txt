Sherman presented the bill on April 28, 1870, and it was alluded to the Senate Finance Committee, of which he was executive. He didn't look for its entry in that session of Congress, as officials were occupied with other monetary enactment. The bill pulled in beside no paper consideration all through the time of just about three years it was under thought, however fiscal specialists and others watched its encouraging intently. On January 9, 1871, Sherman conveyed the bill to the Senate floor for discussion. That it nullified the silver dollar, and therefore bimetallism, was not talked about, as representatives concentrated on the exclusion of the coinage charge (the expense for the Mint's administrations in changing over bullion to cash). This was of significance to the SenateÃ¢ÂÂparticularly individuals from the Far WestÃ¢ÂÂsince it influenced what mining organizations and refiners (a vital monetary intrigue) could get for their item. Sherman offered a change to hold the coinage charge, however it was assaulted by Western representatives as an out of line charge on excavators and refiners of gold, and the revision was vanquished, 26Ã¢ÂÂ 23. On January 10, the bill passed the Senate, 36Ã¢ÂÂ 14, with Sherman casting a ballot against his very own bill. It was then sent to the House of Representatives and alluded to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures from which it was quickly delivered on February 25 by Pennsylvania's William D. Kelley, the executive, before being recommitted to board. The bill was not considered by the House amid the rest of the 41st Congress, which terminated on March 3, 1871, and the Senate-passed bill kicked the bucket with it.
