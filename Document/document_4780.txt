The AESC kept on scorning the administration. Playford pushed the utilization of dark colored coal from the South Australian Leigh Creek mine to evade supply intricacies, and even made into law a bill empowering its utilization. He likewise supported the improvement of the town and the development of the mine, which had been torpid for a very long while, to facilitate the state's reliance on imported coal. Much state and government cash was put resources into the plan, the town foundation was manufactured, and the generation began in February 1944. Right away a while later, the AESC reacted by purchasing new boilers which would just have the capacity to the more profitable dark coal. With more clashes resulting, and even with the organization gradually yielding, Playford did not stop his battle. A Royal Commission in March 1945 was designated to find out an answer between the two gatherings, and exhibited its report in August with a suggestion that the AESC be nationalized. A couple of months after the fact, Playford's position got a lift when substantial strikes in New South Wales constrained shutdowns in South Australia that saw a large number of workers out of work. By then at the leader of the main moderate government in the country, when Playford mentioned province assets to aid the nationalization of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley reacted with happiness and energy. On 11 October, he displayed a bill to Parliament to nationalize the AESC and make the Electricity Trust of South Australia.
