Burrowing started in February 1972 and was finished before the finish of 1974. In 1977, amid development of the stations, the name of the line was changed to the Jubilee line, to check the Queen's Silver Jubilee that year. A development shaft in Hays Mews north of the station was utilized for an electrical substation and ventilation shaft. At Green Park, the ticket lobby was expanded somewhat to give space to lifts for the new line which interface with a middle of the road concourse giving exchange between the Jubilee and Victoria lines. A second trip of elevators slips to the Jubilee line stages, which are beneath road level, the most profound of the three sets. Trade between the Jubilee and Piccadilly lines was through the ticket lobby. Stage dividers were tiled in a dark red with dark leaf designs by June Fraser. Preliminary running of trains started in August 1978 and the Jubilee line opened on 1 May the following year. The line had been authoritatively opened by Prince Charles the earlier day, beginning with a train venture from Green Park to Charing Cross. In 1993, to ease blockage, a third lift was introduced in the lower trip to supplant a fixed staircase.
