"Pallas" returned on 12 May with and a 16-gun ship-sloop, . Allemande despatched two large frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, "Pallas" and "Kingfisher" came back and Allemande again ordered "Minerve", "Lynx", "Sylphe", and "Palinure" to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, and , cleared for action and ready to go. Collett ordered his ships to set all sail in the hope of catching "Pallas" before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his topsails and slowing down. Once in range, "Pallas" opened fire, bringing down the topsail yard of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby shoals with "Minerve" in pursuit. By 13:00 "Minerve" had come up on the leeward side of "Pallas", whereupon "Pallas" fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. Just at that moment, "Minerve" hit a sandbank and "Pallas" crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough to jolt "Pallas"s guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but "Pallas"s shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, "Armide" and "Infatigable", drawing near. The crew of "Kingfisher" sailed in to take "Pallas" in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, jib-boom, spritsail, stunsail, and main topsail yards. "Minerve" was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard "Minerve", with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard "Pallas".
