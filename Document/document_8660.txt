The epic presented a few characters who were absent in the amusement, or some other diversion. The goddesses Demeter and Hestia both showed up only preceding Kratos joining the Spartans in Rhodes where Kratos caught them talking about their disappointment of the unending war in Greece. Iris, the Goddess of the Rainbow and an infrequent delegate, was another new character and had an increasingly generous job. Atropos reached Iris and had her lie to Zeus about Kratos on a few occurrences, and was the reason for doubt among the Olympians because of her gossip spreading and misleading statements. She in the end supplanted Hermes as the Messenger of the Gods. She likewise disclosed to Zeus that he would need to designate another God of War. Zeus contemplated about making Hercules the new God of War. Athena wished Kratos to be returned as the God of War, thinking thusly, it would stop the disarray and disagreement between the divine beings. Hermes had thought to recommend Perseus as the new God of War and skilled him his imperceptibility head protector. Hermes in the end recaptured his situation as the Messenger of the Gods when he at last persuaded Zeus that Iris had been deceiving him about Kratos. Iris was in this way expelled from Olympus, just to show up at dawn and nightfall, and when it down-poured.
