To decide the reason for death, the coroner, Gavin Thurston, requested a posthumous examination on Hendrix's body, which was performed on September 21, by Professor Robert Donald Teare, a legal pathologist. Teare announced that Hendrix was "very much fed and strong", and he recognized a quarter-inch scar to Hendrix's left side wrist. He said that there were "no stigmata of [intravenous] illicit drug use. When these imprints are there [in the skin], they never leave. For this situation, there were no imprints by any means." Although Teare saw that the correct side of Hendrix's heart was generally enlarged, he found no proof of valvular coronary illness. He found a mostly fell left lung and 400 ml of liquid in Hendrix's chest. The two lungs were clogged, and upchuck was found in the littler bronchi. As per Teare, Hendrix's stomach "contained a medium-sized mostly processed feast in which rice could be recognized." Teare inferred that Hendrix's kidneys were sound, and his liver was blocked. His "bladder was half loaded with clear pee." He expressed that Hendrix's blood liquor content was 100ÃÂ mg per 100 ml, "enough to fall flat a breathalyzer testÃÂ ... what could be compared to around four pints of brew." Teare announced that examination of Hendrix's blood "uncovered a blend of barbiturates predictable with those from Vesparax", and he assessed that sedate fixations meant ingestion of 1.8 grams of barbiturate, 20ÃÂ mg of amphetamine, and 20ÃÂ mg of cannabis. Teare gave the reason for death as: "Inward breath of regurgitation because of barbiturate inebriation." He didn't endeavor to decide Hendrix's season of death.
