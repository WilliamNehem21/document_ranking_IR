In the elimination rounds of the 1993 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament against Kentucky, Howard contributed on offense and kept Jamal Mashburn under tight restraints protectively; Mashburn did not make a field objective in the last 12:36 of guideline. Sportswriter Jay Mariotti composed that Howard had done "a stupendous protective occupation" in guarding Mashburn. The 31Ã¢ÂÂ 4 Wolverines were coordinated facing the 33Ã¢ÂÂ 4 North Carolina Tar Heels in the title diversion; both Fisher and North Carolina head mentor Dean Smith were looking for their second national title. Amid the title diversion Howard got his second close to home foul with 9ÃÂ minutes 42ÃÂ seconds staying in the primary half and was before long substituted out as the whole group managed an aggregation of fouls. The diversion would be associated with a late specialized foul against Webber for endeavoring to consider a period out when the Wolverines had none left; this prompted a Tar Heels triumph. Throughout the season, Howard arrived at the midpoint of 7.4ÃÂ rebounds. After the season, Webber and Howard were welcome to go for the United States national b-ball crew that would contend at the 1993 World University Games and Under-22 World Championships. Howard did not make the group.
