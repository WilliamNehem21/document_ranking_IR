The species' range is currently known to stretch out over the mountain scopes of eastern Madagascar from the Tsaratanana Massif south to Andohahela, at above ocean level. It happens in montane timberland, yet in addition in corrupted prairie, where it is among the main species to return after flames. At Ankaratra, where the species was recorded in 1929, it happened in such field, where the nesomyine "Brachyuromys betsileoensis" was likewise found. The creature was again recorded at Ankaratra in 1996, this time in an intensely bothered woodland, where it happened with "Eliurus minor" and the presented dark rodent ("rattus"). At Andringitra, the creature was recorded in high montane woodland together with six different nesomyinesÃ¢ÂÂ"Brachyuromys ramirohitra", "Eliurus minor", "Eliurus tanala", "Eliurus webbi", "Gymnuromys roberti", and "Nesomys rufus"Ã¢ÂÂ just as the dark rodent. At Andohahela, "Monticolomys" was found at an elevation of in sclerophyllous timberland. Its conveyance relates to the High Mountain Domain, a locale characterized based on plant circulations. This area is presently spasmodic, yet the High Mountain Domain living space was ceaseless from mountain to mountain as of late as the early Holocene. Subfossil remains have been found in Mahajanga Province (northwestern Madagascar). Malagasy mountain mouse is morphologically uniform over its wide dispersion.
