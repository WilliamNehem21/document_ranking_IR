"Oxalaia" is one of three spinosaurids discovered in Brazil, the other two being "Irritator" and its possible synonym "Angaturama", both of which were also initially known from partial skulls. They were discovered in the Romualdo Formation of the Santana Group, part of the Araripe Basin. Microfossils date this formation to the Albian, around nine to six million years before "Oxalaia". The fossil record of spinosaurids is poor compared to those of other theropod groups; very few body fossils are known and most genera have been erected from isolated elements such as vertebra or teeth. The holotype specimen of "Oxalaia quilombensis", designated MN 6117-V, was found "in situ" (at its original place of deposition) with part of the left side embedded in the rock matrix; it consists of the fused praemaxillae (frontmost snout bones) from a large individual. An isolated and incomplete left (main upper jaw bone) fragment (MNÂ 6119-V) was referred to "Oxalaia" because it showed the same general traits occurring in spinosaurids, the maxilla was discovered on the rock surface, having possibly moved from its original location after erosion. Both bone fragments were found on Cajual Island, MaranhÃ£o, in the Northeast Region of Brazil, and were housed at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. In 2018, a fire engulfed the palace housing the museum, possibly destroying "Oxalaia"s specimens, along with various other fossils found in Brazil. Besides the partial skull bones, numerous spinosaurid teeth had earlier been reported from the Laje do Coringa site.
