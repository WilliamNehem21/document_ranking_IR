Rindt's aversion seemed defended when both he and Hill endured rapid accidents at the Spanish Grand Prix at MontjuÃÂ¯c. In the two cases, the suspension mounted wings on the vehicles severed, causing mishaps that could have murdered either driver. The impact of the disappointment lifted Rindt's vehicle off the track and into the obstructions, where it crashed into the stationary vehicle of Hill, whose mishap happened at a similar spot. In spite of the fact that Rindt just endured a broken nose, one marshal lost an eye and another had his foot broken. Rindt was incensed with Lotus' group proprietor, Colin Chapman, over the disappointment; he told a columnist after the mishap: "I place the fault on him [Chapman] and which is all well and good, since he ought to have determined that the wing would break." In a meeting on Austrian TV daily later, he stated: "These wings are madness ["ein Wahnsinn"] in my eyes and ought not be permitted on dashing autos. [...] But to get any intelligence into Colin Chapman's head is unimaginable." Asked whether he had lost trust in Lotus after the mishap, he answered: "I never had any trust in Lotus", proceeding to portray his association with the group as "absolutely business". His mishap left him sidelined for the Monaco Grand Prix, a race that Hill won.
