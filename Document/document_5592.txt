The King George VI dry dock was formally opened by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Shenton Thomas, on 14 February 1938. Two squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm gave a flypast. The 42 vessels in participation included three US Navy cruisers. The nearness of this armada allowed a chance to direct a progression of maritime, air and military activities. The plane carrying warship had the capacity to cruise undetected to inside of Singapore and dispatch a progression of amazement strikes on the RAF runways. The neighborhood air leader, Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Tedder, was incredibly humiliated. The nearby land leader, Major-General Sir William Dobbie, was no less baffled by the execution of the counter flying machine protections. Reports suggested the establishment of radar on the island, yet this was not done until 1941. The maritime barriers worked better, however an arrival party from was as yet ready to catch the Raffles Hotel. What most concerned Dobbie and Tedder was the likelihood of the armada being circumvent totally by an overland intrusion of Malaya from Thailand. Dobbie led an activity in southern Malaya which exhibited that the wilderness was a long way from obstructed. The Chiefs of Staff Committee presumed that the Japanese would in all likelihood arrive on the east bank of Malaya and advance on Singapore from the north.
