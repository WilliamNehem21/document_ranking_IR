In 2016, Chopra featured as a cop in Prakash Jha's social dramatization "Jai Gangaajal". Composing for "The Hindu", Namrata Joshi believed that she "looks disagreeable, unengaged and uninvolved with the goings on through a large portion of the film". It didn't perform well economically. She next delivered the Marathi parody show "Ventilator" under her generation organization Purple Pebble Pictures, which proceeded to win three honors at the 64th National Film Awards. The next year, Chopra made her Hollywood cutting edge film debut by playing the rival Victoria Leeds in Seth Gordon's activity parody "Baywatch" inverse Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. The element got ominous audits. Scott Mendelson of "Forbes" stated "Chopra has a fabulous time as the baddie, yet she remains out of sight until the finish of the motion picture and actually just gets one major scene toward the finish of the image." "Baywatch" was not a business accomplishment in North America but rather the film performed better in the abroad markets. The 2018 Sundance Film Festival denoted the arrival of Chopra's next American film, "A Kid Like Jake", a dramatization about sex change, featuring Jim Parsons and Claire Danes. Amy Nicholson of "Assortment" recognized her "beguiling nearness" however believed that her job increased the value of the film. After a year, Chopra had another supporting part, as a yoga envoy, in Todd Strauss-Schulson's satire "Isn't It Romantic", which featured Rebel Wilson ahead of the pack job. Dana Schwartz of "Excitement Weekly" believed her to be "superbly thrown" yet Benjamin Lee of "The Guardian" suspected that she was "not exactly sufficiently intriguing".
