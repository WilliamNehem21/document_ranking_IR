Michael utilized the break to ship in extra fortifications from Asia Minor and fix the dividers of Blachernae. At the point when Thomas returned in spring, he chose to concentrate his assault on the Blachernae division. Prior to the hostile, Michael himself rose the dividers and tended to Thomas' troops, admonishing them to surrender their administrator and promising reprieve in the event that they would desert. Thomas' military saw the request as an indication of shortcoming, and progressed unhesitatingly to start the ambush, yet as they neared the divider, the protectors opened the entryways and assaulted. The abrupt assault drove back Thomas' military; in the meantime, the Imperial Fleet vanquished Thomas' ships, whose teams broke and fled to the shore in frenzy. This thrashing reduced Thomas' maritime quality, and in spite of the fact that he kept barring the capital via land, the misfortune discouraged his supporters, who started deserting. Gregory Pterotos, whose family was in Michael's grasp, made plans to betray Thomas, trailed by a little band of men faithful to him. He withdrew the dissident camp, traveled west, and sent a priest to educate Michael of his abandonment, however the priest neglected to go around the bar and achieve the capital. After learning of this absconding, Thomas responded rapidly: with a select separation, he pursued Gregory, crushed his troops and murdered the miscreant.
