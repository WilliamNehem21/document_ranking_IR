Lady Castle had been surrendered before the finish of the first century, when "Durnovaria" (Dorchester) rose to noticeable quality as the "civitas", or provincial capital, of the Durotriges, a Celtic clan whose domain was in southwest England. In any case, in July 2015 archeologists from Bournemouth University found the remaining parts of the Iron Age settlement of Duropolis and trust that the relinquishment of the post might be associated with the new site. As indicated by the old geographer Ptolemy, writing in the second centuryÃÂ AD, "Dunium" was the fundamental settlement of the Durotriges. In spite of the fact that "Dunium" has for some time been thought to allude to Maiden Castle, Hod Hill and Hengistbury have been recognized as two other conceivable locales for "Dunium". "Dunium" may have gotten from British "duno-" which signified "a stronghold". At some point after 367, a Romano-Celtic sanctuary was worked at Maiden Castle in the eastern portion of the slope post. The date was derived from a crowd of coins found underneath a mosaic floor in the sanctuary. A focal room, estimating square, was encompassed by a path, like numerous Romano-Celtic sanctuaries found in the south of England. Adjacent were two different structures: a rectangular structure with two rooms that may have been a house for a cleric, and a round structure that may have been a place of worship. In the meantime as the sanctuary was fabricated, the fortress' eastern entryway was restored; there was potentially another holy place inside the door.
