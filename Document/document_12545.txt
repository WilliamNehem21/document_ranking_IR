Gibbes sold his interests in New Guinea in 1972. He burned through the greater part of the rest of the decade in the Mediterranean, on board his sailboat "Billabong". In his 60s, he cruised "Billabong" from England to Australia without anyone else's input, conquering substantial oceans and Malaysian privateers en route. By 1979 he was living in Sydney and had started fabricating his very own twin-engined plane, which he in the long run got off the ground in 1990. In 1994, Gibbes distributed his collection of memoirs, "You Live But Once". He kept on flying until compelled to surrender his common flight permit at 85 years old. In 2002, he showed up in a scene of the TV arrangement "Australian Story" committed to Nicky Barr. Gibbes was granted the Medal of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2004 for "administration to avionics and to the travel industry, especially in Papua New Guinea". He kicked the bucket of a stroke at Mona Vale Hospital in Sydney on 11ÃÂ April 2007, matured 90, and was made due by his significant other and two little girls. His burial service at St Thomas' Church, North Sydney, was gone to by 350 grievers, including the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Geoff Shepherd, and 40 individuals from No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron driven by the boss. A Spitfire in the "Dim Nurse" attire of one of Gibbes' World WarÃÂ II flying machine overflew the congregation, alongside four F/A-18 Hornet stream warriors from No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron in a "missing man" development.
