On 18 July 1944, "ReichsfÃÂ¼hrer"- SS Heinrich Himmler requested that the brigade be extended to divisional size, despite the fact that the approved quality was just 6,600 troops. The 24th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "KarstjÃÂ¤ger" was to be built up by the Higher SS and Police Leader () for the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, SS-"GruppenfÃÂ¼hrer" (Major General) Odilo Globocnik. The name "KarstjÃÂ¤ger" was gotten from a mix of "Karst", signifying the area of tasks, and "JÃÂ¤ger", the German military term for light infantry. The division was to comprise of two "GebirgsjÃÂ¤ger" (mountain infantry) regiments, with an ordnance regiment, observation, "PanzerjÃÂ¤ger" (hostile to tank) and pioneer brigades, just as substitution and supply troops. The division was provided with 14 caught Italian Carro Armato P 40 tanks, yet these demonstrated inconsistent, with just half being workable at any one time. In August 1944, the under-quality division took an interest in Operation "Dachstein" under the direction of the 188th Mountain Division. Among August and November 1944, the division kept performing hostile to divided obligations in a similar locale, however its quality had just achieved 3,000, not exactly 50% of its approved foundation. It demonstrated difficult to select adequate troops for the division, and in December 1944 the division was minimized to a unit.
