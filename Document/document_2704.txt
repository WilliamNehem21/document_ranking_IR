The two Jordan autos crashed on lapÃÂ 15. Rubens Barrichello spun in the last chicane when he endeavored to brake later than his partner Irvine. Barrichello hit a stopping point, which harmed his vehicle's back wing and made him resign from the race. Irvine was engaged with another impact at the chicane on lapÃÂ 20 when Frentzen hit him from behind. Irvine proceeded without harm, however Frentzen needed to pit for another front wing. At the front, Alesi was lapping quicker than Schumacher, despite the fact that Schumacher was on dry tires. Alesi was just sixÃÂ seconds behind Schumacher when his Ferrari 412T2 endured an evident differential disappointment on lapÃÂ 25. It was later found that the issue was a driveshaft disappointment, potentially because of his prior turn. Schumacher made a pit stop for a second time on lapÃÂ 31, coming back to the race in second spot behind Hill. Schumacher set the quickest lap of the race on lapÃÂ 33, and recaptured his lead on the following lap when Hill made his pit stop. Behind them, HÃÂ¤kkinen and Coulthard were third and fourth separately before their pit stops, however Coulthard set six laps later than HÃÂ¤kkinen and came back to the track in thirdÃÂ place, one spot in front of the Finn. Johnny Herbert was fifth in the second Benetton vehicle after the second round of pit stops, with Irvine balancing the point-scoring places in 6th.
