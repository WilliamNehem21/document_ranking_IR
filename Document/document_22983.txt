The games have been complemented and expanded upon through other media. For "Final Fantasy XIII", a small book of short stories titled "Final Fantasy XIII - Episode Zero" was released, first through the game's website and then as a print release in December 2009. It shows events prior to the game's opening. A second novella, "Episode i", was published via "XIII-2"s official website, bridging the narrative gap between "XIII" and "XIII-2". Alongside "XIII-2"s Japanese release, a book detailing events not shown or described in the game titled "Fragments Before" was released in December 2011 including "Episode i"; this would be followed up by "Fragments After", released in June 2012. Only "Episode i" has received an official English release. "Lightning Returns" was also set to receive a prequel novel by Benny Matsuyama alongside the game's Japanese release in November 2013, however this was later cancelled due to the author falling ill. A three-part novella exclusive to "Famitsu Weekly" magazine titled "Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories" was released across June and July 2014. It was written by Daisuke Watanabe, who handled the scripts for the "XIII" games, and takes place immediately after the ending of "Lightning Returns". "Reminiscence" was later released online.
