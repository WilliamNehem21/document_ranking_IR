In 1923 Formby began to play the ukulele, despite the fact that the careful conditions of how he came to play the instrument are obscure, and he brought it into his demonstration amid a keep running at the Alhambra Theater in Barnsley. At the point when the melodiesÃ¢ÂÂstill his dad's materialÃ¢ÂÂwere generally welcomed, he changed his stage name to George Formby, and quit utilizing the John Willie character. Another critical occasion was his appearance in Castleford, West Yorkshire, where showing up on a similar bill was Beryl Ingham, an Accrington-brought into the world hero clogdancer and performer who had won the All England Step Dancing title at 11 years old. Beryl, who had shaped a moving demonstration with her sister, May, called "The Two Violets", had a low conclusion of Formby's demonstration, and later said that "in the event that I'd had a pack of spoiled tomatoes with me I'd have tossed them at him". Formby and Beryl went into a relationship and wedded two years after the fact, on 13 September 1924, at a register office in Wigan, with Formby's auntie and uncle as observers. After hearing the news, Eliza demanded the couple having a congregation wedding, which pursued two months after the fact.
