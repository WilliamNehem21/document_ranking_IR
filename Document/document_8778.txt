They had faith in enabling kids by practices, for example, welcoming their gathering of people individuals with "Hi, everybody", rather than "Hi, young men and young ladies" in light of the fact that as Paul Field has clarified, the second welcome "superfluously isolates youngsters and has hints of loftiness". Kathleen Warren, the gathering's previous educator at Macquarie University, trusted that the gathering's routine with regards to requesting that their crowd "Wake Up Jeff" when Fatt professed to nod off was "particularly with regards to the manner in which they work with youngsters". Warren expressed that requesting that youngsters intrude on Fatt's sleep helped them assemble certainty and to feel more responsible for their lives. Fatt was the main unique individual from The Wiggles without a foundation in early youth instruction; he clarified that was the reason nodding off was picked as his contrivance and that "it was a method for getting me engaged with the shows without really doing anything". Paul Field detailed that kids in The Wiggles' group of onlookers felt "incredible energy" and were frustrated if not allowed the chance to help Jeff thusly. Anthony Field, who called it "a straightforward gathering of people cooperation and association choke we've done since the beginning of the gathering", asserted that it charmed Fatt to their groups of onlookers. The gathering's individuals alternated nodding off in the beginning of the gathering, yet it turned into Fatt's trick since "it was an ideal fit". At the point when Fatt resigned, Gillespie assumed control over the assignment of nodding off.
