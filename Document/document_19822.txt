In 1824 Berlioz composed a "Messe solennelle". It was performed twice, after which he suppressed the score, which was thought lost until a copy was discovered in 1991. During 1825 and 1826 he wrote his first opera, "Les francs-juges", which was not performed and survives only in fragments, the best known of which is the overture. In later works he reused parts of the score, such as the "March of the Guards", which he incorporated four years later in the "Symphonie fantastique" as the "March to the Scaffold".
In August 1826 Berlioz was admitted as a student to the Conservatoire, studying composition under Le Sueur and counterpoint and fugue with Anton Reicha. In the same year he made the first of four attempts to win France's premier music prize, the Prix de Rome, and was eliminated in the first round. The following year, to earn some money, he joined the chorus at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des NouveautÃ©s. He competed again for the Prix de Rome, submitting the first of his Prix cantatas, "La mort d'OrphÃ©e", in July. Later that year he attended productions of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" and "Romeo and Juliet" at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de l'OdÃ©on given by Charles Kemble's touring company. Although at the time Berlioz spoke hardly any English, he was overwhelmed by the plays â the start of a lifelong passion for Shakespeare. He also conceived a passion for Kemble's leading lady, Harriet Smithson â his biographer Hugh Macdonald calls it "emotional derangement" â and obsessively pursued her, without success, for several years. She refused even to meet him.
