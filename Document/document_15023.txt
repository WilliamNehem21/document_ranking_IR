In June 1942, "ShÅkaku" and "Zuikaku" had their anti-aircraft armament augmented with six more triple 25Â mm mounts, two each at the bow and stern, and one each fore and aft of the island. The bow and stern groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25Â mm mount was added at the bow and stern and 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. After the battle, "Zuikaku"s anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 26 single mounts for the 25Â mm Type 96 gun, bringing the total of 25Â mm barrels to 96, 60 in 20 triple mounts and 36 single mounts. These guns were supplemented by eight 28-round AA rocket launchers. Each rocket weighed and had a maximum velocity of . Their maximum range was .
"ShÅkaku" was the first carrier in the IJN to be fitted with radar, a Type 21 early-warning radar, mounted on the top of the island around September 1942. The date of "Zuikaku"s installation is unknown, but both ships received a second Type 21 radar in a retractable installation adjacent to the flight deck after October. Before June 1944, a Type 13 air-search radar was installed on the light tripod mast abaft the island. The "ShÅkaku"-class carriers were also fitted with a Type 91 hydrophone in the bow that was only useful when anchored or moving very slowly.
