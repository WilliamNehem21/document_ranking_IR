Silke Roth has suggested that Shepseskare was a child of Neferirkare Kakai and a sibling of both Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. Rather, Verner has recommended that Shepseskare was a child of Sahure who figured out how to quickly catch control after the sudden passing of Neferefre. This would clarify the vicinity of Shepseskare's incomplete pyramid to that of Sahure. Loaning assurance to this hypothesis is the disclosure by Verner and Tarek El Awady in 2005 of reliefs from the boulevard of Sahure's pyramid complex appearing, his better half Meretnebty and their two children Ranefer and Netjerirenre. The help gives the two children the title of "lord's oldest child", showing that they were potentially twins. The help further demonstrates that Ranefer accepting the royal position as "Neferirkare lord of Upper and Lower Egypt". Verner and Awady in this manner guess that while Ranefer and his child Neferefre progressed toward becoming lords, Netjerirenre could have endeavored to catch the position of royalty at the passing of the last mentioned. In this speculation Shepseskare would be the position of royalty name of Netjerirenre. Verner had anyway himself written in 1997 that Shepseskare could similarly be a child of Shepseskaf, last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty, or of Userkaf or Neferirkare Kakai as Roth recommended: so few are the genuine confirmations relating to the issue that all conceivable outcomes are simply hypotheses. In one more theory, JaromÃÂ­r KrejÃÂÃÂ­ trusts that Shepseskare was Neferefre's child.
