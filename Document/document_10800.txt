As a component of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, Congress approved an assessment of the viability of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project. A report known as the "Restudy", composed by the U.S. Armed force Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, was submitted to Congress in 1999. It refered to markers of mischief to the framework: a half decrease in the first Everglades, reduced water stockpiling, destructive planning of water discharge, a 85 to 90% diminishing in swimming winged animal populaces over the past 50ÃÂ years, and the decay of yield from business fisheries. Waterways including Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, St. Lucie estuary, Lake Worth Lagoon, Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, and the Everglades reflected extraordinary water level changes, hypersalinity, and sensational changes in marine and freshwater biological communities. The Restudy noticed the general decrease in water quality over the past 50ÃÂ years was brought about by loss of wetlands that go about as channels for dirtied water. It anticipated that without mediation the whole South Florida biological system would fall apart. Trenches took generally of water to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico every day, so there was no open door for water stockpiling, yet flooding was as yet an issue. Without changes to the flow framework, the Restudy anticipated water limitations would be important each other year, and every year in certain areas. It likewise cautioned that updating a few bits of the undertaking without committing endeavors to a general far reaching plan would be lacking and most likely inconvenient.
