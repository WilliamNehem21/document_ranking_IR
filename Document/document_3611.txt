Chandler embraced dim steed competitor Wallace G. Wilkinson in the 1987 Democratic essential, and his underwriting was viewed as vital to Wilkinson's triumph in the race. After Wilkinson's race as senator, he reestablished Chandler's casting a ballot rights on the University of Kentucky's leading body of trustees. (In 1981, Governor John Y. Dark colored Jr. had assigned Chandler a "privileged," non-casting a ballot, individual from the board.) While talking about the University of Kentucky's choice to discard its interests in South Africa at a gathering of the college's leading body of trustees on April 5, 1988, Chandler commented, "You know Zimbabwe's everything nigger now. There aren't any whites." The remark quickly drew requires Chandler's acquiescence from the University Senate Council and the Student Government Association, and around 50 understudies walked on college president David Roselle's office requesting for Chandler to apologize or leave. Remarking on the debate the following day, Chandler stated, "I was brought up in a community in Western Kentucky. There were 400 whites and 400 blacks, and we called them niggers and they wouldn't fret. What's more, I returned briefly, at any rate, to that articulation, and obviously, I wish I hadn't." That expression of remorse did not fulfill many, and 200 dissidents walked onto the State Capitol, requesting for Wilkinson to expel Chandler from the load up. Wilkinson would not evacuate Chandler and asked the group to pardon him.
