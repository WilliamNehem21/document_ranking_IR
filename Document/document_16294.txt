Chris Turner wrote positively of the Canyonero spoof piece in "Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation", calling it "a brilliant parody of an SUV ad". In an article in the journal "Environmental Politics" Steve Vanderheiden commented that the Canyonero reflected an "anti-SUV" stance by "The Simpsons". Vanderheiden wrote: "Even the popular animated television series âThe Simpsonsâ joined the anti-SUV fray in 1998, featuring a mammoth vehicle called the âCanyoneroâ (marketed with the jingle: âTwelve yards long, two lanes wide/Sixty-five tons of American pride!â), which promised to help the family transcend its mundane station-wagon existence but instead brought only misery." The term "Canyonero" has since been used in the news media to refer critically to large trucks and SUVs. In an article in the "San Francisco Chronicle" about SUV owners, Vicki Haddock wrote "SUV owners have become something of a punch line, succinctly captured in a "Simpsons" parody touting the apocryphal Canyonero". In a 2006 article, Seth Jayson of "The Motley Fool" compared the wording in a Ford advertisement "myFord Owner Magazine" to this episode, writing: "the unholiest of unholies is the writing, which is so thick with absurd adspeak, you'd think it was written by the crew at "The Onion" or "The Simpsons"Â â especially that episode where Krusty starts shilling for the Canyonero." In a 2004 article in the "Chicago Tribune", Jim Mateja noted that people have pointed out a similarity between the GMC Canyon and the Canyonero. When contacted, GMC responded that the GMC is a pickup truck, while the Canyonero is a parody of an SUV. Joshua Dowling of "The Sun-Herald" described the philosophy of the Ford F-250 as "The Canyonero comes to life".
