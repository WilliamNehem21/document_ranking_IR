The main activity for "Lion" and "Princess Royal" was amid the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. Beatty's boats had initially been proposed as removed help of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in the event that the expansive boats of the High Seas Fleet sortied because of the British assaults. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light powers neglected to withdraw on calendar and the rising tide implied that German capital boats would most likely clear the sand bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary. The pristine light cruiser had been disabled before in the fight and was enduring an onslaught from the German light cruisers and when the battlecruisers lingered out of the fog at 12:37. "Strassburg" had the capacity to dodge into the fogs and sidestep fire, yet "CÃÂ¶ln" stayed obvious and was immediately disabled by flame from the squadron. Beatty was diverted from the undertaking of completing her off by the abrupt appearance of the old light cruiser straightforwardly to his front. He turned in interest and diminished her to a flaring mass. The battlecruisers experienced the disabled "CÃÂ¶ln" not long after turning north and she was sunk by "Lion" after a couple salvoes.
