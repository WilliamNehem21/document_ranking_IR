By 1965's "Elastic Soul", he had started to lead the different Beatles into people shake through his enthusiasm for the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian traditional music through his utilization of the sitar on "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)". He later called "Elastic Soul" his "most loved [Beatles] collection". "Pistol" (1966) included three of his arrangements: "Taxman", chose as the collection's opening track, "Love You To" and "I Want to Tell You". His automaton like tambura part on Lennon's "Tomorrow Never Knows" exemplified the band's continuous investigation of non-Western instruments, while the sitar-and tabla-based "Love You To" spoke to the Beatles' first real attack into Indian music. As indicated by the ethnomusicologist David Reck, the last melody set a point of reference in mainstream music for instance of Asian culture being spoken to by Westerners consciously and without spoof. Creator Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1978 that following Harrison's expanded relationship with the sitar after "Norwegian Wood", he wound up known as "the maharaja of raga-shake". Harrison kept on building up his enthusiasm for non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on "Strawberry Fields Forever".
