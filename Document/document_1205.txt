Lincoln confronted three noteworthy adversaries. A split in the Democratic Party had driven northerners to designate Senator Douglas, while southerners picked Vice President John C. Breckinridge. The Constitutional Union Party, another gathering comprising for the most part of previous Southern Whigs, chose previous Tennessee congressperson John Bell. As Lincoln would not be on the poll in ten southern states, he expected to win pretty much every northern state to take the administration. Douglas was said to be solid in Illinois and Indiana, and in the event that he took those, the decision may be tossed into the House of Representatives. Seward was encouraged to embrace a battle voyage through the Midwest in help of Lincoln and did as such for five weeks in September and October, drawing in tremendous groups. He ventured by rail and pontoon as far north as Saint Paul, Minnesota, into the outskirt territory of Missouri at St. Louis, and even to Kansas Territory, however it had no discretionary votes to cast in the race. At the point when the train went through Springfield, Seward and Lincoln were presented, with Lincoln seeming "humiliated" and Seward "compelled." In his speech, Seward talked about the U.S. as a "tower of opportunity," a Union that may even incorporate Canada, Latin America, and Russian America.
