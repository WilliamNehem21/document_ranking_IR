Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic focused on the processor performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of "Home Office Computing" praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the display because a full US letter page ( Ã 11Â inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and desktop publishing capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: "The Classic's value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance will get you working on that novel, database, or spreadsheet." "PC Week" criticized the lack of a faster processor, stating, "The 7.8Â MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road." Similarly, "PC User"'s review concluded, "The slow processor and lack of expansion slots on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices". "MacWEEK" described it as a "fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision six and a half years later". "Computer Gaming World" was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.
