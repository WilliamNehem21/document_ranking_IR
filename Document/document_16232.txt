Initial responses to the character were mostly positive. Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" declared Tritter the best male villain of the fall of 2006. Lisa Edelstein, who portrays Lisa Cuddy on "House", named David Morse as one of her favorite "House" guest stars, saying that he did a great job portraying the character. Barbara Barnett from "Blog Critics Magazine" and Charles McGrath of "The New York Times" compared Tritter to Inspector Javert of "Les MisÃ©rables", and Alynda Wheat from "Entertainment Weekly" stated that Tritter annoyed House more than any other character, surpassing other antagonists such as Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), and Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston). "Variety"s Stuart Levine considered Tritter a "worthy foe" for House.
However, the continued character arc increasingly bored critics. Staci Krause of IGN found the first few episodes of SeasonÂ 3, in which House recovers from being shot, more interesting. In a review of "Que Sera Sera", "Entertainment Weekly"s Michelle Kung noted that while David Morse is a fine actor, "his cop is so ridiculously one-note and revenge-bent that his scenes are often just excruciating to sit through". In a review for "Fools for Love", Sara Morrison of Television Without Pity doubted that Tritter's revenge on House was worth his time and aggravation, and later called the Tritter arc an "insane quest for ass-thermometer justice". "The Star-Ledger"s Alan Sepinwall stated that "pitting House against a comedy-impaired cop was both dull and not a fair fight".
