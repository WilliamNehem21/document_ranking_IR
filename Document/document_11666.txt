In the 1910Ã¢ÂÂ 11 Australian season, Crawford scored 50 years in each top notch diversion he played yet was less fruitful with the ball. His prosperity against the visiting South Africans, maybe helped by his experience confronting their googly bowlers on past events, conveyed him near choice for the Australian Test group that year. The Australian Board of Control in the end chose that, as he had just showed up for England, they couldn't pick him; rather they picked Charlie Kelleway as the all-rounder. Crawford left his situation as St Peter's in March 1911, proposing to the press that he may move into cultivating. He may have thought about leaving South Australia, yet the Cricket Association named him as an agent at the Adelaide Oval, a position which earned ÃÂ£200 per annum, with extra obligation regarding training and youth exploring. In the interim, in England, after fruitless endeavors by his dad to change the psyche of the Surrey board of trustees, including a fizzled offer to verify his own decision to the advisory group, Crawford sent a composed conciliatory sentiment to Surrey sooner or later in 1910. Thusly, the advisory group passed a movement in March 1911 which finished the prohibition on Crawford playing for the province.
