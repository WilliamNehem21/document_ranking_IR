In the following Congress, among the main bills to pass the house was the Public Credit Act of 1869, which would require the legislature to pay bondholders in gold, not greenbacks. The 1868 race battle had seen the Democrats proposing to reimburse the bondholders (for the most part supporters of the Union war exertion) in paper; Republicans favored gold, as the bonds had been obtained with gold. Sherman concurred with his kindred Republicans and casted a ballot with them to pass the bill 42-13. Sherman kept on favoring more extensive course of the greenback when he voted in favor of the Currency Act of 1870, which approved an extra $54 million in United States Notes. Sherman was likewise engaged with discussion over the Funding Act of 1870. The Funding Act, which Sherman called "[t]he most imperative budgetary proportion of that Congress," discounted the national obligation. The bill as Sherman composed it approved $1.2 billion of low-financing cost securities to be utilized to buy the high-rate securities issued amid the war, to exploit the lower getting costs realized by the harmony and security that pursued the Union triumph. The Act was the subject of impressive discussion over the definite rates and sums, however once the distinctions were resolved, it gone by vast greater parts in the two houses. While Sherman was discontent with the trade offs (particularly the augmentation of the bonds' term to 30 years, which he accepted excessively long), he saw the bill as an improvement over the current conditions and encouraged its section.
