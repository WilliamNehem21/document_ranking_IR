Franciscan minister AndrÃÂ©s AvendaÃÂ±o y Loyola recorded his very own record of his late seventeenth century voyages to NojpetÃÂ©n, written in 1696 and entitled "RelaciÃÂ³n de las entradas que hize a la conversiÃÂ³n de los gentiles Ytzaex" ("Account of the undertakings that I made to change over the Itza barbarians"). At the point when the Spanish at long last vanquished PetÃÂ©n in 1697 they created an immense amount of documentation. Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor was a Spanish provincial authority who originally held the post of relator of the Royal Chancery of Vallodalid and later as that of the Council of the Indies. All things considered he approached the extensive measure of provincial reports put away in the General Archive of the Indies. From these he delivered his "Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la de el Lacandon, y otras naciones de indios barbaros, de la mediacion de el Reyno de Guatimala, a las provincias del Yucatan en la AmÃÂ©rica Septentrional" ("History of the Conquest of the Province of the Itza, decrease, and advances in that of the Lakandon, and different countries of primitive indians, and the intercession of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and the areas of Yucatan in Northern America"). This was first distributed in Madrid in 1701 and definite the historical backdrop of PetÃÂ©n from 1525 through to 1699.
