Between late 1937 and 1938, Captain FÃÂ©lix Verdeja Bardales started to secretly build up the idea for another light tank. The new tank would think about every one of the characteristics and issues with existing tanks in administration with the Nationalist Army, including the Panzer I and T-26, and consolidate various attributes which would make it the best light tank in administration at the time. His optimal light tank incorporated a tank firearm, with 360-degree cross and a rise of 72 degrees. In the meantime, the vehicle was to have the least conceivable outline, and no not exactly of all-around protection, and on the front. Moreover, the covering was to be slanted to expand its proficiency and shot of an approaching shot ricocheting. With a greatest speed of , the light tank was to be fueled by a motor. Moreover, the vehicle's mechanical dependability was to enhance that of the current tanks in administration with the Nationalist Army. Regardless of starting deterrents, including resistance to an indigenous Spanish tank program from German General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, the main model was conveyed in late 1938; this model was worked from extra parts taken from various diverse tanks. The model performed well in testing and another model was requested.
