After their unique religious exercises stopped, Egyptian sanctuaries endured moderate rot. Many were damaged by Christians attempting to eradicate the remainders of antiquated Egyptian religion. Some sanctuary structures, for example, the "mammisi" at Dendera or the hypostyle lobby at Philae, were adjusted into places of worship or different sorts of structures. Most ordinarily the destinations were left neglected, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while local people stole away their stones to fill in as material for new structures. The disassembling of sanctuaries for stone proceeded with well into present day times. Limestone was particularly helpful as a wellspring of lime, so sanctuaries worked of limestone were practically all disassembled. Sandstone sanctuaries, found for the most part in Upper Egypt, were bound to endure. What people left unblemished was as yet subject to normal enduring. Sanctuaries in desert territories could be halfway secured by floats of sand, while those close to the Nile, especially in Lower Egypt, were frequently covered under layers of stream borne residue. In this way, some real sanctuary destinations like Memphis were decreased to demolish, while numerous sanctuaries a long way from the Nile and focuses of populace remained generally flawless. With comprehension of the hieroglyphic content lost, the data about Egyptian culture that was saved in the enduring sanctuaries lay immeasurable to the world.
