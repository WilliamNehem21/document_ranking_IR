William of Poitiers portrays a board called by Duke William, in which the essayist gives a record of an extraordinary discussion that occurred between William's nobles and supporters about whether to chance an attack of England. Albeit some kind of formal gathering likely was held, it is improbable that any discussion occurred, as the duke had by then settled command over his nobles, and the vast majority of those amassed would have been on edge to verify a lot of the prizes from the success of England. William of Poitiers likewise relates that the duke acquired the assent of Pope Alexander II for the intrusion, alongside an ecclesiastical flag. The writer likewise guaranteed that the duke verified the help of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and King Sweyn II of Denmark. Henry was as yet a minor, be that as it may, and Sweyn was bound to help Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian lord, so these cases ought to be treated with alert. Despite the fact that Alexander gave ecclesiastical endorsement to the victory after it succeeded, no other source claims ecclesiastical help before the attack. Occasions after the attack, which incorporated the compensation William performed and explanations by later popes, do loan incidental help to the case of ecclesiastical endorsement. To manage Norman issues, William put the legislature of Normandy under the control of his significant other for the term of the intrusion.
