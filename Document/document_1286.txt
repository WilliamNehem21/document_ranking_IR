"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" screened at a few film celebrations in 2003, winning various honors. Starting with the South by Southwest celebration on 7ÃÂ March, its celebration appearances incorporated the Banff World Television Festival, the Seattle International Film Festival, the Marseille Festival of Documentary Film, the Three Continents Film Festival, the Chicago International Film Festival, the Monaco International Film Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh and the Los Angeles Wine and Country Festival. In March 2003, a VHS duplicate of the film screened to under 100 individuals as a feature of an American Cinematheque Irish film celebration in Los Angeles. Among the watchers was the leader of Vitagraph Films, David Schultz, who purchased the rights for showy conveyance and paid for the film to be changed over from video. Schultz at first attempted to verify the help of exhibitors; they were wary of the film's business prospects, and trusted "the earth was not accommodating" for a film disparaging of the US so near the beginning of the 2003 attack of Iraq. They just ended up responsive a couple of months after the fact, when political recognitions moved and the open turned out to be increasingly mindful of Venezuela in view of its oil riches. One such exhibitor was the Film Forum in New York City. Mike Maggiore, a software engineer at the theater, attempted to advertise the film and raise its profile with film commentators. He made press packs and coursed data to engage "a specific gathering of people".
