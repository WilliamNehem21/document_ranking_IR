On 14ÃÂ September 2014, the Federal government focused on conveying up to eight Super Hornets of No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as a component of the Australian Air Task Group joining the alliance against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) powers in Iraq. Airplane from the squadron directed their first mission over Iraq on 5ÃÂ October, and their first strike four days after the fact. As indicated by the Department of Defense, as of 20ÃÂ December 2014 the Super Hornets had flown more than 180 fights, dropped 113 weapons, and crushed 36 ISIL targets, harming another six. In March 2015, having flown just about 3,000 hours in more than 400 missions, the separation was supplanted by six F/A-18As from No.ÃÂ 75 Squadron. A unit of No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron was again to sent to Al Minhad as a major aspect of the Australian Air Task Group in May 2017, supplanting the inheritance Hornets of No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron conveyed earlier. The Super Hornets flew the last strike mission of their revolution, and the remainder of 2,700 forays by the Air Task Group Hornets, on 14ÃÂ January 2018. In April, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron was granted the 2017 Gloucester Cup.
