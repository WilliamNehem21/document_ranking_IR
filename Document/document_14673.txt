"Auriscalpium vulgare" generally has a solitary stem, however periodically a few stems emerge from a thick basic base. It joins to the side of the top and is round and hollow or somewhat straightened with a bulbous base. Its surface is secured with bushy strands (particularly close to the base), and its develop shading is a dim chestnut dark colored. The top is half circle or kidney-molded, level on the lower surface and adjusted on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: secured with fibers and dull chestnut darker. Be that as it may, it winds up smooth with development and can obscure to the point of being practically dark. The top edge is generally buff to light brownÃ¢ÂÂ generally a similar shading as the spines and lighter in shading than the inside. It progresses toward becoming rolled internal ("revolute") and frequently wavy in development. The spines on the underside of the top are a couple of millimeters long and barrel shaped down to their sharp tips. White to light dark colored when youthful, they later turned out to be secured with a white spore mass and after that turn an ashy dim. Incidentally, organic product bodies are delivered that do not have a top completely.
