Indeed, even by maximal size appraisals, "Irritator" was littler than other known spinosaurids. Gregory S. Paul determined its length at and weight at . Thomas R. Holtz Jr. distributed a higher gauge of , with a weight between . Gauges by Dougal Dixon were lower at long and high. At the point when scaled by Aureliano and associates, the reproductions from the examination by Sales and Schultz gave a length of to the "Irritator challengeri" holotype, and for the "Angaturama limai" holotype. A portion of the skull bones of the previous holotype had not yet completely co-solidified (intertwined), showing that the example had a place with a subadult. The halfway spinosaurine skeleton MN 4819-V spoke to a respectably measured individual, evaluated by Machado at long. Numerous components from this example were joined into the skeletal mount in the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, which had a length of and a stature of . Nonetheless, spinosaurids from the Romualdo Formation conceivably achieved more prominent sizes. In spite of the fact that LPP-PV-0042 is spoken to just by a tibia piece, Aureliano and associates evaluated its length at generally . Bone histology demonstrates that this individual was a subadult, so the develop creature may have been bigger.
