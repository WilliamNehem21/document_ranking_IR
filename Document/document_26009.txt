On 1 November, "Vizeadmiral" Prince Heinrich, who had replaced Hoffmann as the I Squadron commander, raised his flag aboard "Kaiser Friedrich III"; the ship held the role as squadron flagship for the next three years, interrupted only during the annual fleet exercises conducted in August and September, when Admiral Hans von Koester, the "Generalinspekteur der Marine" (Inspector-General of the Navy), commanded the fleet from "Kaiser Wilhelm II". Through November, the ships of the squadron were occupied with individual training. On 17 November 1900, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was steaming to Kiel after conducting training exercises. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" attempted to pass "Kaiser Friedrich III", so the latter stopped and allowed the former to pass to port. However, the order to resume steaming was given too quickly, and the ship accidentally rammed "Kaiser Wilhelm II". "Kaiser Friedrich III" suffered minor damage to her bow, while her sister was slightly damaged in the compartment that housed the steering engines. Repairs were completed within three days, without the need for either vessel to enter drydock. On 4 December, the ships began a winter training cruise, during which they stopped in Larvik, Norway, from 10 to 12 December. The squadron returned to Germany three days later.
