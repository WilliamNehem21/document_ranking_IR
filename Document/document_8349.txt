At first, Monteverdi had little eagerness for "Le nozze di Tetide", and looked for methods for maintaining a strategic distance from or deferring take a shot at it. He would acknowledge the commission, he educated Striggio on 9 December 1616, in light of the fact that it was the desire of the duke, his medieval ruler. Be that as it may, the refrains he was given were not, he felt, helpful for wonderful music. He found the story hard to comprehend, and did not figure he could be enlivened by it. In any occasion he was involved for a large portion of December recorded as a hard copy a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, maybe trusting that the commission would be pulled back, Monteverdi disclosed to Striggio that he was prepared to start take a shot at "Le Nozze di Tetide" "in the event that you guide me to do as such". In January 1617, in any case, he turned out to be progressively energetic on discovering that the task had been downsized and was currently being anticipated as a progression of intermedi. He educated Striggio that what he had first considered a fairly tedious piece he presently thought completely fitting to the event. He started chip away at the recitative segments, however before he could begin setting the more expressive numbers, the duke had a difference in heart and dropped Monteverdi's bonus. "Le nozze di Tetide" was relinquished; its lyrics and whatever music existed have vanished.
