Debussy's literary inspirations were mostly French, but he did not overlook foreign writers. As well as Maeterlinck for "PellÃ©as et MÃ©lisande", he drew on Shakespeare and Charles Dickens for two of his PrÃ©ludes for piano â "La Danse de Puck" (Book 1, 1910) and "Hommage Ã  S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C." (Book 2, 1913). He set Dante Gabriel Rossetti's "The Blessed Damozel" in his early cantata, "La Damoiselle Ã©lue" (1888). He wrote incidental music for "King Lear" and planned an opera based on "As You Like It", but abandoned that once he turned his attention to setting Maeterlinck's play. In 1890 he began work on an orchestral piece inspired by Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" and later sketched the libretto for an opera, "La chute de la maison Usher". Another project inspired by Poe â an operatic version of "The Devil in the Belfry" did not progress beyond sketches. French writers whose words he set include Paul Bourget, Alfred de Musset, ThÃ©odore de Banville, Leconte de Lisle, ThÃ©ophile Gautier, Paul Verlaine, FranÃ§ois Villon, and MallarmÃ© â the last of whom also provided Debussy with the inspiration for one of his most popular orchestral pieces, "PrÃ©lude Ã  l'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune".
