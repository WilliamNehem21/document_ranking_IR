In Ireland Heseltine joined investigations of early music with an interest for Celtic dialects, pulling back for a two-month time frame to a remote island where Irish was spoken only. Another distraction was an expanding interest with enchanted and mysterious practices, an intrigue initially stirred amid his Oxford year and restored in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols shows that right now he was "tamper[ing] ... with the science obscenely known as Black Magic". To his previous guide Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books "brimming with the most bewildering intelligence and light"; these works included Eliphas Levi's "History of Transcendental Magic", which incorporates techniques for the conjuring of devils. These redirections did not keep Heseltine from taking an interest in Dublin's social life. He met W.B. Yeats, an individual lover for the mysterious, and quickly considered composition a musical show dependent on the ninth century Celtic people story of Liadain and Curithir. The writer Denis ApIvor has shown that Heseltine's fixation on the mysterious was in the long run supplanted by his investigations in religious rationalities, to which he was drawn through participation of a theosophist assemble in Dublin. Heseltine's enthusiasm for this field had initially been stirred by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the writer who had acquainted him with the music of BÃÂ©la BartÃÂ³k.
