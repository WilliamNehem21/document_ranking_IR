Numerous different components and atoms have been identified in ice centers. In 1969, it was found that lead levels in Greenland ice had expanded by a factor of more than 200 since pre-modern occasions, and increments in different components created by mechanical procedures, for example, copper, cadmium, and zinc, have additionally been recorded. The nearness of nitric and sulfuric corrosive ( and ) in precipitation can be appeared associate with expanding fuel burning after some time. Methanesulfonate (MSA) () is delivered in the climate by marine creatures, so ice center records of MSA give data on the historical backdrop of the maritime condition. Both hydrogen peroxide () and formaldehyde () have been examined, alongside natural atoms, for example, carbon dark that are connected to vegetation discharges and woodland fires. A few animal groups, for example, calcium and ammonium, show solid occasional variety. At times there are commitments from more than one source to a given animal categories: for instance, Ca originates from residue just as from marine sources; the marine info is a lot more prominent than the residue input thus in spite of the fact that the two sources top at various occasions of the year, the general flag demonstrates a crest in the winter, when the marine information is at a most extreme. Regular signs can be eradicated at locales where the aggregation is low, by surface breezes; in these cases it is beyond the realm of imagination to expect to date singular layers of ice between two reference layers.
