In the twentieth century, six speculations for clarifying the eradication of the mammoth subfossil lemurs have been proposed and tried. They are known as the "Incomparable Fire", "Incredible Drought", "Lightning war", "Natural Invasion", "Hypervirulent Disease", and "Collaboration" theories. The first was proposed in 1927 when Henri Humbert and different botanists working in Madagascar presumed that human-presented fire and uncontrolled consuming planned to make field and fields for harvests changed the living spaces rapidly over the island. In 1972, MahÃÂ© and Sourdat recommended that the parched south had turned out to be continuously drier, gradually slaughtering off lemur fauna as the atmosphere changed. Paul S. Martin connected his pointless excess theory or "lightning war" model to clarify the loss of the Malagasy megafauna in 1984, anticipating a fast cease to exist as people spread in a wave over the island, chasing the expansive species to eradication. That equivalent year, Robert Dewar guessed that presented domesticated animals outcompeted the endemic natural life in a reasonably quick arrangement of different waves over the island. In 1997, MacPhee and Marx hypothesized that a quick spread of hypervirulent illness may clarify the pass on offs that happened after the presence of people around the world, including Madagascar. At long last, in 1999, David Burney suggested that the total arrangement of human effects cooperated, now and again alongside regular environmental change, and all around gradually (i.e., on a period size of hundreds of years to centuries) realized the destruction of the goliath subfossil lemurs and other as of late wiped out endemic natural life.
