Angelou utilizes her numerous jobs, manifestations, and characters all through her books to represent how abuse and individual history are interrelated. For instance, in "Confined Bird", Angelou exhibits the "supremacist propensity" of renaming African Americans, as demonstrated when her white manager demands calling her "Mary". Angelou portrays the business' renaming as the "loathsome awfulness of being 'got out of [one's] name'". Researcher Debra Walker King considers it a supremacist affront and an attack against Maya's race and mental self portrait. The renaming accentuates Maya's sentiments of deficiency and stigmatizes her character, singularity, and uniqueness. Maya comprehends that she is being offended and revolts by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's most loved dish, however feels vindicated when, as she abandons her manager's home, Mrs. Cullinan at last gets her name right. Another episode in the book that cements Maya's personality is her outing to Mexico with her dad, when she needs to drive a vehicle out of the blue. Appeared differently in relation to her involvement in Stamps, Maya is at last "responsible for her destiny". This experience is key to Maya's development, just like the occurrence that quickly tails it, her brief time of vagrancy subsequent to belligerence with her dad's better half. These two occurrences give Maya a learning of self-assurance and affirm her self-esteem.
