The Mammoth Genome Project at Pennsylvania State University is likewise examining the change of African elephant DNA to make an elephant-mammoth half and half. On the off chance that a feasible crossover incipient organism is acquired by quality altering strategies, embedding it into a female Asian elephant housed in a zoo might be conceivable, however with the present information and innovation, regardless of whether the half breed developing life would be helped through the 2-year incubation is obscure. On the off chance that any technique is ever effective, a proposal has been made to acquaint the crossovers with an untamed life hold in Siberia called the Pleistocene Park. A few scholars question the morals of such amusement endeavors. Notwithstanding the specialized issues, very little environment is left that would be reasonable for elephant-mammoth half and halves. Since the two species are [were] social and gregarious, making a couple of examples would not be perfect. The time and assets required would be tremendous, and the logical advantages would be indistinct, recommending these assets ought to rather be utilized to protect surviving elephant species which are jeopardized. The morals of utilizing elephants as surrogate moms in hybridization endeavors has additionally been addressed, as most fetuses would not endure, and knowing the careful needs of a half and half elephant-mammoth calf would be unthinkable.
