The principal portion of the story-based DLC "The Knife of Dunwall" was lauded for its dimension structure, which urged investigation to discover shrouded substance and elective courses through territories. The adjustments to specific capacities, especially Blink were correspondingly generally welcomed for the progressions they conveyed to the interactivity from the primary diversion. The story, notwithstanding, was for the most part reprimanded. Polygon noticed that the savage professional killer Daud had no thought process in looking for recovery, and enabling him to be played as a non-deadly character made a distinction with the account. IGN thought about that it felt like just 50% of a total diversion, coming up short on any criticalness in its story and highlighting a baffling end. "The Brigmore Witches" story got a blended reaction, with Destructoid saying that it offered an all the more holding account, while Polygon expressed that it did not have a similar strain as "The Knife of Dunwall", and the consummation felt hurried and uninspiring. Notwithstanding, the ongoing interaction was commonly viewed as an improvement, giving increasingly mind boggling level structure and nuanced world structure that delivered interactivity requiring a progressively attentive methodology. PC Gamer valued that the dimensions each had an unmistakable subject, and enough accommodated both stealth and rough ongoing interaction, while Polygon said that just the last dimension improved over the former DLC, presenting new mechanics that constrained changes in stealth players.
