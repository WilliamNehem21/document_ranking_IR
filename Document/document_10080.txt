In "Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell", Clarke injects her dry mind with trite curiosity. For instance, the storyteller notes: "It has been commented (by a woman limitlessly cleverer than the present creator) how compassionately arranged the world by and large feels to youngsters who either pass on or wed. Envision then the intrigue that encompassed Miss Wintertowne! No young woman at any point had such preferences previously: for she passed on upon the Tuesday, was brought to life up in the early long periods of Wednesday morning, and was hitched upon the Thursday; which a few people thought an excessive amount of fervor for multi week." As Michel Faber clarifies in his survey for "The Guardian", "here we have all the characterizing highlights of Clarke's style at the same time: the archly Austenesque tone, the to some degree overcompensated curiosity ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-truth utilization of the heavenly, and buffoonery to save." Gregory Maguire notes in "The New York Times" that Clarke even tenderly criticizes the class of the novel itself: "[A gentleman] grabs a book and starts to readÃÂ ...ÃÂ but he isn't taking care of what he peruses and he must Page 22 preceding he finds it is a novelÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the kind of work which over all others he most despisesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and he puts it down in nauseate." Elsewhere, the storyteller comments, "Dear Emma does not squander her energies upon books like other young ladies." The storyteller's personality has been a theme of dialog, with Clarke pronouncing that said storyteller is female and omniscient instead of a future researcher from inside the genuine storyline as some had recommended.
