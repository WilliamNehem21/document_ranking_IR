In the early piece of his term, Crittenden was worried about subduing the savagery in Kansas Territory. A rival of the KansasÃ¢ÂÂ Nebraska Act of 1854, Crittenden likewise contradicted canceling the Missouri Compromise except if the North consented to substitute famous power for the rejection of subjugation north of the 36ÃÂ°30' line. In mid 1856, he proposed sending General Winfield Scott to the Kansas Territory to guarantee that reasonable races were held there, yet the proposition was hindered by the Pierce organization. He didn't concur with the majority of the demonstration proposed by Robert Toombs to take into consideration a sacred tradition in Kansas Territory, however he bolstered it as a stage to bring harmony there. He respected the confirmations of both the Topeka Constitution and the Lecompton Constitution as invalid, and made a standout amongst the most very respected discourses of his profession contrary to the last mentioned. His substitute bill that would have resubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas for another approval vote was bolstered by Republicans, yet it was at last vanquished. So extraordinary was Crittenden's impact after his activities on the Kansas question that Abraham Lincoln felt that Crittenden's underwriting of Stephen Douglas cost Lincoln the Illinois senatorial decision in 1858.
