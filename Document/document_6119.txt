Albeit fifty vehicles were entered in the qualifier, as indicated by NASCAR's passing strategy just forty-three could race. Every driver ran two laps, with the beginning request controlled by the contender's quickest occasions. Kurt Busch secured his 6th shaft position of the period, the ninth of his vocation and his first at Martinsville, with a period of 19.408. He was joined on the matrix's first column by Gordon, who was 0.038 seconds slower and had the shaft position until Kurt Busch's lap. Hamlin qualified third, Newman fourth and Tony Stewart fifth. Blaney was 6th, with Earnhardt and Green seventh and eighth. Johnson, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified ninth and Ken Schrader adjusted the best ten qualifiers. Harvick, another driver in the Chase, set the twelfth-quickest time. The seven drivers who neglected to qualify were Mike Bliss, Hermie Sadler, Chad Chaffin, Morgan Shepherd, Ted Christopher, Derrike Cope and Stanton Barrett. After the qualifier Kurt Busch stated, "It was an extraordinary lap, unforeseen for me, however this group has constantly qualified well at this track, Martinsville is the sort of track that you either love or abhor, and I've figured out how to do both. It's an intense, testing short track."
