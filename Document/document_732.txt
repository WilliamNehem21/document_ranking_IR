The next year his gathering entered an alliance with the gatherings of Peru's two important traditionalist government officials at the time, ex-president Fernando BelaÃÂºnde Terry (of the Popular Action gathering) and Luis Bedoya Reyes (of the "Partido Popular Cristiano"), to frame the tripartite focus right alliance known as "Frente DemocrÃÂ¡tico" (FREDEMO). He kept running for the administration of Peru in 1990 as the hopeful of the FREDEMO alliance.
