Spotswood's board guaranteed that Teach's quality was an emergency and that under a rule of William III, the representative was qualified for attempt Howard without a jury. The charges alluded to a few demonstrations of robbery evidently dedicated after the exoneration's cut-off date, in "a sloop having a place with ye subjects of the King of Spain", however overlooked the way that they occurred outside Spotswood's purview and in a vessel at that point legitimately possessed. Another charge refered to two assaults, one of which was the catch of a slave send off Charles Town Bar, from which one of Howard's slaves was attempted to have come. Howard was sent to anticipate preliminary under the steady gaze of a Court of Vice-Admiralty, on the charge of robbery, yet Brand and his associate, Captain Gordon (of ) wouldn't present with Holloway present. Exasperated, Holloway had no alternative yet to remain down, and was supplanted by the Attorney General of Virginia, John Clayton, whom Spotswood depicted as "an honester man [than Holloway]". Howard was observed blameworthy and condemned to be hanged, yet was spared by a commission from London, which coordinated Spotswood to exonerate all demonstrations of theft submitted by surrendering privateers before 23ÃÂ July 1718.
