Following Cuvier's identification, German naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach gave the woolly mammoth its scientific name, "Elephas primigenius", in 1799, placing it in the same genus as the Asian elephant. This name is Latin for "first elephant". Cuvier coined the name "Elephas mammonteus" a few months later, but the former name was subsequently used. In 1828, the British naturalist Joshua Brookes used the name "Mammuthus borealis" for woolly mammoth fossils in his collection that he put up for sale, thereby coining a new genus name. Where and how the word "mammoth" originated is unclear. According to the" Oxford English Dictionary", it comes from an old Vogul word "mÄmoÅt", "earth-horn". It may be a version of "mehemot", the Arabic version of the biblical word "behemoth". Another possible origin is Estonian, where "maa" means "earth", and "mutt" means "mole". The word was first used in Europe during the early 17th century, when referring to "maimanto" tusks discovered in Siberia. American president Thomas Jefferson, who had a keen interest in palaeontology, was partially responsible for transforming the word "mammoth" from a noun describing the prehistoric elephant to an adjective describing anything of surprisingly large size. The first recorded use of the word as an adjective was in a description of a wheel of cheese (the "Cheshire Mammoth Cheese") given to Jefferson in 1802.
