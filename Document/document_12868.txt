From the accessible pieces of music, both Virtanen and Andrew Mellor of "Gramophone" recognize indications of "Tapiola", especially in the first of the three concentrates. KilpelÃÂ¤inen focuses to a portion of Sibelius' late minor works, specifically the "Five Esquisses" for piano Op. 114 (1929), as giving proof that in his last compositional years Sibelius was "advancing towards an increasingly theoretical figure of speech: clear, ethereal pictures minimal contacted by the human interests". Further creativity, KilpelÃÂ¤inen says, is found in the "Surusoitto" music for organ, made in 1931 for the memorial service of Sibelius' companion Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a work that Aino Sibelius conceded may have been founded on Eighth Symphony material: "Did the new orchestra", asks KilpelÃÂ¤inen, "subsequently additionally speak to a cutting edge sound not at all like that of his past style, with dreary, open tones and uncertain disharmonies?" After the account of the sections, StorgÃÂ¥rds could perceive the arranger's late style, including that "the harmonies are so wild and the music so energizing that I'd truly love to know how he went on with this current." Sibelius' solitary safeguarded remark on the music itself, as particular from his intermittent advancement reports, is a comment to SchnÃÂ©evoigt in December 1932: "You have no clue how sharp it is".
