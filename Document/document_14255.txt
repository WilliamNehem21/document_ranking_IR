Toward the finish of 1831, Chopin got the principal significant underwriting from an extraordinary contemporary when Robert Schumann, auditing the Op. 2 Variations in the "Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung" (his originally distributed article on music), pronounced: "Caps off, noble men! A virtuoso." On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave an introduction Paris show at the Salle Pleyel which drew widespread appreciation. The pundit FranÃÂ§ois-Joseph FÃÂ©tis wrote in the "Revue et newspaper musicale": "Here is a young fellow whoÃÂ ... taking no model, has found, if not a total restoration of piano music,ÃÂ ... a plenitude of unique thoughts of a sort to be discovered no place elseÃÂ ..." After this show, Chopin understood that his basically personal console method was not ideal for expansive show spaces. Soon thereafter he was acquainted with the affluent Rothschild banking family, whose support additionally opened entryways for him to other private salons (parties of the nobility and masterful and scholarly world class). Before the finish of 1832 Chopin had set up himself among the Parisian melodic first class, and had earned the regard of his companions, for example, Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He never again depended monetarily upon his dad, and in the winter of 1832 he started gaining an attractive salary from distributing his works and instructing piano to prosperous understudies from all over Europe. This liberated him from the strains of open show giving, which he loathed.
