The Detroit-based structural firm Field, Hinchman and Smith planned the Piquette Avenue Plant. It is a case recently Victorian-style design and was designed according to New England material factories. Structuring processing plants dependent on this kind of factory was regular practice in the United States at the time. The structure is three stories high, wide, and long. Its heap bearing outside block dividers contain 355 windows, and its maple floors, upheld by square oak bars and posts, spread . The Piquette Avenue Plant contains two lift stairwell mixes, one situated on its northwest corner and the other situated on its southwest side. Reviewing a fire in March 1901 that annihilated the Olds Motor Works manufacturing plant in Detroit, Henry Ford and the planners incorporated a fire sprinkler framework in the structure's plan, an uncommon component for mechanical structures of the period. This and a few other unique security includes in the processing plant, for example, its firewalls, fire entryways, and fire get away, are as yet present. Water for the sprinkler framework was provided by a wooden water tank situated on the structure's rooftop. A block powerhouse, estimating wide by long, was the first power supplier for the industrial facility, and was situated close to its northwest corner. The water tank and powerhouse never again exist.
