As of January 1999, Ion Storm CEO Todd Porter anticipated that the diversion should deliver 2.5 million duplicates. Particle Storm chose to deliver a spin-off for "Anachronox" around mid 1999, feeling there would somehow be a lot of substance for one diversion, requiring restrictive expenses and postponements. Colleague Brian Eiserloh noticed that few craftsmanship resources had just been made for the continuation. By May 1999, the group had settled on a cast of 450 non-player characters, and made arrangements for a late 1999 or mid 2000 discharge date. Particle Storm propelled the "Anachronox" site in mid 1999 with a motion picture style trailer. Tom Hall highlighted four "Anachronox" non-player characters in his online joking parody of Kasparov versus the World. Among the amusement's maps finished in 1999 were the Bricks ghettos of Anachronox (Seneca Menard), Ballotine (Josh Jay), Sender Station (Lee Dotson), others parts of Democratus (Matt Sophos), the Casinox territory of Anachronox (Brian Patenaude), and the junkyard labyrinth of Anachronox. Tom Hall detailed in 1999 that a choice was being created to expel grown-up topics, later showed as a choice to kill irreverence. Particle Storm showed the amusement at E3 1999; the group drove a RV to the occasion, which endured a victory and electrical disappointment. "PC Games Magazine" subsequently remarked that "Anachronox" had "more extensive roots than a Banyan forest and more guarantee per square byte than a CD gathering of political discourses."
