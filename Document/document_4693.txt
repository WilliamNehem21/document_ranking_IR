"Ravenloft's" achievement prompted a spin-off in 1986 titled Ravenloft II: The House on Griffin Hill. In spite of the fact that Tracy Hickman was credited in "RavenloftÃÂ II", he had left TSR before the module was finished. The composing was finished by David "Zeb" Cook, Jeff Grubb, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles, following the Hickmans' framework. Every author sought after an alternate segment of the module so as to comply with the time constraint. Clyde Caldwell, who had done the majority of the workmanship for the first "Ravenloft" module, gave the spread, however inside craftsmanship was finished by Jeff Easley. The experience is intended for first release "Propelled Dungeons and Dragons" characters of levels 8Ã¢ÂÂ 10. The experience was 48 pages, and incorporated a substantial shading map and an external envelope. It imparted basic components to the first, including variable NPC objectives and variable areas for key articles, so that "Griffin Hill" plays diversely each time. The module's plot includes a curio known as "The Apparatus" that switches a beast's identity with that of a conventional townsperson; player characters, subsequently, are questionable about the genuine personality of the general population they meet. The module likewise presents Azalin the lich, who later turned into a noteworthy character in the Ravenloft crusade setting. This module is playable alone, or as a spin-off of the first "Ravenloft". It incorporates depictions of the town of Mordentshire, just as some spooky fields, and a lodge, all mapped in context like the first module.
