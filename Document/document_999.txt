The 2002 investigation showed that the progenitors of the dodo and the solitaire wandered around the Paleogene-Neogene limit. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, RÃÂ©union, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic birthplace and are under 10 million years of age. In this manner, the predecessors of the two fowls presumably stayed equipped for trip for an extensive time after the detachment of their heredity. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were put at the base of a heredity prompting the Raphinae, which demonstrates the flightless raphines had progenitors that had the capacity to fly, were semi-earthly, and possessed islands. This thus underpins the theory that the predecessors of those feathered creatures achieved the Mascarene islands by island jumping from South Asia. The absence of mammalian herbivores going after assets on these islands enabled the solitaire and the dodo to accomplish vast sizes and flightlessness. In spite of its dissimilar skull morphology and adjustments for bigger size, numerous highlights of its skeleton stayed like those of littler, flying pigeons. Another vast, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu monster pigeon ("Natunaornis gigoura"), was portrayed in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was just somewhat littler than the dodo and the solitaire, and it also is thought to have been identified with the delegated pigeons.
