The achievement of the photos drove Dean to offer Formby a seven-year contract with ATP, which brought about the creation of 11 films, in spite of the fact that Dean's kindred maker, Michael Balcon, considered Formby to be "an odd and not especially loveable character." The main film from the arrangement was discharged in 1935. "No Restriction" highlights Formby as a participant in the Isle of Man yearly Tourist Trophy (TT) cruiser race. Monty Banks coordinated, and Florence Desmond took the female lead. As per Richards, Dean did not attempt "to play down Formby's Lancashire character" for the film, and utilized Walter Greenwood, the Salford-conceived writer of the 1933 novel "Love on the Dole", as the scriptwriter. Taping was vexed, with Beryl being hard to everybody present. The essayist Matthew Sweet depicts the set as "a battleground" in light of her activities, and Banks fruitlessly mentioned that Dean bar Beryl from the studio. "The Observer" imagined that pieces of "No Restriction" were "quite dull stuff", yet the race film was "shot and slice to a limit of fervor." Regarding the star of the film, the commentator believed that "our Lancashire George is a stupendous fellow; he can muffle and jokester, play the banjo and sing with authorityÃÂ ... Still and everything, he doesn't do excessively terrible." The film was so prominent it was reissued in 1938, 1946 and 1957.
