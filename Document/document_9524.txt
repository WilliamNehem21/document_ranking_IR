Like the vast majority of the melodies from "Light Years", "Turning Around" is a "string-loaded" move pop track with conspicuous impacts from disco music. As per the sheet music of the tune distributed by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is made in the key out of F minor and highlights a moderate rhythm of 120 beats for every moment. Minogue's vocal range ranges from the low note of F to the high note of C. Tending to the topic of rehash, the verses proclaim that Minogue has changed and gained from her past missteps; it contains lines like "I'm turning near/Move out of my wayÃÂ ... I'm not the equivalent" and "Errors that I made have given me the solidarity to truly trust." In an examination of the verses of the tune, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics composed that Minogue requests consideration in the ensemble towards the adjustments as a part of her identity and affirms that individuals welcome them, in the line "I know you're feelin[g] me [be]cause you like it like this." The principal section manages Minogue freeing herself of things and images from quite a while ago and beginning over again, confirm in lines like "Discarded my old garments, showed signs of improvement closet." The pundit felt that in the second refrain Minogue faces her oversights and acknowledges herself as she seems to be. The extension of the tune includes the redundancy of the snare "You realize you like it like this," with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the verses, Minogue was conceding that discharging "Unimaginable Princess" in 1997 was not the best choice.
