Thomas' disobedience was the "focal residential occasion" of Michael II's rule, however it was not extremely damaging in material terms: with the exception of Thrace, which had experienced the delayed nearness of the opponent armed forces and the fights battled there, the bigger piece of the domain was saved the attacks of war. The Byzantine naval force endured extraordinary misfortunes, with the topical armadas specifically being crushed, while the land powers endured relatively couple of losses. This is customarily held to have brought about a military shortcoming and interior issue which was quickly abused by the Muslims: in the years after Thomas' insubordination, Andalusian outcasts caught Crete and the Tunisian Aghlabids started their triumph of Sicily, while in the East, the Byzantines were compelled to keep up a for the most part guarded position towards the Caliphate. Later grant has questioned how much the common war was in charge of Byzantine military disappointments amid these years, refering to different motivations to clarify them: Warren Treadgold opines that the realm's military powers recouped decently fast, and that clumsy military authority combined with "the remoteness of Sicily, the nonappearance of normal troops on Crete, the concurrence of the assaults on the two islands, and the administration's long-standing absence of enthusiasm for ocean control" were unmistakably progressively in charge of the loss of the islands.
