The gatehouse, called Monnow Gate, which gives Monnow Bridge its now one of a kind appearance, was included toward the finish of the thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth hundreds of years, twenty-five to thirty years after the extension itself was constructed. The siting of the gatehouse mid-channel is moderately surprising; the excavator David Harrison noticed the more typical course of action was for the door to be arranged on the roadway toward one side of the scaffold. In 1297, Edward I gave a murage concede for Monmouth because of a solicitation from his nephew, Henry of Lancaster. A murage was a medieval assessment, conceded explicitly to take into account the raising of assets to develop or fix town dividers. The give enabled the townspeople to fabricate the town dividers and doors, including the development of the gatehouse. By 1315, work was inadequate or required fix, as the first specialist was recharged on 1 June of that year. Around then, the scaffold would have been much smaller than now, with all traffic going underneath a solitary curve. The curve was secured by a portcullis, whose related notches are as yet unmistakable. The conspicuous angled machicolations, protective gaps through which stones or other material could be dropped on assailants, were included at an obscure date in the medieval period, perhaps in the late fourteenth century. The door framed piece of the town's guarded dividers. The cartographer John Speed's guide of 1610 shows dividers just on the northern side of the town, which lies unprotected by either the Monnow or the Wye, yet the excavator Ian Soulsby proposes it is "unfathomable" that Monnow Gate, and another door appeared by Speed driving out onto Chippenham Mead, remained solitary.
