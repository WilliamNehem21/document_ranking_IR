An investigation of the cranial estimations and jaw muscles of desperate wolves found no huge contrasts with present day dim scoundrels 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the equivalent with the exception of that the desperate wolf had bigger measurements, and the P4 had a moderately bigger, increasingly gigantic sharp edge that upgraded cutting capacity at the carnassial. The jaw of the critical wolf had a moderately more extensive and increasingly huge temporalis muscle, ready to create somewhat more chomp drive than the dark wolf. Because of the jaw game plan, the desperate wolf had less temporalis influence than the dim wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, yet the useful hugeness of this isn't known. The lower premolars were moderately marginally bigger than those of the dark wolf, and the critical wolf m1 was a lot bigger and had all the more shearing capacity. The desperate wolf canines had more noteworthy twisting quality than those of living canids of proportional size and were like those of hyenas and felids. Every one of these distinctions demonstrate that the critical wolf had the capacity to convey more grounded nibbles than the dark wolf, and with its adaptable and increasingly adjusted canines was better adjusted for battling with its prey.
