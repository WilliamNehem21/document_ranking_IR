"Missouri" came back to be a piece of the United States Navy save armada at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, until 12 January 1995, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She stayed in Bremerton, yet was not open to sightseers as she had been from 1957 to 1984. Disregarding endeavors by residents' gatherings to keep her in Bremerton and be re-opened as a visitor site, the U.S. Naval force needed to combine an image of the finish of World War II with one speaking to its start. On 4 May 1998, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton marked the gift contract that exchanged her to the not-for-profit USS "Missouri" Memorial Association (MMA) of Honolulu, Hawaii. She was towed from Bremerton on 23 May to Astoria, Oregon, where she sat in crisp water at the mouth of the Columbia River to execute and drop the saltwater barnacles and ocean grasses that had developed on her body in Bremerton, at that point towed over the eastern Pacific, and docked at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 22 June, just from the "Arizona" Memorial. Not exactly a year later, on 29 January 1999, "Missouri" was opened as an exhibition hall worked by the MMA.
