Information collected from Council reports in New South Wales from April to June 2013, demonstrated that hounds distinguished as Australian Cattle Dogs were associated with 66 assaults, where an assault is characterized as any episode where a canine surges at, chomps, annoys or pursues any individual or creature. Staffordshire Bull Terrier (155 assaults), German Shepherd (89) and American Staffordshire Terrier (88) were accounted for to be associated with more occurrences. Communicated as a level of enrolled hounds, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were associated with assaults. The information assembled in 2011Ã¢ÂÂ 2012 recorded the ACD twenty-seventh in contribution in episodes positioned by level of canines enrolled. A survey of episodes in Melbourne where a canine piece, surged at or pursued an individual or creature in an open space, found that there were sixty breeds included and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses represented 9% of occurrences. Studies of U.S. breed club individuals demonstrated that both puppy coordinated animosity and outsider coordinated hostility were higher in the ACD than the normal of breeds contemplated, with pooch coordinated animosity being the more common of the two hostility types. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs. The normal pass rate for all breeds is 80.4%.
