The delayed assault was rescheduled for the next day, and in spite of further issues with the tank support, the 48th Battalion had the capacity to push through to the second line of German channels in the Hindenburg Line east of Bullecourt. The position was viewed as secure if close gunnery support was given. In any case, mixed up ordnance and air eyewitnesses demanded that they had seen Australian troops past the Hindenburg Line, messages from the forward legions did not return to their higher central command, and the mounted guns authorities would not cut down the defensive blast required. Fortifications were unfit to traverse in adequate quality. At the point when a huge scale German counterattack built up, the 48th Battalion was nearly cut off in the caught German channels, and needed to battle out, taking substantial setbacks all the while. Of the around 750 men of the contingent associated with the assault, the unit lost 15 officers and 421 men. Leane's nephew Allan, who had driven the battle in the caught German channel, was caught in the wake of being injured and later kicked the bucket in a German medical clinic. The Australian administrators were scorching of the tanks, accusing them for the most part for the disappointment, with Leane notwithstanding blaming the tank teams for "weakness and ineptitude".
