The antiquarian John Bale in the 1550s listed six works of Foliot known to him, five of which were letters. The sixth work known to Bale was the commentary on the "Song of Songs", which survived in a single manuscript, now in the Bodleian Library. Young also recorded a "Lundinensis Ecclesiae" as being by Foliot. The scholar John Pits gave much the same list in 1619, adding one work, a "Vitas aliquot sanctorum Angliae, Librum unun", but this work never appears in a medieval book catalogue and has not survived under this name so it is unclear if Foliot wrote such a work. The antiquary Thomas Tanner, writing in the early 18th century, listed Foliot as the author of the seven works given by Bale and Pits, adding an eighth, the "Tractatus Gilberti, episcopi London: Super Istud "Sunt diuae olivae"", citing John Leland, the 16th-century antiquary, as his source. This apparently is the collection of nine sermons on Saints Peter and Paul that has yet to be published and is still in manuscript at the Bodleian Library. Leland also listed another work by Foliot, the "Omeliae Gileberti, episcopi Herefordensis", which he stated was held at Forde Abbey. This work, since lost, might have been the sermons mentioned above, or could have been a known collection of homilies, also lost. It is also possible that another Gilbert was the author. Lastly, Walter Map recorded that Foliot had begun work on a "the Old and the New Law" shortly before his death.
