BÃÂ©atrice contained three separate strongpoints shaping a triangle with the point confronting north. In the southeast, strongpoint Beatrice-3, its protections crushed by 75mm mountain firearms shooting at point-empty shell go, was rapidly overwhelm by the 209th Regiment's 130th Battalion. In the north, the vast majority of Beatrice-1 was quickly vanquished by the 141st Regiment's 428th Battalion, however the safeguards held out in corner of the situation for a period in light of the fact that the aggressors thought they had caught the whole strongpoint when they experienced an inside security fencing hindrance in obscurity. In the southwest, the strike on Beatrice-2 by the 141st Regiment's eleventh Battalion did not admission well since its attack channels were excessively shallow and bits of them had been leveled by French ordnance. Its endeavors to break Beatrice-2's security fencing were slowed down for a considerable length of time by flanking fire from Beatrice-1 and a few already undetected fortifications on Beatrice-2 that had been saved by the barrage. The holdouts on Beatrice-1 were dispensed with by 22:30 and the 141st Regiment's eleventh and sixteenth Battalions at long last broke into Beatrice-2 an hour later, however the strongpoint was not by any means taken until after 01:00 on March 14. Approximately 350 French legionnaires were executed, injured or caught. Around 100 figured out how to escape and rejoin the French lines. The French evaluated that Viet Minh misfortunes totalled 600 dead and 1,200 injured. The triumph at ""Beatrice"" "aroused the confidence" of the Viet Minh troops. On the next morning, a ceasefire of a couple of hours was concurred and the French were approved to go to the caught position and take some injured, given back by the Viet Minh.
