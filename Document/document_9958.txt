Whenever A. Koszul first distributed an interpretation of "Proserpine" in 1922, he contended "that the little traditional likes which Mrs. Shelley never dared to distribute are very as deserving of thought as her increasingly goal-oriented writing works". Be that as it may, his "Presentation" to the play talks for the most part of Percy Shelley and his commitment to Mary Shelley's works. Indeed, as he clarifies, he chose to distribute to add to the Percy Shelley century. Since their unique distribution, not one or the other "Midas" nor "Proserpine" has gotten much basic consideration. Pundits have either focused just to Percy Shelley's sonnets, or have disregarded the plays through and through. Artistic pundit Elizabeth Nitchie composes that the plays are "recognized just by the verses that [Percy] Shelley composed for them", and Sylvia Norman battles that they "don't generally call for diagnostic and similar examination". While "Frankenstein" has remained a ground-breaking social power since its distribution, Mary Shelley's different works have once in a while been republished and researchers have concentrated only on Mary Shelley, creator of "Frankenstein", and Mary Shelley, spouse of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Nonetheless, with the distribution of works by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor during the 1980s and "The Other Mary Shelley" in 1993, more consideration has been paid to Mary Shelley's "other" works, for example, her shows.
