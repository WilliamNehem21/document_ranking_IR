Antonov portrayed his motivation from London as "a major city, it's untidy, it's disordered and intenseÃÂ ...ÃÂ and it's both fascinating and recognizable to Americans and to Europeans." He featured the significance of that commonality to various societies since "you need to impart to many individuals when you make another bit of fiction." He said that Edinburgh gave a feeling of regulation and an assortment of structural plans, which were joined with a cutting edge vision which Antonov said was not equivalent to the metal, bolts, and steam of steampunk structure.

The pair maintained a strategic distance from the busier lanes and concentrated on side boulevards and back roads that would better suit the diversion's reality. Mitton expressed: "We were endeavoring to structure the diversion from a rodent's viewpointÃÂ ...ÃÂ if we have a little city, from an obliged perspective, what are all the distinctive points that we can investigate?" Inspiration additionally originated from the fine art of John Atkinson Grimshaw, Canaletto, and Gustave DorÃÂ©. The world guide was planned as a solitary bit of workmanship and was separated so the fashioners were sure about where every mission happens.
