"78 T" survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye by which rump Austria officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class, T-group boats, "76 T", "77 T" and "79 T", and four F-group boats she served with the KSCS Navy (later the Royal Yugoslav Navy, , KJRM; ÐÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²ÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ³Ð¾ÑÐ»Ð¾Ð²ÐµÐ½ÑÐºÐ° Ð Ð°ÑÐ½Ð° ÐÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÐ°). Transferred in March 1921, in KJRM service, "78 T" was renamed "T3". At the time of her transfer, she and the other 250t-class torpedo boats were the only modern sea-going warships in the Yugoslav fleet. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy. In MayâJune 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser "Dalmacija", the submarine tender "Hvar" and the submarines and , on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. It is not clear if "T5" was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval attachÃ© was reporting that Yugoslav ships were engaging in few exercises or manoeuvres due to reduced budgets.
