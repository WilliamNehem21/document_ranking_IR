Cooper surrendered his judgeship in November 1946 to look for the U.S. Senate situate emptied when A. B. "Cheerful" Chandler surrendered to acknowledge the situation of Commissioner of Baseball. Cooper's adversary, previous Congressman and Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives John Y. Darker, Sr., was better known and broadly accepted to be the most loved in the race. Notwithstanding, Brown had distanced Chandler's supporters in the Democratic Party amid a fervently challenged senatorial essential among Brown and Chandler in 1942, and this gathering neutralized his race in 1946. Further, the "Louisville Courier-Journal" contradicted Brown on account of his assaults on previous Senator J. C. W. Beckham and Judge Robert Worth Bingham, who were leaders of a ground-breaking political machine in Louisville. With these two elements neutralizing Brown, Cooper won the decision to fill Chandler's unexpired term by 41,823 votes, the biggest triumph edge by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time. His triumph checked just the third time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been famously chosen to the Senate. The move to Washington, D.C. turned out to be a lot for Cooper's now stressed marriage. In 1947, he sought legal separation, charging surrender.
