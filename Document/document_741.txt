At the point when the First World War started in August 1914, Wilkinson, in the same way as other in the Labor development, denounced it as a radical exercise that would result in the passings of a large number of specialists. By and by, she played the job of privileged secretary of the Manchester part of the Women's Emergency Corps (WEC), a body which found appropriate war work for ladies volunteers. With the appearance of war the NUWSS ended up partitioned between star war and expert harmony groups. They at last isolated, the peacemongers (counting Wilkinson's Manchester branch) in the end adjusting themselves to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WIL). With little suffrage action to sort out, Wilkinson searched for another activity, and in July 1915 was named as a national coordinator for the Amalgamated Union of Co-usable Employees (AUCE), with specific duty regarding the enrollment of ladies into the association. In this post she battled for equivalent pay for equivalent work, and for the privileges of incompetent and lower-paid specialists when these interests clashed with those of the more generously compensated specialty associations. She sorted out a progression of strikes to achieve these objectives with eminent triumphs in Carlisle, Coatbridge, Glasgow and Grangemouth.
