In his "Prospects Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time", history specialist Reinhart Koselleck examines Altdorfer's portrayal of time in an increasingly philosophical light. In the wake of separating between the shallow erroneous date found in the loss figures on the military pennants and the more profound chronological error imbued in the artistic creation's contemporary setting, he sets that the last kind is less a superimposition of one verifiable occasion over another and more an affirmation of the recursive idea of history. With reference to Koselleck, Kathleen Davis contends: "...ÃÂ for [Altdorfer], fourth century Persians look like sixteenth century Turks not on the grounds that he doesn't know the distinction, but since the distinction does not matterÃÂ ... The "Alexanderschlacht", at the end of the day, embodies a premodern, "untemporalized" feeling of time and an absence of chronicled consciousnessÃÂ ... Altdorfer's recorded overlays show an eschatological vision of history, proof that the sixteenth century (and by degrees likewise the seventeenth and eighteenth hundreds of years) remained secured a static, steady fleetingness that proleptically immerses the future as dependably a redundancy of the sameÃÂ ... In such a framework there can be no "occasion" all things considered: expectation and landing are as one sucked into the dark opening of sacrosanct history, which isn't temporalized in light of the fact that its time is basically undifferentiatedÃÂ ..."
