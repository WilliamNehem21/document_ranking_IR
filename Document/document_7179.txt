In 1097, the Crusader armed forces gathered at Constantinople having gone in gatherings eastbound through Europe. Alexios I, who had mentioned just some western knights to fill in as soldiers of fortune to help battle the Seljuk Turks, barred these armed forces in the city and would not allow them to leave until their pioneers swore vows promising to reestablish to the Empire any land previously having a place with it that they may vanquish while in transit to Jerusalem. The Crusaders in the long run swore these vows, separately instead of as a gathering. Consequently, Alexios gave them guides and a military escort. The Crusaders were anyway exasperated by Byzantine strategies, for example, arranging the surrender of Nicaea from the Seljuks while it was still under attack by the Crusaders, who would have liked to loot it to help fund their adventure. The Crusaders, feeling sold out by Alexios, who had the capacity to recoup various vital urban communities and islands, and in actuality a lot of western Asia Minor, proceeded on their way without Byzantine guide. In 1098, when Antioch had been caught after a long attack and the Crusaders were thus themselves assaulted in the city, Alexios walked out to meet them, at the same time, got notification from Stephen of Blois that the circumstance was miserable, he came back to Constantinople. The Crusaders, who had out of the blue withstood the attack, trusted Alexios had relinquished them and considered the Byzantines totally deceitful. Thusly, they viewed their pledges as refuted.
