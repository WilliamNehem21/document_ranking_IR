Duke Charles Eugene moved into the Neuer Hauptbau in 1757 and tasked La GuÃªpiÃ¨re with the apartment's decoration. Two years later, La GuÃªpiÃ¨re completed the entire suite except for the bedchamber, as the Duke occupied his wife's former suite in 1760 for his actual residence. The rest of the suite was used for social functions until it was emptied of furnishings in the next decade. A staircase and antechamber lead to the entrance of today's apartment, a gallery decorated by Ludovico Bossi. The initial rooms are the first and second antechambers, clad in green damask with portraits by Antoine Pesne and paneling by Michel Fressancourt, overdoors by MatthÃ¤us GÃ¼nther, boiserie flooring, and furniture by Jacques-Philippe Carel and Jean-Baptiste HÃ©douin that Charles Eugene acquired around 1750. The Assembly Room, restored in 2003, prominently features overdoors by Adolf Friedrich Harper and trophies of musical instruments above the windows. Charles Eugene's third-floor residence begins with the Corner Room, again painted by Harper, which feeds into a cabinet room and then finally the bedchamber, completed in 1770. Bossi created the ceiling's stucco in 1759â60, but the room and its two closets took another decade to complete. Additional rooms on the third floor housed relatives of the rulers of WÃ¼rttemberg and these have been occupied by the Ceramics Museum since 2004.
