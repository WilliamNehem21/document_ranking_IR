It was at first comprised of the sixteenth and the 22nd Guards Brigade, who were situated in Egypt, yet needed gunnery or other supporting arms.

Here, the division prepared for land and/or water capable activities in the Dodecanese. The weakening circumstance in North Africa, which saw General Erwin Rommel's "Afrika Korps" retake the region lost by the Italians amid Operation Compass, brought about the sixth Infantry Division being reassigned to guard Egypt.

The fourteenth Brigade later guarded the runway at Heraklion amid the Battle of Crete when 2,000 German paratroopers arrived in the region on 20ÃÂ May. The Germans had the capacity to enter into Heraklion, before Anglo-Greek powers cleared the town following substantial battling. Notwithstanding numerous misfortunes, the paratroopers had the capacity to delve in on edges around the detachment's positions. Because of the falling apart circumstance on Crete, the fourteenth Brigade was emptied by Royal Navy sends on 29 May. In transit to Egypt, they were over and again shelled by the "Luftwaffe", enduring 800 setbacks.
