"Experience of the German 1st Army in the Somme Battles", ("Erfahrungen der I Armee in der Sommeschlacht") was published on 30 January 1917 by Ludendorff but new defensive methods were controversial. During the Battle of the Somme in 1916 Colonel Fritz von LoÃberg (Chief of Staff of the 1st Army) had been able to establish a line of "relief" divisions (), with the reinforcements from Verdun, which began to arrive in greater numbers in September. In his analysis of the battle, LoÃberg opposed the granting of discretion to front trench garrisons to retire, as he believed that manoeuvre would not evade Allied artillery fire, which could blanket the forward area and invited French or British infantry to occupy vacant areas. LoÃberg considered that spontaneous withdrawals would disrupt the counter-attack reserves as they deployed and further deprive battalion and division commanders of the meand to conduct an organised defence, which the dispersal of infantry over a wide area had already made difficult. LoÃberg and others had severe doubts as to the ability of relief divisions to arrive on the battlefield in time to conduct an immediate counter-attack () from behind the battle zone. Sceptics wanted the tactic of fighting in the front line to continue, with authority devolved no further than battalion, to maintain organizational coherence in anticipation of a methodical counter-attack () by the relief divisions after Ludendorff was sufficiently impressed by LoÃberg's memorandum to add it to the new "Manual of Infantry Training for War".
