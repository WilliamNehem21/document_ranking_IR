With Rosberg resigning from Formula One toward the finish of 1986 season, underestimated Swede Stefan Johansson filled the McLaren situate nearby Prost for the season. Despite the fact that McLaren had presented the new Steve Nichols planned MP4/3 after three seasons with the MP4/2 display (Barnard had withdrawn for Ferrari), the TAG motors were not the power they had been formerly, falling behind in power and with shakiness beforehand concealed. He never surrendered however and tested Piquet and Mansell nearly until the end, winning three races and breaking Jackie Stewart's record for race triumphs by winning for the 28th time at the Portuguese Grand Prix. Prost considers his success in the opening round in Brazil as his best and most remunerating race ever. The Williams-Hondas had been predominant amid qualifying, and Prost began fifth on the lattice with a period three seconds slower than Mansell's post time. Realizing he didn't have the passing pace, he rather chipped away at his race set-up, and with every other person going for a high-downforce set-up, the Frenchman went the other way. The set-up implied less tire wear, on account of slower speeds in the corners while going quick down the straights. With his vehicle having less tire wear than his opponents, Prost had the capacity to get past the 61 laps of the grating JacarepaguÃÂ¡ Circuit with just two stops contrasted with the at least three by his adversaries (Piquet set for tires multiple times inside the initial 40 laps). Prost completed 40 seconds before Piquet, with Johansson a further 16 seconds back in third.
