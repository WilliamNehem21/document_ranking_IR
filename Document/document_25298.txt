Fouroux was succeeded by Daniel Dubroca, who coached the team to the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he resigned after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-AndrÃ© turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc LiÃ¨vremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. LiÃ¨vremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. But there was also a 59â16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22â21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19â14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, before the World Cup, it was announced that Philippe Saint-AndrÃ© would replace LiÃ¨vremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This came as no surprise to LiÃ¨vremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.
