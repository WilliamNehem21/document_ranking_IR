Be that as it may, discontent was blending underneath the surface. A portion of this was because of existing issues deserted by the late lord, while much was because of the new ruler's insufficiencies. The issues were triple. First there was discontent with the regal approach for financing wars. To fund the war in Scotland, Edward I had progressively turned to alleged prises Ã¢ÂÂ or purveyance Ã¢ÂÂ to arrangement the troops with victuals. Despite the fact that a flawlessly real strategy for fund-raising, the friends felt that the purveyance had turned out to be dreadfully oppressive and remuneration was by and large lacking or missing altogether. Likewise, they didn't care for the way that Edward II took prises for his family without proceeding with the war exertion against Scotland, causing the second issue. While Edward I had spent the most recent decade of his rule perseveringly battling against the Scots, his child surrendered the war on the whole. In this circumstance, the Scottish ruler Robert Bruce before long accepted the open door to recapture what had been lost. This not just uncovered the north of England to Scottish assaults, yet in addition endangered the assets of the English baronage in Scotland.
