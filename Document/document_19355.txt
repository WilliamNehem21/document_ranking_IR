In "Stegosaurus stenops" there are 27 bones in the vertebral column anterior to the sacrum, a varying number of vertebrae in the sacrum, with four in most subadults, and around 46 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The presacrals are divided into cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals, the total number being one greater than in "Hesperosaurus", two greater than "Huayangosaurus", although "Miragaia" preserves 17 cervicals and an unknown number of dorsals. The first cervical vertebra is the axis bone, which is connected and often fused to the atlas bone. Farther posteriorly, the proportionately larger the cervicals become, although they do not change greatly in anything other than size. Past the first few dorsals, the centrum of the bones become more elongate front-to-back, and the transverse processes become more elevated dorsal. The sacrum of "S. stenops" includes four sacral vertebrae, but one of the dorsals is also incorporated into the structure. In some specimens of "S. stenops", a caudal is also incorporated, as a caudosacral. In "Hesperosaurus" there are two dorsosacrals, and only four fused sacrals, but in "Kentrosaurus" there may be as many as seven vertebrae in the sacrum, with both dorsosacrals and caudosacrals. "S. stenops" preserves 46 caudal vertebrae, and up to 49, and along the series both the centrums and the neural spines become smaller, until the neural spines disappear at caudal 35. Around the middle of the tail, the neural spines become bifurcated, meaning they are divided near the top.
