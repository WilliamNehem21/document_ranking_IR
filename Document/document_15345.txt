Caracciola tested the new Mercedes-Benz W25 at the AVUS track in April, and despite his injuriesâhis right leg had healed fiveÂ  shorter than his left, leaving him with a noticeable limpâhe was cleared to race. However, Neubauer withdrew the Mercedes team from their first race, also at the AVUS track, as their practice times compared too unfavourably to Auto Union's. Caracciola was judged not fit to race for the Eifelrennen at the NÃ¼rburgring, but made the start for the German Grand Prix at the same track six weeks later. He took the lead from Auto Union driver Hans Stuck on the outside of the Karussel on the 13th lap, but retired a lap later when his engine failed. He had better luck at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix in September. In very hot weather, Caracciola started from fourth and moved to second, where he trailed Stuck. After 59Â laps, the pain in his leg overwhelmed him, and he pitted, letting teammate Fagioli take over his car. Fagioli won from Stuck's car which by then had been taken over by Nuvolari. His best results in the rest of the season were a second place in the Spanish Grand Prixâhe led before Fagioli passed him, much to the anger of Neubauer, who had ordered the Italian to hold positionâand first at the Klausenpass hillclimb.
