Nirvana frequently adjusted the tune's verses and rhythm for live exhibitions. Some live exhibitions of the melody had the line "our little gathering has dependably been" changed to "our little clan has dependably been", which can be heard on the 1996 live collection "From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah". "Moving Stone" commented that the "Wishkah" rendition of "Adolescent Spirit" "[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the tune's melodic limits and starting new life in that about played-out hit". A striking interchange act of "Scents Like Teen Spirit" happened on BBC's "Top of the Pops" in 1991, amid which the band would not emulate to the pre-recorded sponsorship track and Cobain sang in an intentionally soft tone and modified various verses in the tune (for instance, "Burden up on weapons, bring your companions" progressed toward becoming "Burden up on medications, murder your companions"). Cobain later said he was attempting to seem like previous Smiths frontman Morrissey. At the point when "Top of the Pops" was dropped in 2006, "The Observer" recorded Nirvana's execution of "Scents Like Teen Spirit" as the third most prominent in the show's history. This execution can be found on the 1994 home video "Live! Today around evening time! Sold Out!!".
