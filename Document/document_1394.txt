The site, Riggs Quarry 13, is situated on a little slope later known as Riggs Hill; it is today set apart by a plaque. More "Brachiosaurus" fossils are accounted for on Riggs Hill, however other fossil finds on the slope have been vandalized. Amid exhuming of the example, Riggs misidentified the humerus as a disfigured femur because of its incredible length, and this appeared to be affirmed when a similarly measured, all around saved genuine femur of a similar skeleton was found. In 1904, Riggs noted: "Had it not been for the uncommon size of the ribs discovered related with it, the example would have been disposed of as an Apatosaur, excessively inadequately safeguarded to be of esteem." It was simply after arrangement of the fossil material in the research center that the bone was perceived as a humerus. The exhuming pulled in substantial quantities of guests, deferring the work and compelling Menke to monitor the site to keep bones from being plundered. On 17 August, the last bone was jacketed in mortar. Following a closing ten-day prospecting trip, the undertaking came back to Grand Junction and contracted a group and wagon to transport all fossils to the railroad station, amid five days; one more week was spent to pack them in thirty-eight boxes with a weight of . On 10 September, Riggs left for Chicago via train, touching base on the fifteenth; the railroad organizations let the two travelers and freight travel for nothing, as an advertising motion.
