After the account sessions were finished, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the collection to a few people, including the leader of DGC's parent organization Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the gathering's administration organization Gold Mountain. At the point when gotten some information about the criticism he got, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, "The adults don't care for it." He said he was told his songwriting was "unacceptable", the sound was "unlistenable", and that there was vulnerability that standard radio would respect the sound of Albini's creation. There were not many individuals at Geffen or Gold Mountain who needed the band to record with Albini in the first place, and Cobain felt he was accepting an implicit message to scrap the sessions and start from the very beginning once more. Cobain was disturbed and said to Azerrad, "I should just re-record this record and do something very similar we did a year ago in light of the fact that we sold out a year agoÃ¢ÂÂthere's no motivation to attempt and vindicate ourselves as craftsmen now. I can't support myselfÃ¢ÂÂI'm simply putting out a record I might want to tune in to at home." However, some of the gathering's companions preferred the collection, and by April 1993, Nirvana was resolved to discharging "In Utero" as it seemed to be. As indicated by Cobain, "obviously, they need another "Don't bother", yet I'd preferably kick the bucket over do that. This is actually the sort of record I would purchase as a fan, that I would appreciate owning."
