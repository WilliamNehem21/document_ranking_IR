A significant number of the period's craftsmanships were dispatched by ministry for their chapels, with determinations for a physical arrangement and pictorial substance that would supplement existing compositional and configuration plans. A thought of how such church insides may have looked can be seen from both van Eyck's "Madonna in the Church" and van der Weyden's "". As per Nash, van der Weyden's board is a shrewd take a gander at the presence of pre-Reformation holy places, and the way in which pictures were put so they reverberated with different works of art or items. Nash proceeds to state that, "any one would fundamentally be found in connection to different pictures, rehashing, broadening, or differentiating the picked subjects". Since mavericks focused on places of worship and church buildings, vital data about the presentation of individual works has been lost, and with it, bits of knowledge about the significance of these fine arts time permitting. Numerous different works were lost to shoot or in wars; the separation of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European clash until 1945. Van der Weyden's "The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald" polyptych is maybe the most noteworthy misfortune; from records it seems to have been tantamount in scale and desire to the "Ghent Altarpiece". It was crushed by French mounted guns amid the barrage of Brussels in 1695, and is today known just from a woven artwork duplicate.
