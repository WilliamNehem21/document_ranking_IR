Netley was brought about by the compelling Peter des Roches, who was Bishop of Winchester from 1205 until his passing in 1238; the monastery was established not long after his demise, in 1239. The organizer's contract demonstrates the name of the monastery as "the congregation of St Mary of Edwardstow", or the Latin "Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de loco Sancti Edwardi" despite the fact that the title of the contract calls it "Letley"; the present name of Netley is probably gotten from this. The nunnery was one of a couple of religious communities which the minister planned as a dedication to himself; the other is La ClartÃÂ©-Dieu in Saint-Paterne-Racan, France. Des Roches started to buy the grounds for Netley's underlying enrichment in around 1236, yet he passed on before the task was done and the establishment was finished by his agents. As indicated by the Chronicle of Waverley Abbey, the main priests touched base to settle the site on 25ÃÂ July 1239 from neighboring Beaulieu Abbey, a year after the priest's demise. The reality of its author earlier demise before assignment of the enrichment was finished, put the nascent convent in a troublesome budgetary circumstance. It is felt that simply after the house was taken under the wing of Henry III, who ended up intrigued by it in the mid-1240s, was advance made on the structures. The King in the long run accepted the job of supporter in 1251.
