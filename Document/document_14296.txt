In October 1954, flooding brought about by Hurricane Hazel caused the pulverization of scaffolds and structures in the valley. As a result of the demolition on the Don and different streams, the common legislature of Ontario prohibited advancement on waterway floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was shaped, consolidating all protection experts in charge of Toronto watersheds (counting the DVCA), with more noteworthy forces to oversee valley lands. The MTRCA started dispossessing exclusive land in the valley for flood control, regularly making or rationing open space employments. Sauriol, who was by then a representative of the MTRCA, was one of only a handful few to stand in opposition to the expressway venture. Sauriol's cabin at the Forks of the Don would be dispossessed by Metro Toronto for the road, albeit quite a bit of his territory is currently part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which reaches out from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, noticeable from the turnpike. On the other hand, Metro director Gardiner had a contrary supposition of the Don Valley and was cited "I'll disclose to you what the Don Valley was. It was a spot to kill young men, that is the thing that it was."
