"The Wind Cries Mary" is the principal number recorded by the Experience; Hendrix composed the verses after a contention with his sweetheart, Kathy Etchingham, whose center name is Mary. She clarified: "I crushed plates on the floor, [and] he cleared them up. He secured me in the washroom for totally ages andÃÂ ... in the end Chas' better half Lotta let me outÃÂ ... I headed out to get a taxi and was remaining under the traffic lights, and I had red hair and a red dress. I returned after I'd chilled off and he'd officially composed it." The tune highlighted a harmony movement roused by Curtis Mayfield and verses that mirrored Hendrix's profound respect of Bob Dylan. "Stone Free" communicated Hendrix's craving to protect his individual flexibility, disputing the ideas of congruity and long haul connections. He returned to this topic in "51st Anniversary" and "Expressway Chile". Overlooked from the American variant of the collection, "Red House" did not see an official discharge in the US until the 1969 aggregation "Raving successes". An unordinary highlight of the account is that it does exclude a low pitch guitar track; Redding rather played mood guitar with his leveling set firmly for bass tones. It is Hendrix's solitary unique twelve-bar blues.
