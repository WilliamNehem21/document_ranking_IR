When "The Man in the Moone" was distributed, discourse on the majority of universes had started to support the likelihood of extraterrestrial life. For Christian masterminds such a majority is personally associated with Christ and his reclamation of man: if there are different universes, do they share a comparative history, and does Christ additionally reclaim them in his penance? As indicated by Philipp Melanchthon, a sixteenth century scholar who worked intimately with Martin Luther, "It must not be envisioned that there are numerous universes, since it must not be envisioned that Christ passed on or was revived all the more regularly, nor must it be suspected that in some other world without the information of the child of God, that men would be reestablished to unceasing life". Comparative remarks were made by Calvinist scholar Lambert Daneau. Halfway through the seventeenth century the issue seems to have been settled for a conceivable majority, which was acknowledged by Henry More and Aphra Behn among others; "by 1650, the Elizabethan Oxford examination question "a sint plures mundi?" ('can these be numerous worlds?'ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ to which the right Aristotelian answer was 'no') had been supplanted by the controversy proposal "quod Luna sit habitabilis" ('that the moon could be habitable'ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ which may be addressed 'most likely' if not 'yes')".
