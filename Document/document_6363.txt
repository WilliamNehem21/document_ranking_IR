Ankaa is the most brilliant star in the group of stars. It is an orange monster of evident visual size 2.37 and ghostly sort K0.5IIIb, 77 light years inaccessible from Earth and circled by an optional item about which little is known. Lying close by Ankaa is Kappa Phoenicis, a primary arrangement star of otherworldly sort A5IVn and clear greatness 3.90. Found midway in the asterism, Beta Phoenicis is the second most brilliant star in the group of stars and another double star. Together the stars, both yellow monsters of ghostly sort G8, sparkle with a clear size of 3.31, however the parts are of individual obvious sizes of 4.0 and 4.1 and circle each other at regular intervals. Zeta Phoenicis or "Wurren" is an Algol-type obscuring double, with an evident greatness fluctuating somewhere in the range of 3.9 and 4.4 with a time of around 1.7 days (40 hours); its darkening outcomes from the segment two blue-white B-type stars, which circle and shut out one another from Earth. The two stars are 0.05 AU from one another, while a third star is around 600 AU far from the pair, and has an orbital period surpassing 5000 years. The framework is around 300 light years inaccessible. In 1976, specialists Clausen, Gyldenkerne, and GrÃÂ¸nbech determined that an adjacent eighth size star is a fourth individual from the framework.
