Having arranged to travel back overland from Peking to rendezvous with "Alceste" at Canton, Amherst was ferried to the mouth of the Hai River on 9 August. As the mission and return journey would take several weeks, Maxwell had an opportunity to explore the area. "Alceste" headed north, while "Lyra", under the command of Lieutenant Basil Hall, was sent south. "General Hewitt", an East Indiaman chartered to carry gifts for the Emperor of China, was to explore the centre channel. "Alceste" first undertook a survey of the Gulf of Liaodong, at that time virtually unknown to Europeans, and after spending some time exploring the Liaodong Peninsula, proceeded southward to Jiaozhou Bay on the coast of Shandong, where she encountered "General Hewitt", and was later joined by Hall in "Lyra". "Alceste" and "Lyra" left the bay on 29 August for the west coast of Korea, an area that had not been surveyed since the Jesuit missionaries visited in the 16th and 17th centuries. Maxwell found the Korean coast to be some 130 miles further east than expected, and in the process of exploration also discovered the archipelago that forms the south-western tip of the Korean peninsula. "Alceste" was then turned towards the Loo Choo Islands, now known as the Ryukyu archipelago, dropping anchor in the Napakiang roads on the south-west side of Okinawa on 16 September 1816. After a six-week stay, "Alceste" returned to China via the southern end of the island of Taiwan, arriving at the mouth of the Pearl River on 2 November.
