In support of "MI", on 27 May 1942, "Kaga" departed the Inland Sea with the Combined Fleet on her final mission, in the company of carriers "Akagi", , and which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions. Her aircraft complement was 27 Zeros, 20 D3As, and 27 B5Ns. With the fleet positioned northwest of Midway Island at dawn on 4 June 1942, "Kaga" contributed eighteen D3As, commanded by Lieutenant ShÅichi Ogawa, escorted by nine Zeros to the strike against the island. The carrier's B5Ns were armed with torpedoes and kept ready in case enemy ships were discovered during the Midway raid. One each of the D3As and Zeros was shot down by AA fire over Midway, and another four D3As were damaged. "Kaga"s Zero pilots claimed to have shot down 12 US aircraft over Midway Island. One "Kaga" B5N was launched to augment the fleet's reconnaissance of the surrounding ocean. The carrier also put up two Zeros on CAP. Another five Zeros reinforced her CAP at 07:00 and the seven fighters helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US air attackers from Midway Island at 07:10. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese "MI" plan from signals intelligence and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.
