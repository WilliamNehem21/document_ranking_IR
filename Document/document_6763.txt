The Percys were faithful Lancastrians, yet Edward IV in the long run won the baron's faithfulness. Northumberland had been caught and detained by the Yorkists in 1461, losing his titles and bequests; in any case, Edward discharged him eight years after the fact and reestablished his earldom. From that time Northumberland served the Yorkist crown, guarding northern England and keep up its tranquility. At first the lord had issues with Richard III as Edward prepped his sibling to be the main influence of the north.

Be that as it may, in the wake of getting to be the best, Richard started forming his nephew, John de la Pole, first Earl of Lincoln, to deal with the north, disregarding Northumberland for the position. As indicated by Carpenter, in spite of the fact that the lord was adequately redressed, he surrendered all expectations regarding any plausibility of headway under Richard.
