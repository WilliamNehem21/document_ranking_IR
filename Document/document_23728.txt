A tribute in honor of Iwata, reading "This game is dedicated to our wingman who fell in battle", was placed at the end of the credits for "Star Fox Zero". Another speculated tribute appears in the Nintendo Switch 2017 launch title "", a game in development at the time of his death. A non-playable character, who bears a striking resemblance to Satoru Iwata, asks for the player to go atop Satori Mountain in search of the mystical Lord of the Mountain. Given the similarity between "Satori" and "Satoru" and the fact that the Lord of the Mountain is seen as a guiding spirit, the quest is thought to be an elaborate tribute to Iwata. In September 2017, modders discovered that an emulated version of the NES game "Golf", which Iwata programmed, is included in every Nintendo Switch console's firmware, and can be accessed by moving the Joy-Con controllers similarly to how Iwata would move his hands in Nintendo Direct presentations when the system clock is set to July 11, the day of his death; this appeared to be removed by Nintendo with a system update issued later that year. Within "PokÃ©mon Ultra Sun" and "Ultra Moon", visiting the Game Freak building with PokÃ©mon transferred from "PokÃ©mon Gold" and "Silver" has a non-player character relate how they were having trouble getting data onto the Game Boy Color game cards until they were helped by an "amazing guy"; this acknowledges Iwata's contribution to "Gold" and "Silver" that allowed them to include the whole of the world from "PokÃ©mon Red" and "Blue" without compromising the size of the "Gold"/"Silver" world. Within "", a daily challenge that occurs on each December 6 (Iwata's birthday) uses a unique avatar based on Iwata.
