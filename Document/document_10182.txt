With the two-penny piece liable to be canceled, just 65,000 were struck for dissemination in 1872; it is hazy why they were struck by any means. On JanuaryÃÂ 18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Archibald Loudon Snowden griped that the "3" in the date, as struck by the Mint, too intently looked like a "8", particularly on the littler estimated sections. Accordingly, Pollock requested the new boss etcher, William Barber (Longacre had kicked the bucket in 1869), to re-imprint the date, opening the arms of the "3" more extensive on generally divisions. The two-penny piece was struck just in evidence condition in 1873, and because of its February cancelation, there ought not have been time or purpose behind Barber to re-etch the coin. By and by, it exists in "Shut 3" and "Open 3" assortments. Breen proposed that the "Open 3" assortment was really struck sometime in the not too distant future, most likely surreptitiously; it was not known to exist until found by a numismatist during the 1950s. Numismatist Paul Green credited the two assortments to the two sorts of confirmation sets that the Mint sold at the time that would have contained the two-penny piece. The "nickel set" contained just the low-esteem coins without valuable metal, while another contained likewise the silver coins; he recommended that one assortment was struck for each.
