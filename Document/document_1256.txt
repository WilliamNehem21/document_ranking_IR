A large portion of "xx" was recorded from late December to late January before McDonald and Smith started a comprehensive blending process, which kept going two weeks. For every melody, they blended a couple of tracks of each instrument and utilized Waves Audio parts to balance the chronicles. Having delighted in how the demos caught unintended foundation commotions, for example, road sounds, McDonald purposely left certain sounds that would have generally been undesirable in the last blend. "I needed it to seem like individuals in a room, as opposed to this cleaned sort of flawless crystalline thing", he clarified. "It was all the little subtleties that we truly preferred." In February, the gathering composed and recorded "Dream", "Safe house", and "Interminability" before completing "xx", perhaps by the end of the month as per McDonald; the collection's liner notes credited the last date of chronicle as April 2009. Sim sang his vocals for "Interminability" in favor of the studio inverse from Croft after his mouthpiece had been accidentally moved there, which brought about a far off sounding vocal trade on the melody. While recording "Asylum", a mechanical part from the guitar intensifier extricated and made it make a clacking sound, which McDonald and the xx held. "It was much the same as this missing bit of percussion that the track required!", McDonald reviewed.
