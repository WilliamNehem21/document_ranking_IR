On 7 June, following rushed fixes to his lead, an armada comprising of ten boats of the line and a fourth-rate joined Nelson off Toulon. The armada, under the order of Captain Thomas Troubridge, had been sent by Earl St. Vincent to strengthen Nelson, with requests that he was to seek after and block the Toulon guard. In spite of the fact that he currently had enough ships to challenge the French armada, Nelson endured two incredible burdens: He had no knowledge with respect to the goal of the French, and no frigates to scout in front of his power. Striking southwards in the desire for gathering data about French developments, Nelson's boats ceased at Elba and Naples, where the British minister, Sir William Hamilton, revealed that the French armada had passed Sicily traveled toward Malta. In spite of requests from Nelson and Hamilton, King Ferdinand of Naples would not loan his frigates to the British armada, dreading French backlashes. On 22 June, a brig cruising from Ragusa presented to Nelson the news that the French had cruised eastwards from Malta on 16 June. In the wake of meeting with his chiefs, the naval commander chose that the French target must be Egypt and set off in interest. Inaccurately trusting the French to be five days ahead instead of two, Nelson demanded an immediate course to Alexandria without deviation.
