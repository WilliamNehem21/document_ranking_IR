The Greenbackers saw the effect of Civil War loyalties all the more intensely as they competed for Southern votes. Weaver set out on a talking voyage through the South in July and August. In spite of the fact that the neighborhood Greenback parties had seen some ongoing achievement, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general at the leader of the ticket, confronted more restriction. The gathering's romance of dark voters, as well, compromised the white Democratic foundation, prompting vicious upheavals at Weaver's mobilizes and dangers against his supporters. As Weaver battled in the North in September and October, Republicans blamed him for intentionally partitioning the vote to enable Democrats to win a majority in peripheral states. Despite the fact that Weaver wouldn't collaborate with Democrats in running combination slates of presidential voters, in state-level races, Greenback competitors did regularly join with Democrats to crush Republican hopefuls. In the September gubernatorial race in Maine, one such combination ticket named Harris M. Plaisted, who barely crushed the officeholder Republican in what was believed to be a sheltered state for that party. The unexpected annihilation sent a stun through the Garfield battle, and made them reconsider their system of waving the ridiculous shirt.
