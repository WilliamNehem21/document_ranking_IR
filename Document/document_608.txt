Before the JWP acknowledgment of their need, the Japanese group had informally recommended different names: "japonium", after their nation of origin; "nishinanium", after Japanese physicist Yoshio Nishina, the "establishing father of present day material science look into in Japan"; and "rikenium", after the organization. After the acknowledgment, the Riken group assembled in February 2016 to settle on a name. Morita communicated his craving for the name to respect the way that component 113 had been found in Japan. "Japonium" was considered, influencing the association with Japan simple to distinguish for non-Japanese, yet it was dismissed as Jap is viewed as an ethnic slur. The name "nihonium" was picked following an hour of consideration: it originates from , one of the two Japanese elocutions for the name of Japan. The pioneers likewise expected to reference the help of their examination by the Japanese individuals (Riken being on the whole government-supported), recoup lost pride and trust in science among the individuals who were influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi atomic catastrophe, and respect Japanese scientist Masataka Ogawa's 1908 revelation of rhenium, which he named "nipponium" with image Np after the other Japanese elocution of Japan's name. As Ogawa's case had not been acknowledged, the name "nipponium" couldn't be reused for another component, and its image Np had since been utilized for neptunium. In March 2016, Morita proposed the name "nihonium" to IUPAC, with the image Nh.
