In the wake of King John's demise in October 1216, Neville and his child came to terms with the new lord, HenryÃÂ III, John's child. The two men had their properties reestablished in 1217, however the workplaces that the senior Neville had held were not returned rapidly. Guardianship of some illustrious timberlands was returned by 1220, however the workplace of Chief Forester was not returned until some time later. In 1218 Neville should have had the woods of Rockingham came back to his authority, however William de Forz, the Count of Aumale, wouldn't return it. It was not until 1220 that de Neville figured out how to recoup his care of Rockingham backwoods. By 1224 Neville was yet again Chief Forester, however he never recaptured the power and impact that he had held under John. When he lost the workplace for the second time is misty. The history specialist C. R. Youthful states that he held the workplace until his demise in 1234 when it go to his child John, however Daniel Crook, writing in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", guarantees that Neville lost the forester office in 1229, to be supplanted by John of Monmouth and Brian de Lisle. He likewise filled in as Sheriff of Lincolnshire.
