The red-capped parrot was first described in 1820 by German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl as "Psittacus spurius", from an immature specimen collected in Albany, Western Australia on the Baudin expedition (1801â1803) and housed at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The specific epithet "spurius" is the Latin adjective meaning "illegitimate", and refers to the markedly different adult and immature plumages (hence appearing unrelated). Irish naturalist Nicholas Aylward Vigors named the species "Platycercus pileatus" in 1830 from an adult male specimen that had been acquired by the Zoological Society of London. English artist Edward Lear illustrated the live specimen in his 1830 work "Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots". It was placed in the monotypic genus "Purpureicephalus"âas "P. pileatus"âby French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The generic name is an amalgam of the Latin "purpureus" "purple", and the Ancient Greek "kephalÃ©" "head". In this generic combination, the current name is translated as "bastard red-head". The species name "pileatus" was generally used until German naturalist Otto Finsch followed Kuhl in using the specific name "spurius", calling it "Platycercus spurius" in 1868. His countryman Anton Reichenow classified "Purpureicephalus" as a subgenus of "Platycercus" before placing it in the genus "Porphyreicephalus" (later corrected to "Porphyrocephalus"), until 1912, when Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews re-established the genus as "Purpureicephalus". The red-capped parrot's elongated bill and its unusual colorationâlack of cheek patches compared with "Platycercus"âare the main reasons for its placement in its own genus.
