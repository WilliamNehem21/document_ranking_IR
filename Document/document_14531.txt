The hindlimb of "Cetiosauriscus" is around 3/2 the length of the forelimb. The two ilia are exceptionally fragmentary, however the opposite sides supplement each other to give a sensible thought of the extents of the total bone. The ilium is long, and has a long and slim pubic peduncle. It is relatively lower than in "Cetiosaurus", being comparative in extents to "Haplocanthosaurus" and the later "Titanosauridae". The left femur is finished, however part of the pole is dissolved away. It is exceptionally slim, being tall yet just wide at the center. This extremely gracile femoral morphology is imparted to "Amphicoelias", "Shunosaurus", "Ligabuesaurus" and an example of "Diplodocus", being more gracile than "Cetiosaurus" and most different eusauropods. An unmistakable fourth trochanter is available, however the rest of the pole is extremely packed. The tibia, fibula and pes are additionally protected, however are fragmentary and disarticulated making correlations troublesome, the lower hindlimb being about upstanding. The foot is like "Diplodocus" and "Brontosaurus", where the main toes are vast and ripped at, and the external ones are little and clawless. Metatarsal III is the longest, trailed by metatarsal IV, II, V and I. Metatarsal I is the most extensive, and the width of the bones diminishes numerically.
