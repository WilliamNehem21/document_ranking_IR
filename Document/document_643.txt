"Chesapeake" left from Hampton Roads on 27 April 1802 and touched base at Gibraltar on 25ÃÂ May; she quickly put in for fixes, as her principle pole had part amid the voyage. Morris stayed at Gibraltar while watching for news on the area of his squadron, as a few boats had not revealed in. On 22ÃÂ July "Adams" touched base with remiss requests for Morris, dated 20ÃÂ April. Those requests were to "lay the entire squadron before Tripoli" and arrange harmony. "Chesapeake" and "Venture" left Gibraltar on 17ÃÂ August destined for Leghorn, while giving security to a guard of trader transports that were headed for transitional ports. Morris made a few stops in different ports before at last landing at Leghorn on 12ÃÂ October, after which he cruised to Malta. "Chesapeake" attempted fixes of a spoiled bowsprit. "Chesapeake" was still in port when "John Adams" landed on 5ÃÂ January 1803 with requests dated 23ÃÂ October 1802 from Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith. These coordinated "Chesapeake" and "Group of stars" to come back to the United States; Morris was to exchange his direction to "New York". "Heavenly body" cruised straightforwardly as requested, however Morris held "Chesapeake" at Malta, asserting that she was in no condition to make an Atlantic voyage amid the winter months.
