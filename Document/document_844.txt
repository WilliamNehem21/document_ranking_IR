"Eraserhead" sound structure has been viewed as one of its characterizing components. In spite of the fact that the film includes a few trademark visualsÃ¢ÂÂthe disfigured newborn child and the rambling mechanical settingÃ¢ÂÂthese are coordinated by their going with sounds, as the "unending mewling" and "suggestive aural scene" are combined with these separately. The film includes a few consistent modern sounds, giving low-level foundation clamor in each scene. This encourages a "compromising" and "startling" air, which has been imitated in works, for example, David Fincher's 1995 spine chiller "Seven" and the Coen siblings' 1991 dramatization "Barton Fink". The consistent low-level clamor has been seen by James Wierzbicki in his book "Music, Sound and Filmmakers: Sonic Style in Cinema" as maybe a result of Henry Spencer's creative ability, and the soundtrack has been portrayed as "mercilessly careless of the contrast among dream and reality". The film additionally starts a pattern inside Lynch's work of relating diegetic music to dreams, as when the Lady in the Radiator sings "In Heaven" amid Spencer's all-inclusive dream arrangement. This is additionally present in "Scene 2" of "Twin Peaks", in which diegetic music continues from a character's fantasy to his waking considerations; and in 1986's "Blue Velvet", in which a comparable center is given to Roy Orbison's "In Dreams".
