The 13th season of "South Park" generally maintained the average Nielsen rating viewership for the series, around 3Â million viewers per episode. The season premiere, "The Ring", was seen in 3.41Â million households. That would prove to be the largest individual viewership for any Comedy Central show that season, outperforming even a highly anticipated and publicized episode of "The Daily Show" involving Jon Stewart's ongoing feud with CNBC and pundit Jim Cramer. The 13th season of "South Park" received its lowest viewership in the episodes "Dances with Smurfs", seen in 1.47Â million households; "W.T.F.", seen in 1.37Â million households; and "The F Word", seen in 1.99Â million households. However, "The F Word" was the highest rated show of the season among viewers between ages 18 and 49, and outperformed "The Jay Leno Show", NBC's primetime talk show. The season finale, "Pee", was seen in 2.87Â million households, which made it the most watched cable show of the night. Likewise, "The Coon", seen in 3.27Â million households, was the most watched cable program among ages 18 to 49 the week it aired. Several episodes from the 13th season of "South Park" were the most watched Comedy Central shows the week they aired, including "Margaritaville" (2.77Â million households), "Fatbeard" (2.59Â million households), "Eat, Pray, Queef" (3Â million households) and "Fishsticks" (3.1Â million households). The latter two episodes were watched by over 1Â million more viewers than the network's second-highest-rated shows in their respective weeks.
