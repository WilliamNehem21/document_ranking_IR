Punk refered to his wellbeing as the fundamental reason he left WWE, portraying that in his last a very long time in the organization he had been working through an untreated and possibly deadly MRSA contamination, broken ribs, harmed knees and various blackouts, including one at the 2014 Royal Rumble, just as having lost his craving and capacity to rest soundly. Punk felt that WWE was influencing and hurrying him to wrestle before he had completely recouped. As per Punk, he found a knot on his back in November 2013 and it was analyzed as a greasy store by Dr. Chris Amann, who would not evacuate it in spite of Punk's solicitations. The week after Punk left WWE, his significant other April Mendez persuaded him to get the knot checked by her specialist. The specialist analyzed it as a MRSA disease and revealed to Punk that he could have kicked the bucket due to overlooking it for so long. Punk had the specialist clear the disease, portraying it as the most noticeably bad torment in his life, yet said that once it was dealt with and he was on more grounded medicine, he had the capacity to rest superior to anything he had in months.
