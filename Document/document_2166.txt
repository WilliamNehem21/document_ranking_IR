Fermi Szilard still trusted that huge amounts of uranium would be required for a nuclear bomb, and consequently focused on delivering a controlled chain response. Fermi asked Alfred O. C. Nier to isolate uranium isotopes for assurance of the fissile segment, and, on 29 February 1940, Nier isolated the main uranium-235 example, which, subsequent to being sent to Dunning at Columbia, was affirmed to be the disengaged fissile material. When he was working in Rome, Fermi had found that impacts among neutrons and neutron arbitrators can back the neutrons off, and subsequently make them bound to be caught by uranium cores, making the uranium splitting. Szilard recommended to Fermi that they use carbon as graphite as an arbitrator. As a back-up plan, he thought about substantial water. This contained deuterium, which would not ingest neutrons like standard hydrogen, and was a superior neutron arbitrator than carbon; however overwhelming water was costly and hard to create, and a few tons of it may be required. Fermi evaluated that a fissioning uranium core created 1.73 neutrons all things considered. It was sufficient, yet a cautious plan was called for to limit misfortunes. (Today the normal number of neutrons produced per fissioning uranium-235 core is known to be about 2.4).
