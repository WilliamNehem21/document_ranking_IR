As indicated by Payne, Le Guin does not expressly censure the idea of religion by and large, yet the propensity inside religion to diminish "reality" to that which can be contained and constrained by the human personality. This "control" is just conceivable inside the completely human-made condition on board the rocket, which Le Guin delineates as lacking components of the "lavishly finished" genuine world, and which denies people the encounters of "ferocity" which make life intriguing. In Payne's view the story challenges the thought, basic to Western culture, that people, and innovation, can take care all things considered; it does as such by exhibiting a whole planet as a framework not amiable to control. A 2002 survey in "Salon" magazine likewise featured the religious topics in the story, expressing that Le Guin offered an abnormal interpretation of the subject of religion by portraying a "faction of agnostics" nourished by the propensity to religious congruity among individuals. Researcher Max Haiven additionally said that "Heavens Lost" showed the human requirement for fantasy and otherworldliness, and the manners by which control structures could emerge even in social orders arranged with the purpose of staying away from them. As indicated by Haiven, the zeroth era tragically assumed that they could make a totally discerning society; rather, the rising arrangement of religion carried with it pressure and male centric benchmarks of conduct.
