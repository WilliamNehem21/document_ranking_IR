In 1998, Goodwin and partners considered "Ornatotholus" an adolescent "S. validum", in this manner a lesser equivalent word. In 2000, Robert M. Sullivan alluded "S. edmontonensis" and "S. brevis" to the variety "Prenocephale" (up to that point just known from the Mongolian species "P. prenes"), and thought that it was more probable that "S. bexelli" had a place with "Prenocephale" than to "Stegoceras", yet thought of it as a "nomen dubium" (questionable name, without recognizing characters) because of its deficiency, and noticed its holotype example had all the earmarks of being lost. In 2003, Thomas E. Williamson and Thomas Carr considered "Ornatotholus" a "nomen dubium", or maybe an adolescent "Stegoceras". In a 2003 amendment of "Stegoceras", Sullivan concurred that "Ornatotholus" was a lesser equivalent word of "Stegoceras", moved "S. lambei" to the new class "Colepiocephale", and "S. sternbergi" to "Hanssuesia". He expressed that the variety "Stegoceras" had turned into a wastebasket taxon for little to medium-sized North American pachycephalosaurs until that point. At this point, many examples had been alluded to "S. validum", including numerous vaults too fragmented to be in any way recognized as "Stegoceras" with sureness. UALVP 2 is as yet the most total example of "Stegoceras", whereupon most logical comprehension of the family is based.
