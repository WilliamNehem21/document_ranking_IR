Esther Newton, writing in 1989, gives an alternate point of view of Hall's apparently befuddling delineation of Stephen's lesbianism and its conflation with her sexual orientation, pivoting her talk on comprehension "The Well" in its recorded and social setting. Newton contends that "Corridor and numerous different women's activists like her grasped [...] the picture of the manly lesbian [...] essentially in light of the fact that they frantically needed to break out of the abiogenetic model of sentimental fellowship" pervasive in the nineteenth century. Sex was viewed as something that "could just happen within the sight of a majestic and imperious penis", to such an extent that sex between ladies was basically not perceived to exist. Newton indicates how sexologists of the time, similar to Ellis, echoes this conclusion, where his "antifeminism and hesitance to see dynamic desire in ladies submitted him to combining reversal and manliness". In a general public "aware of sex and its immense significance", Stephen feels prohibited from the unbending, ladylike job forced on her as a natural female. Thus, for Stephen's lesbianism to be perceived by the perusers in that time, Hall needed to intentionally indicate Stephen "enter(ing) the male world, [...] as a lesbian in male body drag", which at the same time empowered the ladylike ladies in the novel to exhibit their lesbianism through "relationship with their manly accomplices".
