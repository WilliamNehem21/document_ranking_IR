It was Warelwast who told Anselm in 1103 that the ruler would not allow his arrival to England. This came after a fizzled joint mission by Warelwast and Anselm to Paschal endeavoring to determine the debate among Henry and the ecclesiastical overseer over the ruler's induction of priests, a question commonly known as the Investiture Controversy. All things considered, the lord had given directions that if the mission fizzled, Warelwast was to educate Anselm that he should possibly to come back to England in the event that he concurred with the ruler's situation in the question. In 1106 Warelwast was the lord's moderator in the discourses that prompted the settlement of the Investiture Controversy in England. The ruler at last lost small, giving up the privilege to give the real images of episcopal specialist to a recently chosen cleric as an end-result of proceeding to get tribute from the priests. Right off the bat in 1106 Warelwast was sent to Bec Abbey, where Anselm was dwelling in a state of banishment, to illuminate him of the settlement and convey to the diocese supervisor the lord's welcome to come back to England. In May 1107 Warelwast went about as the lord's agent at Paschal's chamber at Troyes, where Paschal was endeavoring to verify support for Bohemond of Antioch's proposed crusade against Byzantium. Warelwast presumably transferred to the pope the news that King Henry would endeavor no commitment to Bohemond's endeavors.
