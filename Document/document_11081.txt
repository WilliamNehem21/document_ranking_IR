Only minutes after the diversion finished, Appalachian State understudies started celebrating on the two principle boulevards in Boone, North Carolina: King Street and Rivers Street. The gathering in the end progressed to Kidd Brewer Stadium, Appalachian State's home field, and tore down one of the goalposts. The understudies continued to convey the goalpost over a mile before saving it in the front yard of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. He approved of this, saying "in the same class as today was for Appalachian State, they can take it up there and put it down. I can hardly wait to arrive and see it." Several understudies hopped bare into the duck lake behind ASU's eating corridor, a grounds custom for celebrating enormous football triumphs. At the point when the group came back to their arena in transports at 11:00ÃÂ p.m., they were welcomed by a horde of thousands of understudies and fans. It took the group 20ÃÂ minutes to get from their transports to the storage space because of the group. The festival in Boone was not constrained to Appalachian State's grounds; the Boone Mall was "overwhelmed" with vehicles, and a games attire shop conveying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, revealed that deals were multiple times higher than ordinary.
