The gathering composed and played out kids' music that was not quite the same as what had been done beforehand; as Cook expressed, "we didn't simply go down the course of what individuals believe is children's music". They were not attached to one style or kind of music and regularly tested in the studio; while a portion of their accounts were instrumental, others had an all the more live feel. The gathering knew that their tunes were regularly kids' first introduction to music. "Guitar Magazine" guessed that since Cook was one of the primary guitarists kids were presented to, he might be the most persuasive guitarist on the planet. Cook was cognizant that he was most likely the main guitarist kids would see, and stated, "I generally feel that in the event that it rouses children to play guitar later on that would be incredible. I figure it would be extremely pleasant if in 15ÃÂ years I read that someone got into guitar playing on account of [The] Wiggles". In 2013, after Cook resigned from visiting with the gathering and turned into their visiting director, he announced that more up to date groups like Regular John moved toward him and said that The Wiggles were the primary band "they got into".
