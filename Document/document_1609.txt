Bowie achieved his pinnacle of ubiquity and business accomplishment in 1983 with "We should Dance". Co-created by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the collection went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles ended up Top 20 hits in the two nations, where its title track achieved number one. "Present day Love" and "China Girl" each made No. 2 in the UK, joined by a couple of "engrossing" limited time recordings that biographer David Buckley said "actuated key originals in the pop world. 'We should Dance', with its little account encompassing the youthful Aborigine couple, directed 'youth', and 'China Girl', with its exposed mooched (and later halfway controlled) shoreline lovemaking scene (a tribute to the movie "From Here to Eternity"), was adequately explicitly provocative to ensure substantial revolution on MTV". Stevie Ray Vaughan was visitor guitarist playing solo on "How about we Dance", in spite of the fact that the video portrays Bowie emulating this part. By 1983, Bowie had risen as a standout amongst the most critical video specialists of the day. "How about we Dance" was trailed by the Serious Moonlight Tour, amid which Bowie was joined by guitarist Earl Slick and support vocalists Frank and George Simms. The world visit kept going a half year and was amazingly mainstream." At the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards Bowie got two honors including the debut Video Vanguard Award.
