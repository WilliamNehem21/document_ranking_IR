At the point when Kyril Bonfiglioli took over in 1964, he grumbled in his first article that he had "quite recently perused a fourth of a million expressions of ms [manuscript] and half of it was so terrible it made me become flushed". He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the main unsold stories Aldiss had were from his initial days, "composed before I got the hang of things", however Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, "They can't in any way, shape or form be more terrible than the trash that is being submitted". Aldiss gave four stories to the initial two issues, under his own name and two nom de plumes, "Cracken" and "John Runciman". Bonfiglioli's third issue included Keith Roberts' initial two stories: "Idealism", a time travel story, and "Anita", the first in an arrangement about a witch; Roberts turned into an incessant patron both under his own name and as "Alistair Bevan", and furthermore gave the fine art to a few spreads. "The Day of the Minotaur", another recorded dream by Thomas Burnett Swann, started serialization in a similar issue under the title "The Blue Monkeys". Swann's tale "The Weirwoods" was additionally serialized in the magazine, with no difference in title. Other new journalists that started to show up under Bonfiglioli's editorship included Josephine Saxton and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli's emphasis on stories that he preferred actually, instead of on a particular publication approach, drove creator Christopher Priest to depict "Science Fantasy" under Bonfiglioli's editorship as "a proficient and charmingly flighty magazine, with an environment all its own".
