Question with Somalia over the Northern Frontier District (NFD) proceeded; for quite a bit of Kenyatta's standard, Somalia remained the significant danger to his administration. To manage sporadic savagery in the district by Somali "shifta" guerrillas, Kenyatta sent warriors into the area in December 1963 and gave them wide powers of capture and seizure in the NFD in September 1964. English troops were doled out to help the Kenyan Army in the district. Kenyatta likewise confronted household resistance: in January 1964, areas of the military propelled an insurrection in Nairobi, and Kenyatta approached the British Army to put down the disobedience. Comparative equipped uprisings had occurred that month in neighboring Uganda and Tanganyika. Kenyatta was shocked and shaken by the rebellion. He freely reproached the rebels, underlining the requirement for lawfulness in Kenya. To anticipate further military turmoil, he acquired an audit of the compensations of the military, police, and jail staff, prompting pay rises. Kenyatta likewise needed to contain parliamentary resistance and at Kenyatta's provoking, in November 1964 KADU formally broke up and its delegates joined KANU. Two of the senior individuals from KADU, Ronald Ngala and Daniel arap Moi, hence turned into a portion of Kenyatta's most faithful supporters. Kenya subsequently turned into a "true" one-party state.
