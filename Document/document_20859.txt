"S. gracilis" was the smallest species, estimated at in weight, about the size of a jaguar. It was similar to its predecessor "Megantereon" of the same size, but its dentition and skull were more advanced, approaching "S. fatalis". "S. fatalis" was intermediate in size between "S. gracilis" and "S. populator". It ranged from . and reached a shoulder height of and body length of . It was similar to a lion in dimensions, but was more robust and muscular, and therefore had a larger body mass. Its skull was also similar to that of "Megantereon", though more massive and with larger canines. "S. populator" was among the largest known felids, with a body mass range of , and one estimate suggesting up to . It stood at a shoulder height of . Compared to "S.Â fatalis", "S.Â populator" was more robust and had a more elongated and narrow skull with a straighter upper profile, higher positioned nasal bones, a more vertical occiput, more massive metapodials and slightly longer forelimbs relative to hindlimbs. Large tracks from Argentina (for which the ichnotaxon name "Smilodonichium" has been proposed) have been attributed to "S. populator", and measure by . This is larger than tracks of the Bengal tiger, to which the footprints have been compared.
