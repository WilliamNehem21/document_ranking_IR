Promotion began in January, with performances by Smith at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and appearances at the debut of the "Oliver!" 2009 revival. Smith also took part in a photoshoot for publicity and cover photos. According to writers for the "Daily Mail", the cover photo was modified to give Smith "a smile worthy of a model from a Colgate advert", due to her "gappy teeth". Though generally critical of the move, the report conceded that it was better for Smith's teeth to be digitally straightened, rather than forcing her "to endure a battery of dental surgery". A television advert and music video for "River of Light" were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith also appeared on the cover of April's "Classic FM Magazine". Further promotion in the weeks leading up to the release of "Faryl" included Smith appearing on "Loose Women", "The Paul O'Grady Show", BBC Radio 4, Radio Five Live and "BBC Breakfast". She also appeared at the Children's Champion Awards and met then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street. On the day of the release, there was an album signing in Smith's hometown of Kettering, at the HMV branch. Smith said "I definitely want to be at home for the launch. I want to be surrounded by my friends and family because, obviously, it's a big deal for me."
