Bacon's work from the 1970s has been portrayed by the workmanship faultfinder Hugh Davies as the "furious force of a battle against death". Bacon conceded amid a 1974 meeting that he thought the most troublesome part of maturing was "losing your companions". This was a grim period in his life, and however he was to live for an additional seventeen years, he felt that his life was practically finished, "and every one of i've's loved ones are dead". His worry is reflected in the obscured fragile living creature and foundation tones of his works of art from this period. His intense feeling of mortality and familiarity with the delicacy of life were uplifted by Dyer's passing in Paris. In the following three years he painted numerous pictures of his previous sweetheart, including the arrangement of three "Dark Triptychs" which have come to be viewed as among his best work. Various qualities tie the triptychs together: the type of a monochromatically rendered entryway includes halfway on the whole, and each is surrounded by level and shallow dividers. In every three Dyer is stalked by a wide shadow; which appears as pools of blood or tissue in the external boards and the wings of the blessed messenger of death in the left hand and focal pictures. In its showcase inscription for "TriptychÃ¢ÂÂ August 1972" the Tate display expressed, "What passing has not as of now expended leaks incontinently out of the figures as their shadows."
