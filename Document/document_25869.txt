In 1997, the game's designers produced a 47-page document that outlined the game's premise and vision statement, and was used to pitch the idea to management at Interplay. Initially, the game was to be called "Last Rites", and they described the game as "avant-garde" fantasy to distinguish it from high fantasy. The document also contained concept artwork for characters and areas of the game. It was one of three "Planescape" games being developed by Black Isle at the time, along with a PlayStation game by Colin McComb based on FromSoftware's "King's Field", and a PC game by Zeb Cook; the other two were cancelled, and only "Last Rites" was released as "Torment". McComb, one of the designers of the overall "Planescape" setting, joined the "Torment" project after his game fell through.
From the outset, "Planescape: Torment"s designers intended to challenge traditional role-playing game conventions: the game features no dragons, elves, goblins, or other common fantasy races; there are only three swords; the rats faced in the game can be quite challenging to defeat; and the undead sometimes prove more sympathetic than humans. The designers explained that most RPGs tend to have a "correct" approach to solving problems, which is almost always the morally good approach. They called this "predictable and stupid" and wished to make a game with greater moral flexibility, where a particular problem might have "two wrongs or two rights". The main quest is not about saving the world, but about understanding The Nameless One and his immortality. Death (of the protagonist or his companions) is often just a minor hindrance, and even necessary at times.
