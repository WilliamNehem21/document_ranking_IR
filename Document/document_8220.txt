In 1995, Sampson noticed that prior investigations had discovered that the horns and decorations of ceratopsians in all likelihood had a capacity in intraspecific showcase and battle, and that these highlights would subsequently have come about because of sexual determination for fruitful mating. Similarly, in 1997 Horner inferred that such ornamentation was utilized by guys to set up strength and that females would have favored very much prepared guys as their posterity would then acquire these qualities, giving a multiplication advantage. Dodson imagined that in the Centrosaurinae as a rule the presentation estimation of the ruffle had been decreased contrasted with the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation. Sampson in 1995 rejected the likelihood that the distinction in skull ornamentation among "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" spoke to sexual dimorphism, for three reasons. Right off the bat, the broad "Einiosaurus" bone beds did not contain any examples with supervisors, as would have been normal in the event that one of the genders had them. Also, "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" are found in strata of an alternate age. Thirdly, in a circumstance of sexual dimorphism normally just a single of the genders demonstrates overstated optional sexual characters. "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" be that as it may, each have built up a particular arrangement of such qualities.
