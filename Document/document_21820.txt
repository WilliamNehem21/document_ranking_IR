As a group, the lemurs of Madagascar are extremely diverse, having evolved in isolation and radiated over the past 40 to 60Â million years to fill many ecological niches normally occupied by other primates. In the recent past, their diversity was significantly greater, with 17Â extinct species sharing body proportions and specializations with lorises and various non-primates, such as tree sloths, giant ground sloths, koalas, and striped possums (genus "Dactylopsila"). The diversity of lemur communities today can be as high as 10 to 12Â species per region; communities of 20 or more lemur species existed as recently as 1,000Â years ago in areas that now have no lemurs at all. Just like living species, many of the extinct species shared overlapping ranges with closely related species (sympatry) through niche differentiation (resource partitioning). Among all the late Quaternary assemblages of megafauna, only Madagascar was dominated by large primates.
Although anatomical evidence suggests that even the large, extinct species were adapted to tree-climbing, some habitats, including gallery forests and the spiny forests of southern Madagascar, in which they occurred would not have allowed them to be strictly arboreal. Even today, most lemur species will visit the ground to cross open areas, suggesting that the extinct species did the same. Monkey lemurs (family Archaeolemuridae), including "Archaeolemur majori" and "Hadropithecus stenognathus", have been reconstructed as being primarily terrestrial. In contrast, the sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae) were highly arboreal despite the large size of some species.
