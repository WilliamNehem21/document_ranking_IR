Keita Takahashi had contemplated workmanship and entered the Musashino Art University to think about chiseling in 1995. Amid his investigations, he went to a logic that his specialty expected to join reasonable components alongside a touch of eccentricity and cleverness. After graduation, Takahashi never again wanted to seek after chiseling as a full-time vocation, and saw the possibility to wind up engaged with computer games as a way to proceed with his specialty enthusiasm for a bigger medium. Joining Namco as a craftsman around 1999, Takahashi chipped away at various littler undertakings for the distributer. One of these was classified "Activity Drive", roused by "Insane Taxi" however with more government operative based components on the driving ongoing interaction. Amid this, Takahashi thought of the thoughts of the characters that would be vital to "Katamari Damacy": the King, the Queen, and the Prince of all Cosmos. His thought would have been that the ruler had been grabbed by specialists on Earth, and the sluggish King sends the Prince to save her. To do this, the player would utilize the humble Prince's head, molded like a mallet, to paralyze people, after which the Prince would then "drive" the people around by putting a guiding wheel on the back of the human's head. Takahashi felt this would prompt fascinating and imaginative ongoing interaction, enabling the player to make devastation as the Prince pursued the misinformed recommendations from the King, yet the undertaking head dismissed the thought. "Activity Drive" was in the long run dropped.
