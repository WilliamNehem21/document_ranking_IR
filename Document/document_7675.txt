Aside from being a nearby in respect to the red rail, the connections of the Rodrigues rail are dubious and the two are ordinarily recorded as independent genera, "Aphanapteryx" and "Erythromachus", however have here and there been joined as types of "Aphanapteryx". GÃÂ¼nther and E. Newton first conventionally synonymised the two out of 1879 in view of their skeletal likenesses. In 1945, the French scientist Jean Piveteau discovered skull highlights of the two species sufficiently diverse for conventional detachment, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson expressed that however the two species were comparative and gotten from a similar stock, they had additionally veered significantly, and ought to conceivably be kept independent. In view of geographic area and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson recommended that they were identified with the genera "Gallirallus", "Dryolimnas", "Atlantisia", and "Rallus". Mourer-ChauvirÃÂ© and associates likewise thought about the two as having a place with discrete genera. Rails have achieved numerous maritime archipelagos, which has as often as possible prompted speciation and development of flightlessness. As per the British scientists Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume, the way that the red rail lost quite a bit of its plume structure demonstrates it was segregated for quite a while. These rails might be of Asian starting point, in the same way as other Mascarene winged animals.
