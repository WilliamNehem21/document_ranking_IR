"HÅshÅ" began the Pacific War in the Third Carrier Division assigned to the 1st Fleet under Vice Admiral ShirÅ Takasu. The carrier, captained by Karou Umetani, was tasked along with "ZuihÅ" to provide air support, including scouting, anti-submarine patrols, and combat air patrol for the Combined Fleet's "Main Body" battle-line of six battleships: , , , , , and . With the Main Body, "HÅshÅ" sortied from the Inland Sea on 7 December 1941 to provide distant cover for the carrier forces under ChÅ«ichi Nagumo which were attacking Pearl Harbor. The battleship force turned back east of Japan, but "HÅshÅ" became separated on 10 December due to radio silence restrictions while conducting anti-submarine air operations. The carrier was located by scout aircraft the next day east of the Main Body and returned to port at Kure on 12 December.
On 29 May 1942, "HÅshÅ" sortied from Japan with the rest of the fleet for the operation which resulted in the Battle of Midway, providing modest air protection, scouting, and anti-submarine support for the Main Body, now consisting of the battleships , "Nagato", and "Mutsu". Her aircraft complement for the operation consisted of eight obsolete Yokosuka B4Y carrier attack aircraft (torpedo bombers).
