The orange-, yellow-or tan-shaded pileus (top) is up to wide, despite the fact that examples estimating have been reported. It is commonly fairly unpredictable fit as a fiddle (it might be arched or curved at development), with a wavy edge that is rolled internal when youthful. Tops develop in a mutilated shape when organic product bodies are firmly grouped. The top surface is commonly dry and smooth, albeit develop examples may indicate splitting. Seen from over, the tops of develop examples look like fairly those of chanterelles. The tissue is thick, white, firm, fragile, and wounds yellow to orange-dark colored. The underside is thickly secured with little, thin whitish spines estimating long. These spines at times rundown something like one side of the stipe. The stipe, normally long and thick, is either white or a similar shading as the top, and is now and then askew. It is not entirely obvious the mushrooms when they are arranged among gilled mushrooms and boletes, in light of the fact that the top and stipe are genuinely unexceptional and the mushrooms must be swung over to uncover their spines. The unadulterated white assortment of this species, "H.ÃÂ repandum" var. "collection", is littler than the primary assortment, with a top estimating wide and a stipe that is long.
