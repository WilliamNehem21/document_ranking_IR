In 2000, Bartley and ÃÂÃÂ Briain had been guaranteed "selective access" to ChÃÂ¡vez by the administration's Minister of Communications. They touched base in Venezuela in September 2001. While taping the pilot they met the president, after which they reevaluated their methodology. Bartley clarified, "We hadÃÂ ... this idea of examining ChÃÂ¡vezÃ¢ÂÂwould he say he was a fanatic? Was the media persona simply that? What really matters to him? My sense had changed as we drew nearer; what we're seeing here is a person who is persuaded, driven, not the rabble rouser with another side, drinking, frolicking. I started to consider him to be increasingly straightforwardÃ¢ÂÂwhat you see is the thing that you get." Bartley and ÃÂÃÂ Briain started by endeavoring to assemble an association with ChÃÂ¡vez that would permit them the entrance they required. At first, the president's staff treated the producers with doubt and made taping troublesome. After various postponements, Bartley and ÃÂÃÂ Briain at last broke through to ChÃÂ¡vez. They determined that they expected to "press the correct catches" to pick up his help, so they gave him an old release of the diaries of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, who had battled close by SimÃÂ³n BolÃÂ­var. Inside, they had composed a statement from the Irish communist dramatist SeÃÂ¡n O'Casey. Gradually, Bartley and ÃÂÃÂ Briain picked up their subjects' trust, "dissolving any reluctance because of their cameras".
