The 2003 disclosure of an early fossil bat from the 52 multi year old Green River Formation, "Onychonycteris finneyi", shows that flight developed before echolocative capacities. "Onychonycteris" had hooks on every one of the five of its fingers, while present day bats have at most two paws on two digits of each hand. It additionally had longer rear legs and shorter lower arms, like climbing well evolved creatures that hang under branches, for example, sloths and gibbons. This palm-sized bat had short, expansive wings, recommending that it couldn't fly as quick or to the extent later bat species. Rather than fluttering its wings consistently while flying, "Onychonycteris" presumably switched back and forth among folds and skims noticeable all around. This proposes this bat did not fly as much as present day bats, yet flew from tree to tree and invested the vast majority of its energy climbing or holding tight branches. The particular highlights of the "Onychonycteris" fossil likewise bolster the speculation that mammalian flight in all probability advanced in arboreal locomotors, as opposed to earthbound sprinters. This model of flight improvement, generally known as the "trees-down" hypothesis, holds that bats originally flew by exploiting tallness and gravity to drop down on to prey, instead of running quick enough for a ground-level take off.
