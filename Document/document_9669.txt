Prior to the 1946 season, Feller marked a $50,000 contract for the year, including a reward for participation, as the Indians felt many were going to ball games essentially to see him; he was offered $100,000 by Jorge Pasquel to play in the Mexican League, yet declined to leave the States once more. Feller recorded his second profession no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He permitted five strolls and struck out 11 Yankees. Feller said of the amusement, "The no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that gets all the consideration. In any case, my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a vastly improved group than the White Sox. There was no examination. I needed to pitch to Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees out." At one point amid the season (as Feller idea he may close Rube Waddell's AL record for strikeouts), Feller affirmed Waddell's record of 344 strikeouts with the AL office instead of 349. In his last appearance of the period on September 29, Feller tossed five strikeouts against the Detroit Tigers to set the then-AL single-season strikeout record. Amid the 1946 season, he enrolled profession highs in strikeouts (348), recreations began (42) and amusements pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete diversions (36) and innings pitched (377.1)Ã¢ÂÂ all significant alliance bests that season. Feller completed 26Ã¢ÂÂ 15 with an ERA of 2.18, the last a profession low. Almost 20 years after the fact, Feller reviewed, "For the 1946 season, however, the Indians were so slender in pitching that Boudreau chose I was to pitch each fourth day, paying little mind to rainouts, open dates, or whatever else."
