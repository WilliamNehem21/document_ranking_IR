Stunning Stories Quarterly was a U.S. sci-fi mash magazine that was distributed somewhere in the range of 1928 and 1934. It was propelled by Hugo Gernsback as a buddy to his "Astounding Stories", the principal sci-fi magazine, which had started distributing in April 1926. "Astonishing Stories" had been sufficiently fruitful for Gernsback to attempt a solitary issue of an "Astounding Stories Annual" in 1927, which had sold well, and he chose to line it up with a quarterly magazine. The primary issue of "Stunning Stories Quarterly" was dated Winter 1928 and conveyed a reproduce of the 1899 rendition of H.G. Wells' "The point at which the Sleeper Wakes". Gernsback's strategy of running a novel in each issue was prevalent with his readership, however the selection of Wells' epic was less so. Throughout the following five issues, just a single more reproduce showed up: Gernsback's very own novel "Ralph 124C 41+", in the Winter 1929 issue. Gernsback went bankrupt in mid 1929, and lost control of both "Astonishing Stories" and "Astounding Stories Quarterly"; his colleague, T. O'Conor Sloane, took over as proofreader. The magazine started to keep running into monetary troubles in 1932, and the timetable ended up unpredictable; the last issue was dated Fall 1934.
