He stood up unequivocally against the lynching of Ell Persons in 1917. People, a dark man blamed for assaulting and executing a sixteen-year-old white young lady, had been singed alive before a horde of thousands in Memphis, and his remaining parts dismantled, dispersed, and showed. Fineshriber assembled a congregational conference to challenge the lynching, persuaded the participation to embrace an open judgment of it, and went about as secretary to a gathering of pastors who issued an announcement denouncing the training. He likewise persuaded the proofreader of Memphis' biggest paper, "The Commercial Appeal", to compose a publication reprimanding the lynching. Fineshriber upheld different causes influencing African-Americans; he attempted to improve their lodging, talked at dark houses of worship, and helped raise assets for them. He scrutinized the Ku Klux Klan from his podium, the main minister in Memphis to do as such. In 1921 he promoted his expectation to "lecture on the Ku Klux Klan" at Children of Israel at an occasion that, it was trusted, would draw in numerous non-individuals. The Klan had re-composed in Memphis that year, and not exactly a month after Fineshriber's discourse, walked openly in Nashville's Armistice Day march. In spite of dangers against him, his better half, and youngsters, Fineshriber kept on lecturing against the Klan at the sanctuary and different scenes.
