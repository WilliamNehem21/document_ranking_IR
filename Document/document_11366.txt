Amid the previous century, the invented journal has created as an acknowledged methods for comedic articulation; the first has, says Morton, "been rich ground which has developed numerous seeds". An early precedent is Anita Loos' tale of 1925: "Refined men Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady" in which the hero, Lorelei Lee, records her coy experience in exposition that "pursues the idiosyncrasies of conversational discourse" and recommends honesty or obliviousness yet, the pundit Elyse Graham watches, "vaudevilles, in abrading point of interest, the vernacular of the American white collar class". The journal kind turned out to be especially well known in the late twentieth century. In 1978Ã¢ÂÂ 81 Christopher Matthew delivered three volumes of journals recording the day by day life of "Simon Crisp", a lone wolf would-be man-about town of the period. The title of the main, "The Diary of a Somebody", is an immediate reference to the Grossmith unique. Assessing this volume in "The Spectator", Benny Green calls attention to a few parallels with the first, in both character and occasion. Matthew's book, says Green, is entertaining, however the Grossmiths' book is unrivaled; it is "influencing just as clever, such that the Matthew pastiche isn't". In 1982 came the primary appearance of Sue Townsend's adolescent creation, Adrian Mole, whose section into youthful masculinity and early middle age is diagrammed in a long arrangement of journals. The more moderately aged he moves toward becoming, says Morton, the more he takes after Pooter.
