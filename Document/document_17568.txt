 Multnomah and Clackamas counties were named after groups of Native Americans who lived in the area before settlement by European Americans in the 19thÂ century. Evidence suggests that people lived in the northern Oregon Cascades as early as 10,000Â years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000Â years ago, the Clackamas River basin, about upriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek and on the east side of the Willamette, was home to the Clackamas tribe. They were a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived near the Columbia River from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to its confluence with the Columbia River. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800Â people living in 11Â villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands. Another group of Chinookans, the Multnomahs, lived on Sauvie Island, about downriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek. Lewis and Clark estimated that 800Â Multnomahs inhabited 5Â villages on the island in 1806, but disease reduced them later in the century to near extinction.
