The police attempted to control a portion of the group, thumping a couple of individuals down, which induced observers significantly more. A portion of those bound in the wagon got away when police left them unattended (intentionally, as indicated by certain observers). As the group endeavored to topple the police wagon, two squad cars and the wagonÃ¢ÂÂwith a couple of cut tiresÃ¢ÂÂleft quickly, with Inspector Pine asking them to return at the earliest opportunity. The bustle pulled in more individuals who realized what was going on. Somebody in the group announced that the bar had been attacked in light of the fact that "they didn't satisfy the cops", to which another person hollered "How about we pay them off!" Coins cruised through the air towards the police as the group yelled "Pigs!" and "Faggot cops!" Beer jars were tossed and the police lashed out, scattering a portion of the group who found a building site close-by with piles of blocks. The police, dwarfed by somewhere in the range of 500 and 600ÃÂ people, got a few people, including society vocalist Dave Van RonkÃ¢ÂÂwho had been pulled in to the revolt from a bar two entryways far from the Stonewall. In spite of the fact that Van Ronk was not gay, he had encountered police savagery when he took an interest in antiwar exhibits: "The extent that I was concerned, anyone who'd remain against the cops was OK with me, and that is the reason I remained in... Each time you pivoted the cops were pulling some shock or another." Ten copsÃ¢ÂÂincluding two policewomenÃ¢ÂÂblockaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (an author for "The Village Voice"), and a few cuffed prisoners inside the Stonewall Inn for their own security.
