Born on 13Â April 1901 in Tylden, Victoria, Joe Hewitt was the son of Reverend J.H.Â Hewitt. He attended Scotch College, Melbourne, before entering the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay in 1915, aged 13. Graduating in 1919, Hewitt rose to lieutenant in the RAN before volunteering for secondment to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a flight lieutenant in January 1923. He undertook the pilots' course at No.Â 1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, and graduated at the end of the year. Hewitt was further seconded to the Royal Air Force on 4Â May 1925, holding a temporary commission as a flying officer; this commission was cancelled on 25Â September. He married Lorna Bishop on 10Â November; they had three daughters.
Hewitt joined the newly formed No.Â 101 (Fleet Cooperation) Flight, operating SeagullÂ III amphibians, in August 1926. Prior to the unit deploying to Queensland to survey the Great Barrier Reef with HMAS "Moresby", he practiced manoeuvres around the centre of Melbourne, landing in the Yarra River near Flinders Street station. Media criticism of the escapade led to him being brought before the Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, who rather than upbraiding Hewitt expressed himself "reservedly pleased about the publicity". After completing its survey work in November 1928, the unit served aboard the seaplane carrier HMAS "Albatross".
