Luce refused to take any action to save himselfâhe had told Baalham, before the second officer's departure, that "the fate of the ship shall be mine". When he could no longer render assistance to those still on board, he climbed with his young son to his command post atop the starboard paddle box, and waited for the end. By this time, many on board had become resigned to their fate; they huddled together for comfort while some sang hymns or recited scripture. A few still frantically sought for means of survival; those who could not find a place on the raft lashed together anything that might floatâchairs, stools, caskets, sofas and doors, while Holland continued to fire the cannon. Peter McCabe, a waiter on his first transatlantic voyage, later described the scene: "Several persons were floating about on doors and bedsÂ ... I seized hold of a door which had been taken down to save passengers, and went into the sea, where I left the door and got upon the raftÂ ... A great many persons were trying to get on the raftÂ ... Among the number who were on it I saw four ladies". Many were lost from the raft when it fouled the sinking hullâa section broke off, spilling its occupants into the sea. After this, McCabe counted seventy-two men and four women either on or clinging to the structure, as it moved slowly away from the ship.
