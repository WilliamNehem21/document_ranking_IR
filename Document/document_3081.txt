Following the 23 August 1944 King Michael's Coup, while in transit to a gathering with Himmler in Berlin, Phleps and his escort made a bypass to survey the circumstance close Arad, Romania in the wake of getting reports of Soviet advances around there. Joined just by his aide and his driver, and ignorant of the nearness of Red Army units in the region, he entered ÃÂimand, a town around north of Arad, on the evening of 21 September 1944. Soviet powers were at that point in the town, and Phleps and his men were caught and acquired for cross examination. At the point when the structure in which they were held was assaulted by German airplane later that evening, the detainees attempted to escape and were shot by their watchmen. Bergel suspects that Phleps had been set up by Hungarian armed force officers who had discovered that he knew about designs for Hungary to switch sides as Romania had done in the blink of an eye previously. Phleps' belongings, including his character card, labels and improvements, were found by a Hungarian watch and gave over to German experts on 29 September 1944. Phleps had been recorded as lost without a trace since 22 September 1944 when he didn't appear for his gathering with Himmler, who had issued a warrant for his capture.
