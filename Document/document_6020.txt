With the remainder of his military, Theophilos then walked to intervene himself between the Cilician Gates and Ancyra, outdoors on the north bank of the waterway Halys, near one of the significant stream intersections. Ashinas crossed the Cilician Gates on 19 June, and the caliph himself with his primary armed force set out on the walk two days after the fact. The Arab advance was moderate and careful. On edge to maintain a strategic distance from a trap and get familiar with the head's whereabouts, Mu'tasim disallowed Ashinas to progress too profoundly into Cappadocia. Ashinas conveyed many exploring separations to take prisoners, and from them at long last learned of Theophilos' essence at the Halys, where he anticipated the Arab way to deal with give fight. In the meantime, around mid-July, Theophilos educated of the landing of Afshin's military, including approximately 30,000 men, at the plain of Dazimon. Leaving a piece of his military under an in respect to watch the intersections of the Halys, Theophilos quickly left with the vast majority of his military, about 40,000 men as per Michael the Syrian, to stand up to the littler Arab drive. Mu'tasim took in of Theophilos' takeoff from prisoners and attempted to caution Afshin, however the ruler was quicker and met Afshin's military in the Battle of Anzen on the plain of Dazimon on 22 July. In spite of introductory achievement, the Byzantine armed force broke and dispersed, while Theophilos with his gatekeeper were circled and scarcely figured out how to get through and escape.
