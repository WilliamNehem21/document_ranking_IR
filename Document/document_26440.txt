Weighing between , "Babakotia radofilai" was a medium-sized lemur and noticeably smaller than the large sloth lemurs ("Archaeoindris" and "Palaeopropithecus"), but larger than the small sloth lemurs ("Mesopropithecus"). In many ways, it had an intermediate level of adaptations for suspensory behavior between the large sloth lemurs and the small sloth lemurs. This includes its highly mobile hip and ankle joints, as well as other specializations in the vertebral column, pelvis, and limbs. Its forelimbs were 20% longer than its hind limbs, giving it a higher intermembral index (~119) than "Mesopropithecus" (~97 to 113), suggesting that it was convergently similar to arboreal sloths. It had a reduced tarsus and curved, elongated digits, adapted for grasping and suggesting suspensory behavior. Its hind feet were reduced, making it well-adapted for climbing and hanging (like in other palaeopropithecids), but not leaping (like in indriids). Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrated that this species was a vertical climber. Additionally, analysis of its semicircular canals, lumbar vertebrae and its spinous processes indicate slow movement and climbing (antipronograde) adaptations, but not necessarily sloth-like hanging, vertical clinging, or leaping. Therefore, it was likely a slow climber like a loris and also exhibited some suspensory behavior like a sloth.
