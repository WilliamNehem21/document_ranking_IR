Sales were very good, and Ziff Davis was sufficiently impressed after only two issues to move the magazine from a quarterly to a bimonthly schedule, and to switch "Amazing" from pulp format to digest-size to match "Fantastic". Shortly afterwards the decision was taken to eliminate "Fantastic Adventures": the March 1953 issue was the last, and the MayâJune 1953 issue of "Fantastic" added a mention of "Fantastic Adventures" to the masthead, though this ceased with the following issue. Payment started at two cents per word for all rights, but could go up to ten cents at the editor's discretion; this put "Fantastic" in the second echelon of magazines, behind titles such as "Astounding" and "Galaxy". The experiment with quality fiction did not last. Circulation dropped, which led to budget cuts, and in turn the quality of the fiction fell. Browne had wanted to separate "Fantastic" from "Amazing"s pulp roots, but now found he had to print more science fiction (sf) and less fantasy in order to attract "Amazing"s readers to its sister magazine. "Fantastic"s poor results were probably a consequence of an overloaded sf-magazine market: far more magazines appeared in the early 1950s than the market was able to support. Ziff Davis sales staff were able to help sell "Fantastic" and "Amazing" along with the technical magazines that it published, and the availability of a national sales network, even though it was not focused solely on "Fantastic", undoubtedly helped the magazine to survive.
