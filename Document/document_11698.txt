It isn't known accurately why Coates neglected to buy the artwork; in any case, it appears to be likely that Coates felt the work was too disputable to even consider acquiring. Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' institute, would have been comfortable with the topic of Eakins' works, and subsequently it appears to be impossible that the bareness in the composition would have amazed or stunned him. Or maybe, it appears to be sure that Coates would have perceived most of men in the work of art, as everything except one were understudies of Eakins at the institute. He was without a doubt acquainted with the site portrayed in the sketch as well, as it was just an a large portion of a mile (800 m) from Haverford College, where Coates contemplated as an undergrad. The portrayal of a teacher and his understudies together naked would have been a delicate subject for the institute's executives, who had taboo Eakins from utilizing Academy understudies as models, as displaying was viewed as foul. Coates traded "The Swimming Hole" for the "less questionable type scene" of Eakins' "The Pathetic Song"Ã¢ÂÂ today housed in the Corcoran Gallery of ArtÃ¢ÂÂand paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the first commission.
