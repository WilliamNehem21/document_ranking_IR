In 1910, the Liberal administration of Alexander Cameron Rutherford was involved in the Alberta and Great Waterways (A&GW) Railway embarrassment. Allegations of bias by the legislature towards the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway had part the Liberal Party, and Rutherford's capacity to stay at its head was in uncertainty. Lieutenant-Governor George Bulyea, a Liberal who had reluctantly requested that Rutherford structure a legislature in 1905, saw his questions about the Premier's initiative abilities approved and unobtrusively started searching for contender to supplant him and spare the Liberal Party. A few conceivable outcomesÃ¢ÂÂincluding William Henry Cushing, Peter Talbot, and Frank OliverÃ¢ÂÂwere considered and either rejected or observed to be uninterested in the activity. As ahead of schedule as March 14, Bulyea had inferred that Sifton may be "the main changeless arrangement", however it was not until May that the Lieutenant-Governor had the capacity to verify Rutherford's consent to leave and the understanding of both real groups in the Liberal gathering to acknowledge Sifton as Premier. Indeed, even up until the latest possible time, Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) faithful to Charles Wilson CrossÃ¢ÂÂthe territory's Attorney-General and a staunch Rutherford partnerÃ¢ÂÂtook steps to abandon the plan except if Cross was kept on as lawyer general, to which Sifton would not concur. On May 26, Rutherford surrendered and Arthur Sifton turned into the second Premier of Alberta.
