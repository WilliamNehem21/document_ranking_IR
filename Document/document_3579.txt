In a 2002 remark on the first portrayal of "T. sethi", engineer John Michael Williams noticed that despite the fact that Kellner and Campos had referenced that the huge peak may have meddled efficiently amid flight, they had not explained on this point and had contrasted the pterosaur and a feathered creature one-fifth its size. He recommended that "Thalassodromeus" utilized its peak to adjust its jaws, with the head changing disposition relying upon the method of headway. Williams hypothesized that the peak would be inflatable with blood and exhibited fluctuating air opposition, which he contrasted with a handheld fan; this would have helped the creature change the disposition of the head amid flight (and amid contact with water), shielding it from pivoting without amazing neck muscles. The peak would have made long flights conceivable, instead of meddling; Williams contrasted it and the spermaceti in the leader of the sperm whale, expressing it is as far as anyone knows used to change lightness through temperature modification. Kellner and Campos rejected the possibility of an inflatable peak, since its compacted bones would not permit this; they didn't discover the sperm-whale similarity persuading in connection to flying creatures, taking note of that spermaceti is bound to be utilized amid hostility or for sonar. They concurred that the possibility of the peak having an in-flight work was enticing and sideways development of the head would have helped it alter course, yet biomechanical and flight-mechanical investigations of the peak would need to be directed to decide the creature's optimal design.
