Much contention has encompassed the subject of whether, and to what degree, "Heterodontosaurus" demonstrated the constant tooth swap that is commonplace for different dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known around then come up short on any signs of ceaseless tooth substitution: The cheek teeth of the realized skulls are worn consistently, showing that they framed at the same time. Recently ejected teeth are missing. Additional proof was gotten from the wear features of the teeth, which were shaped by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear aspects were converged into each other, framing a consistent surface along the total tooth push. This surface demonstrates that sustenance parade was accomplished by forward and backward developments of the jaws, not by basic vertical developments which was the situation in related dinosaurs, for example, "Fabrosaurus". Forward and backward developments are just conceivable if the teeth are worn consistently, again fortifying the case for the absence of a nonstop tooth substitution. At the same time, Thulborn focused on that a normal tooth substitution was fundamental for these creatures, as the alleged eating regimen comprising of extreme plant material would have prompted speedy scraped spot of the teeth. These perceptions drove Thulborn to presume that "Heterodontosaurus" more likely than not supplanted its whole arrangement of teeth without a moment's delay all the time. Such a total substitution could just have been conceivable inside periods of aestivation, when the creature did not bolster. Aestivation additionally consents to the alleged living space of the creatures, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when nourishment was rare.
