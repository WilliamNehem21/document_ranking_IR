The ditchers found a way to guarantee support for their recommendations. In 1921, WWPC verified a primer license to construct a dam at Kettle Falls, about upstream from the Grand Coulee. Whenever fabricated, the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain in the way of the Grand Coulee Dam's store, basically hindering its development. WWPC planted gossipy tidbits in the papers, expressing exploratory penetrating at the Grand Coulee site found no stone on which a dam's establishments could rest, just dirt and divided shake. This was later invalidated with Reclamation-requested penetrating. Ditchers employed General George W. Goethals, designer of the Panama Canal, to set up a report. Goethals visited the state and delivered a report backing the ditchers. The Bureau of Reclamation was unmoved by Goethals' report, trusting it loaded up with blunders. In , President Warren G. Harding visited Washington state and communicated support for water system work there, yet kicked the bucket a month later. His successor, Calvin Coolidge, had little enthusiasm for water system ventures. The Bureau of Reclamation, covetous of a noteworthy task that would support its notoriety, was concentrating on the Boulder Canyon Project that brought about the Hoover Dam. Recovery was approved to direct an investigation in 1923, yet the venture's cost made government authorities hesitant. The Washington state proposition got little help from those further east, who dreaded the water system would result in more harvests, discouraging costs. With President Coolidge contradicted to the task, bills to suitable cash for reviews of the Grand Coulee site fizzled.
