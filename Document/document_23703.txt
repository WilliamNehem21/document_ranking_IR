Around 12:00, the Italians went over to the offensive, with the 3rd Alpine Group tasked to advance to the line SelcaâRadovljica, XI Corps to push via Logatec to Ljubljana, VI Corps to drive on Prezid, and V Corps to advance from Fiume towards Kraljevica then Lokve. While one Italian attack south of the SneÅ¾nik plateau was stopped by elements of the Mountain Detachment "RiÅ¡najaski" and the Italian advance was held up by border troops in some areas, there was little significant resistance, and by the end of the day they had captured SuÅ¡ak, Bakar, Delnice, Jesenice, Vrhnika, Logatec and Ljubljana. To assist the Italian advance, the Luftwaffe attacked Yugoslav troops in the Ljubljana region, and the 14th Panzer Division, which had captured Zagreb on 10 April, drove west to encircle the withdrawing 7th Army. The Italians faced little resistance, and captured about 30,000 troops of the 7th Army waiting to surrender near Delnice. When the Italian 14th Infantry Division "Isonzo" entered Ljubljana, a delegate of the NszS greeted its commander, "Generale di Divisione" Federico Romero, and symbolically handed him the keys to the city. An official reception was held for Romero that evening, attended by NatlaÄen and most of the members of the NszS, but because NatlaÄen and the council preferred that the Germans occupy Ljubljana, he asked Romero for permission to travel to Celje the following day to meet with Lanz.
