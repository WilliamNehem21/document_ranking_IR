The Pieter Withoos painting, which was found first, seems, by all accounts, to be founded on a before painting by Pieter Holsteyn, three variants of which are known to have existed. As per Hume, Cheke, and Valledor de Lozoya, it creates the impression that all delineations of white dodos depended on Roelant Savery's artwork "Scene with Orpheus and the creatures", or on duplicates of it. The work of art has by and large been dated to 1611, however a post-1614, or even post-1626, date has additionally been proposed. The depiction demonstrates a whitish example and was evidently founded on a stuffed example then in Prague; a "walghvogel" portrayed as having a "messy grayish shading" was referenced in a stock of examples in the Prague gathering of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607Ã¢ÂÂ 1611). Savery's few later pictures all show grayish fowls, potentially on the grounds that he had by then observed another example. Cheke and Hume trust the painted example was white, attributable to albinism. Valledor de Lozoya has rather recommended that the light plumage was an adolescent characteristic, an aftereffect of fading of old taxidermy examples, or essentially creative permit.
