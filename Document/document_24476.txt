Tim Byrd reviewed the adventure in "The Space Gamer" No. 30, stating that it "successfully combines fantasy with SF" and that it was "extremely fun to play [...] one of the best modules TSR has published". Two gaming magazines reviewed "Expedition to the Barrier Peaks" in 1981. Reviewer Marcus L. Rowland said in "White Dwarf" #26 that he found the adventure "very enjoyable, with ideas and creatures eminently suitable for wider use". He gave it 9/10 overall, but complained that some of the maps were printed on both sides of the same sheet, making them useless as a Dungeon Master's shield (a visual barrier that allows dice rolls and other activities to be conducted without the players knowing the outcome). He recommended at least a week's study by the Dungeon Master before attempting to play it. He also notes that the cover "reveals the secret of the creatures". Kirby Griffis reviewed the adventure in "The Space Gamer" #36. Griffis noted that it is full of "surprises and new monsters", and felt that its one drawback was that Gygax presented standard "D&D" monsters as natives of other planets. In summary, he found it interesting and "full of spice and flavor"; recommending it to anyone interested in "something new" or wanting to include science fiction in their "D&D" game.
