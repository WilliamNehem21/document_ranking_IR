For Mellor, Indigenous character is a topic featured both in his work and (not really by his own decision) in open life. As a reasonable cleaned man with blue eyes and caucasian highlights, his appearance has incidentally brought up issues of "credibility". Mellor got himself the objective of reporter Andrew Bolt, who disagreed with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Jolt stated "This white college speaker, with his pleasant Canberra studio, has by winning pushed aside genuine attract the-soil Aboriginal craftsmen, for example, Dorothy Napangardi, Mitjili Napanangka Gibson and Walangkura Napanangka, who had additionally entered and could truly have utilized that money and acknowledgment." Commentator Ellie Savage, scrutinizing Bolt, asked why somebody who "neither attracts the earth nor lives in it" ought to subsequently reserve "no privilege to enter rivalries for Indigenous specialists". Jolt two years after the fact lost a case brought by nine Indigenous AustraliansÃ¢ÂÂexcluding MellorÃ¢ÂÂfor racial segregation over articles that censured reasonable cleaned Indigenous individuals, including the post that had thrashed Mellor. Craftsmanship essayist Maurice O'Riordan, inspecting the 2009 Award, noticed the Bolt debate, yet called attention to that Mellor, while in early works recognizing his own Indigenous legacy, isn't worried about the meaning of Aboriginality, however with authentic collaboration among societies and the reconsidering of history.
