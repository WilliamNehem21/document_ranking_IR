Following a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk made a trip to Leipzig, ceasing in different European urban areas en route. From Leipzig, it went to Dresden, where Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz saw the Turk and distributed his discoveries in "ÃÂber lair Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung", alongside representations demonstrating his convictions about how the machine worked. It at that point moved to Amsterdam, after which Kempelen is said to have acknowledged a solicitation to the Sanssouci royal residence in Potsdam of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. The story goes that Frederick delighted in the Turk so much that he paid a vast total of cash to Kempelen in return for the Turk's insider facts. Frederick never gave the mystery away, yet was supposedly disillusioned to figure out how the machine functioned. This story is in all likelihood fanciful; there is no proof of the Turk's experience with Frederick, the primary notice of which comes in the mid nineteenth century, by which time the Turk was additionally mistakenly said to have played against George III of England. It appears to be no doubt that the machine remained torpid at SchÃÂ¶nbrunn Palace for more than two decades, despite the fact that Kempelen endeavored fruitlessly to offer it in his last years. Kempelen passed on at 70 years old on 26 March 1804.
