ABC put "Temperatures Rising" in its 8:00 PM Tuesday evening opening, where it appeared on September 12, 1972. Since one of the stars was dark, a portion of ABC's partnered stations in the southern and midwestern pieces of the United States wouldn't air the arrangement or communicate it in an alternate vacancy. Airing inverse it were "Bonanza" on NBC, and the new sitcom "Maude" on CBS. "Bonanza" was entering its fourteenth year and presented an aspiring two-hour season debut managing the marriage of Little Joe Cartwright (Michael Landon). "Maude", featuring Beatrice Arthur in the title job, was a turn off of "All in the Family". The two shows exhibited "Temperatures Rising" with firm resistance in the "evaluations diversion". The two-hour season debut of "Bonanza" performed outstandingly well in the appraisals. "Maude" showed improvement over "Temperatures Rising" in the New York City region, while "Temperatures Rising" fared superior to "Maude" in the Los Angeles region. In resulting weeks, "Bonanza's" appraisals dropped forcefully and NBC dropped the arrangement in November 1972. As indicated by Asher: ""Temperatures Rising" put "Bonanza" bankrupt and was beating "Maude" in the Los Angeles territory until mid-season, when NBC changed to some substantial films which hurt us". In spite of this the arrangement completed its first year with a reliable 29 offer of the evaluations when a 30 share was sufficient to guarantee reestablishment for another season. ABC, in any case, needed to improve the evaluations and chose to roll out noteworthy improvements to "Temperatures Rising" for its second season.
