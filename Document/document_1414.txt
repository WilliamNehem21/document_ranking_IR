On 31 May 1916, the second BCS comprised of "New Zealand" (lead of Rear-Admiral William Pakenham) and "Inexhaustible". The squadron was doled out to Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to ocean to capture a fight by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British had the capacity to translate the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to ocean. Chief naval officer Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers detected the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20ÃÂ p.m., however Beatty's boats did not recognize the Germans to their east until 3:30. After two minutes, he requested a course change to east south-east to position himself on the back of the German's line of retreat and called his boats' groups to activity stations. He likewise requested the second BCS, which had been driving, to fall in toward the back of the first BCS. Cooler arranged his boats to swing to starboard, far from the British, to expect a south-easterly course, and to lessen speed to permit three light cruisers of the second Scouting Group to make up for lost time. With this play Judas on the High Seas Fleet, at that point about behind him. Around this time Beatty modified course toward the east as it was rapidly obvious that he was still excessively far north to cut off Hipper.
