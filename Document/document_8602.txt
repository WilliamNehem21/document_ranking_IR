The juvenile Tubman had been sent to a dry-products store for provisions. There, she experienced a slave possessed by another family, who had left the fields without consent. His manager, angry, requested that she help limit him. She won't, and as he fled, the manager tossed a two-pound weight at him. He struck her rather, which she said "broke my skull." She later clarified her conviction that her hairÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ which "had never been brushed andÃÂ ...ÃÂ stood out like a bushel basket"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ may have spared her life. Draining and oblivious, she was come back to her proprietor's home and laid on the seat of a loom, where she stayed without therapeutic consideration for two days. She was sent once more into the fields, "with blood and sweat moving down my face until I couldn't see." Her manager said she was "not worth a sixpence" and restored her to Brodess, who attempted ineffectively to offer her. She started having seizures and would apparently fall oblivious, despite the fact that she professed to know about her environment while seeming, by all accounts, to be snoozing. These scenes were disturbing to her family, who were unfit to wake her when she nodded off all of a sudden and all of a sudden. This condition stayed with her for an incredible remainder; Larson recommends she may have experienced transient projection epilepsy because of the damage.
