There are male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (unisexual flowers) on a single plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, appearing from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in "Cucurbita" there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that there appears to be one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3â5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of "C.Â argyrosperma" and "C.Â ficifolia" have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of "C.Â pepo" have a small calyx, but the calyx of "C.Â moschata" male flowers is comparatively short.
"Cucurbita" fruits are large and fleshy. Botanists classify the "Cucurbita" fruit as a pepo, which is a special type of berry derived from an inferior ovary, with a thick outer wall or rind with hypanthium tissue forming an exocarp around the ovary, and a fleshy interior composed of mesocarp and endocarp. The term "pepo" is used primarily for Cucurbitaceae fruits, where this fruit type is common, but the fruits of "Passiflora" and "Carica" are sometimes also pepos. The seeds, which are attached to the ovary wall (parietal placentation) and not to the center, are large and fairly flat with a large embryo that consists almost entirely of two cotyledons. Fruit size varies considerably: wild fruit specimens can be as small as and some domesticated specimens can weigh well over . The current world record was set in 2014 by Beni Meier of Switzerland with a pumpkin.
