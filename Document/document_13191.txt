Amid his initial a very long time as a rehearsing counselor, Garrow was especially noted for his forceful and angry style of interrogation. At the point when James Wingrove was accused of burglary and savagery over the span of an outrageous overpricing in 1784, Garrow's interrogation of William Grove (who went about as an observer and the individual charging Wingrove) got him to concede that he was lying himself trying to get a reward, and that Wingrove hosted not looted the two harmed gatherings. Garrow demonstrated an abhorrence of most hoodlum takers, of which Grove was one, in spite of the fact that he didn't treat the Bow Street Runners and different experts with scorn. His aversion of such men was featured with all due respect of three men in 1788 for robbery; they were accused of attacking John Troughton, placing him in dread of his life, and taking his cap. The issue was whether the attack placed him in dread of his life, or whether he was misrepresenting to guarantee a reward, which couldn't be asserted for straightforward robbery. Garrow built up that Troughton was unsure about how he lost his cap, regardless of his endeavors to guarantee that the respondents thumped it off him, and after four observers gave character proof the litigants were found not blameworthy.
