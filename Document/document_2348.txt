A few tunes on "New York Dolls" work as what Robert Hilburn esteemed "vivid, whenever misrepresented, articulations of youngster estrangement". As indicated by Robert Christgau, in light of the fact that a considerable lot of Manhattan's white adolescents were well off and to some degree refined, just badly acted youngsters from the external precincts like the band could "catch the onerous energy Manhattan holds for a half-shaped individual". "Private World", a dreamer supplication for security, was co-composed by Kane, who seldom contributed as a musician and felt overpowered as a youthful grown-up in the music business. Johansen, the band's fundamental lyricist, said "Frankenstein (Orig.)" was about "how kids come to Manhattan from all finished, they're somewhat similar to whipped hounds, they're exceptionally subdued. Their bodies and cerebrums are bewildered from each otherÃÂ ... it's an adoration melody." Its main beast was translated by faultfinder Frank Kogan to be the exemplification of New York and its ethosÃ¢ÂÂ"the conspicuousness and the dread, the fantasies and the dread"Ã¢ÂÂ while Johansen inquiring as to whether they "could make it with Frankenstein" included more than sexual slang: "David was inquiring as to whether youÃ¢ÂÂin the event that IÃ¢ÂÂcould make it with the beast of life, regardless of whether I could grasp life in the entirety of its agony and dreams and catastrophe." Sylvain flippantly said "Frankenstein" was titled with the incidental qualifier since shake artist Edgar Winter had discharged his tune of a similar name before the band could record their own: "Our tune 'Frankenstein' was a major hit in our live showÃÂ ... Presently, his thing didn't sound at all like our own, however I'm certain he stole our title."
