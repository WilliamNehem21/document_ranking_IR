In mid 1993, Sasha banded together with individual Renaissance DJ John Digweed. Sasha and Digweed sharpened their DJing aptitudes, frequently performing couple and concentrating on track determination and specialized blending capacities. Renaissance was satisfied with their exhibitions, and had the pair order the triple-CD blend collection "Renaissance - The Mix Collection", discharging it on the club's own Renaissance Records name. The collection highlighted tracks from such craftsmen as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice, and unique creations and remixes from Sasha and Digweed. "The Mix Collection" was discharged not long after Sasha's takeoff from Renaissance in April 1994. Following his prosperity at Renaissance, Sasha was again highlighted on "Mixmag" with the slogan "Child OF GOD?", however he detested the award. In the wake of visiting together for a long time, the couple turned out to be "genuine hotshots" with the arrival of their twofold CD "Northern Exposure" on uber name Ministry of Sound. Around this time, Sasha started a repetitive mentorship and association with individual maker BT with the collection "Ima". Just as giving direction to BT, Sasha delivered an "euphoric" and "contemplative" 42-minute interpretation of the collection which shaped the focal point of the UK discharge and showed up as a "reward" second circle on the US discharge. He kept on propelling his own generation work by blending with vocalist Maria Nayler to deliver the single "Be as One", which came to #17 on the UK singles graph.
