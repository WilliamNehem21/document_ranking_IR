Middlemen buy as many as 30Â slow lorises from rural hunters over a wide area, and then sell them in the major city markets for 300,000 to 500,000Â rupiahs ( to ) each. Western tourists and expatriates pay as much as 1,000,000Â rupiahs (). Traders have reported to researchers that they have difficulty keeping pace with demand, and one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200Â pygmy slow lorises during 2001â2002. Hundreds of slow lorises are sold domestically each year in Indonesian at open-air animal markets (or "bird markets"), as well as in shopping malls. Slow lorises are the most commonly sold protected primate at these markets. Live trade is the most common, with only 13.6% of slow lorises traded for parts. In Phnom Penh, Cambodia during the 1990s, observers counted up to 204Â slow lorises for sale at a single store; in 2007 a market in Mondulkiri Province displayed 30Â dried specimens. A total of 234Â slow lorises were confiscated by the Forestry Administration-Wildlife Alliance between 2002 and 2006. In Indonesia, nearly 6,000 to 7,000Â slow lorises were traded domestically each year from 2000 to 2006. For international trade, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand were the biggest exporters, with exports having declined for all species except the pygmy slow loris from 1998 to 2007 (compared to 1978â1997).
