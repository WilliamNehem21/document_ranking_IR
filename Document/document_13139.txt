In England, Earl Godwin kicked the bucket in 1053 and his children were expanding in power: Harold prevailing to his dad's earldom, and another child, Tostig, moved toward becoming Earl of Northumbria. Different children were conceded earldoms later: Gyrth as Earl of East Anglia in 1057 and Leofwine as Earl of Kent some time somewhere in the range of 1055 and 1057. A few sources guarantee that Harold participated in William's Breton crusade of 1064 and that Harold promised to maintain William's case to the English position of royalty toward the finish of the battle, however no English source reports this outing, and it is vague in the event that it really happened. It might have been Norman purposeful publicity intended to dishonor Harold, who had developed as the principle contender to succeed King Edward. In the mean time, another contender for the royal position had emergedÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Edward the Exile, child of Edmund Ironside and a grandson of ÃÂthelred II, came back to England in 1057, and in spite of the fact that he kicked the bucket not long after his arrival, he carried with him his family, which included two little girls, Margaret and Christina, and a child, Edgar the ÃÂtheling.
