The tropical banksia is commonly a little tree which develops to around or here and there tall, with an unpleasant stocky trunk, spreading crown, and abnormal branches. The dim dark bark isn't flaky yet tesselated in surface and appearance. At first canvassed in ruddy hair that erodes, branchlets become smooth and dim with age. The expansive green leaves are dissipated along the stems, and increasingly swarmed at the branchlet tips. They are long and wide, obovate fit as a fiddle with mucronate tips. The dentate (toothed) edges are fixed sporadically with long teeth, isolated by u-molded sinuses. The leaves are undulate (wavy) with white undersurfaces, the midrib raised underneath and discouraged previously. The round and hollow yellow inflorescences (blossom spikes), emerge from one-to three-year-old branches. Showing up among November and May, they are high and wide. Recently opened bloom spikes smell like corn. All blossom parts are light yellow; the perianth is long, including a long appendage. After anthesis, the pistil is long. Bloom parts before long tumble off maturing spikes, which form into unpredictable barrel shaped infructescences. The oval follicles are long, high and wide. Light green and fuzzy when youthful, they become smooth and pale dark colored with age. The follicles open unexpectedly with development. They contain two seeds each, between which lies a woody dull darker separator of comparative shape to the seeds. Estimating long, the seed is obovate, and made out of a dull dark colored wide membranous 'wing' and obovate seed appropriate which estimates long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or canvassed in small edges.
