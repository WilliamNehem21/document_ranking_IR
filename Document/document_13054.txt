Investigations of warmth stream and the water science in Crater Lake and the change of rocks more seasoned than 120,000 years back recommend that aqueous zones exist in the Mazama region. Most springs show comparative science, from the enduring of volcanic glass and clinopyroxene. These highlights most likely shaped because of procedures identified with leftover warmth from the magma chamber that delivered the climactic Mazama emission 7,700 years prior. The lake demonstrates convective blending that cycles at regular intervals as warm liquid moves into the lake through its floor, making warm springs that framed silica towers with statures up to . Therefore, the California Energy Company penetrated two geothermal investigation wells: the MZI-11A with a profundity of toward the east of the national park obstruction at the Scott Creek Drainage, and the MZII-1 with a profundity of toward the south of a similar limit and toward the east of Annie Creek. The most extreme temperature they have seen at the southern well is , while the greatest temperature was at the eastern well. The convective warmth release in Crater Lake denotes the third biggest in the Cascades, after the Austin Hot Springs and at Lassen Volcanic National Park. Researchers from the United States Geological Survey believe that hotspots for geothermal vitality use exist at Mazama and Crater Lake.
