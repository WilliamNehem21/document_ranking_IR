Due to the low rates of pay, the tales submitted to "Super Science Stories" in its first year had commonly as of now been rejected somewhere else. Be that as it may, Pohl was an individual from the Futurians, a gathering of sci-fi fans that included Isaac Asimov, C.M. Kornbluth, Richard Wilson and Donald Wollheim; the Futurians were anxious to wind up proficient authors and were anxious to submit stories to Pohl. The Futurians were productive; in Pohl's first year as an editorial manager he purchased an aggregate of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines. Pohl contributed material himself, for the most part as a team with at least one of the Futurians. Especially after his marriage to Doris Baumgardt in August 1940, Pohl understood that his pay secured their condo lease with no cash left finished, and started to expand his salary by pitching to himself just as to different magazines. The principal story Pohl ever distributed that was not a coordinated effort was "The Dweller in the Ice", which showed up in the January 1941 "Super Science Stories". The majority of the narratives Pohl purchased from himself were distributed under pen names, in reality Pohl utilized pen names all that he composed until the 1950s.
