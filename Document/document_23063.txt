Twenty minutes later, the 16 "Zuikaku" torpedo planes arrived and split up to attack "Enterprise". One group of torpedo bombers was attacked by two CAP Wildcats which shot down three of them and damaged a fourth. On fire, the fourth damaged aircraft purposely crashed into the destroyer , setting the ship on fire and killing 57 of her crew. The torpedo carried by this aircraft detonated shortly after impact, causing more damage. The fires initially seemed out of control until "Smith"'s commanding officer ordered the destroyer to steer into the large spraying wake of the battleship , which helped put out the fires. "Smith" then resumed her station, firing her remaining anti-aircraft guns at the torpedo planes.
The remaining torpedo planes attacked "Enterprise", "South Dakota", and cruiser , but all of their torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; nine of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 "Enterprise" reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before the next wave of Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on "Enterprise", forcing a suspension of landing operations.
