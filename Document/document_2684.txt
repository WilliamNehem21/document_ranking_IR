In June 1945, every last bit of her optional weapons and about portion of her enemy of airplane combat hardware was moved aground, together with her rangefinders and searchlights. Her group was in like manner decreased to under 1,000 officers and enrolled men. On 18 July 1945, the vigorously covered ship was assaulted by contender planes and torpedo aircraft from five American bearers as a feature of Admiral William Halsey, Jr's. battle to obliterate the IJN's last enduring capital boats. "Nagato" was hit by two bombs, the primary bomb struck the scaffold and slaughtered Otsuka, the official officer, and twelve mariners when it exploded after hitting the top of the conning tower. The second 500-pound bomb struck the deck toward the back of the mainmast and exploded when it hit No. 3 barbette. It neglected to harm the barbette or the turret above it, yet punctured about in measurement in the deck over the officer's parlor, executing 21 men and harming four Type 96 firearms on the deck above. A failure rocket of questionable size hit the ship's fantail, yet neglected to do any huge harm. To persuade the Americans that "Nagato" had been gravely harmed by the assault, her harm was left unrepaired and a portion of her counterweight tanks were siphoned loaded with seawater to influence her to sit further in the water as though she had sunk to the harbor base.
