The Allies previously seen development action at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans started constructing railroad track and the offloading stores into the old quarry. After Hitler approved the choice to transform the warehouse into a rocket dispatch site, development was ventured up. Work on the arch started in November 1943 and burrowing in the precipice face underneath started in December. Toward the beginning of January, Allied surveillance flying machine watched a detailed arrangement of disguise on the slope top, introduced to hide the arch. The structure works were enormously frustrated by the steady air-attack alerts, which ceased work multiple times in May 1944 alone. In light of Hitler's longing to see the site finished the workforce was extended significantly from 1,100 in April 1944 to about 1,400 by June. About 60% of the laborers were Germans; talented specialists, for example, diggers from Westphalia, were enlisted to unearth the passages and manufacture the vault. The rest of primarily Frenchmen recruited by the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), in addition to Soviet detainees of war. The undertaking was regulated by a few substantial German development organizations, with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH filling in as the central contractual workers.
