The fossil skull of "Livyatan" had a bended bowl, known as the supracranial bowl, which was profound and wide. Dissimilar to other raptorial sperm whales, however much like in the cutting edge sperm whale, the bowl spread over the whole length of the nose, making the whole skull be curved on the top as opposed to making a nose as observed in "Zygophyseter" and "Acrophyseter". The supracranial bowl was the most profound and largest over the braincase, and, not at all like other raptorial sperm whales, it didn't overhang the eye attachment. It was characterized by high dividers on the sides. The antorbital indents, which are typically cut like scores on the sides of the skull directly before the nose, were inside the bowl. An inclining peak on the transient fossa coordinated towards the back of the skull isolated the nose from the remainder of the skull, and was characterized by a notch beginning at the antorbital forms on the cheekbones. The bowl had two foramina in the front, rather than the cutting edge sperm whale which has one foramen on the maxilla, and to the advanced diminutive person and dwarf sperm whales which have a few in the bowl. The suture in the bowl between the maxilla and the brow had an interlocking example.
