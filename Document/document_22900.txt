After Davidson's death and burial, press attention withered as newspapers concentrated on more significant events in the years before the Second World War. In the decades after the war interest in the affair was periodically revived. In 1963 Blythe, deemed by Parris to be the affair's "best historian", published his account. Later in the 1960s, two stage musical versions were produced: "The Stiffkey Scandals of 1932", which appeared in Edinburgh in 1967 and London in 1968, and "God Made the Little Red Apple", staged in Manchester in 1969. Neither of these productions was commercially successful; when the former was adapted for television, "The Daily Telegraph"s critic questioned the artistic justification for a musical about "so sad and peculiar a person". In the 1970s Davidson's case was the subject of a radio documentary, "A Proper Little Gent", and in 1994 an episode of BBC Television's "Matter of Fact" series examined the affair. Cullen's full-length biography of Davidson in 1975 posits a theory that multiple personalities led him to behave in different ways in differing circumstances. Robert Brown, in a biographical sketch for the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", suggests that what really motivated Davidson will never be known. In 2007 John Walsh published a fictionalised account of Davidson's life, "Sunday at the Cross Bones" (Fourth Estate), in which, according to a review in "The Guardian", Davidson is depicted as "well-meaning but ineffectual, bewildered by the world's wickedness and his own barely acknowledged desires".
