Representatives to the July 22, 1799, tradition were chosen in May 1799. Neither Garrard nor his child William were picked as agents, for the most part because of their abolitionist servitude sees. Garrard had been a more dynamic representative than his antecedent, often utilizing his veto and conflicting with the province courts. Therefore, the representatives moved to reign in a portion of the power given to the state's CEO. Under the 1799 constitution, the representative was famously chosen, and the edge for abrogating a gubernatorial veto was brought down from a 66% larger part of each place of the governing body to a flat out lion's share. In spite of the fact that the representative held expansive arrangement controls, the state senate was enabled to favor or reject every gubernatorial candidate. New term limits were forced on the representative, making him ineligible for re-appointment for a long time following the termination of his term. The confinement on priests serving in the assembly was held and reached out to the representative's office. Student of history Lowell Harrison held that this limitation was "a reasonable scorn to Garrard", yet Garrard biographer H. E. Everman kept up that it was "unquestionably not a blow went for Garrard". Garrard was by and by exempted from both the progression and clerical limitations, making room for him to look for a second term.
