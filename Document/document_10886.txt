Henry Conwell (c. 1748 Ã¢ÂÂ April 22, 1842) was an Irish-brought into the world Catholic minister in the United States. He turned into a minister in 1776 and served in that limit in Ireland for over four decades. After the Pope declined to designate him Archbishop of Armagh, the bishopric in which he filled in as Vicar General, he was rather introduced as the second Bishop of Philadelphia in 1819. Conwell took up the post at a propelled age, and invested quite a bit of his energy there fighting with the lay trustees of his wards, particularly those of St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia. At the point when Conwell evacuated and banished William Hogan, a questionable minister at St. Mary's, the area trustees rather dismissed Conwell's power, making a minor break. The opposite sides in part accommodated by 1826, however the Vatican pecking order trusted Conwell had surrendered a lot of capacity to the laymen all the while, and reviewed him to Rome. Despite the fact that he held his position, Conwell was constrained to give up real control to his coadjutor priest, Francis Kenrick. He stayed in Philadelphia and played out some clerical obligations, however for every pragmatic reason never again ran the see. He kicked the bucket there in 1842 at the period of around 94.
