At the point when Arnold Johnson (a companion of Topping and Yankees general supervisor George Weiss) turned into the proprietor of the Kansas City Athletics in 1955, his new group made numerous exchanges with the Yankees. From 1956 to 1960, the Athletics exchanged numerous youthful players to the Yankees for money and maturing veterans. The exchanges fortified the Yankees' program, yet brought analysis from adversary clubs. Prior to their 1960 season, the Yankees made one such exchange with the Athletics in which they procured outfielder Roger Maris. In his first Yankees season, Maris drove the association in slugging rate, RBIs, and additional fair hits, completed second with 39 grand slams, and won the AL MVP Award. The 1960 Yankees won the AL flag for the tenth time in 12 years under Stengel, and outscored the Pirates 55Ã¢ÂÂ 27 in the seven World Series amusements. In any case, the group lost four of them, missing the mark concerning a Series title after Bill Mazeroski hit a stroll off grand slam in the last diversion, finishing a challenge that Appel called "a standout amongst the most vital in baseball history." The season ended up being Stengel's last as Yankees chief; he showed that his age assumed a job in the group's choice, saying, "I'll never tragically be seventy again."
