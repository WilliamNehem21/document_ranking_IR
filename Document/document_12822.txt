Writing in London's "Night Standard" on 5 January 2011, media reporter Roy Greenslade communicated worry over various negative articles that had showed up in papers concerning Yeates' proprietor, Jefferies, following his capture, portraying the inclusion as "character death on a vast scale". He refered to a few instances of features and stories that had been distributed, incorporating a feature in "The Sun" depicting JefferiesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a previous schoolmaster at Clifton CollegeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ as unusual, opulent, lascivious and frightening; a story from the "Day by day Express" citing anonymous previous understudies alluding to him as "... a kind of Nutty Professor" who made them feel "creeped out" by his "unusual" conduct; and an article from the "Every day Telegraph", which detailed Jefferies "has been portrayed by understudies at Clifton College ... as an aficionado of dim and vicious cutting edge films". Jefferies propelled legitimate activity against six papers on 21 AprilÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "The Sun", the "Every day Mirror", the "Day by day Star", the "Day by day Express", the "Day by day Mail" and the "Day by day Record"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ looking for harms for defamation. It was held that the media rushed to make a hasty judgment with respect to Jefferies' capture. Being a resigned English educator who lived alone, whose physical appearance and "unconventionally unkempt white hair," made him emerge, persuaded that he looked the sort. Stephen Moss wrote in "The Guardian": "The implicit suspicion was that nobody could look that odd and be honest."
