Garrett was concerned with changing the Army's association as well as with redesigning its hardware; by the mid 1960s the Army would secure the FN 7.62mm rifle, the M60 assault rifle, the M101 105mm howitzer, the M113 heavily clad faculty bearer, and new mortars and radios. He likewise supported firmly for the Army to work its own helicopters and light flying machine; the Australian Army Aviation Corps was in the long run set up in July 1968. Garrett was booked to resign from the Army on his sixtieth birthday celebration in February 1960 yet the legislature expanded his term. He resigned on 30 June 1960 and was prevailing by Lieutenant General Reg Pollard, whom Garrett had prescribed for the post despite resistance from the Minister for the Army, John Cramer, who had endeavored to choose Major General Ivan Dougherty, a resigned CMF officer. In spite of the fact that Garrett's proposed redesign of the Army along pentropic lines proceeded under Pollard, it demonstrated fleeting. The US Army relinquished the framework in June 1961, and the Australian Army came back to the triangular arrangement following an audit appointed by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in October 1964.
