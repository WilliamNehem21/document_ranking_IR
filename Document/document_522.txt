The Grand Fleet left for a voyage in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had proposed to utilize the Harwich Force to clear the Heligoland Bight, however awful climate forestalled activities in the southern North Sea. Therefore, the activity was bound toward the northern end of the ocean. Another range started on 6 March, yet must be surrendered the next day as the climate became unreasonably extreme for the escorting destroyers. The evening of 25 March, "Collingwood" and the remainder of the armada cruised from Scapa Flow to help Beatty's battlecruisers and other light powers striking the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. When the Grand Fleet moved toward the zone on 26 March, the British and German powers had just withdrawn and a solid storm undermined the light art, so the armada was requested to come back to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet directed an exhibit off Horns Reef to occupy the Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its protective minefields in the Baltic Sea. The armada came back to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refueled before continuing south because of insight reports that the Germans were going to dispatch an assault on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet touched base in the territory after the Germans had pulled back. On 2Ã¢ÂÂ 4 May, the armada directed another exhibition off Horns Reef to keep German consideration concentrated on the North Sea.
