Douglas started accumulating respects in her initial days composing for "The Miami Herald". During the 1980s, the honors turned out to be progressively esteemed, and her responses to them blended. The Florida Department of Natural Resources (presently the Florida Department of Environmental Protection) named its home office in Tallahassee after her in 1980, which she thought about a questionable respect. She told a companion she would have preferably observed the Everglades reestablished over her name on a structure. Amid her amenable acknowledgment discourse, she railed against Ronald Reagan and the then-Secretary of the Interior James Watt for their dull way to deal with ecological preservation. In 1986 the National Parks Conservation Association set up the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award, which "honor(s) people who frequently should make a huge effort to supporter and battle for the assurance of the National Park System". In spite of visual impairment and reduced hearing, Douglas kept on being dynamic into her second century, and was respected with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II, to whom Douglas gave a marked duplicate of "The Everglades: River of Grass" in 1991. Rather than presents and festivities, Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday, bringing about more than 100,000 planted trees over the state and a bare cypress on the yard of the senator's chateau. The South Florida Water Management District started expelling intriguing plants that had grabbed hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102.
