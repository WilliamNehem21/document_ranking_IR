All through August 1918, No. 4 Squadron "kept up a high operational rhythm" as the Allies propelled another hostile on the Western Front. On 7 August, Baker and two others took off from their squadron aerodrome at Reclinghem; every one of the three machines were conveying a substantial heap of bombs. Airborne over Pont-du-Hem, the trio discharged their bombs over German billets in the zone, before spotting two Albatros D.Vs. The three Australians surrounded the two airplane. Dough puncher drew in an Albatros, his flame separating the left wing of the air ship, adequately obliterating the machine. After nine days, an arrangement of 65 flying machine was gathered from No.ÃÂ 88 Squadron RAF, No.ÃÂ 92 Squadron RAF, No.ÃÂ 2 Squadron AFC and Baker's No. 4 Squadron AFC to execute a mass attack on the German aerodrome at Haubourdin. The armada of air ship was outfitted with a scope of ignitable and hazardous bombs, notwithstanding automatic weapon ammo. Driven by Captain Harry Cobby, the flying machine from No.ÃÂ 4 Squadron were the first to clear down and ambush the objective. At a certain point, Baker sought after a staff vehicle until the vehicle kept running up a bank and flipped over. He later detailed that "Nobody left the vehicle". The assault, which was the biggest aeronautical assault by Allied powers to that date, was profoundly fruitful; British evaluations inferred that 37 German planes had been demolished.
