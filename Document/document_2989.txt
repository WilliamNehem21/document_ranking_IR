Creation started in 1979, with the expectation to assemble a sum of 512 reinforced vehicles (200 tanks and 312 VCTP infantry battling vehicles). Monetary issues, be that as it may, finished generation in 1983 with just 150 TAMs and 100 VCTPs fabricated. These vehicles were delivered by an Argentine organization, "Tanque Argentino Mediano Sociedad del Estado" (or TAMSE) established by the administration in March 1980. 70% of the TAM's segments were made in Argentina, while the 30% made in Germany related to the transmission, optics and flame control framework. In 1983, 20 TAMs and 26 VCTPs were conveyed to the Argentine Army after a unique request of 80 TAMs by Peru was dropped because of budgetary issues. In 1991, TAMSE and the TAM generation line were closed down, despite the fact that in 1994 TAMSE was reactivated to finish a request for 120 of the two TAMs and VCTPs to supplant the M4 Shermans in the second Armored Cavalry Brigade of the Argentine Army. By 1995 the Argentine Army was outfitted with 200 TAM tanks and 216 VCTP and VCPC shielded vehicles. In spite of the fact that 25 VCA-155s were initially gotten ready for generation beginning in 1990, just 19 were finished and conveyed by 1995, alongside 50 VCTMs. No different variations of the TAM, including the VCLC, VAC and VCRT were put into generation because of spending limitations.
