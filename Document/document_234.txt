Over the span of the preliminary, Lanfranc is said to have expressed that the court was "attempting you not in your ability as cleric, however with respect to your fief; and along these lines we made a decision about the minister of Bayeux as to his fief before the present ruler's dad, and that lord did not bring him to that supplication as religious administrator but rather as sibling and duke." Unlike the later instance of Thomas Becket, St-Calais got little compassion from his kindred priests. A large portion of the diocesans and aristocrats that made a decision about the case appear to have felt that the intrigue to Rome was made to abstain from noting an allegation that St-Calais knew was valid. The last judgment was just come to after the lord lost his temper and shouted: "Trust me, cleric, you're not returning to Durham, and your men aren't going to remain at Durham, and you're not going to go free, until you discharge the chÃÂ¢teau." The surviving "De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi", or "Of the Unjust Persecution of the Bishop William I", subtleties the preliminary of St-Calais before the ruler. This work is the soonest enduring definite contemporary report of an English state-preliminary; some have questioned its validness, in any case, guaranteeing St-Calais would not have been as learned in standard law as the work depicts him. The history specialist Mark Philpott, notwithstanding, contends that St-Calais was proficient in group law, since he claimed a duplicate of the standard law, the "False Decretals", which still endures.
