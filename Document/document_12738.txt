The next year both the Great North and Highland railroads connected to parliament, the Great North for a line from Portsoy along the coast through Buckie to Elgin, and the Highland for a branch from Keith to Buckie and Cullen. Specialist was in truth, however on account of the Highland Railway just for a line similarly as Portessie, with running rights over the Great North coast line among Buckie and Portsoy and the Great North getting proportional rights over the Highland railroad among Elgin and Forres. The coast line opened in stages, the external areas from Portsoy to Tochieneal and Elgin to Garmouth opening in 1884. The inside area, which included overwhelming designing, with a long viaduct with a focal range of over the Spey at Garmouth and dikes and viaducts at Cullen, opened in May 1886. The line was served by four trains every day and a quick through train from Aberdeen that came to Elgin in hours.
