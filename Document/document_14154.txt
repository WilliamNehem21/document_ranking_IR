On 21 July 1944, around 0830, third Battalion hit the Asan shorelines on Guam. Arriving on the outrageous left of the whole third Marine Division, their central goal was to take Chonito Cliff and Adelup Point, which denoted the left flank of the division. Inside minutes the Japanese safeguards opened up with mortars and assault rifles, hitting numerous third Battalion Marines coming shorewards. By 0912 force administrator Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Houser announced numerous losses brought about by the two mortars and expert sharpshooter fire. Both Kilo and India Companies hurried the Chonito Cliffs yet the Japanese protectors (Elements of the 2d Battalion, eighteenth Regiment and 320th Independent Infantry Battalion) opposed firmly, now and again moving explosives down the slope. Upheld by flamethrowers, half-tracks, and protection from the third Tank Battalion, third Battalion battled a ridiculous, three-hour fight up the side of Chonito Cliff. Houser then arranged Lima Company to flank the precipices toward the north by dashing down an uncovered shoreline street. Having verified Chonito Cliff, the legion at that point proceeded onward to Adelup Point. The US Navy sent a destroyer to shoot the Japanese caverns at point-clear range and third Battalion flamethrowers wore out Japanese warriors who still remained. In the wake of verifying Adelup Point, third Battalion completed the day giving flank security to the remainder of the third Marines amid the Battle for Bundschu Ridge and turned into the main unit in the regiment to achieve its targets before W-Day's over.
