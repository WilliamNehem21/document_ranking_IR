Following its conclusion toward the beginning of the 1705 Lenten season, the GÃÂ¤nsemarkt did not revive until August, by which time Keiser had come back from Weissenfels to deliver his musical drama "Octavia". Starting here, Handel's normal association with the performance center seems to have decreased. In spite of the fact that he stayed in Hamburg for a further year, his fundamental wellspring of salary was from private exercises, as he put something aside for his since quite a while ago wanted visit to Italy. He by and by acknowledged a commission from the GÃÂ¤nsemarkt to create a setting for an expansive scale musical show dependent on the Greek fantasy of Apollo and Daphne. With its drifting plot and a grouping of moves and other set piecesÃ¢ÂÂvery nearly 100 melodic numbers altogetherÃ¢ÂÂthe work was in the long run isolated into two separate musical shows, for execution on progressive evenings. The two segments were given the formal names "Der beglÃÂ¼ckte Florindo" ("Florindo satisfied") and "Kick the bucket verwandelte Daphne" ("Daphne transformed"), however are commonly known as "Florindo" and "Daphne". It isn't known when Handel composed the music. He may have finished it in 1705Ã¢ÂÂ 06 while still in Hamburg, or it might have been created in Italy in the wake of landing there in the last piece of 1706.
