Work on Binnie's structure started, however was plagued by issues. Driving planners denounced the structure, with Arthur Beresford Pite portraying it as "an eventual Gothic building type of extraordinary profanity and idiotic need of importance", and T G Jackson depicting the extension plans as an indication of "the express obvious lack of interest of those in power to the matter of workmanship". Plans to manufacture substantial stone projections must be suspended when it was discovered that the southern projection would hinder the River Effra, which at this point had been redirected underground to fill in as a tempest help sewer and which streamed into the Thames now. The Effra must be rerouted to join the Thames toward the north of the scaffold. After the development of the establishments and docks it was then found that the dirt of the riverbed now would not have the capacity to help the heaviness of a solid scaffold. With the stone docks as of now set up, it was chosen to manufacture a steel superstructure onto the current wharfs, and a superstructure long and wide was planned by Binnie and Maurice Fitzmaurice and worked by LCC engineers at an expense of ÃÂ£437,000 (about ÃÂ£ in 2019).
