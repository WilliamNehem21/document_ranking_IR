The exact composition of the fauna "Achelousaurus" was part of is uncertain, as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa. Its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that "Achelousaurus" shared its habitat with forms roughly found in the middle or at the end of the time range of its formation. As with horned dinosaurs, Horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of the Two Medicine Formation. One of these was a form in between "Lambeosaurus" and "Hypacrosaurus"; in 1994 he would name it "Hypacrosaurus stebingeri". Today, "Hypacrosaurus stebingeri" is no longer seen as having evolved through anagenesis because autapomorphies of the species have been identified. Horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as indicative for a taxon in between "Stegoceras" and "Pachycephalosaurus"; these have not been consistently referred to a new genus. Finally, Horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional between "Daspletosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus". In 2017, tyrannosaurid remains from the Two Medicine Formation were named as a new species of "Daspletosaurus": "Daspletosaurus horneri". The 2017 study considered it plausible that "D. horneri" was a direct descendant of "D. torosus" in a process of anagenesis, but rejected the possibility that "D. horneri" was the ancestor of "Tyrannosaurus".
