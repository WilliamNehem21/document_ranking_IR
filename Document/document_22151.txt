A combination of hieroglyphic texts from Tikal, CopÃ¡n and QuiriguÃ¡, together with architectural styles and chemical tests of the bones of the founder of the CopÃ¡n dynasty all suggest that QuiriguÃ¡ and CopÃ¡n were founded by elite colonists from the great city of Tikal as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region. The recorded history of QuiriguÃ¡ starts in 426, in the Early Classic ("c".Â 200Â â "c".Â 600); according to hieroglyphic inscriptions at other sites, on 5Â September of that year K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was enthroned as king of CopÃ¡n. Just three days later he installed "Tok Casper", the first known king of QuiriguÃ¡, upon the throne. From this it is evident that right from the beginning of its recorded history QuiriguÃ¡ was subservient to its southern neighbour, and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of CopÃ¡n and, indirectly, of Tikal. During the next few centuries, about which little is known, the ceremonial architecture at QuiriguÃ¡ was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor. It is recorded that a stela, as yet undiscovered, was erected in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K'inich, the second king of QuiriguÃ¡. An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from CopÃ¡n, demonstrating QuiriguÃ¡'s continued status as a vassal of that city. A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of QuiriguÃ¡, but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult.
