The coordinated ("Antechinus agilis"), shrub rodent ("Rattus fuscipes"), feathertail lightweight plane ("Acrobates pygmaeus"), and sugar lightweight plane ("Petaurus breviceps") have been recorded visiting bloom spikes. Both dust and nectar are devoured by the southwestern dwarf possum ("Cercarteus concinnus"). Ants, honey bees (both local and European bumble bees), blowflies and dark colored butterflies have been recorded as guests to blossom spikes. The wasp "Mesostoa kerri" of the subfamily Mesostoinae inside the family Braconidae causes stem bothers on "B. marginata" in southeastern South Australia. The nerves are either round to a breadth of , or stogie formed to . Their impact on the plant is misty. "B. marginata" is a host plant for the larval and grown-up phases of the buprestid scarab "Cyrioides imperialis". Substantially more neurotic is the banksia longicorn scarab ("Paroplites australis") which drills openings in the base of banksia plants which at that point debilitate and fall or blow over with wind and bite the dust. A few types of organism have been recorded developing on the foliage, including "Acrospermum gaubae", "Argopericonia elegans", "Asterina systema-solare", "Botryosphaeria banksiae", a types of "Cladosporium", "Cooksonomyces banksiae", "Dimerium banksiae", "Episphaerella banksiae", a "Periconiella" species, "Satchmopsis australiensis", "Tryssglobulus aspergilloides", and a types of "Veronaea".
