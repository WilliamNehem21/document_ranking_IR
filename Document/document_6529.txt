On 9 August 1345 Derby landed in Bordeaux with 500 men-at-arms, 500 mounted toxophilite and 1,000 English and Welsh foot bowmen. Following two weeks enrolling and sorting out Derby walked his power to Langon, rendezvoused with Stafford and took order of the consolidated power. Stafford had to this point sought after a careful methodology of little scale attacks. Derby's aim was very extraordinary, instead of proceed with a careful war of attacks he was resolved to strike straightforwardly at the French principle compel before it was completely amassed. The French, becoming aware of Derby's entry, amassed their powers at the deliberately critical town of Bergerac, where there was an essential extension over the Dordogne River, under the order of Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain. They would likewise be inside reach of the French power under Henri de Montigny, Seneschal of PÃÂ©rigord, attacking close-by Montcuq. After a committee of war Derby chose to assault the French here. The catch of the town, which had great waterway supply connects to Bordeaux, would furnish the Anglo-Gascon armed force with a base from which to convey the war to the French. It would likewise constrain the lifting of the attack of the adjacent united chÃÂ¢teau of Montcuq and separate correspondences between French powers north and south of the Dordogne. The English trusted that if the French field armed force could be beaten or occupied the town could be effectively taken.
