As indicated by Colin Amery, who led a show of Lutyens' work during the 1980s, "some of [Lutyens'] best dedications and tombs" are to be found in Mells, and Edward Horner's remembrance is a standout amongst "Lutyens' ideal and most moving tributes to the misuse of life in the Great War". In his open war remembrances (especially the Cenotaph and the different dedications dependent on it), Lutyens frequently utilized unique and ecumenical structures, feeling that an alternate type of engineering was expected to pass on the feeling of distress at the huge death toll. Where he was charged to honor an individual, in any case, Lutyens was increasingly open to customary symbolism, for example, a statue of an officer. As indicated by Tim Skelton, creator of "Lutyens and the Great War" (2008), the Horner statue is "broadly viewed as a standout amongst the most moving of individual remembrances to the [First World War]". Lutyens' unique structure for Horner's dedication included columns ascending from the plinth to encase the statue in a tomb, yet this piece of the proposition was not executed. Munnings' shape for the statue is in plain view at the Munnings Art Museum, in his previous home and studio in Dedham in Essex.
