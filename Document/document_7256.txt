By area, the Central Highlands lost the best number of lemur species. It has lost almost the majority of its forest living space, however some lemur species still make due in secluded woodland patches. Lemur decent variety is firmly connected with plant assorted variety, which thus diminishes with expanded woodland fracture. In outrageous cases, treeless destinations, for example, the town of Ampasambazimba from the focal area never again bolster any of the lemur species spoke to in their subfossil record. Different areas never again have monster subfossil lemurs, yet despite everything they keep up forested living space that could bolster them. Despite the fact that the goliath lemurs have vanished from these areas, while the littler species get by in the backwoods fixes that remain, the subfossil remains show that the living species used to be progressively far reaching and existed together with the wiped out species. The Central Highlands saw the best species misfortune, yet was not by any means the only locale or natural surroundings type to observe eliminations. The least-comprehended area is the eastern rainforests, which have not yielded subfossil lemur remains. Thusly, it is difficult to realize what level of lemur taxa were as of late lost there; investigations of Malagasy traditions (ethnohistory) alongside archeological proof proposes the eastern rainforests were more biologically bothered in the past than they are today. Chasing and catching by people may have seriously affected expansive lemurs in this district also.
