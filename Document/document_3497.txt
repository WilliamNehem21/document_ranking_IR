Finishing of the interstate was the second most noteworthy need as indicated by the Highway Development Association in May 1963, after the I-5 expressway. Offering started on the segment from Broadway in El Cajon to Harritt Road in September 1963. This segment of the turnpike was to parallel US 80 toward the south up to Lakeview Road, and after that toward the north. This segment of the turnpike was booked to be finished by May 1965. By January 1965, I-8 had been finished from I-5 east to a trade with Lake Jennings Park Road, only south of the last's crossing point with the southern end of Harritt Road. At an expense of $3.44ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars), the undertaking decreased the evaluation and bends at what was known as "Passage Hill" that obstructed the stream of traffic. The piece of the interstate from west of Harritt Road to west of Alpine was in the mood for offering in October 1964, and the Highway Commission put aside $2.1ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) for this stretch in February 1965. An agreement for $1.42ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) was issued in August 1965. The whole stretch from Lake Jennings Road to Harbison Canyon Road was under development by September 1965 and was booked to be finished by the following year.
