According to Asser, at the end of his life, Ãthelwulf directed that his kingdom should be divided between his two eldest sons, and this was carried out when he died on 13 January 858. Ãthelbald then continued (or resumed) as king of Wessex, while Ãthelberht resumed (or kept) the kingship of Kent and the south-east. Ãthelwulf left a bequest to Ãthelbald, Ãthelred and Alfred, with the provision that whoever lived the longest was to inherit the whole; this is seen by some historians as leaving the kingship of Wessex to the survivor, but other historians dispute this and it may have been intended to provide for the younger sons. Judith's charisma as a Carolingian princess was so great that rather than lose the prestige of the connection Ãthelbald then married her. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" ignores the marriage, perhaps because mentioning such a prestigious connection of Alfred's older brother would have detracted from its focus on the achievements of Alfred himself. Ãthelbald's marriage to his widowed stepmother was subsequently condemned by Asser as "against God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and also contrary to the practice of all pagans", although it does not appear to have aroused opposition at the time. The Frankish "Annals of St Bertin" reported the marriage without comment, and stated that when she returned to her father after Ãthelbald's death, Judith was treated "with all the honour due to a queen". To her father's fury, soon afterwards she eloped with Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and their son Baldwin II married Alfred's daughter Ãlfthryth.
