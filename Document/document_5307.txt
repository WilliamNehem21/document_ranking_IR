The Napoleonic Wars, the name for a progression of associated clashes between the armed forces of the French Emperor Napoleon and his European adversaries, were nine years of age when the War of the Fifth Coalition finished in 1809. The Treaty of SchÃÂ¶nbrunn that pursued the war gave Napoleon ownership of the last piece of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the Illyrian Provinces. This formalized the control the French had practiced in Illyria since 1805 and over the entire Adriatic Sea since the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. In the Treaty of Tilsit, Russia had conceded France command over the Septinsular Republic and pulled back their own powers from the locale, permitting Napoleon opportunity of activity in the Adriatic. At SchÃÂ¶nbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan France and in this manner under direct French standard, not at all like the neighboring Kingdom of Italy which was ostensibly autonomous yet as a general rule went under his own standard. Along these lines, the Treaty of SchÃÂ¶nbrunn formalized Napoleon's control of nearly the whole coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, would enable him to transport troops and supplies to the Balkans. The French armed force framing in the Illyrian Provinces was perhaps planned for an attack of the Ottoman Empire related to the Russians; the two nations had consented to an arrangement to help each other against the Ottomans at Tilsit.
