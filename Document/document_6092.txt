Frederik Pohl later said that Gernsback's magazine distributed "the sort of stories Gernsback himself used to compose: a kind of enlivened list of contraptions". Gernsback found that the gathering of people he had pulled in was less inspired by logical development stories than in fantastical experiences. A. Merritt's "The Moon Pool", which started serialization in May 1927, was an early achievement; there was next to zero logical premise to the story, however it was exceptionally prevalent with "Stunning's" perusers. The spreads, which were all painted by Paul, were flashy and adolescent, driving a few perusers to grumble. Raymond Palmer, later to turn into an editorial manager of the magazine, composed that a companion of his was compelled to quit purchasing "Astounding" "by reason of his folks' aversion of the spread outlines". Gernsback tried different things with an increasingly calm spread for the September 1928 issue, however it sold ineffectively, thus the startling spreads proceeded. The mix of low quality fiction with gaudy work of art has driven a few pundits to remark that Gernsback made a "ghetto" for sci-fi, however it has likewise been contended that the making of a specific market enabled sci-fi to create and develop as a type.
