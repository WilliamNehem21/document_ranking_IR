At Cape Smythe two more Inuit seekers, Keraluk and Kataktovik, joined the endeavor, together with Keraluk's familyÃ¢ÂÂspouse Keruk and their two youthful girls Helen and Mugpi. As the voyage continued, Bartlett turned out to be progressively on edge about the degree of ice in the region, and noticed that the metal stemplates on the ship's bow had just been harmed. Throughout the following couple of days "Karluk" attempted to make progress, as Bartlett removed the ship northwards from the coast, following channels of untamed water. The main logical assignments of substance that could be completed amid this period were Murray's digging tasks, through which he gathered numerous types of Arctic ocean life, and the ordinary profundity soundings. On 13 August Bartlett determined their situation as east of Point Barrow, with a comparative separation to venture out to Herschel Island. This turned out to be the ship's most remote point east, as at that position she turned out to be solidly caught in the ice and started to move gradually westbound; by 10 September "Karluk" had withdrawn about back towards Point Barrow. In the blink of an eye a short time later, Stefansson educated Bartlett that all desires for further advancement that year had finished, and that "Karluk" would need to winter in the ice.
