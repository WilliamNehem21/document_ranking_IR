The premaxillary bones, which shaped the tip of the nose, contained only three teeth on each side, not exactly in most different theropods. The of the upper jaw were fixed with 15 sharp edge like teeth on each side in the holotype. The initial eight of these teeth were extremely long and vigorous, however from the ninth tooth ahead they bit by bit decline in size. As run of the mill for theropods, they included finely edges, which in the holotype contained somewhere in the range of 10 denticles for each . Example MWC 1 just demonstrated 11 to 12, and example UMNH VP 5278 12 teeth in every maxilla; the teeth were increasingly vigorous and progressively recurved in the last example. In all examples, the tooth crowns of the upper jaws were especially long. In example UMNH VP 5278, they measured up to long, which is equivalent to the base stature of the lower jaw. In the holotype, they are long, which even outperforms the base tallness of the lower jaw. In different theropods, a practically identical tooth length is just known from the perhaps firmly related "Genyodectes". Conversely, a few individuals from the Abelisauridae highlight short tooth crowns. In the holotype, every 50% of the , the tooth-bearing bone of the , was furnished with 15 teeth, which are, in any case, ineffectively saved. The two examples MWC 1 and UMNH VP 5278 get defensive in each dentary, which were, as appeared by the last example, somewhat straighter and less tough than those of the upper jaw.
