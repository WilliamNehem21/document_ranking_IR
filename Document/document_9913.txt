As the Japanese progressed towards New Guinea in mid 1942, the RAAF critically settled three new warrior units for Australia's northern protection, Nos.ÃÂ 75, 76 and 77 Squadrons. Jackson was elevated to acting squadron pioneer and designated leader (CO) of No.ÃÂ 75 Squadron on 19ÃÂ March, scarcely two weeks after the unit was shaped at Townsville, Queensland. He took over from Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, who had driven No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the undertaking of planning No.ÃÂ 75 for activities at Port Moresby, where the neighborhood Australian Army battalion was under normal assault by Japanese aircraft. Jeffrey later criticized Jackson for his enthusiasm to come back to battle regardless of having officially done what's necessary in the war, to which the last answered, "What are you battling for? Lord and nation? All things considered, I'm battling for my significant other and kids and no Jap knave will get them!" On 21ÃÂ March, Jackson drove the squadron's primary power to Seven Mile Aerodrome to participate in the barrier of Port Moresby, a critical early fight in the New Guinea crusade, and what military flight student of history Andrew Thomas called "a standout amongst the most brave scenes ever of RAAF". The unit was furnished with P-40 Kittyhawks, whose hotly anticipated landing had seen them flippantly named "Tomorrowhawks", "Neverhawks", and "Mythhawks" by the ambushed battalion at Moresby. Jackson's age of thirty-four was viewed as cutting edge for a military pilot, and he was warmly known as "Old John" to his men, one of whom was his more youthful sibling Les, presently a flight lieutenant. As CO, Jackson's initiative was to demonstrate motivational to his pilots, a considerable lot of whom had gotten just nine days of preparing in contender strategies, and discharged their firearms just once.
