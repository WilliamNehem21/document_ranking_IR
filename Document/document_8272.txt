Occupied with strife with their unique businesses, the Byzantine Empire, the Catalan Company had crossed the southern Balkans and touched base in southern Greece in 1309. The new Duke of Athens, Walter of Brienne, employed them to assault the Greek leader of neighboring Thessaly. In spite of the fact that the Catalans vanquished a significant part of the area for him, Walter would not pay them and arranged to persuasively oust them from their additions. The two armed forces met at Halmyros in southern Thessaly (or at the Boeotic Cephissus, close Orchomenos, as indicated by a before translation). The Catalans were significantly dwarfed and debilitated by the hesitance of their Turkish assistants to battle. The Company had the benefit of choosing the battleground, situating themselves behind damp territory, which they further immersed. On the Athenian side, huge numbers of the most vital masters of Frankish Greece were available and Walter, a prideful man and certain about the ability of his substantial rangers, continued to charge fast against the Catalan line. The bog obstructed the Frankish assault and the Catalan infantry stood firm. The Turks re-joined the Company and the Frankish armed force was steered; Walter and nearly the whole knighthood of his domain fell in the field. Because of the fight, the Catalans assumed control over the leaderless Duchy of Athens; they decided that piece of Greece until the 1380s.
