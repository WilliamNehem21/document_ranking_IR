On 20ÃÂ January, a power of over 100ÃÂ Japanese flying machine, containing aircraft, jump planes and warrior escort, joined on Rabaul. It was driven by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had controlled the assault on Pearl Harbor on 7ÃÂ December 1941. Two watching Wirraways of No.ÃÂ 24 Squadron assaulted the main rush of Japanese bandits. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then mixed, one slamming on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the ocean by Mitsubishi Zero warriors, two others crash arrived with serious harm, one got away with minor harm, and one stayed solid. The ten-minute activity killed six RAAF aircrew and injured five. An Australian fighter on the ground later reviewed, "We sat at our weapons, stunned by the slaughter we had recently watched". The Japanese warriors intensified the embarrassment by executing aerobatics over the shelled runway. Lerew flagged base camp, "Two Wirraways pointless safeguard. Will you presently please send a few contenders?", accepting the answer, "Lament powerlessness to supply warriors. In the event that we had them you would get them." The following day he was requested to assault the moving toward Japanese armada with "all accessible air ship". As his two workable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left just the one residual Hudson with which to execute the request; it properly took off to scan for the foe delivers yet was unfit to find them by sunset, and came back to base.
