The period under Pohl is viewed as the magazine's prime; the three back to back Hugo Awards won from 1966 to 1968 broke a significant lot in which the honor had been cornered by "Simple" (the name to which "Dumbfounding" changed in 1960) and "Dream and Science Fiction". Straight to the point Robinson remarked that "Pohl was the special case who was shocked when he won three Hugos in succession for altering "IF". It had a great time, and the fun had appeared." Niven's "Neutron Star" showed up in October 1966, and Harlan Ellison's "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" showed up in March 1967; both won Hugo Awards. Pohl likewise figured out how to verify another Skylark tale, "Skylark DuQuesne", from E.E. Smith; the arrangement had been begun during the 1920s was as yet mainstream with perusers. Pohl likewise purchased A.E. van Vogt's "The Expendables"; the story was van Vogt's first deal in 14ÃÂ years and pulled in long-term perusers to the magazine. Another overthrow was the serialization of three books by Robert A. Heinlein, including the honor winning "The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress", which kept running in five sections from December 1965 to April 1966.
