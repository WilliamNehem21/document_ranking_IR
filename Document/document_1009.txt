Hughes met with a few other Rhodesian figures before leaving late on 27 July, yet Lisbon stayed off the program more often than not. Just before Hughes withdrew, Dupont discharged an announcement saying that Reedman would get down to business in Lisbon on 1 August, and would be "heartily invited" by the Portuguese government. Hughes discredited this in a concise phone call to Smith, yet could do minimal more before leaving Rhodesia that night. On 29 July, Smith handled inquiries from the press, remarking on both Lisbon and the autonomy talks when all is said in done. He communicated the conviction that Rhodesia had gained more ground towards freedom conversing with Hughes than it at any point had previously, however qualified this by saying just Wilson's answer to the proposition given to Hughes would appear if this were without a doubt genuine. He said that despite the fact that he thought Whitehall was quick to determine the autonomy issue, he didn't trust their line had changed. He pronounced that he and the RF would not change their position at all. Moving to the subject of Lisbon, Smith focused on this was discrete from the autonomy question, at that point overruled Dupont's declaration of two days prior: Reedman's arrangement would stay temporary until further notice, he said.
