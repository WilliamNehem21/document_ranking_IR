"Alceste" first embraced a review of the Gulf of Liaodong, around then basically obscure to Europeans, and subsequent to investing some energy investigating the Liaodong Peninsula, continued southward to Jiaozhou Bay on the bank of Shandong, where she experienced "General Hewitt", and was later joined by Hall in "Lyra". "Alceste" and "Lyra" left the sound on 29 August for the west shoreline of Korea, a region that had not been overviewed since the Jesuit evangelists visited in the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of years. Maxwell observed the Korean coast to be somewhere in the range of 130 miles further east than anticipated, and during the time spent investigation likewise found the archipelago that frames the south-western tip of the Korean landmass. "Alceste" was then turned towards the Loo Choo Islands, presently known as the Ryukyu archipelago, mooring in the Napakiang streets on the south-west side of Okinawa on 16 September 1816.
