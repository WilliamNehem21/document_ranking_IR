Following the outbreak of World WarÂ II, Brain was given the task of coordinating Qantas' support for the Australian military, which became known as the Qantas Merchant Air Service. On 23Â February 1940, Fysh noted that since its formation in 1934, QEA had logged six million miles in flying boats and landplanes without suffering any injuries to passengers or crew. He called it "a record which has never been equalled in any part of the worldÂ ...Â It reflects the highest credit on Captain Brain, who has been in charge of flying operations during this time." In 1941, Brain took charge of ferrying eighteen PBY Catalinas from the United States to Australia on behalf of the RAAF, which had purchased the aircraft. US neutrality made it prudent for a civilian organisationâthat was also experienced in long-range flying boat operationsâto undertake the task. Brain and his crew departed San Diego, California, on 25Â January to make the first flight, having surveyed their intended route on the journey out from Australia. Travelling via Honolulu, Canton Island and NoumÃ©a, they arrived at their destination after one week, including sixty hours flying time; it was only the third such direct flight to Australia across the Pacific Ocean.
