Leigh's companions recommended she play a little job as a student in the film "Things Are Looking Up", which was her film debut, yet uncredited as an additional. She connected with an operator, John Gliddon, who trusted that "Vivian Holman" was not an appropriate name for an on-screen character. In the wake of dismissing his numerous recommendations, she took "Vivian Leigh" as her expert name. Gliddon prescribed her to Alexander Korda as a conceivable film on-screen character, however Korda dismissed her as lacking potential. She was thrown in the play "The Mask of Virtue", coordinated by Sidney Carroll in 1935, and got magnificent audits, trailed by meetings and paper articles. One such article was from the "Every day Express", in which the questioner noticed "a lightning change came over her face", which was the primary open notice of the fast changes in state of mind which had turned out to be normal for her. John Betjeman, the future artist laureate, depicted her as "the embodiment of English girlhood". Korda went to her premiere night execution, conceded his mistake, and marked her to a film contract. She proceeded with the play be that as it may, when Korda moved it to a bigger theater, Leigh was observed to be unfit to extend her voice enough or to hold the consideration of so substantial a group of people, and the play shut before long. In the playbill, Carroll had reconsidered the spelling of her first name to "Vivien".
