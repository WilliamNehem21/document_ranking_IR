The Second World War showed that science, and physical science specifically, presently required significant money related and material assets. To keep away from a cerebrum channel to the United States, twelve European nations joined together to make CERN, an exploration association along the lines of the national labs in the United States, intended to embrace Big Science extends past the assets of any of only them. Questions before long emerged with respect to the best area for the offices. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the perfect site. Pierre Auger, who composed the starter exchanges, dissented; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's essence would dominate others. After a long discussion, Bohr swore his help to CERN in February 1952, and Geneva was picked as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was situated in Copenhagen until their new settlement in Geneva was prepared in 1957. Victor Weisskopf, who later turned into the Director General of CERN, summed up Bohr's job, saying that "there were different identities who begun and considered the possibility of CERN. The excitement and thoughts of different individuals would not have been sufficient, nonetheless, if a man of his stature had not bolstered it."
