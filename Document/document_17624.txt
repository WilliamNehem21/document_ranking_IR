Soviet ice drilling projects began in the 1950s, in Franz Josef Land, the Urals, Novaya Zemlya, and at Mirny and Vostok in the Antarctic; not all these early holes retrieved cores. Over the following decades work continued at multiple locations in Asia. Drilling in the Antarctic focused mostly on Mirny and Vostok, with a series of deep holes at Vostok begun in 1970. The first deep hole at Vostok reached 506.9Â m in April 1970; by 1973 a depth of 952Â m had been reached. A subsequent hole, Vostok 2, drilled from 1971 to 1976, reached 450Â m, and Vostok 3 reached 2202Â m in 1985 after six drilling seasons. Vostok 3 was the first core to retrieve ice from the previous glacial period, 150,000 years ago. Drilling was interrupted by a fire at the camp in 1982, but further drilling began in 1984, eventually reaching 2546Â m in 1989. A fifth Vostok core was begun in 1990, reached 3661Â m in 2007, and was later extended to 3769Â m. The estimated age of the ice is 420,000 years at 3310Â m depth; below that point it is difficult to interpret the data reliably because of mixing of the ice.
