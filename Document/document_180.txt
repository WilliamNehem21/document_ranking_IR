In general, Viking metal is difficult to characterize since, aside from specific components like song of devotion like chorales, it did not depend altogether on melodic highlights and covers with other metal types, with sources in dark and demise metal Some groups, for example, Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play passing metal, yet consolidate Viking topics and along these lines are named as a component of the class. For the most part, Viking metal is characterized more by its topical material and symbolism than melodic characteristics. Instead of being a counterfeit up of medieval music, "it is in the band names, collection titles, fine art of collection covers and, particularly, in the tune verses that Viking topics are so clear." Viking metal, and the firmly related style agnostic metal, is to a greater extent a term or "behavior" than a melodic style. Since they are characterized essentially by melodious center, any melodic classifications of these two styles is dubious. In this way, Viking metal is even more a cross-type term than a descriptor of a specific sound. Ashby and Schofield compose that "The expression 'Viking metal' is one of numerous that falls inside an intricate trap of kinds and subgenres, the exact type of which is continually moving, as patterns and prevailing fashions develop and blur." From its causes in dark metal, Viking metal "has enhanced (in any event in aural terms), and now covers a scope of styles that run the array between dark metal and what one may legitimately term great shake".
