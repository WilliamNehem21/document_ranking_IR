The third Playford, Thomas Playford II, was conceived at Bethnal Green, London in 1837 to the second spouse of Pastor Playford. He was raised on the Mitcham property in South Australia, was scholarly and adademic, and wished to go the esteemed St Peter's College to consider law. He was reprimanded by his dad and along these lines turned into a rancher like his ancestors, purchasing property at Norton Summit and developing vegetables, plums and apples. He was chosen to the neighborhood East Torrens Council in 1863 at 27 years old; and afterward to the State Parliament in 1868 as a 'liberal' (parties had not yet shaped), speaking to the voting demographic of Onkaparinga. He ended up known as 'Fair Tom' for his clear and gruff ways. He lost his seat in 1871 and recovered it in 1875 just to lose it again until he was re-chosen in 1887, whereupon he ended up Premier of South Australia. He in this way lost the prevalence in 1889, recaptured it in 1890, and after that spent a lot of his term missing in India. In the wake of losing a race, he moved to London to speak to South Australia as Agent General to the United Kingdom. While in England, Playford was thrice offered a knighthood, yet declined it each time.
