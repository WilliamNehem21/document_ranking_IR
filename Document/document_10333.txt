Sam Moskowitz started a book survey segment in February 1957 that immediately transformed into a progression of articles about early sci-fi, starting with "The Real Earth Satellite Story" in the June 1957 issue, about satellites in early sf. Moskowitz likewise proposed stories that could be reproduced to enhance the articles, for example, Fitz-James O'Brien's 1864 short story "How I Overcame My Gravity", which went with the paper on O'Brien in the June 1958 issue. The greater part of these articles were later amended for his book, "Pilgrims of the Infinite", however the delineations, which repeated early craftsmanship or book covers, were excluded for the book variant. Margulies composed an article for each issue with the exception of the last one. In the April 1959 issue his article contended that a letter segment was an approach to "[strengthen] the bond among authors and perusers"; he as needs be presented a letter section in the May 1959 issue, which turned out to be the last. "Satellite's" work of art was unremarkable, in the assessment of Mike Ashley; he singles out Alex Schomburg's about six spreads for acclaim, yet portrays the inside craftsmanship, quite a bit of it by Leo Morey, as "average".
