Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp was appointed as Ramos' replacement, and Tottenham reverted to a traditional setup with Redknapp responsible for both coaching and player transfers. Redknapp took the club out of the relegation zone by winning 10 out of the 12 points available in his first two weeks in charge, and finished the 2008â09 campaign eighth in the league table. The January transfer window saw the return of Keane and Jermain Defoe to the club after spells at Liverpool and Portsmouth respectively, later joined by Peter Crouch signed in the summer, and Rafael van der Vaart in 2010.
The team's performance improved in the two following seasons. Notable matches in the 2009â10 season include the 9â1 home win against Wigan Athletic, with Defoe scoring five, a record win in the top flight for the club, and a 2â1 against Arsenal, with goals from Bale and debutant Danny Rose, giving them their first Premier League victory against their rivals. Spurs finished the 2009â10 season in fourth place, and reached the qualifying rounds of the Champions League for the first time in their history. In the 2010â11 season, they qualified for the group stages of the Champions League, came top of their group and went on to beat A.C. Milan 1â0 on aggregate in the knock-out stage. At the quarter-finals, Spurs suffered a heavy defeat against Real Madrid after Crouch was sent off early in the game, and the 10-men team was beaten 4â0 at the Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium, and 5â0 on aggregate. Earlier in the season they won at the Emirates with goals from van der Vaart and Bale, their first win at Arsenal in 17 years.
