Coming back to Port Arthur on 10 August, the squadron found that the city was at that point under attack by the Japanese Third Army driven by Baron Nogi Maresuke. On 23 August, "Sevastopol" barraged a Japanese battery with an end goal to escape alongside nine littler boats, however after she killed the battery, she came back to port after a Japanese post recognized the moving toward boats. As she was moving once more into Port Arthur, she struck another mine and required fixes. On 5 December the Third Army caught 203 Meter Hill, a critical position that disregarded the harbor. From that point, the Japanese had the capacity to flame on "Sevastopol" and different boats of the First Pacific Squadron that had endure the Yellow Sea fight. The boats around then were about far from the slope, putting them inside scope of Japanese shore mounted guns. By 9 December four ships and two cruisers had been sunk by the Japanese. "Sevastopol", in spite of the fact that hit multiple times by shells, figured out how to move far from the western harbor and out of scope of the firearms to the minor harbor of White Wolf, where she could be safeguarded by torpedo nets and blasts. Inside the cautious surroundings of White Wolf, Essen began to design a fight through the barricade to Vladivostok or a meeting with the Second Pacific Squadron, around then coaling at Madagascar. In the meantime, the directing chief naval officer of the Imperial Japanese Navy, TÃÂgÃÂ HeihachirÃÂ, as taught by Emperor Meiji in Tokyo, requested the annihilation of the ship by six rushes of destroyers, alongside some torpedo pontoons that were propelled from the and "Mikasa".
