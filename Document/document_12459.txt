The yearling touched base at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on April 28, 2014. He was flown in from California, his first time on a plane, and voyaged unobtrusively. When the plane landed, in any case, his movement quirk was found by the holding up press when he wouldn't be emptied until he was pivoted and called it quits the incline; Alan Sherman clarified later this was additionally his regular way of departure from ground-based transportation. Upon landing in Churchill Downs, the ponies entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given an uncommon seat fabric to wear while practicing on the track, recognizing them as Derby contenders and including their name. The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical mistake, with California incorrectly spelled as "Califorina". He wore it the main day and after that the track the board acquired one with the right spelling. Pundits remarked that getting the pony late and not giving him a full exercise on the track was an error, however Sherman's technique was supported by Lukas. In the days paving the way to the race, California Chrome dashed on the track, was strolled in the saddling enclosure, and educated at the beginning door. Willie Delgado later commented that the pony did not especially like that specific track, saying "he never really felt agreeable on it."
