In March 2014, Rivera was twice perceived for his altruistic endeavors, getting the ROBIE Humanitarian Award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation, just as a Jefferson Award for Public Service. Soon thereafter, the "Legends Series", involving two MLB show diversions between the Yankees and Miami Marlins, was played in Rivera's local Panama to "respect [his] heritage"; he advanced the recreations, which were enhanced by altruistic occasions and an affair profiting his establishment. On April 9, 2014, MLB reported that another yearly honor for help pitchers, the Reliever of the Year Award, would supplant the current Delivery Man of the Year Award, and that the AL respect would be named after Rivera. The next month, a segment of River Avenue flanking Yankee Stadium at 161st Street was renamed "Rivera Avenue" in the pitcher's respect. This corresponded with the arrival of his collection of memoirs, "The Closer: My Story", co-composed with Wayne Coffey. New York University offered a privileged Doctor of Humane Letters degree upon Rivera amid its beginning function at Yankee Stadium on May 21, 2014. Amid the 2015 Little League World Series, he was accepted into the Little League Hall of Excellence. The Yankees devoted a plaque to Rivera in Yankee Stadium's Monument Park on August 14, 2016. In May 2018, Rivera was named to co-seat the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.
