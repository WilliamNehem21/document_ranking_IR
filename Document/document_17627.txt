Although Davenport continued at the "Evening Mail" after Roosevelt was elected, the quality of his work declined; fewer and fewer of his images were selected for inclusion in Albert Shaw's "Review of Reviews". He also began to devote large periods to other activities; in 1905, he spent months in his home state of Oregon, first visiting Silverton and then showing, at Portland's Lewis and Clark Exposition, the animals he bred. 
In 1902, James Pond, a lecture circuit manager, hired Davenport as a speaker. Beginning in 1905, Davenport traveled on the Chatauqua lecture circuit, giving engaging talks, during which he sketched on stage. He sometimes appeared on the same program as Bryan, though on different days, and like him drew thousands of listeners. In 1906, he traveled to the Middle East to purchase Arabian horses from their native land, and then wrote a book in 1908 about his experiences. Davenport authored an autobiographical book, "The Diary of a Country Boy", in 1910, and collections of his cartoons, including "The Dollar or the Man" and "Cartoons by Davenport". Apparently as a joke, Davenport once included "The Belle "(or sometimes, "Bell"Â ) "of Silverton and Other Oregon Stories" in a list of his publications, and reference books for years listed it among his works. A book of that name did not exist, however. Some speculate that this was an early working title for "The Country Boy."
