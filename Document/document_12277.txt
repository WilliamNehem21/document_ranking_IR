Notwithstanding these pre-Galfridian Welsh sonnets and stories, Arthur shows up in some other early Latin messages other than the "Historia Brittonum" and the "Annales Cambriae". Specifically, Arthur includes in various surely understood "vitae" ("Lives") of post-Roman holy people, none of which are presently commonly viewed as solid chronicled sources (the most punctual likely dates from the eleventh century). As per the "Life of Saint Gildas", written in the mid twelfth century via Caradoc of Llancarfan, Arthur is said to have executed Gildas' sibling Hueil and to have safeguarded his significant other Gwenhwyfar from Glastonbury. In the "Life of Saint Cadoc", composed around 1100 or a little before by Lifris of Llancarfan, the holy person offers security to a man who murdered three of Arthur's troopers, and Arthur requests a group of steers as "wergeld" for his men. Cadoc conveys them as requested, yet when Arthur claims the creatures, they transform into packs of greeneries. Comparative occurrences are depicted in the medieval histories of Carannog, Padarn, and Eufflam, likely composed around the twelfth century. A less clearly incredible record of Arthur shows up in the "Legenda Sancti Goeznovii", which is frequently professed to date from the mid eleventh century (in spite of the fact that the most punctual original copy of this content dates from the fifteenth century and the content is presently dated to the late twelfth to mid thirteenth century). Additionally critical are the references to Arthur in William of Malmesbury's "De Gestis Regum Anglorum" and Herman's "De Miraculis Sanctae Mariae Laudensis", which together give the primary certain proof to a conviction that Arthur was not in reality dead and would sooner or later return, a subject that is frequently returned to in post-Galfridian old stories.
