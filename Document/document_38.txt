Cornelius resigned in 1938, and Popular Fiction Publishing was sold to William J. Delaney, who was the distributer of "Short Stories", an effective general fiction mash magazine situated in New York. Sprenger and Wright both got an offer of the stock from Cornelius; Sprenger did not stay with the organization but rather Wright moved to New York and remained on as proofreader. A lot of Popular Fiction Publishing was changed over to a little enthusiasm for the new organization, Weird Tales, Inc., a backup of Delaney's Short Stories, Inc. Dorothy McIlwraith, the supervisor of "Short Stories," turned into Wright's colleague, and throughout the following two years Delaney attempted to build benefits by altering the page check and cost. An expansion from 144 pages to 160 pages beginning with the February 1939 issue, alongside the utilization of less expensive (and consequently thicker) paper, made the magazine thicker, however this neglected to expand deals. In September 1939 the page check went down to 128, and the cost was sliced from 25 pennies to 15 pennies. From January 1940 the recurrence was diminished to every other month, a change which remained in actuality until the finish of the magazine's run fourteen years after the fact. None of these progressions had the proposed impact, and deals kept on grieving. In March 1940, Wright left and was supplanted by McIlwraith as proofreader; accounts of the magazine contrast about whether he was terminated due to poor deals, or quit in light of his wellbeingÃ¢ÂÂhe was at this point experiencing Parkinson's severely to the point that he experienced difficulty strolling unassisted. Wright at that point had an activity to lessen the torment with which he endured, however never completely recouped. He passed on in June of that year.
