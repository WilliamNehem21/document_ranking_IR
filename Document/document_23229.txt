Musically, Bax veered away from the influence of Wagner and Strauss, and deliberately adopted what he conceived of as a Celtic idiom. In 1908 he began a trilogy of tone poems called "Eire" (I. "Into the Twilight" / II. "In the FaÃ«ry Hills" / III. "Roscatha"), described by his biographer Lewis Foreman as the beginning of the composer's truly mature style. The first of these pieces, "Into the Twilight", was premiered by Thomas Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909, and the following year, at Elgar's instigation, Henry Wood commissioned the second in the cycle, "In the FaÃ«ry Hills". The work received mixed notices. "The Manchester Guardian"'s reviewer wrote, "Mr Bax has happily suggested the appropriate atmosphere of mystery"; "The Observer" found the piece "very undeterminate and unsatisfying, but not difficult to follow". "The Times" commented on the "rather second-hand language" at some points, derivative of Wagner and Debussy, although "there is still a great deal which is wholly individual". "The Musical Times" praised "a mystic glamour that could not fail to be felt by the listener" although the coherence of the piece "was not instantly discernible". A third work in the cycle, "Roscatha", was not performed in the composer's lifetime.
