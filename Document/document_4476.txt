A British power of 500ÃÂ sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the principal blockade, catching Morgan and his men in the city. Skipper George Laws drove his 500 men, comprising of Royal Highlanders and mariners out of the Palace Gate, when they experienced an American power under Henry Dearborn who was coming up to help Morgan. As Dearborn's men had their powder moist, they couldn't utilize their black powder guns and Dearborn and the remainder of his men surrendered. Laws at that point betrayed Morgan's gathering, who turned out to be increasingly obstinate. Laws himself was caught, however the endeavors of the Americans to break out were blocked. As the battling proceeded, the Americans came up short on ammo and one by one, gatherings of Continental Army troopers surrendered the battle. With no road of retreat and under overwhelming flame, Morgan and his men surrendered. The fight was over by 10ÃÂ am. Morgan was the last to surrender and instead of surrender his sword to a British officer, he gave it to a Catholic minister who been sent under a banner of ceasefire to request his surrender. At last, Carleton requested an attack on the battery outside the dividers, which was caught, and thereafter the British pulled back behind the security of the dividers. Found on the American bodies in the snow were paper streamers appended to their caps perusing "Freedom or Death!".
