Toward the beginning of March, Union Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, at that point officer of the Department of the Missouri, requested Grant to stay at Fort Henry, and on March 4 turned field direction of the campaign over to a subordinate, Brig. Gen. C. F. Smith, who had as of late been designated as a noteworthy general. (Different authors state that Halleck made this stride due to expert and individual animosity toward Grant; notwithstanding, Halleck right away reestablished Grant to full direction, maybe affected by a request from President Abraham Lincoln.) Smith's requests were to lead assaults planned to catch or harm the railways in southwestern Tennessee. Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's troops landed from Paducah, Kentucky, to lead a comparable mission to break the railways close Eastport, Mississippi. Halleck likewise requested Grant to propel his Army of West Tennessee (destined to be known by its increasingly acclaimed name, the Army of the Tennessee) on an attack up the Tennessee River. Give left Fort Henry and headed upriver (south), touching base at Savannah, Tennessee, on March 14, and set up his home office on the east bank of the stream. Concede's troops set up camp more distant upriver: five divisions at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, and a 6th at Crump's Landing, four miles from Grant's central command.
