In spite of the fact that "Myotis alcathoe" was at first known just from Greece and Hungary and was believed to be confined to southeast Europe, records from that point forward have significantly extended its range, and it is currently known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey. In a few European nations, centered quests were led to identify its event. Its living space for the most part comprises of damp, deciduous, develop timberland close streams, for instance in gorges or in alluvial woodland (backwoods almost a waterway), where there are many rotting trees that the bat can use as perching destinations. In Germany, its favored living space comprises of blended deciduous woods. In the south of the mainland, it for the most part happens in mountain ranges, yet the elements influencing its circulation in the north are less outstanding. Its range has all the earmarks of being comparable fit as a fiddle to those of the more noteworthy and lesser horseshoe bats ("Rhinolophus ferrumequinum" and "R. hipposideros") and "Myotis emarginatus". It might yet be found in other European nations, for example, the Benelux nations, Ireland, and Moldova. In spite of the fact that there are plenteous records from certain territories, for example, France and Hungary, the species seems, by all accounts, to be uncommon in the greater part of its range.
