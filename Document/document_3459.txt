Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969. They wedded inside a year. Her effect on him was quick, and her contribution in his profession expansive, leaving administrator Ken Pitt with restricted impact which he discovered baffling. Having set up himself as a performance craftsman with "Space Oddity", Bowie started to detect a without: "a full-time band for gigs and recordingÃ¢ÂÂindividuals he could identify with actually". The inadequacy was underlined by his aesthetic competition with Marc Bolan, who was at the time going about as his session guitarist. The band Bowie gathered contained John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, Tony Visconti on bass and Mick Ronson on electric guitar. Known as Hype, the bandmates made characters for themselves and wore expand outfits that prefigured the glitz style of the Spiders from Mars. After an unfortunate opening gig at the London Roundhouse, they returned to a setup showing Bowie as a performance craftsman. Their underlying studio work was defaced by a warmed contradiction among Bowie and Cambridge over the last's drumming style. Matters reached a crucial stage when a goaded Bowie blamed the drummer for the unsettling influence, shouting "You're screwing up my collection." Cambridge left and was supplanted by Mick Woodmansey. Not long after, the vocalist terminated his administrator and supplanted him with Tony Defries. This brought about long stretches of case that finished up with Bowie paying Pitt remuneration.
