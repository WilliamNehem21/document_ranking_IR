Following Peddle's abdication, Leech composed a propitiatory letter to Palmer, who reacted lamenting that them three had not cooperated, as opposed to experiencing some miscommunication. Palmer had written to recommend an option in contrast to the engraving reverse: that the coin portray the Women's Building at the reasonable. Stylist arranged draws and rejected the thought, expressing that the structure would show up an insignificant streak on the coin in the required low alleviation. Rather, he supported a sketch arranged by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, demonstrating a bowing lady turning flax, with a distaff in her grasp. Bloodsucker was not completely happy with the proposition, expressing that the juxtaposition of Isabella on the front-side and the Morgan switch was "an excess of lady". Prior to tolerating Morgan's plan, Leech needed Barber to deliver a few turns around himself, which the central etcher did, and Bosbyshell sent them to Leech on April 11 and 12. These indicated different employments of a heraldic hawk. Subsequent to thinking about these endeavors, Leech chose Morgan's structure and kept in touch with Palmer as needs be, expressing that "the distaff is utilized in workmanship to symbolize persistent industry, and particularly the business of ladies." accordingly, the Lady Managers recommended the utilization of the structure's entrance, and inquired as to whether it was conceivable to put a living individual on the coin. Parasite expressed that Secretary Carlisle had chosen the distaff turn around, and his assurance was authoritative.
