While at Winchester in 1070, William met with three ecclesiastical legatesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of SionÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ who had been sent by the pope. The legates formally delegated William amid the Easter court. The student of history David Bates sees this crowning liturgy as the formal ecclesiastical "seal of endorsement" for William's victory. The legates and the lord at that point continued to hold a progression of religious gatherings committed to transforming and revamping the English church. Stigand and his sibling, ÃÂthelmÃÂ¦r, the Bishop of Elmham, were dismissed from their church districts. A portion of the local abbots were likewise removed, both at the committee held close Easter and at a further one close Whitsun. The Whitsun board saw the arrangement of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas of Bayeux as the new Archbishop of York, to supplant Ealdred, who had passed on in September 1069. William's stepbrother Odo maybe expected to be selected to Canterbury, yet William presumably did not wish to give that much capacity to a relative. Another explanation behind the arrangement may have been weight from the papacy to delegate Lanfranc. Norman ministry were delegated to supplant the dismissed diocesans and abbots, and toward the finish of the procedure, just two local English religious administrators stayed in office, alongside a few mainland prelates named by Edward the Confessor. In 1070 William additionally established Battle Abbey, another religious community at the site of the Battle of Hastings, somewhat as a retribution for the passings in the fight and incompletely as a commemoration to the dead.
