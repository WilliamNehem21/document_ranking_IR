From 1996 to 1999, the congregation was reestablished with the assistance of supporters EnergoPol, a Polish organization, and Renovabis, a German relationship for Roman Catholic chapels. The Russian government gave assets towards the finish of the task. Reproduction occurred at first under the course of Polish organizations PKZ and Budimex, who totally reestablished the faÃÂ§ade and rooftop. From September 1998, Father Andrzey Stetskevich and Jan Tajchman, planner and restorer from ToruÃÂ, Poland, mutually supervised the work; they had recently headed the rebuilding of the Catholic Assumption Cathedral in St. Petersburg. (Stetskevich later rose to progress toward becoming vicar general of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow.) The inside fittings and the new special stepped area were worked by Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian specialists. Organizations in Moscow completed all the inner and outer marble work. The congregation decorations were created, under the heading of Vladimir Mukhin, by understudies from the St. Petersburg remodeling school. Recolored glass for the faÃÂ§ade's rose window were made in ToruÃÂ, different windows were delivered by Tolotschko, a Belarusian organization from Hrodna. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was ritualistically revived on 12ÃÂ December 1999 and was reconsecrated by the Secretary of State of the Roman Curia, Angelo Cardinal Sodano. The house of prayer fuses a library, the publication office of the Russian Catholic magazine "The Catholic MessengerÃ¢ÂÂThe Light of the Gospel" (Russian: ÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂ¾ÃÂ»ÃÂ¸ÃÂÃÂµÃÂÃÂºÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹ ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃÂÃÂÃÂ½ÃÂ¸ÃÂº Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ¡ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ²ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ³ÃÂµÃÂ»ÃÂ¸ÃÂ) just as the neighborhood office for the Caritas philanthropy.
