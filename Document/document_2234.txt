Despite the fact that a business and basic achievement, the play shut after 31 exhibitions when Barrymore crumbled, enduring a mental meltdown. Since showing up in "Reclamation" he had worked incessantly, showing up in front of an audience in the nights, while arranging or practicing the following generation amid the day, and when he showed up as Richard, he was spending his daytimes recording "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". He went through about a month and a half recovering under the ministrations of his dad's companion, wrestler William Muldoon, who ran an asylum. Amid the late spring of 1920, Oelrichs wound up pregnant with Barrymore's youngster, and a brisk separation was organized with her better half, which left her and Barrymore allowed to wed in August that year; a little girl, Diana Barrymore, followed in March 1921. Not long after the birth, he started practices for "Clair de Lune", which his better half had adjusted from Victor Hugo's 1869 novel "The Man Who Laughs". Barrymore induced Ethel to assume the job of the QueenÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ it was the first run through the two had showed up in front of an audience together in over 10 years. The play was a basic lemon, in spite of the fact that the nearness of the kin guaranteed that it kept running for more than 60 exhibitions.
