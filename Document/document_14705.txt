"Starship Troopers" has been distinguished similar to a piece of a convention in U.S. sci-fi that accept that rough clash and the militarization of society is inescapable and vital. Despite the fact that the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is alloted, is viewed as a modest post by the characters in the story, the novel itself proposes that it is the core of the military and the most decent unit in it. In a critique written in 1980, Heinlein concurred that "Starship Troopers" "commends the military ... Explicitly the P.B.I., the Poor Bloody Infantry, the mudfoot who puts his slight body between his adored home and the war's devastation Ã¢ÂÂ yet is once in a while refreshing... he has the hardest activity of all and ought to be respected." The story depends on the social Darwinist thought of society as a battle for survival dependent on military quality. It recommends that a few clashes must be settled by power: one of the exercises Rico is over and again instructed is that viciousness can be a viable strategy for settling strife. These proposals get to a limited extent from Heinlein's view that during the 1950s the U.S. government was as a rule excessively mollifying in its dealings with socialist China and the Soviet Union.
