Of more noteworthy concern, Gunson says, is the "conscious obscuring of duty regarding the upset". The film exhibits that the military commandants scattered, "leaving a complete power vacuum". Be that as it may, the central leadership's senior figure, General Lucas RincÃÂ³n (who declared ChÃÂ¡vez's abdication on TV), was not part of the upset and stayed in the administration after April 2002. The request makes the determination, "(1) either General RincÃÂ³n expressed a reality that was acknowledged all through the entire countryÃÂ ... or then again (2) General RincÃÂ³n lied, since he was an accompliceÃÂ ... that appears not to be reality since he [remained in ChÃÂ¡vez's administration]." Only one of the central leadership joined Carmona's break organization before adding to its destruction by pulling back his help. The military chiefs demonstrated pulling back their help for ChÃÂ¡vez were not the central leadership, and Vice-Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez was not the leader of the naval force, as the film claims. Gunson says, "With one single special case, these officers and chiefs of naval operations had not 'fled abroad' after the Carmona government fallen." Although Bartley and ÃÂÃÂ Briain acknowledge that RincÃÂ³n said ChÃÂ¡vez "had consented to leave", they emphasize that "components in the military [threatened] constrain in the push to make ChÃÂ¡vez leave"; the movie producers state it is "unimportant" that the entire military did not join the upset, as this "is the situation with generally overthrows". General RincÃÂ³n's declaration was overlooked in light of the fact that they felt it was "strengthening to the principle, key truth of the story", that no narrative proof of the abdication exists.
