Amid Hershiser's streak he posted 59 IP, 0 runs, 31 hits, 38 strikeouts, 10 strolls, and 3 additional fair hits, while Drysdale had posted 58 IP, 0 runs, 28 hits, 45 strikeouts, 10 strolls, and 3 additional fair hits. Drysdale kept up the record for sequential shutouts (6) in light of the fact that Hershiser did not pitch past the initial 10 innings of his September 28 begin since it endured 16 innings. Hershiser's record was dominated in light of the fact that the 1988 Summer Olympics and the beginning of the 1988 National Football League season happened in the meantime. Los Angeles had two NFL groups at the time (Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders). Moreover, baseball fans were progressively worried about flag races. Besides, four of the last five recreations in the streak were played in the Pacific Time Zone, restricting the diversions' perceivability to the remainder of the nation. Questionably, KTTV did not communicate either the September 26 amusement in which the Dodgers secured the NL West or the September 28 diversion in which Hershiser set the record. Rather, it demonstrated "Friday the thirteenth" and "The Funhouse" on September 26 and 28, separately. The record-setting diversion drew a participation of 22,596.
