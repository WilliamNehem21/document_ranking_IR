Gaga and Cooper co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the soundtrack for "A Star Is Born", which she insisted they perform live in the film. Its lead single, "Shallow", performed by the two, was released in September and has reached number one in several countries including the United States. The song earned Gaga an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Original Song, as well as the Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media. The soundtrack contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs, and received generally positive reviews; Mark Kennedy of "The Washington Post" called it a "five-star marvel" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "The Guardian" termed it an "instant classics full of Gaga's emotional might". Gaga received a BAFTA Award for Best Film Music for her work on the album. Commercially, the soundtrack debuted at number one in the US, making Gaga the only woman with five US number one albums in the 2010s, and breaking her tie with Taylor Swift as the most for any female artist this decade. It additionally topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the UK. Later that month, Gaga announced her engagement to talent agent Christian Carino whom she had met in early 2017. They ended the engagement in February 2019.
