In the flying segments, the player controls Nights' trip along a foreordained course through every Mare, taking after that of a 2D platformer. The player has just a restricted timeframe accessible before Nights tumbles to the ground and changes over into Claris or Elliot, and every crash with a foe subtracts five seconds from the time remaining. The player's time is renewed each time they return an Ideya to the Ideya Palace. While flying, Nights can utilize a "Drill Dash" to travel quicker, just as thrashing certain dream foes dispersed all through the dimension. Taking hold of specific adversaries makes Nights turn around, which dispatches the two Nights and the adversary toward the path the lift was started. Different aerobatic moves can be performed, including the "Paraloop", whereby flying around in a total circle and associating the trail of stars left afterward makes any things inside the circle be pulled in towards Nights. The amusement includes a combo framework known as "Connecting", whereby activities, for example, gathering things and flying through rings are worth more focuses when performed with hardly a pause in between. Catalysts might be picked up by flying through a few foreordained rings, demonstrated by a reward barrel. The catalysts incorporate a speed help, point multiplier and an air stash.
