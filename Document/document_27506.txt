The development team decided that, as with "And Then There Were None", they would change Christie's original ending for "Murder on the Orient Express". The aim of the developers was to create games that would not only appeal to casual gamers, but also to Christie fans. As nearly all Christie fans have read "Murder on the Orient Express", and know the solution, and considering that the novel was to be included with the game, the developers decided that the ending needed to be changed. The novel has two solutions â one being what appears to be happening and the other being what is actually occurring â and the developers aimed to develop a third solution which drew on these two solutions and still surprised the player. Lee Sheldon admitted that his variation to the ending of "And Then There Were None" received some criticism, and said that in "Murder on the Orient Express" changing the ending was even harder because of the sheer fame of the book and its solution. He also expressed his hatred of adaptations of older material which make fun of that time period, and said that he was trying to stay as faithful to Christie's work and time era as possible.
