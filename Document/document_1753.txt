As one of Harun's more youthful children, Abu Ishaq was at first of little result, and did not figure in the line of progression. Not long after Harun kicked the bucket in 809, an awful considerate war broke out between his senior stepbrothers al-Amin () and al-Ma'mun (). Al-Amin delighted in the sponsorship of the customary Abbasid elites in Baghdad (the "abnÃÂÃÂ¾ al-dawla"), while al-Ma'mun was upheld by different areas of the "abnÃÂÃÂ¾". Al-Ma'mun developed successful in 813 with the surrender of Baghdad after a long attack and the demise of al-Amin. Staying in his fortification in Khurasan, on the northeastern fringe of the Islamic world, al-Ma'mun enabled his principle lieutenants to administer in his stead in Iraq. This brought about an influx of abhorrence towards al-Ma'mun and his "Persian" lieutenants, both among the Abbasid elites in Baghdad and by and large in the western locales of the Caliphate, coming full circle in the designation of Harun al-Rashid's more youthful sibling Ibrahim as against caliph at Baghdad in 817. This occasion made al-Ma'mun understand his failure to manage from a far distance; bowing to prevalent response, he rejected or executed his nearest lieutenants, and returned face to face to Baghdad in 819 to start the troublesome errand of remaking the state.
