Because of swelling, 1919 statements for the execution of the pre-war development plans came to ÃÂ£66,000, contrasted with the 1914 statement of ÃÂ£27,000. By March 1922 this cost had diminished to ÃÂ£41,775, and the executives pushed ahead with the designs for the new Trinity Road Stand. Development started in April 1922 with the stand in part opened in August. Development proceeded all through the 1922Ã¢ÂÂ 1923 season, with the stand authoritatively opened on 26 January 1924 by the then Duke of York, later King George VI. He remarked to Rinder that he had "no thought that a ground so finely prepared all aroundÃ¢ÂÂand dedicated to footballÃ¢ÂÂexisted." On culmination the Trinity Road Stand was viewed as one of the most fantastic in Britain, complete with recolored glass windows, Italian mosaics, Dutch peaks in the style of Aston Hall and a general staircase. A few observers including Simon Inglis believe it to be Leitch's magnum opus; a "Sunday Times" journalist portrayed it in 1960 as the "St Pancras of football." The last expense of the stand and related 1922Ã¢ÂÂ 1924 ground advancements was determined at ÃÂ£89,000, an entirety that irritated the club's chiefs who requested an examination concerning cost and in 1925 constrained Rinder's acquiescence.
