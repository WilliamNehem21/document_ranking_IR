"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" was gotten emphatically by contemporary commentators. In an article for "The Source", The Ghetto Communicator stated "This record is cruel, yet so is the world that we live in. For B-young men n'girls who originate from the center of the hard, this is the hip-bounce collection you've been sitting tight for". "Amusement Weekly" stated, "With its thunder disorder of drumbeats, peppered with infrequent piano plunking, "Enter" has a crude, pass-the-mike season we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-stayed quiet." TourÃÂ© was less excited in "Moving Stone", lauding the collection's sound, however taking note of that "Wu-TangÃÂ ... are a bigger number of figures than breathtaking manifestations. In declining to commodify themselves, they leave clear a definitive canvasÃ¢ÂÂoneself." He included, "This is hip-jump you won't discover crawling up the "Announcement" outlines yet you will listen to blasting of Jeep sound systems in all the correct neighborhoods." However, "Enter the Wu-Tang" had amazing graph achievement, in spite of its crude, underground stable. It crested at number 41 on the "Announcement" 200 outline and achieved number eight on "Billboard"s Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums graph. The collection kept on selling relentlessly and was in the long run guaranteed platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.
