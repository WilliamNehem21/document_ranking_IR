Monroe came back to Hollywood in July 1958 to act inverse Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilder's satire on sex jobs, "Some Like It Hot". In spite of the fact that she considered the job of Sugar Kane another "imbecilic blonde", she acknowledged it because of Miller's support and the idea of accepting 10% of the film's benefits notwithstanding her standard pay. The troubles amid the film's generation have since progressed toward becoming "unbelievable". Monroe would request many re-takes, and couldn't recollect her lines or go about as directedÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Curtis broadly expressed that kissing her was "like kissing Hitler" because of the quantity of re-takes. Monroe herself secretly compared the generation to a sinking ship and remarked on her co-stars and chief saying "[but] for what reason should I stress, I have no phallic image to lose." Many of the issues originated from a contention among her and Wilder, who likewise had a notoriety for being troublesome, on how she should play the character. Monroe made Wilder irate by soliciting him to modify numerous from her scenes, which thus exacerbated her stage fear, and it is recommended that she purposely demolished a few scenes to act them her way.
