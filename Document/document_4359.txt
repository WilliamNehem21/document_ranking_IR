furthermore, wooden boxes decayed or were eaten by bugs. Parachutes for air dropping were hard to come by. Requests for parachutes were put in Australia, the United States and India. A solicitation for 5,000 load parachutes with compartments was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September it was chosen to send 1,000 without compartments via air, while the rest passed via ocean. Because of the deficiency of parachutes, most supplies must be "free-dropped"Ã¢ÂÂ dropped without parachutesÃ¢ÂÂso the rate of breakage was high. As the substance of the bundling generally burst, they were encased in at least two sacks, the external being a lot bigger than the internal, so it could contain the substance when the inward burst, and keep them from dispersing. Three layers was discovered essential. Things, for example, sacks and covers were favored as bundling, as these were helpful to the troops. Around 12,000 covers were utilized in the five weeks up to 12 October. The prior reception of covers as bundling would have spared supplies from breakage, yet would have likewise expanded the volume of provisions conveyed over the track, as a great many covers were sent via transporter. Without an efficient recuperation exertion, less that 50 percent of what was dropped was recouped, and maybe 70 percent of what was recouped was observed to be in a usable condition.
