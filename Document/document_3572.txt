A standout amongst the most acclaimed Welsh beautiful references to Arthur comes in the accumulation of courageous demise melodies known as "Y Gododdin" ("The Gododdin"), credited to sixth century writer Aneirin. One stanza applauds the grit of a warrior who slew 300 foes, yet says that notwithstanding this, "he was no Arthur" Ã¢ÂÂ that is, his accomplishments can't measure up to the valor of Arthur. "Y Gododdin" is known just from a thirteenth century composition, so it is difficult to decide if this entry is unique or a later introduction, yet John Koch's view that the section dates from a seventh century or prior rendition is viewed as doubtful; ninth or tenth century dates are frequently proposed for it. A few sonnets credited to Taliesin, a writer said to have lived in the sixth century, additionally allude to Arthur, in spite of the fact that these all presumably date from between the eighth and twelfth hundreds of years. They incorporate "Kadeir Teyrnon" ("The Chair of the Prince"), which alludes to "Arthur the Blessed"; "Preiddeu Annwn" ("The Spoils of Annwn"), which describes a campaign of Arthur to the Otherworld; and "Marwnat vthyr pen[dragon]" ("The Elegy of Uther Pen[dragon]"), which alludes to Arthur's valor and is suggestive of a dad child relationship for Arthur and Uther that pre-dates Geoffrey of Monmouth.
