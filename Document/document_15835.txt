Kathie Lee Gifford, then a television hostess on the morning talk show "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee", was the first of many celebrities to be spoofed in a "South Park" episode. The "South Park" creators said they chose Gifford completely at random, not based on any particular reason or distaste for her. Shortly after "Weight Gain 4000" aired, the tabloid "The Globe" hired Suzen Johnson to film herself seducing Frank Gifford, Kathie Lee's husband, for a newspaper story. The incident was the first of what Parker and Stone called the "South Park Curse", in which something tragic or embarrassing supposedly happens to a celebrity shortly before or after they were featured in "South Park". Actress Karri Turner provided the voice of Gifford in "Weight Gain 4000", marking her first and only guest appearance on "South Park". Gifford appears at a parade hidden inside a bulletproof glass bubble. The bubble was inspired by an appearance Pope John Paul II made in the Popemobile during a trip to Denver, which was attended by Parker and Stone. They thought the design of the Popemobile, which has a bulletproof booth built into the back of a modified truck, was "hilarious". The design of the trophy that Gifford was to give to Cartman is a reference to Parker and Stone's 1997 film "Orgazmo".
