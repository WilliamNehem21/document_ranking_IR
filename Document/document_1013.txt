Cragh was held tight a slope about a fourth of a mile (400 m) outside Swansea, in sight of de Briouze's Swansea Castle, on Monday 27 November 1290. He was executed alongside another "evildoer", Trahaern ap Hywel. In spite of the fact that the last was managed by the town killer, Cragh was hanged by one of his own relatives, Ythel Fachan, who was constrained into that administration by de Briouze. Trahaern ap Hywel was a vast and influential man who battled a lot as he was pulled up starting from the earliest stage his neck, making the crossbeam of the hangman's tree break. In spite of the fact that the killer, John of Baggeham, believed the two men to be as of now dead when they tumbled to the ground they were by and by hanged once more, "as an affront to their kinfolk", and on the grounds that it was the typical custom that hanged men couldn't be expelled from the hangman's tree without the ruler's consent. The execution occurred promptly in the first part of the day, and the two men were left swinging from the hangman's tree. John of Baggeham detailed that he chop down Cragh's body at about 4:00ÃÂ pm and sent it into the town in line with William de Briouze's significant other, Lady Mary. It is misty what was the fate of Trahaern ap Hywel, however his body may have been covered by the hangman's tree.
