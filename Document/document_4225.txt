Surveying for the "New Statesman and Nation", Raymond Mortimer composed that the boards "appears served from Picasso's Crucifixion [1930], yet further mutilated, with ostrich necks and catch heads jutting from sacksÃ¢ÂÂthe entire impact miserably phallic, similar to Bosch without the silliness. These articles are roosted on stools, and portrayed as though they were mold, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no uncertainty of Mr. Bacon's remarkable endowments, yet these photos communicating his feeling of the terrible world into which we have endure appears [to me] images of shock instead of masterpieces. In the event that harmony changes him, he may enchant as he currently alarms." Reflecting on the response of commentators and people in general, Bacon offered, "I've never referred to why my artistic creations are known as shocking. I'm constantly marked with ghastliness, however I never consider awfulness. Joy is such a differing thing. Furthermore, loathsomeness is as well. Would you be able to call the well known Isenheim raised area an awfulness piece? Its one of the best works of art of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thistles like nails, yet strangely the structure is so excellent it detracts from the ghastliness. In any case, that is the ghastliness as in it is so vitalising; isn't that how individuals left the incredible catastrophes? Individuals turned out as if cleansed into bliss, into a more full truth of presence."
