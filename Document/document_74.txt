The second Experience single, "Purple Haze"/"51st Anniversary", was discharged on March 1. It entered the UK singles diagram on the 23rd, topping at number three. Amid that month, the band took another long break from account while they played gigs in Belgium, Germany, and the UK, including appearances on the UK TV program "Dee Time" and the BBC radio show "Saturday Club". Planning clashes at Olympic drove Chandler to book a March 29 session at De Lane Lea. On this date the band took a shot at another recently composed Hendrix piece, "Hyper Depression"; they completed a harsh blend before the finish of the session that was later rejected for a re-blend finished at Olympic. On April 3, the Experience came back to Olympic, including overdubs and finishing last blends on a few incomplete bosses. Amid the eight-hour session, the band recorded three new melodies, including "Interstate Chile", "May This Be Love", and "Would you say you are Experienced?". As the collection's title track highlighted in reverse cadence guitar, bass, and drums, replication of the beat caused Mitchell some dismay while endeavoring the melody live. Chandler finished last blends for "I Don't Live Today", "Are You Experienced?", and "May This Be Love" before the finish of a session that Kramer portrayed as "sorted out."
