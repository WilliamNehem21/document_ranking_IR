The comedy "The Princess Diaries" and the adventure drama "The Other Side of Heaven", both 2001 Disney films, featured Hathaway in lead roles. Based on Meg Cabot's 2000 novel of the same name, the former follows a teenager Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway) who discovers that she is the heir to the throne of the fictional Kingdom of Genovia. Hathaway auditioned for the role during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand. Garry Marshall, the film's director, initially considered Liv Tyler for the role, but cast Hathaway after his granddaughters suggested that she had the best "princess" hair. The film became a major commercial success, grossing $165Â million worldwide. Many critics praised Hathaway's performance; a BBC critic noted that "Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry" and "The New York Times" Elvis Mitchell found her to be "royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features". She earned a MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female Performance nomination for the role. Hathaway starred with Christopher Gorham in Mitch Davis's "The Other Side of Heaven". Inspired by John H. Groberg's memoir "In the Eye of the Storm", the film met with mostly negative reviews and was a box-office failure.
