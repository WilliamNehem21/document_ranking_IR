The legislature made on MayÃÂ 25 articulated itself faithful to the ousted King of Spain FerdinandÃÂ VII, however students of history differ on whether this was genuine or not. Since Miter, numerous history specialists feel this claimed dependability was just a political trickery to pick up self-sufficiency. The Primera Junta did not promise loyalty to the Council of Regency, which was still in activity, and in 1810 regardless it appeared to be improbable that Napoleon would be vanquished and Ferdinand came back to the position of authority (which at long last occurred on DecemberÃÂ 11, 1813, with the Treaty of ValenÃÂ§ay). The motivation behind such a trickery would have been to pick up time to reinforce the situation of the devoted reason and keep away from responses that may have prompted a counter-insurgency, by influencing it to create the impression that monarchical specialist was as yet regarded and that no transformation had occurred. The trick is known as the "Veil of FerdinandÃÂ VII". It was maintained by the Primera Junta, the Junta Grande and the First Triumvirate. The Assembly of YearÃÂ XIII was expected to pronounce freedom, yet neglected to do as such on account of other political clashes between its individuals. Be that as it may, it smothered notice of FerdinandÃÂ VII in authority reports. Prior to the presentation of autonomy of 1816, the incomparable chiefs thought about different alternatives, for example, to consult with Spain or become a British protectorate.
