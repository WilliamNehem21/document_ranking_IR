The subject of whether the Citizenship Clause connected to people conceived in the United States to Chinese outsiders initially preceded the courts in a 1884 case, "In re Look Tin Sing". Look Tin Sing was conceived in Mendocino, California in 1870 to Chinese outsiders. In 1879, his trader father sent him to China; however after coming back from China in 1884 at age 14, he was banished from reappearing the United States by authorities who questioned his not having met the documentation necessities forced at the time on Chinese foreigners under the Restriction Acts of 1882 or of 1884. Look's case was heard in the government circuit court for California by U.S. Preeminent Court Associate Justice Stephen J. Field and two other government judges. Lucy Salyer, a history teacher at the University of New Hampshire, composes that Justice Field "issued an open welcome to all legal advisors in the region to give their sentiments on the established inquiries required" for the situation. Field concentrated on the importance of the "subject to the locale thereof" expression of the Citizenship Clause, held that Look was for sure subject to U.S. ward at the season of his introduction to the world regardless of the outsider status of his folks, and on this premise requested U.S. authorities to perceive Look as a native and enable him to enter the United States. The "Look Tin Sing" administering was not advanced and was never evaluated by the Supreme Court. A comparable end was come to by the government circuit court for Oregon in the 1888 instances of "Ex parte Chin King" and "Ex parte Chan San Hee".
