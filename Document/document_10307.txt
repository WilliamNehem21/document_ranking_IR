For her next component, Kapoor was given a role as the hero of Madhur Bhandarkar's "Courageous woman", a dramatization spinning around the Bollywood film industry. Initially the main decision for the job, Kapoor was reluctant to take on the venture when Bhandarkar moved toward her with the film's underlying idea. With doubts about the analysis her character may summon, she was supplanted by Aishwarya Rai. Days after generation started, Rai left the film (because of her pregnancy) and Bhandarkar re-drew closer Kapoor with the film. At the point when the executive strengthened his confidence in her, she consented to do the film subsequent to having perused the finished content. Kapoor (who depicted her character of Mahi AroraÃ¢ÂÂa blurring starÃ¢ÂÂas "bipolar and schizophrenic") shunned taking on some other ventures, since she discovered "Courageous woman" "exceptionally forceful and tiring". Analysts observed the film to be "dully tedious", however noticed that it was watchable essentially because of Kapoor's execution. Rajeev Masand portrayed it as "a delectably camp exhibition," played "with most extreme genuineness". Bollywood Hungama opined that it was her best work to date and reasoned that "[t]hough her character is conflicting [...] Kareena outfits the courageous woman's character with an uncommon weakness and an extraordinary internal life." At the yearly Stardust Awards, Kapoor accumulated the Editor's Choice for Best Actress, and got extra selections at Filmfare, IIFA, Producers Guild, Screen and Stardust.
