It was once believed that the rockfowl once in a while adventures a long way from its reproducing grounds; be that as it may, new information recommends that the species has an a lot more extensive territory than recently suspected. Rockfowl have been known to keep perching on their homes for a period following the rearing season. These flying creatures are regularly singular or in sets, however once in a while they live in gatherings of three to five flying creatures. Ordinarily, they quietly sidestep any uncommon developments in their woods. In any case, if these winged animals realize that they have been located, they can turn out to be very curious and every so often approach onlookers. One of the rockfowl's showcases involves a few of the winged animals in a settlement shaping a free circle. Individual rockfowl keep running at one another, constraining the moved toward winged creature to withdraw marginally before pursuing either the feathered creature that charged it or another in the circle. At interims amid this presentation a rockfowl inclines forward on a branch, tucking its head between its legs and half-spreading its wings, along these lines uncovering its crown to the next rockfowl. It is trusted that this conduct demonstrates the plan of the rockfowl to perch in a gathering, however ongoing proof proposes that the presentation could be engaged with reproducing. To scratch its head, the fowl lifts its foot over its wing. This species is seemingly perpetual.
