The AIF began embarking on the troop ships on 24 January 1943. As the Suez Canal ports were too small for the four troop ships to load simultaneously, the embarkation process was staged and the convoy's five vessels sailed separately through the northern Red Sea and rendezvoused near Massawa in Eritrea. British destroyers , , and and the Greek destroyer "Vasilissa Olga" were transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet to guard the troop ships from attack by Japanese submarines as they passed through the Red Sea.
"Queen Mary" was the first ship to complete loading, and left Port Tewfik on 25 January. She anchored at Massawa three days later, and the soldiers on board endured very hot conditions until she resumed her journey. "Aquitania" was next to load, and embarked the entire 20th Brigade between 25 and 30 January. "Ãle de France" completed loading and departed Egypt on 28 January, and "Nieuw Amsterdam" and "Queen of Bermuda" sailed together on 1 February. Overall, 30,985 Australians were embarked on "Queen of Bermuda" and the converted liners; "Aquitania" carried 6,953, "Ãle de France" 6,531, "Nieuw Amsterdam" had 9,241 on board, 9,995 sailed on "Queen Mary" and 1,731 on "Queen of Bermuda". A total of 622 AIF personnel remained in the Middle East after the ships departed Egypt, but this figure was steadily reduced to below 20 by March 1943.
