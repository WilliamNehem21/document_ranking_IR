U2 found that they were neither arranged nor all around practiced, and that their thoughts were not advancing into finished tunes. The gathering were unfit to achieve accord amid their contradictions and felt that they were not gaining ground. Bono and Lanois, specifically, had a contention that nearly got into a physical altercation amid the composition of "Strange Ways". Amid one tense session, Clayton expelled his low pitch guitar and held it out to Bono, saying, "You reveal to me what to play and I'll play it. You need to play it yourself? Proceed." With a feeling of going no place, the band considered separating. Eno visited for a couple of days, and understanding their endeavors to deconstruct the band, he guaranteed them that their advancement was superior to anything they expected. By including unordinary impacts and sounds, he demonstrated that the Edge's interest for a new sonic area was not contrary with Mullen's and Lanois' "want to clutch strong tune structures". At last, a leap forward was accomplished with the composition of the tune "One". While taking a shot at "Debilitated Puppy"Ã¢ÂÂ an early form of "Secretive Ways"Ã¢ÂÂ The Edge played two separate harmony movements consecutively on guitar at Lanois' support, and discovering motivation, the gathering immediately extemporized another melody that progressed toward becoming "One". It gave consolation and approved their long-standing "clear page approach" to composing and recording together.
