"Bellerophon" returned to sea in May 1795 after three months anchored in the Solent. She had been at Spithead on 1 May, when the 98-gun caught fire and blew up, with "Bellerophon" rescuing twelve men. Still with the Channel Fleet, she joined a squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis which was patrolling off Ushant. The squadron had arrived on station on 7 June, and the following day captured a convoy of eight French merchants off Belle Ãle. The squadron remained in the area until 16 June, when a lookout on "Bellerophon" spotted a large fleet to the east-south-east. This was the Brest fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, two frigates, two brigs and a cutter, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis ordered a retreat, but the "Bellerophon" and sailed unusually slowly and he found himself being steadily overhauled by the French. Keeping his ships together, Cornwallis ordered "Bellerophon" to take up position at the head of his line, later explaining that "The Bellerophon I was glad to keep in some measure as a reserve, having reason at first to suppose there would be full occasion for the utmost exertions of us allÂ ... I considered that ship a treasure in store, having heard of her former accomplishments, and observing the spirit manifested by all on board when she passed me, joined to the zeal and activity shewed by Lord Cranstoun during the whole cruize."
