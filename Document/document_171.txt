Massa secured his third post position of the period with a period of 1:15.787, and was joined on the first line by partner RÃÂ¤ikkÃÂ¶nen. Hamilton took third spot on the framework, with a passing time simply 0.052ÃÂ seconds slower than Massa's. Kovalainen defeated Kubica to take fourth, the last attempting to get heat into his tires for his last run. Rosberg's assaulting style took him to 6th; Renault driver Fernando Alonso, Trulli and Red Bull driver Mark Webber involved the following three spots. Webber's partner David Coulthard finished his second session in the boundaries after the passage, after his vehicle jolted sideways at the peak under braking. In spite of the fact that Coulthard was safe, the situation of his stricken vehicle and the ensuing alert banners encompassing it denied numerous drivers the chance to make their last flying laps in the session. Honda driver Jenson Button, who took twelfth behind Timo Glock of Toyota, censured the disturbance for his execution, having arranged his vehicle explicitly for the last run. Heidfeld experienced comparable tire issues to his partner and oversaw thirteenth; Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima and Honda driver Rubens Barrichello took the following two places in front of Bourdais in the new STR3. Renault driver Nelson Piquet arranged from seventeenth and Vettel oversaw eighteenth before his gearbox punishment downgraded him to nineteenth. The Force Indias of Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella qualified slowest; Fisichella's punishment for a difference in gearbox in the wake of morning practice implied he began from twentieth on the lattice.
