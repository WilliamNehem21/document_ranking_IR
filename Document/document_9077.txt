"Four Times of the Day" was the principal arrangement of prints that Hogarth had issued since the accomplishment of the "Whore" and "Rake" (and would be the main set he would issue until "Marriage in the current style" in 1745), so it was excitedly foreseen. On becoming aware of its fast approaching issue, George Faulkner composed from Dublin that he would take 50 sets. The arrangement comes up short on the ethical exercises that are found in the before arrangement and returned to in "Marriage in the current style", and its absence of teeth implied it neglected to make a similar progress, however it has discovered a suffering specialty as a depiction of the general public of Hogarth's time. At the closeout of 1745, the depictions of "Four Times of the Day" raised more than those of the "Rake"; and "Night", which is by and large viewed as the most exceedingly bad of the arrangement, brought the most astounding single aggregate. Cunningham remarked wryly: "Such was the reward at that point, to which the supporters of virtuoso idea these works entitled". While Horace Walpole commended the going with print, "Walking Actresses Dressing in a Barn", just like the best of Hogarth's works, he wanted to sit quiet of "Four Times of the Day" other than that it didn't wind up needing in correlation with Hogarth's different works.
