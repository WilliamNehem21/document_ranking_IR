The "Mahan"s' impetus plant was significantly improved over that of the "Farragut"s. The steam weight was brought from to up in certain boats, and the superheated steam temperature was brought from to up in all boats. Twofold decrease adapting supplanted single decrease outfitting, and permitted littler, quicker swinging turbines to be utilized. This spared enough space and weight so that cruising turbines could be fitted, which enormously improved efficiency at moderate velocities. The kettle economizers, as in past boats, further improved mileage. The boats' range was stretched out to at , more distant than the "Farragut"s. The plan shaft pull was expanded from to in a similar space and weight as in the "Farragut"s. The generally smaller power plant added to the "Mahan"s' capacity to convey 12 torpedo cylinders rather than eight with just 150 tons of additional removal. The fundamental turbines were made by the General Electric Company and were the drive type, additionally called the Curtis turbines. Every fundamental turbine was separated into a high-weight (HP) and a low-weight (LP) turbine, which nourished into a typical decrease apparatus and drove a pole, along these lines to the hardware represented at the accompanying reference note. The steam from the boilers was provided to the HP turbine, which depleted to the LP turbine, thusly depleted to the condenser. The cruising turbines were outfitted to the HP turbines and could be locked in or withdrew as required. At low speeds, they were worked in an arrangement with the HP turbines to improve the productivity of the general turbine game plan, and furthermore improved the mileage. This general course of action with twofold decrease intending turned into a standard for most ensuing steam-controlled surface boats of the US Navy, despite the fact that not every one of them had cruising turbines.
