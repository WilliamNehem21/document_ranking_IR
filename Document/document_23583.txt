Chile's was launched on 27 November 1913. After the First World War broke out in Europe, work on "Almirante Latorre" was halted in August 1914, and it was formally purchased on 9 September after the British Cabinet recommended it four days earlier. "Almirante Latorre" was not forcibly seized like the Ottoman "ReÅadiye" and "SultÃ¢n OsmÃ¢n-Ä± Evvel" (ex-"Rio de Janeiro"), two other ships being built for a foreign navy, as a result of Chile's "friendly neutral" status with the United Kingdom. The British needed to maintain this relationship owing to their dependence on Chilean nitrate imports, which were vital to the British armament industry. The former Chilean shipâthe largest vessel built by Armstrong up to that timeâwas completed on 30 September 1915, commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October, and served in that navy in the First World War. Work on the other battleship, "Almirante Cochrane", was halted after the outbreak of war. The British purchased the incomplete hulk on 28 February 1918 for conversion to an aircraft carrier, as "Almirante Cochrane" was the only large and fast hull which was immediately available and capable of being modified into a carrier without major reconstruction. Low priority and quarrels with shipyard workers slowed completion of the ship; it was commissioned into the Royal Navy as in 1924.
