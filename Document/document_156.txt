After Stone and Jefferson repeated the proof they had given in Bow Street, George Orsborne stood up. He said he had not consented to Moore's proposition to "lose" the vessel, and in the wake of withdrawing with "Young lady Pat" had still been unsure about what he would do. He had left Jefferson in Dover since he was a poor specialist and an alcoholic. Moore, he declared, was mixed up in guaranteeing that the watercraft's arrangements and gear were satisfactory. Orsborne said that while the vessel was shielding in Jersey, he had recommended to the team that they "should make an occasion of it", and afterward suggested that they influence a hover of the Atlantic Ocean before coming back To grimsby. There was no expectation to fall in with Moore's plan or to take the vessel; they would "thank the proprietors for the advance of the ship" and return it. Orsborne included that while they were in port at CorcubiÃÂ³n, he was offered cash for "Young lady Pat", yet turned it down. Orsborne denied that he had attempted to hide his or the pontoon's actual character in Dakar, or had left the port to maintain a strategic distance from enquiriesÃ¢ÂÂthe abrupt takeoff was expected, he stated, to issues with the locals. Nor had he endeavored to dodge the experts in Georgetown; his developments there had emerged from worry for the wellbeing of his vessel, which was being risked by the moves of the police dispatch.
