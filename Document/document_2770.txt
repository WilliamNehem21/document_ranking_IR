The first U.S. Government supported undertaking to enter Jackson Hole was the 1859Ã¢ÂÂ 60 Raynolds Expedition. Driven by U.S. Armed force Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by mountain man Jim Bridger, it included naturalist F. V. Hayden, who later driven different endeavors to the locale. The endeavor had been accused of investigating the Yellowstone locale, yet experienced troubles crossing mountain goes because of snow. Bridger wound up controlling the undertaking south over Union Pass at that point following the Gros Ventre River waste to the Snake River and leaving the locale over Teton Pass. Sorted out investigation of the district was ended amid the American Civil War yet continued when F. V. Hayden drove the all around subsidized Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. In 1872, Hayden administered investigations in Yellowstone, while a part of his campaign known as the Snake River Division was driven by James Stevenson and investigated the Teton district. Alongside Stevenson was picture taker William Henry Jackson who took the main photos of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named a large number of the mountains and lakes in the district. The investigations by early mountain men and consequent endeavors neglected to distinguish any wellsprings of monetarily suitable mineral riches. All things considered, little gatherings of miners set up cases and mining tasks on a few of the rivers and waterways. By 1900 every single composed exertion to recover minerals had been deserted.
