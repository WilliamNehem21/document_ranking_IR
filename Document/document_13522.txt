The steamer which had crashed into "Ice" was , an iron-hulled propeller-driven French ship utilized by a noteworthy angling administrator to ship its workers to and from their focal point of tasks at Saint Pierre Island, Newfoundland. To those on "Arctic"s deck, "Vesta" gave off an impression of being lethally harmed; Luce thought her bows "appeared to be actually cut or pulverized off for full ten feet". His first response, trusting his own ship practically immaculate, was to help "Vesta", on which scenes of frenzy and turmoil among the 200-odd mariners and anglers on board her were obvious. He requested his main officer, Robert Gourlay, to bring down one of "Arctic"s six rafts with a team of six, and to find out what help could be offered; in the mean time, "Ice" gradually surrounded the stricken vessel. Gourlay's vessel was rapidly away, and another was set up for propelling, under second officer William Baalham, however before this should be possible Luce repealed the request. He had seen an adjustment in the development of "Arctic"s paddle wheels through the water and saw additionally that the ship was posting, indications of conceivably genuine harm. Baalham was requested to make a closer investigation of the purpose of effect; he found that flotsam and jetsam from "Vesta"s iron stem and stay were skewered in the woodwork of "Arctic"s body, making generous openings around eighteen creeps over the water-line. Two breaks were beneath the waterline, conceding extensive amounts of water. In contrast to "Vesta", "Ice" was not furnished with watertight compartments; the frame was open from stem to stern.
