Commander Rachel Garrett of the "Venture"- C and her team learn they have gone into what's to come. Garrett clarifies that they were reacting to a trouble call from the Klingon station on Narendra III, and were assaulted by Romulan starships. While his team attempts to fix the "Undertaking"- C and keep an eye on the group's wounds, Picard and his direction staff talk about whether the ship should come back to the past. Authority Riker contends that their demises would be good for nothing, however Data recommends that it would be viewed as a noteworthy demonstration by the Klingons. Picard examines the circumstance with Garrett, who reveals to him that her team will serve the Federation in the present. Picard discreetly uncovers to her that the Federation is very nearly rout and the nearness of one ship will have no effect, however on the off chance that the "Venture"- C were to come back to the past they may keep the war from consistently beginning. Garrett concurs and reports to her team that they will return through the inconsistency; right then and there, the two boats are trapped by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is executed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes direction.
