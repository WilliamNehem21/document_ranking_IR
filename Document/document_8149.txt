The basic reaction to "The Turn of the Screw" was blended. The film was applauded by Matt Baylis, writing in "The Express", as one of the better adjustments of James' story. "The Times"s David Chater, in spite of the fact that he didn't consider the film "unnerving" or "suppurate[d] in abhorrence", discovered it "never not exactly engrossing", suspecting this would be especially so for watchers new to the story. "The Daily Telegraph"s Simon Horsford felt that "The Turn of the Screw" "probably won't take a shot at all dimensions however it is a disrupting understanding in any case". Paradoxically, Tom Sutcliffe, writing in "The Independent", was neutral with the film, considering James' tale to have been "extensively vandalized", while Richard Whittaker, writing in "The Austin Chronicle", felt that the film was "a specific and impossible to miss fizzle" from Welch. "The Turn of the Screw" was picked as "pick of the day" in "The Sunday Times", in spite of the commentator, Victoria Segal, communicating her view that the film was "a long way from flawless". In any case, she included that the blemishes could be neglected, and in spite of the fact that there are times "when it pounds through the apparatuses with a thump and bang", the "soul" of James' story is held.
