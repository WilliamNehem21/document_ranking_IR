GameSpot commented that the concept of mixing the serious elements of "Final Fantasy" with the lighter elements of Disney seemed impossible, but was pulled off quite well. Because of that they awarded "Kingdom Hearts" "Best Crossover Since "Capcom vs. SNK"" in their 2002 Best and Worst of the Year awards. GameSpy noted that the periodic departure from the main plot into the Disney side stories was disappointing, and when the original plot builds to a climax, "the story fails to gel thanks to a confusing mish-mash of vague terms and symbolism that probably made more sense in the director's head than in this final product." Aside from the plot, they stated that the overall package was worth playing through to the end. G4TV awarded it "Best Story" at their 2003 G-Phoria awards show. Fan response was also positive; "Kingdom Hearts" was voted as the 19th best game of all-time by readers of the Japanese magazine "Famitsu", 16th by the users of website GameFAQs, and 92nd by IGN users. "Kingdom Hearts" ranked ninth on IGN's most recent "Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time" list. It was also a nominee for the Best Game Award from the for 2001-2002. In the making of the 2004 video game "Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel" the developers, Racjin, looked at other titles for inspiration, particularly "Kingdom Hearts" when making the game.
