In 1932, after completing "Devil and the Deep" with Tallulah Bankhead to fulfill his old contract, Cooper appeared in "A Farewell to Arms", the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. Co-starring Helen Hayes, a leading New York theatre star and Academy Award winner, and Adolphe Menjou, the film presented Cooper with one of his most ambitious and challenging dramatic roles, playing an American ambulance driver wounded in Italy who falls in love with an English nurse during World War I. Critics praised his highly intense and emotional performance, and the film became one of the year's most commercially successful pictures. In 1933, after making "Today We Live" with Joan Crawford and "One Sunday Afternoon" with Fay Wray, Cooper appeared in the Ernst Lubitsch comedy film "Design for Living", based on the successful NoÃ«l Coward play. Co-starring Miriam Hopkins and Fredric March, the film received mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office. Cooper's performance â playing an American artist in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a beautiful woman â was singled out for its versatility and revealed his genuine ability to do light comedy. Cooper changed his name legally to "Gary Cooper" in August 1933.
