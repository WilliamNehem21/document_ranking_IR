The early rulers of the Wodeyar administration revered the Hindu god Shiva. The later lords, beginning from the seventeenth century, took to Vaishnavism, the love of the Hindu god Vishnu. As per musicologist Meera Rajaram Pranesh, King Raja Wodeyar I was a fan of the god Vishnu, King Dodda Devaraja was regarded with the title "Defender of Brahmins" ("Deva Brahmana Paripalaka") for his help to Brahmins, and Maharaja Krishnaraja III was committed to the goddess Chamundeshwari (a type of Hindu goddess Durga). Wilks ("History of Mysore", 1800) expounded on a "Jangama" (Veerashaiva holy person aficionado of Shiva) uprising, identified with over the top tax assessment, which was put down solidly by Chikka Devaraja. Student of history D.R. Nagaraj claims that four hundred "Jangamas" were killed all the while yet clears up that Veerashiava writing itself is quiet about the issue. History specialist Suryanath Kamath claims King Chikka Devaraja was a Srivaishnava (adherent of Sri Vaishnavism, a faction of Vaishnavism) yet was not hostile to Veerashaiva. Antiquarian Aiyangar agrees that a portion of the lords including the observed Narasaraja I and Chikka Devaraja were Vaishnavas, however recommends this might not have been the situation with all Wodeyar rulers. The ascent of the current Mysore city as a focal point of south Indian culture has been followed from the time of their sway. Raja Wodeyar I started the festival of the Dasara celebration in Mysore, a pleased custom of the recent Vijayanagara illustrious family.
