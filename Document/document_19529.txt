York started 2012â13 by winning five of 14 matches, and were ninth in the table by late October 2012. They dropped down the table in the following months, but were still in contention for a play-off place after beating Burton Albion 3â0 in the New Year. After this match, York failed to win 11 consecutive matches, and Mills was dismissed in March 2013 after a 2â0 home defeat to Bradford City. Under his replacement, former Northern Ireland manager Nigel Worthington, York avoided relegation by winning four of their last five matches. They finished their first League Two season in 17th place. York won only four of their first 23 matches of 2013â14, and were third from the bottom of the table by late December 2013. A number of influential signings in January 2014 helped York improve their form, and from early February they were unbeaten in 17 consecutive matches, conceding no goals from open play. York finished in seventh place and played Fleetwood Town in the play-off semi-final. After losing the first leg 1â0 at home, York drew 0â0 at Highbury Stadium in the second leg. Worthington resigned as manager in October 2014 after York won only one of their opening 14 matches of 2014â15. He was succeeded by former Scunthorpe United manager Russ Wilcox. York remained in the lower reaches of the table. They avoided relegation with a late-season run of four wins from five matches, finishing the season in 18th place.
