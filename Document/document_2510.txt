After the passing of his mom KinoÃÂ»ole in 1855, Pitman's dad remarried to Maria Louisa Walsworth Kinney, the widow of American preacher Rev. Henry Kinney. The Kinneys were a piece of the Twelfth Company of teachers from the ABCFM to land in 1848. The marriage adjusted the Pitman youngsters to the American teacher network. They were classified "cousins" by the offspring of the ministers and considered piece of the all-encompassing preacher group of HawaiÃÂ»i. This first stepmother kicked the bucket in 1858 in the wake of bringing forth their dad's fourth tyke, a little girl named Maria KinoÃÂ»ole (1858Ã¢ÂÂ 1892). The Pitman family came back to Massachusetts in 1861 after his dad remarried to his third spouse Martha Ball, giving his four kids another stepmother. Letters by British explorer Sophia Cracroft, niece of Lady Jane Franklin, demonstrated that the Pitman family left for San Francisco, on June 25, 1861, on board the ship "Comet" with Cracroft and Lady Franklin and that the senior Pitman "now has a third spouse with an infant [Charles Brook Pitman]." According to a 1887 account composed by Robert G. Carter, a private who might later serve in a similar organization as Pitman, he was disregarded after his mom's demise by his dad and stepmother, who "oppressed [him] to disregard and treatment, that with his touchy nature he couldn't bear". He proceeded with his instruction in the government funded schools of Roxbury, where the Pitman family lived for a timeframe. He have continued the family in leaving Hawaii. The 1860 United States Census enlisted Pitman under his educator Solomon Adams as living and probably being instructed in Newton, likewise in the Boston region.
