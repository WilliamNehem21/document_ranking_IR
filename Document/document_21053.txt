In notable contrast to his successor Stigand, Robert does not figure among the important benefactors to English churches, but we know of some transfers to JumiÃ¨ges of important English church treasures, the first trickle of what was to become a flood of treasure taken to Normandy after the Conquest. These included the relic of the head of Saint Valentine only recently given to the monks of Winchester Cathedral by Emma of Normandy. Though the Winchester head remained in place, another one appeared at JumiÃ¨ges; he "must have clandestinely removed the head, or at least the greater part of it, and left his monks to venerate the empty or nearly empty "capsa"". Two of the four most important surviving late Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscripts went the same way, thus probably preventing their destruction in a series of fires that devastated the major English libraries. One is the so-called "Missal of Robert of JumiÃ¨ges", actually a sacramentary with thirteen surviving full-page miniatures, which bears an inscription apparently in Robert's own hand recording its donation to JumiÃ¨ges when he was Bishop of London, and the other the so-called "Benedictional of Archbishop Robert", actually a pontifical with three remaining full-page miniatures and other decoration (respectively Rouen, BibliothÃ¨que Municipale, Manuscripts Y.6 and Y.7). The latter may well have been commissioned by Ãthelgar, Robert's predecessor as archbishop in 988â90, although it is possible the "Archbishop Robert" of the traditional name is Emma's brother Robert, Archbishop of Rouen from 990 to 1037. These masterpieces of the Winchester style were the most elaborately decorated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts known to have reached Normandy, either before or after the Conquest, and influenced the much less-developed local style, though this remained very largely restricted to initials.
