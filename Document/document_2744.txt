The Michigan State Highway Commission dropped the northern segment of the thruway, initially wanted to proceed with northward from Novi to a point close Davisburg and Clarkston, on January 26, 1977, after it burned through $1.6 million (identical to $ in ) the prior year acquiring land for the roadway. This northern segment was not arranged as an Interstate Highway around then, bearing the assignment M-275. Resistance to development originated from different natives' gatherings and distinctive dimensions of nearby government. Also, both "The Detroit News" and "Detroit Free Press" restricted the venture. The Detroit City Council, driven by then-Chairman Carl Levin, restricted the arrangement. Levin said at the time, "Finally I think individuals are awakening to the threats of increasingly more roads. Sooner or later we must state enough. Also, I think we've achieved it." The US Department of the Interior checked on the state's ecological effect investigation of the venture and expressed that the task, "will cause hopeless harms on diversion lands, wetlands, surface waters and untamed life living space". The all out venture to interface Farmington Hills with Davisburg with the augmentation would have cost $69.5 million (proportionate to $ in ) and spared drivers an expected eight minutes off movement time around the city of Detroit.
