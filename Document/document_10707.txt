Updates on the Fort Rosalie assault achieved New Orleans toward the beginning of December, and the pilgrims there started to freeze. The city relied on grain and different supplies from the Illinois settlement, and shipments all over the Mississippi River would be undermined by the loss of Fort Rosalie. Representative PÃÂ©rier responded to the slaughter by denying the section of an appointment of Choctaw individuals into the city, for dread that they were utilizing the appearance of a benevolent visit to dispatch an assault. He at that point requested slaves and French troops to walk downstream and slaughter a little town of Chaouacha individuals who had no impact in the uprising in Natchez. His bosses in Paris reviled the pioneer for this demonstration, which may have been expected to keep any coalition among slaves and Native Americans against the French homesteaders. Numerous Louisiana pioneersÃ¢ÂÂDumont de Montigny specificallyÃ¢ÂÂaccused ChÃÂ©part (who was slaughtered by the Natchez) and PÃÂ©rier for the slaughter; Louis XV, the French ruler, requested PÃÂ©rier back to France in 1732. PÃÂ©rier's substitution was his antecedent, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, whom the French state thought to be progressively experienced at managing the Native Americans of the district. A year sooner, the French West India Company had surrendered control of the state to Louis XV since it had been exorbitant and hard to oversee even before the disobedience.
