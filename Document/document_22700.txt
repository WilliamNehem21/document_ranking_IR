Released on August 25, 1988, by Elektra Records, "â¦And Justice for All" was acclaimed by music critics. In a contemporary review for "Rolling Stone", Michael Azerrad said that Metallica's compositions are impressive and called the album's music "a marvel of precisely channeled aggression". "Spin" magazine's Sharon Liveten called it a "gem of a double record" and found the music both edgy and technically proficient. Simon Reynolds, writing in "Melody Maker", said that "other bands would give their eye teeth" for the songs' riffs and found the album's densely complicated style of metal to be distinct from the monotonous sound of contemporary rock music: "Everything depends on utter punctuality and supreme surgical finesse. It's probably the most incisive music I've ever heard, in the literal sense of the word." Borivoj Krgin of "Metal Forces" said that it was the most ideal album he has heard because of typically exceptional production and musicianship that is more impressive than that of "Master of Puppets". In a less enthusiastic review for "The Village Voice", Robert Christgau believed that the band's compositions lack song form and that the album "goes on longer" than "Master of Puppets". In 1988, "â¦And Justice for All" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, but controversially lost to Jethro Tull's "Crest of a Knave". In 2007, "Entertainment Weekly", named this one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history.
