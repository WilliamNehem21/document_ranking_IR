Snow meets Cid and Fang, two individuals from the Cavalry, after he is caught and confined on board the aircraft "Lindblum". In the interim, the others escape from PSICOM before getting isolated by an airstrike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus. In Lightning's situation, she accidentally bolsters Hope's objective of executing Snow to retaliate for his mom's passing. In Vanille's situation, Sazh talks about how his child Dajh was transformed into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to find his Focus. In Palumpolum, Lightning endeavors to prevent Hope from proceeding with his vengeance and meets Snow and Fang. Tooth uncovers that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were transformed into precious stones; they were transformed once more into people 13 days sooner, starting the Purge. Expectation endeavors to kill Snow, yet in the wake of being saved amid an airstrike, he chooses not to proceed with it. The four at that point escape the city with Cid's guide. In Nautilus, Vanille uncovers herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and by implication the reason that Dajh was transformed into a l'Cie. Sazh and Vanille are then caught and confined on board the aircraft "Palamecia".
