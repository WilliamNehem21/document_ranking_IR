The Arab armada under Sulayman (regularly mistook for the Caliph himself in the medieval sources) touched base on 1 September, tying down at first close to the Hebdomon. After two days, Sulayman drove his armada into the Bosphorus and the different squadrons started tying down by the European and Asian rural areas of the city: one section cruised south of Chalcedon to the harbors of Eutropios and Anthemios to look out for the southern passageway of the Bosporus, while the remainder of the armada cruised into the strait, gone by Constantinople and started making landfall on the coasts among Galata and Kleidion, cutting the Byzantine capital's correspondence with the Black Sea. In any case, as the Arab armada's rearguard, twenty substantial boats with 2,000 marines, was passing the city, the southerly wind halted and afterward turned around, floating them towards the city dividers, where a Byzantine squadron assaulted them with Greek flame. Theophanes announced that some ran down with all hands, while others, consuming, cruised down to the Princes' Islands of Oxeia and Plateia. The triumph empowered the Byzantines and down and out the Arabs, who, as indicated by Theophanes, had initially planned to sail to the ocean dividers amid the night and attempt to scale them utilizing the boats' directing oars. That night, Leo drew up the chain between the city and Galata, shutting the passage to the Golden Horn. The Arab armada wound up hesitant to draw in the Byzantines, and pulled back to the protected harbor of Sosthenion further north on the European shore of the Bosporus.
