Review audits have been to a great extent positive. In 2007, "Diversion Informer" called "Adventure" one of the best amusements at any point made, and applauded the utilization of sensational camera edges and livelinesss to make the fights "artistic even by present day principles". In a 2007 article for 1UP.com, James Mielke appraised the amusement 9/10, depicting it as "the best RPG you've never played" and a standout amongst the "most extraordinary" RPGs ever. As indicated by Mielke, "for a 3D shooter to abruptly make the unforeseen bounce from shooter to RPG so effortlessly was a noteworthy achievement." "Retro Gamer's" Phil Harrison reverberated this supposition, adulating the combination of activity and RPG components. In "1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die" (2013), Jason Brookes composed that just the cutscenes had matured ineffectively and that "numerous aspectsÃÂ of the diversion awe well beyond even a significant number of the RPGs delivered these days". Mielke, Harrison and Brookes all commended the story's restriction and absence of platitude. In 2018, "The Ringer" lauded the multifaceted nature of its characters, none of whom are "really courageous". John Szczepaniak, creator of "The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers", composed that "I really can't think about an amusement whose story inspires me more" and contended that the crude illustrations helped the feeling of an antiquated, outsider world.
