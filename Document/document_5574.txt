The main play of the drive was a fragmented go by Taylor, yet the Hokies earned the underlying first down of the diversion two plays later when Taylor finished a 14-yard toss to Roberts, propelling the ball to the 41-yard line of Boston College all the while. After a five-yard punishment against the Hokies, Taylor finished two back to back passes: one to Evans for a 12-yard gain and the other to Roberts for a 10-yard gain. Presently at the 24-yard line of Boston College, Virginia Tech's offense started running the ball as opposed to passing it. Evans scrambled for five yards, at that point second-string running back Josh Oglesby kept running for seven more on the following two plays. The first of Oglesby's surges brought about a first down inside the Eagles' red zone, and Tech kept on propelling the ball on the ground as Evans ran another five yards. Confronting third down at the Boston College five-yard line, Virginia Tech called a timeout to define its next hostile play. That play was a five-yard surge by Taylor, who crossed the objective line for the amusement's first score, a Virginia Tech touchdown. The consequent additional point kick was fruitful, and the Hokies took a 7Ã¢ÂÂ 0 lead with 6:27 staying in the primary quarter.
