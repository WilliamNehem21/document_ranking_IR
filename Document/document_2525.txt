In the occasions paving the way to World War II, Bruce and Lyons had been supporters of the British under Chamberlain and the arrangement of conciliation practiced with respect to the reoccupation of the Rhineland, the Anschluss and the Munich Crisis. Notwithstanding amid the "fake war", Bruce kept on pushing the execution of an increasingly tough worldwide framework to authorize harmony through shared demobilization, the extension of transnational exchange, and worldwide associations equipped for tending to the squeezing social and financial inquiries that he felt were the repetitive reasons for global clash. He had turned into a nearby compatriot of senior Conservative Party figures Anthony Eden and Neville Chamberlain in this period, and was strident in propelling the sentiment of Australia (and the territories all the more extensively) that arrangement and bargain with Nazi Germany was desirable over war. Bruce effectively took an interest in the exchanges for the Munich Agreement. At the point when Lyons passed on in April 1939, Earle Page and Richard Casey by and by advanced for Bruce to come back to Australia and take over again as PM at the leader of the UAP. Bruce challenged, be that as it may, and made it the state of his arrival that he be permitted to sit in parliament as an autonomous and lead an all-party solidarity government. Such conditions were politically difficult to meet, and Robert Menzies was chosen as the new pioneer of the UAP.
