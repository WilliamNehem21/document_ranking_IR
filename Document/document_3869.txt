Downman was prevailing in January of the next year by Commander Jahleel Brenton, who was based at Gibraltar. While cruising off Gibraltar in organization with the British privateer "Protector" on 9ÃÂ AugustÃÂ 1799, Brenton ran over three little Spanish warships, mounting twenty 6-pounders altogether. The Spanish kept running into a little sandy inlet and tied down in a line in order to expedite their firearms to hold up under all the while the British boats. "Rapid" and "Safeguard" cruised all over for two hours terminating broadsides, however absent much impact. "Safeguard" just had 22 men ready and chosen to cruise farther to ocean to meet one of her water crafts. Brenton thought the exertion of holding under sail was supporting the adversary, and secured "Rapid" inside of the center ship. The two traded a wild barrage for seventy five percent of 60 minutes, after which the Spanish relinquished their boats and made for the shore. Two of the boats ran aground and the third was promptly caught. "Rapid" propelled her water crafts to recuperate the other two, going under black powder rifle discharge from the Spanish on the slope as they did as such. The British got the two vessels off and brought them into Gibraltar, alongside two men injured amid the task.
