By 27 April, Shout had been constantly in real life without rest since the arrival. That morning, he was sent to Walker's Ridge to supplant an injured officer in a defenseless part of the line. As the Turks involved positions in the clean just past the Australians' channel, Shout and his men were exposed to exact and substantial rifle discharge for the duration of the day. As needs be, Shout revamped his men and, presenting himself to the Turks' flame, wandered out to survey the foe's position. He was then ready to precisely coordinate the rifle discharge of his men. In spite of the fact that injured from the get-go in the activity, Shout wouldn't leave the cutting edge. As the battling wore on, the Turks surrounded the Australian channel and Shout drove a pike charge to hold them under control. He was later injured a second time, a projectile going through his arm and rendering it pointless. In any case, he would not leave. Before long, he was injured a third time and cleared for therapeutic treatment. Amid the commitment, Shout had diverted a few injured men from the bleeding edge. Refered to for his "obvious strength and capacity" at Walker's Ridge, Shout was granted the Military Cross, turning into the main individual from his unit to get the embellishment. The notice and going with reference for the honor was distributed in an enhancement to the "London Gazette" on 3 July 1915.
