While Richard was still in Sicily, word achieved the lord of the question between William Longchamp, whom Richard had left in England, and John, Richard's more youthful sibling. On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances over from Sicily to England. The diocese supervisor arrived in England on 27 June, after a short reroute to Rome. Coutances got a discharge from his crusading pledge, and came back to England in the organization of Richard's mom, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. He had various imperial records approving him to settle the debate, and on 28 July a settlement was achieved that left Longchamp in charge, in spite of the fact that John still held adequate capacity to make Longchamp's grasp on the administration to some degree shaky. In September, in any case, Longchamp detained Richard's knave relative, Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, who was endeavoring to come back to England in the wake of having been exiled by the ruler. The detainment recharged recollections of the homicide of Thomas Becket practically 20ÃÂ years prior, and Geoffrey was immediately discharged. Longchamp was conveyed to a committee, headed by Coutances and some of the administrative and lay rulers of England, which occurred on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames. Longchamp was dismissed and banished, to a great extent since Coutances had an imperial report requesting the magnates to comply with Coutances' if the ecclesiastical overseer's recommendation was opposed by Longchamp, which it had been. In spite of the fact that the medieval writer Richard of Devizes blamed Coutances for guile, and of attempting to play the two sides against the other, the proof recommends that Coutances was truly endeavoring to unravel the debate to the ruler's advantage. Longchamp fled to Normandy, and he was banished by Coutances.
