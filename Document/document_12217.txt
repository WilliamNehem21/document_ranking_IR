A significant part of the historical backdrop of the waterway is characterized by its extensions, which are portrayed from here mouth to source. The Drove Bridge, which denotes the ebb and flow degree of the Port of Bridgwater, is the closest to the mouth and the most up to date street scaffold to cross the stream. With a range of , the extension was built as a component of the Bridgwater Northern Distributor street plot (1992), and gives a safe channel which is wide with headroom at typical spring high tides. Upstream of this is the retractable or Telescopic Bridge, worked in 1871 to the structure of Sir Francis Fox, the specialist for the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It conveyed an expansive measure (later standard check) railroad siding over the stream to the docks, and was mobile, to enable pontoons to continue up waterway. A segment of railroad track toward the east of the extension could be moved sideways, with the goal that the fundamental supports could be withdrawn, making a traversable channel which was wide. It was physically worked for the initial eight months, and afterward controlled by a steam motor, returning to manual task in 1913, when the steam motor fizzled. The scaffold was last opened in 1953, and the traverser segment was wrecked in 1974, however open clamor at this brought about the extension being recorded as a Scheduled landmark, and the remainder of the scaffold was kept. It was later utilized as a street crossing, until the development of the Chandos street connect nearby it, and is presently just utilized by people on foot. Portions of the steam motor were moved to Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum in 1977.
