Scholar Taede Smedes contended that religious language is emblematic. Denying any contention among science and religion, he suggests that 'to trust' signifies to acknowledge a conviction (that God exists, with regards to Christianity), which is not the same as 'knowing', which just happens once something is demonstrated. In this way, as per Smedes, we trust things that we don't know without a doubt. Smedes contends that, instead of being a piece of the world, God is so a long ways past the world that there can be no regular standard to which both God and the world can be looked at. He contends that individuals can in any case trust in God, despite the fact that he can't be contrasted with anything on the planet, since faith in God is only an elective method for review that world (he compares this to two individuals seeing a sketch in an unexpected way). Smedes claims that there ought to be no motivation to search for an importance behind our analogies and images of God in light of the fact that the allegories are all we have of God. He recommends that we can just discuss God "ace nobis" (for us) and not "in se" (all things considered) or "sine nobis" (without us). The point, he contends, isn't that our idea of God ought to relate with the real world, however that we can just imagine God through illustrations.
