The preliminary started in June 1934 preceding Justice William Ives with three days of declaration from MacMillan. Brownlee's legal counselor, Arthur LeRoy Smith, utilized his interrogation to raise doubt about nearly everything MacMillan said. To disprove her case that Brownlee had persuaded her to move to Edmonton, he went into proof a letter she had kept in touch with Alberta College looking for data on its projects, dated before she had even met Brownlee. He further exhibited that on the night of the enchantment, which had purportedly occurred in a vehicle on a side street west of Edmonton, the city had been immersed in a snow squall. Additionally, the administration vehicle in which the enchantment should have occurred had not been bought until over a year after that date. In light of her declaration that she had dependably rested in the servant's room while remaining with the Brownlees, Smith created letters demonstrating that she had really dozed in Mrs. Brownlee's room. After MacMillan yielded her oversight, Smith noticed that Mrs. Brownlee's room had an expansive deadbolt on the entryway: on the off chance that she had dreaded Brownlee, why had she not utilized it? "Since I simply did as Mr. Brownlee said," was the offended party's reaction. MacMillan, when addressed, conceded that the period amid which she had been remaining in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had at first put at about a month and a half, was in reality just four. When she distinguished these a month as the most recent two weeks of April and the initial two of May, Smith demonstrated that Brownlee had been away for everything except ten evenings of that period.
