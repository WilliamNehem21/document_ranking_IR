Plant sustenance is put away all year, yet for the most part in pre-winter. Singular seeds are covered up in splits in bark, every so often in dividers or in the ground. The nourishment thing is generally covered with lichen, greenery or little bits of bark. The stored nourishment is recovered in chilly climate. Siberian flying creatures store the seeds of the Siberian stone pine, once in a while accumulating enough to last an entire year. Reserved sustenance may in some cases incorporate non-plant material, for example, bits of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the hatchlings being weakened by battering. Accumulating is a long haul procedure, put away sustenance things possibly being expended when crisp nourishment is elusive, once in a while as long as three months subsequent to reserving. Winged creatures with great put away nourishment supplies are fitter that those with progressively constrained assets. Beech pole crops shift broadly from year to year. Where beech pole is an imperative piece of the eating regimen, grown-up survival rates are to a great extent unaffected in years with a poor pole crop, however the quantity of adolescent winged creatures falls in the harvest time as they are lost through starvation or migration. In territories where normal hazel is the pervasive tree species, there is a comparative example of grown-up survival and loss of adolescent winged animals in years with poor nut generation.
