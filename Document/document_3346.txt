Desha was drawn into the Holley debate amid the 1824 presidential race. At the point when no competitor accomplished a dominant part of the discretionary votes cast, the challenge was settled by the U.S. Place of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly trained the state's congressional appointment to cast their votes in favor of Andrew Jackson, yet the designation, driven by House Speaker Henry Clay, resisted these directions and casted a ballot rather for John Quincy Adams. In view of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, turned into Desha's political adversary. Desha's antagonistic vibe for Transylvania and Holley compounded when, in the fallout of the Isaac Desha preliminary, an understudy at Transylvania conveyed a discourse disparaging of the representative in the college's church. In spite of the fact that Holley was available for the discourse, Transylvania antiquarian John D. Wright, Jr. composed that he didn't know the understudy's point already and in the wake of hearing the discourse, endeavored to approve its substance. It was Holley's training, in any case, to enable understudies to talk straightforwardly about current political issues, paying little respect to which position they took. Desha kept up that, in light of the fact that Holley had not quieted the understudy, he was to blame for implicitly approving ill bred analysis of the state's CEO.
