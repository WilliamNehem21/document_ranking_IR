Newcastle's Freewheels Theater appointed Nick Enright to create a play that investigated subjects around the assault and murder. Titled "A Property of the Clan", it debuted at the Freewheels Theater in Newcastle in 1992, and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993. The title was taken from the dubious statement in the mental report on Webster made in anticipation of his preliminary. Enright excluded the criminal demonstrations and the homicide from the play, rather concentrating on the show, its members and the result of the homicide. The play was appeared different secondary schools in the Newcastle territory, and following its positive gathering was appeared secondary schools broadly, winning a few honors. Be that as it may, Newcastle High School, where both Leigh and Webster had been understudies, declined to indicate it. The play is set in the anecdotal town of Blackrock, and the assault and murder injured individual is named Tracy. Leigh's family mentioned that the name be changed, as 'Tracey' was the name of Leigh's cousin and closest companion. The name stayed, in spite of different modifications to the content; the play was retitled "Blackrock". It was performed by the Sydney Theater Company in 1995 and 1996.
