NASA got consent from Eisenhower to select its first space explorers from the positions of military aircraft testers. The administration records of 508 alumni of aircraft tester schools were gotten from the United States Department of Defense. From these, 110 were discovered that coordinated the base gauges: the applicants must be more youthful than 40, have a four year certification or proportional, and be or less. Just the tallness prerequisite was carefully authorized, inferable from the extent of the Project Mercury shuttle. This was blessed for Glenn, who scarcely met the prerequisites, as he was close to the age cutoff and came up short on a science-based qualification. The 110 were then part into three gatherings, with the most encouraging in the primary gathering. The principal gathering of 35, which included Alan Shepard, amassed at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were invited by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, and the USAF officers were tended to by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both swore their help to the Space Program, and guaranteed that the professions of volunteers would not be antagonistically influenced. NASA authorities at that point advised them on Project Mercury. They cautioned that it would be a perilous endeavor, however stressed that it was of extraordinary national significance.
