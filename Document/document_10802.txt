In 1851 Sharpe distributed a monograph entitled "The Seven Periods of English Architecture", a little book of about 50ÃÂ pages recommending another plan for ordering the styles of English religious engineering "from the Heptarchy to the Reformation". It was planned to supplant the plan at that point being used, which had been proposed in 1817 by Thomas Rickman. Rickman had separated English design into "four unmistakable periods, or styles" which he named "Norman", "Early English", "Embellished English", and "Opposite English". The Norman style enduring until around 1189, was described by its curves generally being crescent, albeit once in a while pointed; the ornamentation was "intense and inconsiderate". The Early English style, proceeding to around 1307, was recognized by its pointed curves and long limited windows without mullions. He called the trademark ornamentation "toothed" on the grounds that it took after the teeth of the shark. The accompanying time frame, the Decorated English kept going until 1377, or potentially 10Ã¢ÂÂ 15 years after the fact, was described by vast windows with pointed curves containing mullions, and with tracery "in streaming lines shaping circles, curves and different figures". There was much ornamentation, cut in all respects gently. The last time frame recognized by Rickman, the Perpendicular English, kept going until up to 1630 or 1640. This was recognized by the mullions and the "elaborate panellings" running in opposite lines. The ornamentation was by and large "so swarmed as to decimate the magnificence of the plan". The cutting was once more "in all respects gently executed".
