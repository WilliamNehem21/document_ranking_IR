Master Bridport had been supplanted as administrator of the Channel Fleet by Admiral Lord St Vincent in mid-1799, and the long bar travels were continued all through the winter and into the next year. On 20 April 1800 Puget was supplanted as officer by Captain Edward Marsh. Bog instructed "Temeraire" through the rest of that year and for the principal half of 1801, until his substitution, Captain Thomas Eyles, touched base to continue order on 31 August. Back Admiral Whitshed had likewise struck his banner at this point, and "Temeraire" turned into the leader of Rear Admiral George Campbell. Around this time the Second Coalition against France had fell, and dealings for harmony were in progress at Amiens. Master St Vincent had been elevated to First Lord of the Admiralty, and direction of the Channel Fleet go to Admiral Sir William Cornwallis. With the finish of the war inevitable, "Temeraire" was taken off bar obligation and sent to Bantry Bay to anticipate the landing of a guard, which she would then escort toward the West Indies. Huge numbers of the group had been serving consistently in the naval force since the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, and had anticipated coming back to England since harmony appeared to be approaching. On hearing bits of gossip that rather they were to be sent toward the West Indies, around twelve men started to unsettle for the remainder of the team to reject requests to cruise for anyplace yet England.
