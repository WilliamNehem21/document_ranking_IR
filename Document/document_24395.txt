Late on FebruaryÂ 16, Guillame began developing a small eye, turning to the east around the same time. With favorable conditions, including good outflow, the system quickly intensified into a compact tropical cyclone as it turned to the southeast. Strengthening briefly stopped on FebruaryÂ 17, possible due to an eyewall replacement cycle, although it resumed the following day. Guillame curved to the south and southwest, reaching peak winds of 195Â km/h (120Â mph) late on FebruaryÂ 18; this made it an intense tropical cyclone. The next day, the cyclone passed about east of Mauritius before an approaching trough turned it to the southeast. Despite the storm's proximity to the island, effects there were modest, marked by winds of and of rain. The cyclone began weakening due to increased wind shear, and deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on FebruaryÂ 21. A strengthening ridge turned Guillame toward the northwest, and the storm dissipated on FebruaryÂ 23.
Cyclone Hary was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. Developing on MarchÂ 5 from the monsoon trough, the storm initially moved generally to the west and gradually intensified. With favorable conditions, Hary quickly intensified on MarchÂ 7, developing an eye and well-defined outflow. After reaching an initial peak, the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar. Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220Â km/h (140Â mph) on MarchÂ 10 just offshore of eastern Madagascar, which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000.
