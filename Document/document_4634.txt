Wellesley-Pole in 1819 educated Benedetto Pistrucci to imprint Flaxman's work to make steel passes on for the decoration. Pistrucci, an Italian who had come to Britain in 1815, was playing out the obligations of Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint. He trusted he had been guaranteed the title, which as an outsider he was ineligible for, and this would be a long-term complaint for him. Pistrucci would not imprint Flaxman's model, reluctant to duplicate crafted by another craftsman. This refusal maddened the Royal Academy. Shaft rather solicited Pistrucci to set up a structure from his own, and in multi day he had created wax models, about which the Prince Regent was eager. In August 1819, Pole got directions from the Treasury to utilize Pistrucci to create the decoration. The expense was ÃÂ£2,400, to be paid in portions. Shaft guaranteed a development that would permit Pistrucci to bring his family from Rome. As indicated by Carlo Milano in his article on Pistrucci for the Royal Mint, "The Waterloo Medal couldn't be contrasted with any past award: it was a lot greater and its iconography more muddled than had at any point been seen before in the historical backdrop of medallic workmanship. In any case, Pistrucci trusted that it should be possible and promptly started to work."
