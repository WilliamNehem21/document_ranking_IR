Harvey came back to legislative issues after the 1929 securities exchange crash and the start of the Great Depression. He chose to keep running for the administration. He shaped the Liberty Party and held their national tradition at Monte Ne. It was the main presidential tradition held in Arkansas. Harvey arranged with railroad outing rates, media offices, overhauled streets, and nourishment concessions, envisioning 10,000 agents. He rose the amphitheater, set up seating, and introduced a speaker framework to achieve the thousands to be situated outside. Agents were just qualified to visit in the event that they ensured they had perused and concurred with the standards of Harvey's most up to date book "The Book", which managed the unsafe impacts of usury by the legislature. At last just 786 representatives visited, and Harvey was the main hopeful the agents could concede to. They named Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for VP. The Liberty Party wound up converging with the Jobless Party, and Harvey kept running for president as a free; in any case, he is generally mistakenly credited similar to their competitor in that decision. In any case, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential race, and Harvey just drew 800 votes.
