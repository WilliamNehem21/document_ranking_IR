The revolt was led by 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel VÆ°Æ¡ng VÄn ÄÃ´ng, a northerner, who had fought with the French Union forces against the Viet Minh during the First Indochina War. Later trained at Fort Leavenworth in the United States, ÄÃ´ng was regarded by American military advisers as a brilliant tactician and the brightest military prospect of his generation and he served in the Airborne Division. Back in Vietnam, ÄÃ´ng became discontented with Diá»m's arbitrary rule and constant meddling in the internal affairs of the army. Diá»m promoted officers on loyalty rather than skill, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from challenging his rule. Years after the coup, ÄÃ´ng asserted that his sole objective was to force Diá»m to improve the governance of the country. ÄÃ´ng was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, the director of training at the Joint General Staff School, and Hong's uncle Hoang Co Thuy. Thuy was a wealthy Saigon-based lawyer, and had been a political activist since World War II. He was the secretary-general of a minority opposition party called the Movement of Struggle for Freedom, which had a small presence in the rubber-stamp National Assembly.
