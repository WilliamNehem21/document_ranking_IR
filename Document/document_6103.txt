During the 1960s, a noteworthy showdown occurred at the Saddle Lake Reserve in Alberta. Following quite a while of decaying conditions and managerial changes, guardians challenged the absence of straightforwardness at the Blue Quills Indian School in 1969. Accordingly, the administration chose to close the school, convert the structure into a habitation, and enlist understudies in a government funded school away in St. Paul, Alberta. The TRC report relating to this period states:Fearing their kids would confront racial separation in St. Paul, guardians wished to see the school exchanged to a private society that would work it both as a school and a habitation. The government had been available to such an exchange if the First Nations association was organized as a commonplace school division. The First Nations dismissed this, saying an exchange of First Nations training to the commonplace specialist was an infringement of Treaty rights. In the mid year of 1970, individuals from the Saddle Lake people group involved the structure and requested the privilege to run it themselves. In excess of 1,000 individuals are accepted to have taken an interest throughout the 17-day sit-in, which endured from July 14 to 31. Their endeavors brought about Blue Quills turning into the principal Indigenous-managed school in the nation. It keeps on working today as University nuhelot'ÃÂ¯ne thaiyots'ÃÂ¯ nistameyimÃÂ¢kanak Blue Quills, the primary Indigenous-represented college in Canada. Following the accomplishment of the Blue Quills exertion the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) discharged the 1972 paper "Indian Control of Indian Education" that reacted, partially, to the Canadian Government's 1969 White Paper requiring the abolishment of the land settlements and the Indian Act.
