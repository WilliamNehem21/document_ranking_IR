The arrangement of numerous seamounts including Limalok has been clarified with the hotspot hypothesis, in which a "problem area" ascending from the mantle prompts the development of chains of volcanoes which get dynamically more established along the length of the chain, with a functioning spring of gushing lava just toward one side of the framework, as the plate moves over the hotspot. Seamounts and islands in the Marshall Islands don't seem to have begun from basic age-dynamic hotspot volcanism as the age movements in the individual island and seamount chains are regularly conflicting with this clarification. One answer for this problem might be that more than one hotspot went through the Marshall Islands, and it is additionally conceivable that hotspot volcanism was influenced by extensional distortion of the lithosphere. For Limalok, geochemical proof shows affinities to the Rarotonga hotspot which is not at all like the geochemical slants in the different volcanoes of the Ratak Chain. Recreations of the territory's geographical history propose that the primary hotspot to go by Limalok was the Macdonald hotspot 9585 million years prior, trailed by the Rurutu hotspot and the Society hotspot 7565 million years back. The Rarotonga and particularly the Rurutu hotspots are viewed as the no doubt contender for the hotspot that framed Limalok. In any case, some paleogeographical irregularities show that lithospheric breaks auxiliary to hotspot movement were likewise included.
