Starting at Main Street, U.S.A. Station contiguous Disneyland's passageway, where a siphon style handcar worked by the Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company can be seen on a siding, the trains of the Disneyland Railroad travel along its single track a clockwise way on its roundabout course. The train will take around 18 minutes to finish a round stumble on the fundamental line when three trains are running, and 20 minutes when four trains are running; on some random day, somewhere in the range of two and four trains run, with three trains running overall. An architect joined by a fire fighter works the train, while conductors at each finish of the train administer the travelers. Preceding leaving Main Street, U.S.A. Station, the designer must affirm whether the flag light in the train's taxi is green, showing that the track section ahead is clear, or red, demonstrating that the track portion ahead is involved by another train. The DRR's course is separated into eleven such fragments, or squares, and every train has a square flag in its taxi to convey the status of each square. Before the establishment of taxi motioning in the trains around 2005, the status of each square along the railroad's of fundamental line track was shown by track-side square flags, of which just the ones at the four stations remain.
