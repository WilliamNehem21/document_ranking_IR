Montagu was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 for his part in Operation Mincemeat; for masterminding the plan, Cholmondeley was appointed a Member of the Order in 1948. Duff Cooper, a former cabinet minister who had been briefed on the operation in March 1943, published the spy novel "Operation Heartbreak" (1950), which contained the plot device of a corpse â with papers naming him as William Maryngton â being floated off the coast of Spain with false documents to deceive the Germans. The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat. Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote "The Man Who Never Was" (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film. The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal operational details, and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful. He was also careful to obscure "the idea of an organised programme of strategic deceptionÂ ... with Mincemeat being presented as a 'wild' one-off caper". In 1977 Montagu published "Beyond Top Secret U", his wartime autobiography which gave further details of Mincemeat, among other operations.
