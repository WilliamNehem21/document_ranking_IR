According to the February 26 order, the individuals who had a Bible, adored in gathering or kept on pronouncing adherence to Christianity were fined, imprisoned, manacled, exposed to preliminary by difficulty, or executed. Shocking records of the execution and torment of Christians were accounted for by teachers with sources on the island who put accentuation on what they saw as the viciousness of the Queen's activities. For example, they detailed the open execution of 15 Christian pioneers close to the Queen's castle who were dangled on ropes 150 feet over a stone filled gorge before the ropes were sliced upon their refusal to disavow Christianity. The Andohalo house of God was developed on this outcropping to honor early Malagasy Christians martyred at the site. The exact number of Malagasy residents put to death for religious reasons amid Ranavalona's rule is hard to state with sureness. English preacher to Madagascar W.E. Cummins (1878) places the number executed at somewhere in the range of 60 and 80. Unquestionably more were required to experience the "tangena" trial, sentenced to hard work, or deprived of their territory and property, and a large number of these kicked the bucket. Mistreatment of Christians increased in 1840, 1849 and 1857; in 1849, considered the most exceedingly awful of these years by Cummins, 1,900 individuals were fined, imprisoned or generally rebuffed for their Christian confidence, of whom 18 were executed.
