Full collections were likewise made accessible as downloadable substance; the rest of the tunes from "Convent Road", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", and "Elastic Soul" have since been discharged on the consoles' individual store administrations. While there is potential for the whole Beatles inventory to be made accessible, this will be improbable, as per John Drake of Harmonix. Drake recognized the expensive improvement process as a conceivably restrictive factor: "Each time we complete one melody, dislike "Musical crew" where we trust that the bosses will come in and simply creator themÃÂ ... its like, send individuals to Abbey Road, utilize the first tape, separate them outÃÂ ... it costs a large number of dollars." Drake stated that Harmonix would take offers of the at present declared collections into thought before proceeding with improvement of downloadable substance. Harmonix's Foster expressed that performance demonstrations from the Beatles' individuals won't be incorporated as downloadable substance for "The Beatles: Rock Band"; be that as it may, he didn't discount the likelihood of these demonstrations showing up in other "Musical gang" recreations. A three pack of tunes from Paul McCartney's 2009 live collection, "Great Evening New York City", was made accessible for the primary "Musical gang" arrangement on 5 January 2010. John Lennon's "Envision" is a piece of the "Musical crew 3" soundtrack, with the full "Envision" collection arriving later as downloadable substance in festivity of Lennon's 70th birthday celebration. A pack including Paul McCartney's band Wings was likewise discharged as DLC for "Musical gang 3" on December 28, 2010.
