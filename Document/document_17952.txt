In addition to arrangements for solo instruments of his popular orchestral works, KetÃ¨lbey wrote a range of music for organ and for piano. Some of the more serious of these pieces were published under his "Vodorinski" pen name. Among the organ works are "Pastorale" and "RÃªverie dramatique", both dating from about 1911. The piano works include the early classical pieces such as the 1888 Sonata, and shorter items in a more popular style, such as "RÃªverie" (1894) and "Les pÃ¨lerins" (1925), by way of "A Romantic Melody" (1898), "PensÃ©es joyeuses" (1888), "In the Woodlands" (1921), "A Song of Summer" (1922), and "LÃ©gende triste" (1923). The musical influences on his piano works were on the whole conservative: for the early works McCanna mentions Haydn and Mendelssohn in this context. Much of the piano music published in the years after the First World War was aimed at a domestic audience; it requires only a modest technical proficiency to play and is simple in structure with deft harmonies. The most commercially successful of the Vodorinski works was the Prelude in C minor (1907). McCanna comments that not only the title but the material is reminiscent of Rachmaninoff: "the music turns out to copy some of the more illustrious composer's features, notably the final fortissimo statement of the melody in the bass". KetÃ¨lbey followed Chopin's model in several waltzes in the key of A major, including "La grÃ¢cieuse" (1907) and two different pieces under the title Valse brillante (1905 and 1911).
