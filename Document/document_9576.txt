In 1934 entomologist John S. Clark distributed a formal depiction of "Nothomyrmecia macrops" as another species and inside a totally new variety and clan (Nothomyrmecii) of the Ponerinae. He did as such on the grounds that the two examples (which at that point turned into the syntypes) looked to some extent like any insect species he knew about, yet they shared comparable morphological attributes with the wiped out sort "Prionomyrmex". Clark takes note of that the head and mandibles of "Nothomyrmecia" and "Prionomyrmex" are to some degree comparable, however the two can be recognized by the presence of the hub (a fragment between the mesosoma and gaster). In 1951, Clark proposed the new insect subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae for his "Nothomyrmecia", in light of morphological contrasts with other ponerine ants. This proposition was dismissed by American entomologist William Brown Jr., who put it in the subfamily Myrmeciinae with "Myrmecia" and "Prionomyrmex", under the clan Nothomyrmeciini. Its inaccessible association with surviving ants was affirmed after its rediscovery, and its situation inside the Formicidae was acknowledged by most researchers until the late 1980s. The single midriff hub persuaded that "Nothomyrmecia" ought to be independent from "Myrmecia" and held Clark's unique proposition. This proposition would put the insect into its very own subfamily, in spite of numerous natural morphological attributes between the two genera. This partition from "Myrmecia" was held until 2000.
