Albeit more than seventy-five vehicles were entered in the race, the vast majority of their proprietors did not possess them finished in energy for race so just three autos and six early cruisers appeared. While heading to the race, Haynes had an encounter with a Chicago policeman who demanded that Haynes reserved no privilege to drive his vehicle on open streets, compelling him to order a steed to pull the vehicle the remainder of the way. Comparable episodes occurred with the other race's entrances so the city passed a mandate a couple of days after the fact to clear up any vagueness in the laws and permit autos level with access to the city boulevards, enabling the delayed race to happen. While giving his vehicle a ride around the town on the next day Haynes was engaged with what is accepted to be the principal car crash subsequent to swerving to miss a road vehicle and striking a sharp check, busting a tire and harming the pivot. Without an extra tire, Haynes was unfit to keep running in the race. The race was hung on November 28, and thousands of onlookers turned out.
