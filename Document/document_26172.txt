In September, the album entered "Billboard"s album charts; the highest position "Freewheelin" reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one million copies in the U.S. Dylan himself came to acknowledge "Freewheelin"' as the album that marked the start of his success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: "Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." Besides "Blowin' in the Wind", "Masters of War", "Girl from the North Country", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of global success. John Lennon recalled: "In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all. Paul got the record ("The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan") from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan."
