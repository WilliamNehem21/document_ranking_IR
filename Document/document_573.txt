In their 2004 phylogenetic examination, LÃÂ¼ and partners grouped "Nemegtomaia" as a determined (or "progressed") oviraptorosaur, and observed it to be most firmly identified with the variety "Citipati". In 2010 Longrich and associates established that "Nemegtomaia" had a place in the family Oviraptoridae, as a feature of the subfamily Ingeniinae, making it the main individual from the last gathering with an unmistakable peak. Individuals from the other perceived subfamily, Oviraptorinae, all have peaks. Ingeniines are recognized by littler size, short and strong forelimbs with feebly bended paws, the quantity of vertebrae in the synsacrum, just as specific highlights of the feet and pelvis. Longrich and associates recommended that the nearness of a peak on "Nemegtomaia" makes it conceivable that this component developed or vanished a few times among oviraptorids, or that the creature might not have been an ingeniine. In 2010, the American scientist Gregory S. Paul recommended that crestless oviraptorids were either the adolescents or females of generally peaked species, and that the quantity of genera in the gathering was subsequently overstated. He recorded "Nemegtomaia" as ""Citipati" (="Nemegtomaia") "barsboldi", thinking of it as fundamentally the same as that variety, however in 2016, he rather recorded it as ""Conchoraptor" (="Nemegtomaia") "barsboldi"".
