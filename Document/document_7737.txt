As 1989 wore on, Prost consistently guaranteed his Honda V10s were not creating a similar measure of intensity as those in Senna's vehicle. It really came to the heart of the matter where Honda F1 manager Osamu Goto felt constrained to address the expert British media on the issue. He guaranteed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the quickening agent helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the motor's mid-go where the greater part of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the motors into low revs where they had a get issue. Obviously the discussion was persuading until a large portion of those present saw Goto persistently called them Ayrton and Prost individually (per Japanese traditions, tending to an individual by their first name as opposed to the surname demonstrates an a lot higher level of nature and privacy). A case of Prost's cases came amid the Mexican Grand Prix. Regardless of his vehicle running less wing than Senna's which hypothetically would give him more prominent top speed, Prost's McLaren was not ready to pass Senna's on the long front straight despite the fact that he fell off the last Peraltada Curve unmistakably quicker than the Brazilian and furthermore had the advantage of a tow. As a glaring difference, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on new tires), Senna was effectively ready to control past Prost on the straight.
