Despite the fact that the two showed extraordinary regard and adoration for one another, their fellowship was uneasy and had a few characteristics of an affection loathe relationship. Harold C. Schonberg trusts that Chopin showed a "tinge of envy and resentment" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have likewise contended that he had turned out to be captivated with Liszt's drama, dramatic artistry and achievement. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 ÃÂtudes, and his execution of them provoked the arranger to write to Hiller, "I should get a kick out of the chance to deny him of the manner in which he plays my examinations." However, Chopin communicated irritation in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the expansion of various mind boggling embellishments, at which Chopin commented that he should play the music as composed or not play it by any means, driving an expression of remorse. Most biographers of Chopin express that after this the two had little to do with one another, despite the fact that in his letters dated as late as 1848 regardless he alluded to him as "my companion Liszt". A few reporters point to occasions in the two men's sentimental lives which prompted a crack between them; there are claims that Liszt had shown envy of his special lady Marie d'Agoult's fixation on Chopin, while others trust that Chopin had progressed toward becoming worried about Liszt's developing association with George Sand.
