In 1926Ã¢ÂÂ 1927, a Royal Commission into pay off of individuals from the police by bookmakers was led, finding that it was plausible that two criminologists and a few casually dressed constables were blameworthy of accepting hush money. Subsequent to thinking about the report of the Royal Commission, Leane presented his own report to the legislature, in which he scrutinized the ambiguous idea of its discoveries, and keeping in mind that tolerating that some police may have taken hush-money, he attested that debasement was not across the board. One investigator and three constables were offered the chance to leave and took it, and another casually dressed constable was come back to formally dressed obligation. Throughout the imperial commission, a few different casually dressed constables had surrendered. Before the commission finished up, Leane prescribed to the Chief Secretary, James Jelley, who was the priest in charge of the police, that the casually dressed part of the police be abrogated, with formally dressed constables to be pivoted through those obligations as required. His suggestion was acknowledged. In January 1927, the structure by Leane's brother by marriage, Louis Laybourne Smith, was chosen for the National War Memorial in Adelaide. In mid 1928, Leane turned into an establishment part and the debut leader of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, built up to help the wards of perished ex-servicemen.
