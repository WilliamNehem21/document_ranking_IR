Waugh's diary indicates that he began writing the story on 21 July, when he completed a dozen pages of the first chapter; he thought it was "quite good". He appears to have done no more work on the project until early September, when he confides to his diary that it is "in serious danger of becoming dull", and expresses doubts that it will ever be finished. However, Waugh apparently found fresh inspiration after reading "A Cypress Grove", an essay by the 17th-century Scots poet William Drummond of Hawthornden, and considered retitling his story "The Fabulous Paladins" after a passage in the essay.
The autumn of 1924 was spent largely in the pursuit of pleasure until, shortly before Christmas, the pressing need to earn money led Waugh to apply for teaching jobs in private schools. His diary entry for 17 December 1924 records: "Still writing out letters in praise of myself to obscure private schools, and still attempting to rewrite "The Temple"". He eventually secured a job as assistant master at Arnold House Preparatory School in Denbighshire, North Wales, at a salary of Â£160 a year, and left London on 22 January to take up his post, carrying with him the manuscript of "The Temple".
