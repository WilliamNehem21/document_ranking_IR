The main portions of redesigned parkways along the future course of I-94 were included amid World War II. Development on the Willow Run Expressway began in 1941 preceding the US entered the war. It was opened on September 12, 1942, to give improved access to Ford's Willow Run aircraft plants. The roadway was given the M-112 assignment at the time. The turnpike was broadened eastbound as the Detroit Industrial Expressway into Detroit; the principal area opened in 1943 and the rest of finished in March 1945. Land securing for the Edsel Ford Freeway began in 1945. Initially alluded to as the Crosstown Freeway, the interstate ended up known as the Edsel Ford Freeway following an April 1946 appeal. The exchange between the Lodge Freeway and the Edsel Ford Freeway was worked in 1953 as the principal full turnpike to-expressway trade in the United States. In mid-1956, the M-112 assignment was decommissioned and supplanted by a rerouted USÃÂ 12. Amid the mid-1950s, the Detroit Streets and Rails crusade proposed a rapid rail line in the middle of the Willow Run, Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford turnpikes; rather than structure the rail line, extraordinary boarding stations contiguous devoted transport paths in the exchanges along the expressway were utilized.
