Some reviewers did not like the expansion's repetitiveness, and Nic Rowen ("Destructoid") was disappointed with the lack of uniqueness in the release. Chad Sapieha ("Post Arcade") said that he was growing weary of the repetitive small tasks like managing loot, and traveling between settlements just to dispose of it; he added that he was done with "Fallout 4" and its DLC and was prepared to move onto a further installment. David Soriano ("IGN") commended the extensive size of the map but felt it was somewhat wasted. Alice Bell ("VideoGamer.com") and the reviewers at "GameCentral" praised the value for money: Bell said that "Far Harbor" was the best of the first three expansion packs for getting "the most bang for your buck", even taking into account the design flaws.
In July 2016, Mod DB user Guillaume Veer, going by the online alias of BaronVonChateau, accused Bethesda of copying one of his "" mods, named "Autumn Leaves". Comparing the plot of "Autumn Leaves" and one of "Far Harbor"s quests called Brain Dead, Veer described both as having âa colorful cast of eccentric robots, in charge of a forgotten Vault where a strange murder happened". Pete Hines, the vice president of Bethesda's marketing team, responded with: "we love our mod community and would never disrespect them", adding that any similarities were completely coincidental.
