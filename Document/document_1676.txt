With the principal model's fixes finished, it likewise joined the flight test program, finishing hostage flights. While in flight, the Goblin was steady, simple to fly, and recoverable from twists, albeit introductory assessments of a 648ÃÂ mph (1,043ÃÂ km/h) top speed demonstrated idealistic. The main practice runs uncovered that choppiness amid way to deal with the B-29 was noteworthy, prompting the expansion of upper and lower blades at the outrageous back fuselage, just as two wingtip balances to adjust for the expanded directional shakiness in docking. All the underlying flights had the snare verified in a fixed position, yet when the snare was stowed and later raised, the subsequent pounding added to the trouble in endeavoring a hookup. To address the issue, little streamlined fairings were added to the snare well that decreased the pounding when the snare was broadened and withdrew. When testing continued, on the 18 March 1948 practice run, Schoch kept on experiencing issues in attaching, striking and harming the trapeze's nose-settling area, before turning to another crisis midsection landing. After fixes to the trapeze, Schoch flew the principal model on 8 April 1949, finishing a 30-minute free flight test, however after three endeavors, relinquished his endeavors and depended on another paunch arrival at Muroc.
