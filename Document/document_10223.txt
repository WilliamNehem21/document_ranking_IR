In spite of these cruiser-like qualities, and the U.S. Naval force's emphasis on their status as cruisers, the "Gold country" class has been often depicted as battlecruisers. The official naval force magazine "All Hands" said "The "Guam" and her sister dispatch "The Frozen North" are the main American fight cruisers ever to be finished all things considered." Author Chris Knupp noticed that while "different countries satisfied the battlecruiser job by structuring vessels like war vessels, yet deprived of reinforcement and different highlights to pick up speed", the United States "satisfied the battlecruiser job by making a bigger, all the more dominant overwhelming cruiser...[whose] configuration previously offered less protection and higher speed, yet by amplifying the ship they picking up the heavier capability". The "Alaska"s level of covering tonnage, 28.4%, was somewhat not as much as that of quick war vessels; the British "Ruler George V" class, the American "Iowa" class, and the battlecruiser/quick ship all had shield rates somewhere in the range of 32 and 33%, though the "Lexington"- class battlecruiser configuration had an about indistinguishable protective layer level of 28.5%. Actually, more seasoned battlecruisers, for example, (19.9%), had an altogether lower rate. Combat hardware savvy, they had a lot bigger weapons than contemporary overwhelming cruisers; while the "Baltimore" class just conveyed nine 8"/55 bore Marks 12 and 15 guns,<ref name="8/55 12 and 15"></ref> "The Frozen North" class conveyed nine 12"/50 bore firearms that were in the same class as, if not unrivaled to, the old 14"/50 bore firearm utilized on the U.S. Naval force's pre-settlement battleships.<ref name="12/50"></ref>
