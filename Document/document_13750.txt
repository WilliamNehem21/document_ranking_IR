These divisions monitored an edge which had a practically ceaseless antitank discard, broad spiked metal perimeter, and a twofold column of solid focuses. The solid focuses were arranged around separated. Each had its very own antitank discard, hidden by meager sheets. They were each equipped with a couple of 47ÃÂ mm antitank firearms and two to four assault rifles. The weapons were discharged from cement sided pits associated by channels to a profound underground solid fortification which offered assurance from mounted guns shoot. In any case, the channels had no shoot steps and the weapons pits needed overhead spread. Each post was involved by a detachment or organization. The inward column of posts were comparable, then again, actually they did not have the antitank trench. The posts were numbered successively from south to north, with the external posts bearing odd numbers and the inward ones even numbers. The real numbers were known to the Australians from the markings on maps caught at Sidi Barrani and were likewise shown on the posts themselves. In the southern corner was a third line of posts, known as the Switch Line. There were six guarded minefields, and a dispersing of mines before some different posts. The major strategic deformity of this cautious framework was that if the foe got through, the posts could be picked off separately from the front or back.
