On July 17, 2011, Cordray was chosen over Warren as the leader of the whole CFPB, however his assignment was promptly in danger in light of the fact that 44 Senate Republicans had recently promised to crash any candidate so as to push for a decentralized structure to the association. This was a piece of an example of contention between Republicans in the Senate and the Obama organization that had prompted record quantities of blocked and fizzled selections. On July 21, 2011, Senator Richard Shelby composed an opinion piece article for "The Wall Street Journal" certifying proceeded with resistance (that returned to a May 5 letter to the President) to a concentrated structure, noticing that both the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had official sheets and that the CFPB ought to be the same. "Politico" translated Shelby's announcements as saying that Cordray's selection might have been "Dead on Arrival". In October, as the selection stayed on hold, the National Association of Attorneys General supported Cordray. On December 8, 2011, the Senate neglected to verify cloture on Cordray's selection. The last vote was 53-45, with 50 out of 51 Democrats voting in favor of cloture, and 45 out of 47 Republicans casting a ballot against.
