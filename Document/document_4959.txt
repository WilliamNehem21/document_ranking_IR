Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, in spite of the fact that the film obtained intensely from the Hollywood Western type, especially in its visuals, it was effectively "Indianised". For instance, William van der Heide has thought about a slaughter scene in "Sholay" with a comparable scene in "Some time ago in the West". Albeit the two movies were comparable in specialized style, "Sholay" underlined Indian family esteems and exaggerated custom, while the Western was increasingly materialistic and limited in its methodology. Maithili Rao, in "Reference book of Hindi Cinema", takes note of that "Sholay" mixes the style of the Western classification into a "feudalistic ethos". Ted Shen of the "Chicago Reader" notes "Sholay"s "insane visual style" and irregular "populist message". Social pundit and Islamic researcher Ziauddin Sardar parodies the film in his book "The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema", both for its cartoon and stereotyping of Muslim and ladies characters, and for what he calls joke of honest residents. Sardar noticed that the two most unmistakable Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and a feeble casualty of the highwaymen (the imam). In the mean time, the sole capacity of one female character (Radha) is to endure her destiny peacefully, while the other female lead (Basanti) is only a chatty town beauty.
