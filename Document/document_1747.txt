As a bowler, Macaulay satisfied two jobs. Toward the beginning of an innings, when the ball was new and hard, he opened the bowling with medium-quick conveyances that swung far from right-gave batsmen. In this style, he was precise and bowled an assortment of conveyances to agitate his rivals. Cricket author R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed him to be superior to any comparable bowler during the 1920s aside from Maurice Tate, the main medium paced bowler in England. Macaulay could differ his pace from medium to quick contingent upon the requirements of the match circumstance and the sort of pitch. At the point when the pitch was appropriate for turning the ball, he bowled medium-paced off breaks. "Wisden" said that his turn made him more powerful than different bowlers of his speed on a sticky wicket, a pitch which has been influenced by downpour, making it unpredictable and hard to bat on. His eulogy further expressed: "Under appropriate conditions for utilizing the off-break, batsmen appeared at his leniency." This was on the grounds that he could bowl conveyances which were practically inconceivable for batsmen to play without getting out, and yet it was hard to score keeps running against him. Robertson-Glasgow composed that "on a downpour harmed contribute he was his brilliance." He would make little changes in accordance with the places of his defenders or bowl from various sides of the wicket, frequently making motions or outward appearances as he did as such. Robertson-Glasgow said that "just the best could endure the attack with the exception of by a supernatural occurrence", and depicted Macaulay as an incredible bowler. The cricket author Jim Kilburn recommended that Macaulay was "an incredible cricketer. He was extraordinary less in scientific accomplishmentÃÂ ... as in cricketing character."
