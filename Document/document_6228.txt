To begin with, at NÃÂ  SÃ¡ÂºÂ£n, the French directed a large portion of the high ground with overpowering mounted guns support. At ÃÂiÃ¡Â»Ân BiÃÂªn PhÃ¡Â»Â§, in any case, the Viet Minh controlled a significant part of the high ground around the valley, their cannons far surpassed French desires, and they dwarfed the French troops four to one. GiÃÂ¡p contrasted ÃÂiÃ¡Â»Ân BiÃÂªn PhÃ¡Â»Â§ with a "rice bowl," where his troops involved the edge and the French the base. Second, GiÃÂ¡p committed an error in NÃÂ  SÃ¡ÂºÂ£n by submitting his powers to foolhardy frontal assaults before being completely arranged. He took in his exercise: at ÃÂiÃ¡Â»Ân BiÃÂªn PhÃ¡Â»Â§, GiÃÂ¡p put in months carefully storing ammo and emplacing overwhelming big guns and antiaircraft weapons before making his turn. Groups of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the manner of the French gunnery. Cannons pieces were situated inside very much built and disguised casemates. Therefore, when the fight at long last started, the Viet Minh knew precisely where the French cannons pieces were, while the French did not know what number of weapons GiÃÂ¡p had. Third, the aeronautical resupply lines at NÃÂ  SÃ¡ÂºÂ£n were never disjoined, notwithstanding Viet Minh antiaircraft flame. At ÃÂiÃ¡Â»Ân BiÃÂªn PhÃ¡Â»Â§, GiÃÂ¡p amassed antiaircraft batteries that rapidly closed down the runway, and made it incredibly troublesome and exorbitant for the French to acquire fortifications.
