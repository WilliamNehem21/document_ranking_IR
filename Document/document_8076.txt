At the World Science Fiction Convention in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli induced a few understood journalists to show up in a "top pick issue ... with exceptionally composed stories round the subject of 'penance. The issue being referred to was the first under the new title of "Motivation", in March 1966; it included fiction by James Blish, Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, Poul Anderson, Jack Vance, and Keith Roberts, who contributed "The Signaller", the main story in his "Pavane" grouping. The second issue was likewise high caliber, with another "Pavane" story and a short story by John Brunner from his "Explorer in Black" arrangement. Resulting issues did not continue this abnormal state, yet by and large, as Ashley would like to think, the twelve issues of "Motivation" contained "the absolute best SF and dream at any point distributed in British magazines". Christopher Priest's first story, "The Run", showed up in the May 1966 issue, and Chris Boyce's second story, "George", was distributed in June 1966. Two books were serialized in "Drive", both generally welcomed: Harry Harrison's "Make Room! Make Room!" (later made into the motion picture "Soylent Green"), and Moorcock's "The Ice Schooner". Other striking stories recorded by Ashley incorporate Thomas Disch's "The Roaches" and "The Number You Have Just Reached", and Aldiss' "The Eyes of the Blind King". Stableford additionally applauds the spreads for the last couple of issues, which were for the most part done by Keith Roberts in a semi-unique style not at all like regular sort craftsmanship.
