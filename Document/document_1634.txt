Following the invalidation, Cromwell was executed on 28 July. Cranmer now wound up in a politically conspicuous position, with nobody else to bear the weight. All through the remainder of Henry's rule, he clung to Henry's power. The lord had all out trust in him and consequently, Cranmer couldn't cover anything from the ruler. Toward the finish of June 1541, Henry with his new spouse, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit toward the north of England. Cranmer was left in London as an individual from a chamber dealing with issues for the ruler in his nonattendance. His associates were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first real bit of obligation outside the Church. In October, while the lord and ruler were away, a reformer named John Lascelles uncovered to Cranmer that Catherine occupied with extramarital undertakings. Cranmer gave the data to Audley and Seymour and they chose to hold up until Henry's arrival. Scared of maddening the lord, Audley and Seymour recommended that Cranmer educate Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry amid mass on All Saints Day. An examination uncovered reality of the conjugal careless activities and Catherine was executed in February 1542.
