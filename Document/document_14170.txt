The last two exhibitions were held in Tempe, Arizona on 19 and 20 December 1987 and were recorded for the 1988 film "Shake and Hum". U2 sang the abstain "el pueblo vencerÃÂ¡", which signifies "the general population will survive" in Spanish, at the finish of the tune. Bono noticed that the Madres utilize the expression for inspiration. The Edge said "we're so near a Spanish talking some portion of the world, we felt that possibly individuals at the show may get on this verse." Bono included that they had shut each show since 1983 with the tune "40", thus they were hoping to supplant it with "Moms of the Disappeared" starting there on. He clarified, "If the general population of Arizona sing this, and in the event that it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a path for the following couple of years, that will be taken up once more. It'll be an intriguing trial ...". The recording was considered for the end grouping of the film, yet the band in the long run ruled against including it. "Pride (In the Name of Love)" was utilized as the last live melody, and "All I Want Is You" was picked to play over the credits.
