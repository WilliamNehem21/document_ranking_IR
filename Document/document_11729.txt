In spite of Ice-T's endeavors to separate "Body Count" from his work in the hip jump classification, the press concentrated on the gathering's rap picture. Ice-T felt that legislators had purposefully alluded to the tune "Cop Killer" as rap to incite negative analysis. "There is positively no real way to tune in to the melody 'Cop Killer' and consider it a rap record. It's so distant from rap. Be that as it may, politically, they know by saying "rap" they can get many individuals who think, 'Rap-dark rap-dark ghetto,' and don't care for it. You state "shake", individuals state, 'Goodness, yet I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac Ã¢ÂÂ that is shake.' They would prefer not to utilize the word shake and move to depict this tune." "Body Count" has since been credited for spearheading the rap metal kind advanced by gatherings, for example, Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, in spite of the fact that Ice-T does not rap on any of the collection's tracks. Ernie C expressed that "A great deal of rappers need to be in a musical crew, yet it must be done genuinely. You can't simply get anyone on guitar and anticipate that it should work. [...] [We] truly cherished the music we were doing, and it appeared."
