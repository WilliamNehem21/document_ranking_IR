Notwithstanding plans for solo instruments of his well known symphonic works, KetÃÂ¨lbey composed a scope of music for organ and for piano. A portion of the more genuine of these pieces were distributed under his "Vodorinski" nom de plume. Among the organ works are "Pastorale" and "RÃÂªverie dramatique", both dating from around 1911. The piano works incorporate the early traditional pieces, for example, the 1888 Sonata, and shorter things in an increasingly well known style, for example, "RÃÂªverie" (1894) and "Les pÃÂ¨lerins" (1925), by method for "A Romantic Melody" (1898), "PensÃÂ©es joyeuses" (1888), "In the Woodlands" (1921), "A Song of Summer" (1922), and "LÃÂ©gende triste" (1923). The melodic effects on his piano works were all in all moderate: for the early works McCanna makes reference to Haydn and Mendelssohn in this specific circumstance. A great part of the piano music distributed in the years after the First World War was gone for a household group of onlookers; it requires just an unassuming specialized capability to play and is straightforward in structure with deft harmonies. The most monetarily fruitful of the Vodorinski works was the Prelude in C minor (1907). McCanna remarks that the title as well as the material is reminiscent of Rachmaninoff: "the music ends up copying a portion of the more famous author's highlights, eminently the last fortissimo explanation of the tune in the bass". KetÃÂ¨lbey pursued Chopin's model in a few dances in the key of A noteworthy, including "La grÃÂ¢cieuse" (1907) and two unique pieces under the title Valse brillante (1905 and 1911).
