The "mentally conditioning" reference had been a spur of the moment, impromptu comment that came toward the finish of a long, behind-plan day of battling. By September 7, it discovered its way into noticeable quality at "The New York Times". Eight different governors who had been on a similar 1965 trek as Romney said no such movement had occurred, and one of them, Philip H. Hoff of Vermont, said Romney's comments were "silly, sort of stinking ... Either he's a most gullible man or he needs judgment." The implications of indoctrinating, following the encounters of American detainees of war (featured by the 1962ÃÂ film "The Manchurian Candidate"), made Romney's remark crushing, particularly as it strengthened the negative picture of Romney's capacities that had effectively created. The point of indoctrinating rapidly moved toward becoming paper article and TV television show grain, and Romney endured the worst part of the topical funniness. Representative Eugene McCarthy, running against Johnson for the Democratic selection, said that for Romney's situation, "a light wash would have been adequate." Republican Congressman Robert T. Stafford of Vermont sounded a typical concern: "In case you're running for the administration, you should have a lot on the ball to be mentally conditioned." After the comment was publicized, Romney's survey appraisals plunged, going from 11ÃÂ percent behind Nixon to 26ÃÂ percent behind.
