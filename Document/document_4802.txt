Given the errand of upgrading the Cardinals by proprietor Gussie Busch (and explicitly to empty Templeton), Herzog was hoping to exchange Templeton when he was drawn nearer by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter gatherings. While McKeon had recently revealed to Herzog that Smith was distant in any exchange, the Padres were presently so irate at Smith's specialist Gottlieb that McKeon was eager to bargain. McKeon and Herzog concurred on a basic level to a six-player exchange, with Templeton for Smith as the highlight. It was then that Padres director Dick Williams educated Herzog that a no-exchange condition had been incorporated into Smith's 1981 contract. After learning of the exchange, Smith's underlying response was to conjure the provision and remain in San Diego, yet he was as yet intrigued to hear what the Cardinals needed to state. While the arrangement for the players close to Templeton and Smith experienced, Herzog traveled to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas occasion. Smith later reviewed that, "Whitey disclosed to me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the flag. He made me feel needed, which was an inclination I was rapidly losing from the Padres. The insignificant reality that Whitey would come such a distance out there to converse with us was all that could possibly be needed to persuade me that St. Louis was the spot I needed to be."
