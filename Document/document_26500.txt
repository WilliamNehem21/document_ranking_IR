In November 2012, the writers told GameSpot that "God of War" will "improve on films like "Clash of the Titans" and "Immortals" by taking a step in a bolder direction." Melton said that Sony has "encouraged" them to make it different from other films in the same genre. It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the "Uncharted" film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, ""s Game Director, Todd Papy, said he did not know the status of the film. The writer behind the "God of War" video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think it will be hard to get that across," but she is hopeful that it can be done. As of 26, 2019, the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, a release date has not been set, but the script has been "turned in". It has a budget of $150 million USD.
