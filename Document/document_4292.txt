The structure's plan was first discharged in December 2001. Be that as it may, the primary structure did not meet with endorsement from different modelers, or from the inhabitants of Chicago. A consequent amendment in July 2002 brought about a 86-story plan for use as an office and private structure, like the 2006 plan which is, be that as it may, for an alternate blend of employments. Smith's 2002 plans put communicate recieving wires (numerous correspondences dishes) at the highest point of the structure. A reconsidered 90-story, plan was uncovered in September 2003 for a structure including apartment suites, office space, a "townhouse lodging", retail locations, and eateries. In January 2004, another modification changed floors 17 through 26 from workplaces into apartment suites and lodgings. In his May 2004 arrangement, Smith chose to top the structure with a decorative tower rather than correspondences dishes. These dishes, as indicated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, would not have tallied toward the structure's stature. The tower, be that as it may, will tally, raising the pinnacle's tallness to . At a certain point in 2005, Trump sought to fabricate a somewhat taller structure that would outperform the Sears Tower as the country's tallest structure, yet Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was against the arrangement. In the long run, Smith settled on a structure with a stature of , which was the tallness of 2 World Trade Center, the shorter of the previous twin World Trade Center towers. This stature makes the Tower the third tallest in the United States after One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower.
