In 1980, Charig depicted an example of uncertain diplodocid from the Early Cretaceous of England, and reconsidered the holotype of "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" to think about its qualities. In this production he affirmed that the ilium of the holotype of "C. leedsi", NHMUK R1988, was too fragmented to even think about being contrasted with the likewise deficient ilium of the alluded example NHMUK R3078. In view of the absence of cover the referral of NHMUK R3078 to "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" was never again irrefutable, so Charig named the new species "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" for NHMUK R3078. The particular name was picked to respect Sir Ronald Stewart, the director of the London Brick Company that claimed the mud pit the fossils had been found in. Moreover, Charig considered "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" and "Cetiosauriscus greppini" to be questionable taxa, making "C. stewarti" the main legitimate species inside "Cetiosauriscus". As a result of the deficiency of the sort species "C. leedsii", Charig made an appeal to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) in 1993 to assign "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" as the sort types of its family, being the taxon containing the example Huene had initially named the variety for and recognized from "Cetiosaurus", and furthermore a systematically progressively stable name. This was acknowledged by the ICZN in 1995, making "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" the sort types of "Cetiosauriscus". The main example that can unhesitatingly be doled out to "C. stewarti" is the holotype NHMUK R3078, in spite of the fact that it is conceivable that segregated teeth from the Oxford Clay could be from the taxon.
