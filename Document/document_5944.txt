Thomas Potts, the assistant to the Lancaster Assizes, records that subsequent to hearing the proof a significant number of those in court were induced of the denounced's blame. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they "submissively fell upon their knees with sobbing teares", and "wanted him [Bromley] for Gods cause to inspect Grace Sowerbutts". Promptly "the face of this Grace Sowerbutts changed"; the observers "started to squabble and blame each other", and in the long run conceded that Grace had been instructed in her story by a Catholic minister they called Thompson. Bromley then dedicated the young lady to be analyzed by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under addressing Grace promptly conceded that her story was false, and said she had been advised what to state by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth otherwise known as Thompson, a Jesuit cleric who was secluded from everything in the Samlesbury region; Southworth was the minister at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage. Leigh and Chisnal scrutinized the three denounced ladies trying to find why Southworth may have manufactured proof against them, yet none could offer any reason other than that every one of them "goeth to the [Anglican] Church".
