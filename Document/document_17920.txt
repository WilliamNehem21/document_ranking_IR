Crag martin pairs nest alone or in small colonies, usually containing fewer than ten nests. Nests are on average apart and each pair aggressively defends its breeding territory against other crag martin and most other bird species. Nesting takes place from May to August, and usually two broods are raised. The nest, built by both adults, is an open half cup made of mud and lined with soft material such as feathers or dry grass. It is constructed under an overhang on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or cave, or on a man-made structure. It takes one to three weeks to build and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. The clutch is two to five eggs with an average of three. The eggs are white with brownish blotches particularly at the wide end, and average with a weight of . The eggs are incubated mainly by the female for 13â17 days to hatching, and the chicks take another 24â27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the chicks bringing food every two to five minutes, and the young are fed for 14â21 days after fledging. With such frequent feeding rates the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since the further they fly to forage the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest. In an Italian study, the hatching rate was 80.2Â percent, and the average number of fledged young was 3.1.
