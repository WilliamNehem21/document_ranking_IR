Berlioz secured a commission from the French government for his Requiem â the "Grande messe des morts" â first performed at Les Invalides in December 1837. A second government commission followed â the "Grande symphonie funÃ¨bre et triomphale" in 1840. Neither work brought him much money or artistic fame at the time, but the Requiem held a special place in his affections: "If I were threatened with the destruction of the whole of my works save one, I would crave mercy for the "Messe des morts"".
One of Berlioz's main aims in the 1830s was "battering down the doors of the OpÃ©ra". In Paris at this period, the musical success that mattered was in the opera house and not the concert hall. Robert Schumann commented, "To the French, music by itself means nothing". Berlioz worked on his opera "Benvenuto Cellini" from 1834 until 1837, continually distracted by his increasing activities as a critic and as a promoter of his own symphonic concerts. The Berlioz scholar D. Kern Holoman comments that Berlioz rightly regarded "Benvenuto Cellini" as a work of exceptional exuberance and verve, deserving a better reception than it received. Holoman adds that the piece was of "surpassing technical difficulty", and that the singers were not especially co-operative. A weak libretto and unsatisfactory staging exacerbated the poor reception. The opera had only four complete performances, three in September 1838 and one in January 1839. Berlioz said that the failure of the piece meant that the doors of the OpÃ©ra were closed to him for the rest of his career â which they were, except for a commission to arrange a Weber score in 1841.
