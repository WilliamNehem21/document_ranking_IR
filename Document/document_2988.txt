After Cedar Creek, the military remained in the region through race day, when McKinley cast his first presidential vote, for the officeholder Republican, Abraham Lincoln. The following day, they moved north up the valley into winter quarters close Kernstown. In February 1865, Crook was caught by Confederate pillagers. Criminal's catch added to the perplexity as the military was revamped for the spring effort, and McKinley ended up serving on the staffs of four unique officers throughout the following fifteen daysÃ¢ÂÂCrook, John D. Stevenson, Samuel S. Carroll, and Winfield S. Hancock. At last doled out to Carroll's staff once more, McKinley went about as the general's sole auxiliary. Lee and his military surrendered to General Ulysses S. Give a couple of days after the fact, successfully finishing the war. McKinley discovered time to join a Freemason hold up (later renamed after him) in Winchester, Virginia before he and Carroll were exchanged to Hancock's First Veterans Corps in Washington. Just before the war's end, McKinley got his last advancement, a brevet commission as major. In July, the Veterans Corps was assembled out of administration, and McKinley and Carroll were soothed of their obligations. Carroll and Hancock urged McKinley to apply for a spot in the peacetime armed force, however he declined and came back to Ohio the next month.
