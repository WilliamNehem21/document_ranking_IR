Stengel figured the 1943 season would be his toward the end in baseball; Edna asked him to care for the privately-run company intrigues full-time, and Casey, who had dependably been a competitor, was hesitant to show himself at a baseball arena with the defectively recuperated damage. However, right off the bat in the 1944 season, the small time Milwaukee Brewers had an overseeing opportunity to fill, as the Chicago Cubs had employed away the Brewer director, Charlie Grimm, who had played with Stengel on the 1919 Pirates. Grimm advised the Cubs he was obliged to see the Brewers had an able substitution, and asked the Brewers to procure Stengel. The group proprietor, Bill Veeck, positioned with the Marines on Guadalcanal, considered sick Stengel a director, and was hesitant in his assent when come to by link. Stengel was capable at cultivating great relations with columnists, and the gifted group kept on winning; before the finish of May, Veeck had pulled back his protests. The group won the American Association flag, yet lost in the playoffs to Louisville. Veeck, having come back to the United States, offered to rehire Stengel for 1945, yet Stengel favored another offer he got. This was from George Weiss of the New York Yankees, to deal with the group Stengel had started with, the Kansas City Blues, by then a Yankee homestead club. Kansas City had completed toward the end in the American Association as Milwaukee won the flag, making it something of a reversal for Stengel, who would have liked to come back to the real alliances. In any case, it was in his old main residence, enabling him to see companions and relations, and he accepted the position. The Blues completed seventh in the eight-group association in 1945.
