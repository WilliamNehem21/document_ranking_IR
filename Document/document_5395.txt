Amid the Late Middle Ages, the Buckley and Crompton families were recorded as the biggest landowners in Crompton, owning area and farmsteads at Whitfield and Crompton Fold separately. The Crompton family has an all around archived history and can be followed back to the season of Magna Carta, showing up in the Assize Roll for 1245. Crompton is indigenous to the township, and first shows up as a family name in the thirteenth century, when the area's primary landowner, Hugh de la Legh, changed his family name to "de Crompton" (of Crompton), to mirror the domain he had. The family possessed an extensive memorable house by the name of Crompton Hall, on the site of Crompton Fold. Crompton Hall initially shows up in chronicled records as right on time as 1442, claimed by Thomas de Crompton and his family. The first "medieval" Crompton Hall was obliterated around 1848. A second Crompton Hall, set in its very own unmistakable forested grounds, was raised by the familyÃ¢ÂÂby then a persuasive and well-off speculator in the neighborhood cotton industryÃ¢ÂÂhowever following the demise of the final relatives, the site was sold and, in 1950, the house was annihilated to clear path for a selective improvement of homes.
