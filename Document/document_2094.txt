A progressively good audit originated from Richard Watts, Jr. of the "New York Herald Tribune", who called "Ravenousness" "the most essential picture yet delivered in AmericaÃÂ  ... It is the one image of the period that can stand its ground as a work of sensational workmanship deserving of examination with such stage plays as "What Price Glory?" and "Want Under the Elms"." The April 20, 1925, release of "The Montreal Gazette" guaranteed it "awes as a ground-breaking film" and portrayed the "limit crowd" screening as "one of only a handful couple of pictures which are as deserving of genuine thought ... which offer a genuine and persuading study regarding life and character and that protected their closures by aesthetic and scholarly methods instead of by recording to the dimension of the groundlings." The survey proceeded to portray the course as "skillful", refering to "its momentous depiction of character advancement and the unpretentious contacts which pass on thoughts through vision as opposed to the composed word, a very uncommon work of the potential outcomes of the film play as a particular part of craftsmanship equipped for honest and persuading disclosure and elucidation of life's substances." An audit in "Extraordinary Photoplays" expressed that "Mr. von Stroheim has dependably been the pragmatist as Rex Ingram is the sentimentalist and Griffith the sentimentalist of the screen, and in "Insatiability" he has given us a case of authenticity at its starkest. Like the novel from which the plot was taken, "Voracity" is a horrendous and magnificent thing."
