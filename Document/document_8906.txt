Prior to the beginning of the Second World War, and the foundation of war-based businesses, Jarvis' drives conveyed humble help to Jarrow. By 1939, around 100 men were utilized in a little furniture processing plant and up to a further 500 in different metal-put together ventures set up with respect to the Palmer's site. Jarvis had procured the out of date liners "Olympic" and "Berengaria", to be separated at the yard. In any case, after their triumphant homecoming a significant number of the marchers felt that their undertaking had fizzled. Con Whalen, who at his passing in 2003 was the last overcomer of the individuals who walked the full separation, said that the walk was "an exercise in futility", however included that he had delighted in each progression. His kindred marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th commemoration of the walk in 1976, said that "[t]he walk created no quick alarming upsurge in work in the town. It took the war to do that". These perspectives are shared by most analysts and students of history. The "Every day Mirror" writer Kevin Maguire calls the walk "a chivalrous disappointment", while Matt Dobson, in "The Socialist", composes that "out of all the craving walks its points were the most weakened and it made the most unassuming additions". The history specialists Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart give a positive point of view, contending that the Jarrow March "molded [post-Second World War] impression of the 1930s", and therefore made ready to social change.
