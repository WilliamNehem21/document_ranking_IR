Bohr was heartily gotten by James Chadwick and Sir John Anderson, yet for security reasons Bohr was kept far out. He was given a loft at St James' Palace and an office with the British Tube Alloys atomic weapons advancement group. Bohr was surprised at the measure of advancement that had been made. Chadwick organized Bohr to visit the United States as a Tube Alloys specialist, with Aage as his right hand. On 8 December 1943, Bohr landed in Washington, D.C., where he met with the executive of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Forests, Jr. He visited Einstein and Pauli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and went to Los Alamos in New Mexico, where the atomic weapons were being structured. For security reasons, he went under the name of "Nicholas Baker" in the United States, while Aage progressed toward becoming "James Baker". In May 1944 the Danish opposition paper De frie Danske revealed that they had discovered that 'the celebrated child of Denmark Professor Niels Bohr' in October the earlier year had fled his nation by means of Sweden to London and from that point ventured out to Moscow from where he could be expected to help the war exertion.
