Geoffrey formally surrendered the see of Lincoln on 6 January 1182, at Marlborough in England, instead of be appointed as Pope Lucius III had requested. Henry had named him Chancellor of England in 1181, after Geoffrey demonstrated he would leave the ward in February 1181. Despite the fact that Geoffrey surrendered the episcopal office, he kept on holding benefices in majority, which was ordinarily in opposition to group law. These workplaces incorporated the Treasurer of York from 1182, the Archdeaconry of Rouen from 1183, and presumably the Archdeaconry of East Riding. Henry additionally gave him two mainland palaces, one in Anjou and one in Touraine, alongside terrains in England and Normandy worth 1000 denotes a year. In spite of the fact that Geoffrey held the workplace of Chancellor, he shows up in just couple of records, predominantly somewhere in the range of 1182 and 1185. After 1185 he doesn't show up in any contemporary reports until 1187, and it is conceivable that he invested some energy outside his dad's areas. Dwindle of Blois composed that few rulers considered Geoffrey as a conceivable successor for their kingdoms in Italy or the Holy Land, and that he was really offered the position of royalty of Jerusalem by Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem. It is conceivable that Geoffrey's non-appearance in reports was because of his nonappearance from his dad's spaces in quest for these desire. Amid Geoffrey's term of office as Chancellor Walter de Coutances filled in as his "seal-guardian"; the requirement for somebody to play out this capacity adds additional proof to the probability that Geoffrey's time as Chancellor was spent on irrelevant obligations for his dad. William Longchamp satisfied a similar right hand job for the archdeaconry at Rouen.
