Ichiki and 916 of his regiment's 2,300 troops, assigned the "Primary Element" and conveying seven days' supply of sustenance, were conveyed to Taivu Point, about east of Lunga Point, by six destroyers at 01:00 on August 19. Ichiki was requested to scout the American positions and sit tight for the rest of his power to arrive. Known as the "Ichiki Butai" (Ichiki Detachment), they were a tip top and fight prepared power however as was going to be found, they were intensely hit with "triumph illness" Ã¢ÂÂ arrogance because of past progress. Ichiki was so certain about the predominance of his men that he chose to wreck the American protectors before the rest of most of his power arrived, notwithstanding writing in his diary ""18 August, landing; 20 August, walk by night and fight; 21 August, satisfaction in the product of triumph"". He prepared a shamelessly basic arrangement: walk straight down the shoreline and through the American guards. Abandoning around 100 work force as a back gatekeeper, Ichiki walked west with the staying 800 men of his unit and made camp before day break about east of the Lunga border. The U.S. Marines at Lunga Point got insight that a Japanese arrival had happened and found a way to discover precisely what was going on.
