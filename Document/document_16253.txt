In early 1940, Farnsworth Wright was replaced as editor of "Weird Tales" by Dorothy McIlwraith, who also edited "Short Stories". McIlwraith had no particular expertise in the horror field and, although she was a competent editor, the Wright era is generally considered to have been "Weird Tales" heyday. With Wright's departure, "Unknown" quickly became the leading magazine in its small field. "Unknown" acquired a stable of regular writers, many of whom were also appearing in "Astounding", and all of whom were comfortable with the rigor that Campbell demanded even of a fantasy plot. Frequent contributors included L. Ron Hubbard, Theodore Sturgeon, and L. Sprague de Camp, who, in collaboration with Fletcher Pratt, contributed three stories about a world where magic operates by logical rules. The stories were later collected as part of Pratt and de Camp's "Incompleat Enchanter" series; John Clute has commented that the title of one of them, "The Mathematics of Magic", is "perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention in "Unknown"". Other stories still regarded as classics include "They" by Heinlein, "Smoke Ghost" by Fritz Leiber, along with several stories in Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser series, and "Trouble With Water" by H.L. Gold. "Unknown"'s influence was far-reaching; according to Ashley, the magazine created the modern genre of fantasy, and science fiction scholar Thomas Clareson suggests that by destroying the genre boundaries between sf and fantasy it allowed stories such as Simak's City series to be written. Clareson also proposes that "Galaxy Science Fiction" and "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction", two of the most important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines, were direct descendants of "Unknown".
