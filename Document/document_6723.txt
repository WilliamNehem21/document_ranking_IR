In 1968, Steiger played a sequential executioner inverse George Segal in Jack Smight's dark satire spine chiller "Unacceptable behavior to show to a Lady". Throughout the film, he embraces different camouflages, including those of an Irish cleric, a New York City policeman, a German handyman, and a gay beautician, to abstain from being distinguished, and to comfort his unfortunate casualties, before choking them and painting a couple of lips on their brows with conspicuous red lipstick. The film and Steiger's execution were widely praised, with Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" featuring Steiger's "delightfully uninhibited execution as a hammy", and an essayist for "Time Out" depicting him as "splendid as a kind of Boston strangler, child of an extraordinary on-screen character who has abandoned her kid with a mother obsession". Later in 1968, Steiger played a subdued gay non-authorized officer inverse John Phillip Law in John Flynn's "The Sergeant" for Warner Bros.- Seven Arts, which earned him the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor. Regardless of the honor win, film faultfinder Pauline Kael of "The New Yorker" was especially condemning of the giving of Steiger a role as a gay and felt that he was "absolutely outside his range", to which Steiger agreed that he was ineffectual.
