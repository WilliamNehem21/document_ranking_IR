"Final Fantasy XI" is one of the first cross-console video games, and has continued to update its software to allow the game to run on new consoles. On 8 March 2007, a patch was released to enable gameplay in French and German. Square Enix noted that Nintendo's use of "friend codes" was the primary reason "Final Fantasy XI" was not brought to the Wii. In December 2006, the PlayStation 2 versions of PlayOnline and "Final Fantasy XI" were able to install and run on the PlayStation 3. The "Vana'diel Collection 2008" discs for the PlayStation 2 had installation issues on the PlayStation 3, causing them to be unusable at first since they weren't on Sony's list of HDD compatible titles in the firmware the PlayStation 3 had at the time. This problem was fixed on December 18, 2007 when Sony released firmware update 2.10 for the PlayStation 3. This allowed all backwards compatible modelsâ20GB model #CECHB01, 60GB model #CECHA01 and 80GB model #CECHE01âto play FFXI. After working with Microsoft to resolve "Final Fantasy XI"s incompatibility issues with Windows Vista, Square Enix released a downloadable version of the PlayOnline client which is compatible with the operating system, although small bugs have appeared.
