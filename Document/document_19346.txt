In their original description, Charig and Milner found "Baryonyx" unique enough to warrant a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found "Baryonyx" to be unlike any other theropod group, and considered the possibility that it was a thecodont (a grouping of early archosaurs now considered unnatural), due to having apparently primitive features, but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in "Dilophosaurus". They also noted that the two snouts from Niger (which later became the basis of "Cristatusaurus"), assigned to the family Spinosauridae by Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to that of "Baryonyx" and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, the American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that "Spinosaurus", described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt that were destroyed in World War II, and "Baryonyx" were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990, Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of "Baryonyx", since they did not find their remains similar enough. In 1997, they agreed that Baryonychidae and Spinosauridae were related, but disagreed that the former name should become a synonym of the latter, because the completeness of "Baryonyx" compared to "Spinosaurus" made it a better type genus for a family, and because they did not find the similarities between the two significant enough. Holtz and colleagues listed Baryonychidae as a synonym of Spinosauridae in 2004.
