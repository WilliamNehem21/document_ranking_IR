Johnson and Christie set up isolated offices for viable sciences, for example, arithmetic, common history, horticulture, and prescription; writing, for example, verse, dramatization, and sentiment; lastly, legislative issues and religion, which enveloped government, religious philosophy, rationality, ethical quality, law, and exchange. For every division, there was a central commentator, despite the fact that the person may connect with others. Despite the fact that the analysts' names were not known to general society, Johnson and Christie figured out how to procure a few illuminating presences: the artist William Cowper; the mainstream moralist William Enfield; the essayist and doctor John Aikin; the artist, writer, and youngsters' writer Anna Laetitia Barbauld; the Unitarian pastor William Turner; the doctor and abstract faultfinder James Currie; the craftsman Henry Fuseli; the author Mary Hays; the researcher Alexander Geddes; and the scholar Joshua Toulmin. The analysts were altogether paid, anyway researchers have been unfit to find their rates. Christie was regularly missing after the establishing of the "Scientific Review", leaving the everyday activities of the diary up to Johnson. In 1790 he went to Paris for a half year, amid which he met with progressive pioneers and began a business; in 1792 he came back to enable the French to make an interpretation of their constitution and to break up his business. He left for Surinam in 1796 to gather cash owed to him, and passed on there.
