Long a promoter for sexual orientation balance in climbing, Hill has contended that people can climb similar courses: "I figure they ought to have ladies contend on indistinguishable ascensions from the men, and on the off chance that the ladies can't do the trips, at that point they shouldn't contend". For instance, she contended that both genders contend on similar courses in World Cup rivalries. In any case, Hill later reconsidered her view, taking note of that while she could and competed with men "onlookers need to see individuals get to the top. What's more, since most ladies aren't moving at a similar dimension as the top men, it's important to plan a course that is somewhat simpler for ladies". In answer to an inquiry concerning whether ladies "will ever equivalent or outperform men in climbing", Hill gave a point by point reaction, concentrated on body arrangement, size, and brain science, clarifying that climbing "favors individuals with high solidarity to-weight ratios[s]", less muscle to fat ratio, and more noteworthy stature, articulating that such qualities regularly support men yet that ladies "have the benefit of being moderately light, with the limit with respect to colossal continuance". She clarified that "hypothetically someone as short as me could be the best on the planet since it doesn't depend such a great amount on tallness nowÃÂ ... What's more, it's a mental thing in excess of a physical thing."
