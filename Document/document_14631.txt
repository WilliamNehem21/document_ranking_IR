Polk saw the ranch as his course to an agreeable presence after his administration for himself and his better half; he didn't expect to come back to the act of law. Trusting the expanded work power would build his retirement salary, he acquired seven slaves in 1846, through a specialist, matured generally somewhere in the range of 12 and 17. The multi year old and one of the multi year olds were obtained together at a home deal; the operator inside weeks exchanged the more youthful kid to Polk's benefit. The year 1847 saw the buy of nine more. Three he obtained from Gideon Pillow, and his specialist acquired six slaves, matured somewhere in the range of 10 and 20. When of the buy from Pillow, the Mexican War had started and Polk sent installment with the letter in which he offered Pillow a commission in the Army. The buy from Pillow was a slave Polk had recently possessed and had sold for being a disturbance, and his significant other and youngster. None of different slaves Polk obtained as President, all more youthful than 20, accompanied a parent, and as just in the one case were two slaves purchased together, in all probability none had a going with kin as each confronted life on Polk's manor.
