At 12:30 pm, "Bellerophon" cut through the enemy line, slipping under the stern of the Spanish 74-gun "Monarca" and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, "Bellerophon" collided with the French 74-gun "Aigle", hitting "Aigle"s port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard "Aigle" sweeping "Bellerophon"s decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply "It is too late now to take them off. I see my situation but I will die like a man." "Bellerophon" was now sustaining fire from "Aigle" and three other ships, the Spanish "San Juan Nepomuceno" and "Bahama", and the French "Swiftsure". "Bellerophon"s main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistolsÂ ... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was "No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike."
