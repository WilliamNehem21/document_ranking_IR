In late 1991 and mid 1992, Paterson and Weston composed their next single, "Blue Room". Helping with the chronicle was bassist Jah Wobble, keyboardist Miquette Giraudy, and guitarist Hillage. Regardless of its playing time of just about 40 minutes, "Blue Room" entered the British diagrams at #12 and topped at #8, making it the longest track to achieve the graphs. The Orb advanced this single with an "amazing vanguard" execution on "Top of the Pops" where Patterson and Weston played a round of chess in space suits while film of dolphins and an altered variant of "Blue Room" kept running out of sight. In July 1992, "U.F.Orb" was discharged highlighting "Blue Room" and, in the US discharge, the Orb's next single, "Professional killer". Weston coordinated his specialized and innovative aptitude with Paterson's Eno-impacted climate on "U.F.Orb", consolidating "drum and bass rhythms" with "velvet consoles" and "undulating synth lines". "U.F.Orb" came to #1 on the British collection outlines to the stun of commentators, who were shocked that fans had grasped what columnists viewed as dynamic shake. Regardless of the Orb's prosperity, Paterson and Weston wanted to maintain a strategic distance from individual exposure and rather enable their music to be the focal point of consideration. In light of this halfway secrecy and the Orb's turning enrollment, they are frequently perceived as all the more a melodic group than a "band".
