The calculation of was revolutionized by the development of infinite series techniques in the 16th and 17th centuries. An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute with much greater precision than Archimedes and others who used geometrical techniques. Although infinite series were exploited for most notably by European mathematicians such as James Gregory and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the approach was first discovered in India sometime between 1400 and 1500 AD. The first written description of an infinite series that could be used to compute was laid out in Sanskrit verse by Indian astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji in his "Tantrasamgraha", around 1500 AD. The series are presented without proof, but proofs are presented in a later Indian work, "YuktibhÄá¹£Ä", from around 1530 AD. Nilakantha attributes the series to an earlier Indian mathematician, Madhava of Sangamagrama, who lived c.Â 1350Â â c.Â 1425. Several infinite series are described, including series for sine, tangent, and cosine, which are now referred to as the Madhava series or GregoryâLeibniz series. Madhava used infinite series to estimate to 11 digits around 1400, but that value was improved on around 1430 by the Persian mathematician JamshÄ«d al-KÄshÄ«, using a polygonal algorithm.
The first infinite sequence discovered in Europe was an infinite product (rather than an infinite sum, which are more typically used in calculations) found by French mathematician FranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te in 1593:
