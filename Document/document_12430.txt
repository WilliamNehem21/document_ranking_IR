Leaving school without his family's learning, he settled on the choice to battle in the Civil War in August 1862. In spite of his blended race lineage, Pitman stayed away from the racial isolation forced on other Native Hawaiian enlisted people of the time and enrolled in the 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, a white regiment. He filled in as a private in the Union Army battling in the Battle of Antietam and the Maryland Campaign. In his organization, Private Robert G. Carter got to know the part-Hawaiian fighter and wrote in later existence of their regular involvement in the 22nd Massachusetts. Arranged decades a short time later from old letters, Carter's record depicted the subtleties encompassing his last destiny in the war. On the walk to Fredericksburg, Pitman was isolated from his regiment and caught by Confederate guerrilla powers. He was compelled to walk to Richmond and detained in the Confederate Libby Prison, where he contracted "lung fever" from the unforgiving states of his detainment and passed on FebruaryÃÂ 27, 1863, a couple of months after his discharge on parole in a detainee trade. Present day students of history consider Henry HoÃÂ»olulu Pitman to be the main known Hawaiian or Pacific Islander to bite the dust as a wartime captive in the Civil War.
