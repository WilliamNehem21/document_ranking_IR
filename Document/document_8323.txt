On August 12, 1902, Treasury Secretary Leslie M. Shaw kept in touch with previous Missouri senator David R. Francis, one of the advertisers of the work, enquiring what plan piece authorities might want to see on the invert of the coins. In spite of the fact that Francis' reaction isn't surviving, Mint specialists initially decided upon an olive branch encompassing a numeral "1". This was evidently detested by the Director of the Mint, George E. Roberts, for on October 2, 1902, Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis kept in touch with him, encasing cardboard impressions of the first and amended proposed inverts. The new structure had the esteem explained and the letter expressed that the progressions were being made at Roberts' proposal. On October 13, Barber went to Washington (where the executive's office was situated) to meet with Roberts about the structure. Roberts considered the olive branch "excessively prominent", given the measure of the coin and the lettering, and asked that the branch be diminished in size. This clearly was finished. By September 1902, work upon the passes on for the front-sides, demonstrating the heads of McKinley and Jefferson, being worked upon by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Stylist, was very much progressed.
