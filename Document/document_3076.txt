A few groups of servicemen and servicewomen who were executed in Iraq responded indignantly to the book, in which Blair does not apologize for the intrusion. "I can't lament the choice to do battle. I can say never did I surmise the ridiculous, ruinous and disorganized bad dream that unfurledÃ¢ÂÂand that also is a piece of the duty," he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose child Tom Keys was murdered in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was "simply crocodile tears from Blair." Keys stated, "The tears he professes to have shed are not at all like the tears I and my significant other have shed for our child. They are not at all like the tears that a huge number of Iraqis have shed for their friends and family. They don't approach it. They appear to me like crocodile tears. It is a pessimistic endeavor to disinfect his heritage." A representative for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's demeanor of disappointment over the death toll was "totally pointless." The representative included, "He needs to demonstrate his lament and offering cash to philanthropy doesn't approach. He is giving a tiny sum contrasted with the expense of war and restoration of harmed warriors. It is ridiculous."
