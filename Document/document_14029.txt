In 1923, numerous things of furniture were sold, yet there was no enthusiasm for buy of the house. Amid that decade bits of gossip emerged that Bramall would be destroyed and transported to the United States; this may have been advanced by the collection of memoirs of Kate Douglas Wiggin which depicted the creator's visit to Bramall in 1890.

At a certain point the neighboring nearby specialist, Stockport County Borough Council, offered to purchase the domain, yet Nevill rejected their idea as "inadmissible". The bartering got no satisfactory offers.

He lived in the house until his demise in 1927, and his widow Amy stayed there until 1935, when she sold it to Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council for ÃÂ£14,360 (worth about ÃÂ£ in 2019) with the aim that the house and park be available to the general population.
