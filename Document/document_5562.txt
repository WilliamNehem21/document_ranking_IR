Tim Byrd checked on the experience in "The Space Gamer" No. 30, expressing that it "effectively consolidates dream with SF" and that it was "amazingly amusing to play [...] a standout amongst the best modules TSR has distributed". Two gaming magazines looked into "Undertaking to the Barrier Peaks" in 1981. Analyst Marcus L. Rowland said in "White Dwarf" #26 that he found the experience "truly agreeable, with thoughts and animals prominently appropriate for more extensive use". He gave it 9/10 generally speaking, yet grumbled that a portion of the maps were imprinted on the two sides of a similar sheet, making them pointless as a Dungeon Master's shield (a visual boundary that permits dice rolls and different exercises to be directed without the players knowing the result). He prescribed no less than seven days' investigation by the Dungeon Master before endeavoring to play it. He likewise noticed that the spread "uncovers the mystery of the animals". Kirby Griffis assessed the experience in "The Space Gamer" #36. Griffis noticed that it is brimming with "shocks and new beasts", and felt that its one disadvantage was that Gygax displayed standard "D&D" beasts as locals of different planets. In outline, he thought that it was fascinating and "loaded with zest and flavor"; prescribing it to anybody keen on "something new" or needing to incorporate sci-fi in their "D&D" diversion.
