Seventy-one years old and ending up progressively hard of hearing, Cooper declared to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not look for re-appointment to his Senate situate, having served longer in that body than some other Kentuckian with the exception of Alben Barkley. The intermediary Cooper chose to make one more endeavor to end the war, after a forceful North Vietnamese hostile against the South in March 1972 escalated battling in the district by and by. Without notification ahead of time, Cooper tended to an almost unfilled Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing a correction to a military help charge that would genuinely end financing for all U.S. military activities in Indochina in four months. The measure, which had no co-supports, dazed Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and incited warmed discussion in the Senate. Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke spared the alteration from practically certain death by including an arrangement that every single American POW be returned before the withdrawal of U.S. powers. The reconsidered revision passed 62Ã¢ÂÂ 33, whereupon Nixon chose to forfeit the whole military help bill. At Nixon's request, the Senate crushed the changed bill 48Ã¢ÂÂ 42. Baffled, Cooper all things considered announced, "I feel cleansed inside. I've felt firmly about this for quite a while. Presently it's in the hands of the President. He's the main individual who can take care of completion the war now."
