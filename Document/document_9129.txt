Introductory work on "Great Theft Auto V" established the open world creation, where primer models were developed in-motor amid pre-generation. The amusement's setting is the anecdotal U.S. province of San Andreas and city of Los Santos, in view of Southern California and Los Angeles separately. San Andreas was first utilized as "" setting, which highlighted three urban communities isolated by open field. The group believed that the desire of incorporating three urban areas in "San Andreas" was excessively incredible, as it didn't imitate the urban communities just as they had trusted. Houser felt that "to complete an appropriate adaptation of L.A.ÃÂ ...ÃÂ the diversion needs to give you a feeling of that sprawlif not totally recreate it", and that separating the financial plan and labor between various urban communities would have degraded catching "what L.A. is". Garbut said that PlayStation 2 time innovation came up short on the specialized capacities to catch Los Angeles legitimately, to such an extent that "San Andreas" interpretation of Los Santos resembled a "background or a diversion level with people on foot arbitrarily processing about". The group ignored "San Andreas" as a takeoff point for "Fantastic Theft Auto V" since they had proceeded onward to another age of consoles and needed to construct the city without any preparation. As per Garbut, with the move to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 equipment, "our procedures and the devotion of the world [had] advanced such a great amount from "San Andreas"" that utilizing it as a model would have been repetitive. The group's emphasis on one city rather than three implied that they could create Los Santos in higher quality and at more prominent scale than in the past diversion.
