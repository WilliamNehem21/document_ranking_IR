Generally Cage abstains from utilizing lower registers of the piano, and a significant part of the music's melodic forefront lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five arranged notes, just three have a place with the three most reduced octaves beneath F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Moreover, D2 is set up so that the subsequent sound has the recurrence of a D4 (bringing about two variations of D4 accessible, one more arranged than the other). The part of the console above F#3 is isolated into about three registers: low, center, and high. The low register has the heaviest arrangement, and the high register the lightest. Distinctive strategies are utilized: certain notes produce sounds that hold the first recurrence and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned forms of the first notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no feeling of the key recurrence by any stretch of the imagination. The utilization of the delicate pedal, which makes the sledges strike just two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with just two strings), muddles the issue further. For instance, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no central noticeable when the delicate pedal is discouraged, yet it sounds genuinely ordinary if the pedal is discharged. It creates the impression that Cage was completely mindful of the ramifications of this: specific sonatas include interaction between two variants of one note, others place uncommon accentuation on specific notes, and still others are extremely subject to specific note blends.
