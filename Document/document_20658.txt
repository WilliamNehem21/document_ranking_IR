Rodgers promised "to dedicate my life to fight for this club and defend the great principles of Liverpool Football Club on and off the field." Liverpool finished seventh in his first season, but outperformed expectations the following season to put them into title contention. A run of 11 consecutive victories was halted by a 2â0 home loss to Chelsea. The defeat meant the title race was out of Liverpool's control. Having taken a 3â0 lead in their next match â away at Crystal Palace, Liverpool conceded three times in the final 15 minutes to draw 3â3. The result dented their title aspirations; although Liverpool went into the final day with a mathematical chance of winning the league, they were overhauled by Manchester City. In July, SuÃ¡rez was sold to Barcelona for Â£75 million, and the following January Steven Gerrard agreed a move to LA Galaxy at the end of the campaign, ending 17 years at the club. Rodgers was sacked after a poor start to the 2015â16 season, and was replaced by German JÃ¼rgen Klopp. Liverpool reached the finals of the League Cup and UEFA Europa League, losing the former 3â1 in a penalty shootout after the match finished 1â1, and the latter 3â1 to Sevilla in Basel.
