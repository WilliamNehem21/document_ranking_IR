Basically, certain parts of "Guards" veered off from the standard in comic books at the time, especially the board format and the shading. Rather than boards of different sizes, the makers isolated each page into a nine-board lattice. Gibbons supported the nine-board matrix framework because of its "power". Moore acknowledged the utilization of the nine-board matrix design, which "gave him a dimension of power over the narrating he hadn't had beforehand", as per Gibbons. "There was this component of the pacing and visual effect that he could now anticipate and use to emotional impact." Bhob Stewart of "The Comics Journal" referenced to Gibbons in 1987, that the page formats reviewed those of EC Comics, notwithstanding the craftsmanship itself, which Stewart felt especially resounded that of John Severin. Gibbons concurred that the resounding of the EC-style formats "was an exceptionally intentional thing", despite the fact that his motivation was fairly Harvey Kurtzman, however it was sufficiently changed to give the arrangement a remarkable look. The craftsman additionally refered to Steve Ditko's work on early issues of "The Amazing Spider-Man" as an impact, just as "Specialist Strange", where "even at his most hallucinogenic [he] would at present keep a quite straight page design".
