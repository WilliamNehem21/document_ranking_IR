The hypothetical physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg thought about whether the neutron could be a key atomic molecule like the proton and electron, instead of a protonÃ¢ÂÂ electron pair. Heisenberg demonstrated that the neutron was best portrayed as another atomic molecule, however its definite nature stayed indistinct. In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick evaluated that a neutron had a mass of about . Since a proton and an electron had a joined mass of , this inferred the neutron as a protonÃ¢ÂÂ electron composite had a coupling vitality of about , which sounded sensible, in spite of the fact that it was difficult to see how a molecule with so small restricting vitality could be steady. Assessing such a little mass contrast required testing exact estimations, be that as it may, and a few clashing outcomes were gotten in 1933Ã¢ÂÂ 4. By shelling boron with alpha particles, FrÃÂ©dÃÂ©ric and IrÃÂ¨ne Joliot-Curie got an expansive incentive for the mass of a neutron, however Ernest Lawrence's group at the University of California delivered a little one. At that point Maurice Goldhaber, a displaced person from Nazi Germany and an alumni understudy at the Cavendish Laboratory, proposed to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma beams of Tl (at that point known as thorium C"):
