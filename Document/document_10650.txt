The vulgarity preliminary started on 9 November 1928. Cape's specialist Harold Rubinstein conveyed 160 letters to potential observers. Many were hesitant to show up in court; as per Virginia Woolf, "they for the most part put it down to the frail heart of a dad, or a cousin who is going to have twins". Around 40 turned up upon the arrival of the preliminary, including Woolf herself, Forster, and such assorted figures as researcher Julian Huxley, Laurence Housman of the British Sexological Society, Robert Cust JP of the London Morality Council, Charles Ricketts of the Royal Academy of Art and Rabbi Joseph Frederick Stern of the East London Synagogue. Norman Haire, who was the star observer after Havelock Ellis bowed out, proclaimed that homosexuality kept running in families and an individual could no more moved toward becoming it by perusing books than if he could wind up syphilitic by finding out about syphilis. None were permitted to offer their perspectives on the novel. Under the Obscene Publications Act of 1857, Chief Magistrate Sir Chartres Biron could choose whether the book was profane without hearing any declaration on the inquiry. "I don't think individuals are qualified for express a sentiment upon an issue which is the choice of the court," he said. Since Hall herself was not on preliminary, she didn't reserve the privilege to her very own insight, and Cape's counselor Norman Birkett had induced her not to give proof herself.
