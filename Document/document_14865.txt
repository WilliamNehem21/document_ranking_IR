As "Vasa" go under the lee of the feigns toward the south (what is currently SÃÂ¶dermalm), a whirlwind filled her sails, and she obeyed all of a sudden to port. The sheets were pushed off, and the ship gradually corrected herself as the blast passed. At Tegelviken, where there is a hole in the feigns, a considerably more grounded blast again constrained the ship onto its port side, this time pushing the open lower gunports under the surface, enabling water to surge in onto the lower gundeck. The water developing on the deck immediately surpassed the ship's insignificant capacity to right itself, and water kept on pouring in until it kept running down into the hold; the ship rapidly sank to a profundity of 32ÃÂ m (105ÃÂ ft) just 120ÃÂ m (390ÃÂ ft) from shore. Survivors clung to garbage or the upper poles, which were still over the surface, to spare themselves, and numerous close-by water crafts raced to their guide, yet regardless of these endeavors and the short separation to arrive, 30 individuals died with the ship, as per reports. "Vasa" sank in full perspective on a horde of hundreds, if not thousands, of generally normal Stockholmers who had come to see the extraordinary ship set sail. The group included outside envoys, basically spies of Gustavus Adolphus' partners and foes, who likewise saw the calamity.
