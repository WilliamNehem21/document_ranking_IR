In the Fortress of Regrets, The Nameless One experiences three of his past manifestations: one down to earth, one great, and one neurotic. The Nameless One discovers that the "great" manifestation was the first man who was made undying by Ravel, and discovers that he had submitted endlessly horrendous sins in his lifetime. Understanding that he would need to serve in the Blood War, an endless war among evil spirits and fiends, when he bites the dust, he looked to delay demise for whatever length of time that conceivable so as to offer reparations for his deeds. In the wake of converging with his past manifestations through either persuading them or battle and increasing the majority of their consolidated involvement and information, The Nameless One defies his mortality, which is encapsulated as The Transcendent One. The Transcendent One uncovers that since being isolated from The Nameless One, he has made the most of his opportunity and has been endeavoring to eradicate pieces of information that may lead The Nameless One to find reality. Contingent upon the player's decision, The Nameless One at that point either kills The Transcendent One through battle or persuades it to rejoin with him, with either alternative at long last finishing his everlasting status. In the amusement's last scene, The Nameless One stirs almost a battleground of Blood War, getting a mace and strolls toward the contention as was initially proposed.
