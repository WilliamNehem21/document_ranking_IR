1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt's career. Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film "Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles", based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name, he was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas. Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony, his performance was poorly received. According to the "Dallas Observer", "Brad PittÂ [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy sideÂ [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis." Following the release of "Interview with the Vampire", Pitt starred in "Legends of the Fall" (1994), based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant, Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category. Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed, many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" said, "Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way." The "Deseret News" predicted that "Legends of the Fall" would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.
