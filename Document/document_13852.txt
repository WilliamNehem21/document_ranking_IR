In Spring 1919, Karl Roche composed another stage for the FVdG entitled "Was wollen pass on Syndikalisten? Programm, Ziele und Wege der 'Freien Vereinigung deutscher Gewerkschaften'" ("What Do the Syndicalists Want? The Program, Goals, and Means of the 'Free Association of German Trade Unions'"). Notwithstanding repeating pre-war thoughts and trademarks, it went further by censuring investment in discretionary majority rule government, asserting that this incapacitated and befuddled lowly class battle. The stage likewise required the foundation of the tyranny of the low class, a position which was intended to connect with the recently framed Communist Party (KPD) and International Communists of Germany. In late 1918 and mid 1919, the FVdG turned into a critical player in the strike development in the Ruhr area (which for the most part included excavators). Its coordinators, most eminently Carl Windhoff, wound up normal speakers at laborers' shows. On April 1, a general strike bolstered by the FVdG, the KPD and the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) started. The strike in the long run required up to 75 percent of the area's diggers until it was fiercely smothered in late April by the SPD-drove government. After the strike and the following breakdown of the General Miners' Union, the FVdG extended its associations quickly and freely of the previously mentioned ideological groups, particularly in the Ruhr area. This prompted an enormous development in FVdG enrollment. The FVdG's analysis of the bureaucratic concentrated worker's organizations, its advocation of direct activity, and its low participation duty were gotten well by the laborers in the Ruhr locale. By August 1919, the league had around 60,000 individuals all through Germany. In any case, its Ruhr diggers' associations left the art unionist conspire the FVdG had customarily been sorted out by behind, leaning toward less complex mechanical structures.
