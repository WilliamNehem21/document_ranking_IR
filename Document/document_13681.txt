Ainsworth's story of Turpin's medium-term venture from London to York on his female horse Black Bess has its beginnings in a scene recorded by Daniel Defoe, in his 1727 work "A visit thro' the entire island of Great Britain". In the wake of submitting a burglary in Kent in 1676, William Nevison evidently rode to York to build up a plausible excuse, and Defoe's record of that venture turned out to be a piece of people legend. A comparative ride was credited to Turpin as right on time as 1808, and was being performed in front of an audience by 1819, however the accomplishment as envisioned by Ainsworth (about 200ÃÂ miles in under multi day) is unthinkable. In any case, Ainsworth's legend of Black Bess was rehashed in works, for example, "Dark Bess or the Knight of the Road", a 254-section penny shocking distributed in 1867Ã¢ÂÂ 68. In these stories, Turpin was the legend, joined by his trusty partners Claude Duval, Tom King, and Jack Rann. These stories, which changed Turpin from a scarred hooligan and killer into "an honorable man of the street [and] a defender of the feeble", pursued a famous social custom of romanticizing English offenders. This training is reflected in the anthems expounded on Turpin, the most punctual of which, "Dick Turpin", would seem to have been distributed in 1737. Later ditties displayed Turpin as an eighteenth century Robin Hood figure: "Turpin was gotten and his preliminary was passed, and for a diversion chicken he kicked the bucket finally. Five hundred pounds he gave so free, all to Jack Ketch as a little heritage."
