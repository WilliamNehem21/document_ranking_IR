On 26 December "New Jersey" returned to the gunline, taking up station off Tuy HÃ²a in support of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 47th Regiment.

Throughout January and into February "New Jersey" operated in support of the Marines. On 10 February the battleship left to reinforce the Korean 2nd Marine Brigade operating near Da Nang. The battleship's target was a suspected subterranean staging area for a Viet Cong regiment. "New Jersey"s big guns went to work on the complex, firing 16Â inch shells into tunnels and bunkers to aid the ground troops. On 14 February the battleship steamed south of the DMZ to provide support for the 3rd Marine Division, in the process destroying an anti-aircraft site with her big guns. The next day "New Jersey" fired on an enemy rocket site northeast of Con Thien, destroying the facility, then trained her guns on known Communist positions to harass PAVN forces. On 22 February "New Jersey" responded to an urgent request for fire support from the besieged Oceanview observation post near the DMZ. For the next six hours "New Jersey" fired her guns, ultimately repelling the attacking force.
