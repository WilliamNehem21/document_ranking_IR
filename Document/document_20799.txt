Three star systems have been discovered to have exoplanets. HD 111232 is a yellow main-sequence star around 78% as massive as the Sun around 95Â light-years distant. It has a planet (HD 111232 b) around 6.8Â times the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period around 1143 days. HD 112410 is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located around 439Â light-years distant. With around 1.54Â times the mass of our Sun, it is cooling and expanding along the red-giant branch, having left the main sequence after exhausting its core supply of hydrogen fuel. It has a substellar companion calculated to have a mass 9.2Â times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 124.6Â days at a distance around 0.57 AU. Yet another member of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, HD 100546 is a young, blue-white Herbig Ae/Be star of spectral type B9V that has yet to settle on the main sequenceâthe closest of these stars to Earth around 320Â light-years distant. It is surrounded by a circumstellar debris disk from a distance of 0.2 to 4Â AU, and again from 13Â AU out to a few hundred AU, with evidence for a protoplanet forming at a distance around 47Â AU. A gap exists between 4 and 13Â AU, which appears to contain a large planet around 20Â times the mass of Jupiter, although further examination of the disk profile indicates it might be a more massive object such as a brown dwarf or more than one planet. LP 145-141 is a white dwarf located 15Â light-years distantâthe fourth-closest to the Solar System. It is considered a good candidate to look for Jupiter-like planets, on account if its proximity and mass.
