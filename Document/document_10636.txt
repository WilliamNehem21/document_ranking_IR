The upper incisors are opisthodont (with the cutting surface arranged in reverse) and have orange to yellow finish. The upper molar lines are either practically parallel or marginally united with one another toward the front. "Holochilus" and "Lundomys" are the main different oryzomyines with non-parallel molar lines. The valleys between the cusps of the upper molars reaching out from the inward and external sides cover marginally over the midlines of the teeth. The molars are high-cusped, nearly hypsodont. On M1, the anterocone (the front cusp) is isolated into two cuspules on the lingual (inward, towards the tongue) and labial (external, towards the lips) sides of the teeth. The mesoloph, a peak close to the center of the labial side of the tooth, is long and very much created on every one of the three upper molars. On the lower molars (m1 to m3), the cusps on the labial side are found marginally before their lingual partners. The anteroconid, the front cusp on the m1, is separated in two. The m1, m2, and as a rule m3 have a mesolophid, a peak relating to the mesoloph yet situated on the lingual side. Every one of the lower molars has two roots.
