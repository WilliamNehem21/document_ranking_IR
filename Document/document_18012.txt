Reviewing the album for "The Guardian", Caroline Sullivan called it flawlessly produced and performed by Saadiq, while "Rolling Stone" magazine's Will Hermes said the record showcased an original take on classic Northern soul. Andy Gill of "The Independent" wrote that it was one of 2008's most captivating albums because "few have managed to retro-fabricate that classic sound so accurately, nor in as many subtle variations" like Saadiq. AllMusic's Andy Kellman stated, "Here's where a modern master, backed by living and breathing session musicians ... masters the masters with startling accuracy." In "The Observer", Kitty Empire found the album "both feather-light and substantial" because of how, "unlike most modern records, Saadiq's tunes gather weight the deeper in you go". Writing for "MSN Music", Christgau said Saadiq sang with Smokey Robinson's detailed sentimentality and Dennis Edwards' amenable personality. He expanded on his praise in "Slate", finding that, while "painstakingly retro", Saadiq's achievement "isn't replicating the Motown Sound but writing consistently charming and catchy songs in that style". "Q" was more critical, finding the record devoid of a "fresh approach" to elevate it from a simple homage. According to "PopMatters" writer Christian John Wikane, "one's total enjoyment of the album depends on their appreciation of classic soul and R&B and whether such appreciation is contingent on absolute authenticity."
