Numerous researchers have concentrated on Isis' name in attempting to decide her starting points. Her Egyptian name was "ÃªÂÂ£st", which progressed toward becoming ("ÃÂse") in the Coptic type of Egyptian, "Wusa" in the Meroitic language of Nubia, and Ã¡Â¼Â¾ÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂ ("Isis"; ), on which her advanced name is based, in Greek. The hieroglyphic composition of her name consolidates the sign for a position of authority, which Isis likewise wears on her head as an indication of her character. The image fills in as a phonogram, spelling the "st" sounds in her name, yet it might have additionally spoken to a connection with genuine positions of royalty. The Egyptian expression for a position of royalty was likewise "st" and may have imparted a typical historical background to Isis' name. Along these lines, the Egyptologist Kurt Sethe recommended she was initially a representation of positions of royalty. Henri Frankfort concurred, trusting that the position of authority was viewed as the lord's mom, and hence a goddess, due to its capacity to make a man into a ruler. Different researchers, for example, JÃÂ¼rgen Osing and Klaus P. Kuhlmann, have questioned this translation, as a result of dissimilarities between Isis' name and the word for a position of royalty or an absence of proof that the royal position was ever revered.
