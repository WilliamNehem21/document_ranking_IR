RenÃÂ© Leibowitz, a defender of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, distributed a handout portraying Sibelius as "the most exceedingly bad arranger on the planet"; others expelled him as superfluous in what was seen for a period as a compelling development towards atonality. This atmosphere decreased interest about the presence of material from a conceivable Sibelius Eighth, until late in the twentieth century, when basic enthusiasm for the writer resuscitated. In 1995 KilpelÃÂ¤inen, who had distributed a review of the Sibelius original copies held in the Helsinki University Library, composed that all that could be associated with the Eighth Symphony were a solitary page from a draft score and the ringed tune piece stamped "VIII" inside the Seventh Symphony portrays. He included, be that as it may, that the library contained further Sibelius draws from the late 1920s and mid 1930s, some of which are much the same as the ringed section and which could possibly have been proposed for the Eighth Symphony. KilpelÃÂ¤inen additionally uncovered that "[j]ust as of late different archives have become known which nobody imagined even existed. Possibly there are still a few pieces of information to the eighth Symphony covered up away and simply sitting tight for some researcher to find them."
