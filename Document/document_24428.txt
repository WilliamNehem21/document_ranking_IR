Having appeared in six episodes of the third season and the first two of the fourth season, Blake Bashoff auditioned for and won the part of Moritz Stiefel in the Broadway musical "Spring Awakening". He warned Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse that he would be unable to shoot "Lost" for at least six months beginning in December 2007, as he rehearsed for and performed in the production. Being "big fans" of the musical and congratulating Bashoff on what they thought was an "amazing opportunity," they brainstormed ideas with the other writers to write him out of the story while they still had him at their disposal. Having decided some time ago that Karl would eventually die, they pinpointed the episode. The cliffhanger of "Meet Kevin Johnson" sees Karl shot dead by unseen killers in the jungle. Two episodes later, the character Miles Straume (Ken Leung) finds Karl partially buried in the jungle dirt, but this corpse is portrayed by a body double and not Bashoff. According to Bashoff, the writers hope that he can return to "Lost" at some point to "serve a cool purpose like [Tom does in 'Meet Kevin Johnson']." In regard to his experience with "Lost", Bashoff recounted that "I love the show. [The cast]'s a great group â¦ and â¦ you get to shoot in paradise"; however, he wished that he had learned more about Karl's backstory.
