England won the First Test at Lord's by 6Â wickets, Trumble taking one wicket in each innings. The Second Test at Old Trafford was more closely fought. Despite K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring a "marvellous" 154 and Tom Richardson "bowling in his finest form" the Australians managed to hold on for a 3Â wicket victory. The Australians required 125Â runs to win in their second innings and were expected to make this target easily. Richardson's skilful bowling however saw Trumble and Kelly batting together with only 3Â wickets in hand but with 25Â runs still to make. Against excellent bowling and in a tense atmosphere, the pair managed to bat Australia home with the last runs taking an hour to score, mainly in singles. Trumble made 17Â not out to follow his 24Â runs in the first innings and his 4Â wickets. With the series tied at one Test apiece, the Third and final Test was played at The Oval in London. On a pitch damaged by rain, the English batted first and were dismissed for 145. Trumble took 6Â wickets for 59Â runs, including a 9-over spell of 5Â wickets for 10Â runs. England fought back to bowl the Australians out for 119. In turn, the Australians restricted England to 84Â runs with Trumble taking 6Â wickets for 30, to leave Australia requiring 111Â runs in their second innings to win the match. Bobby Peel and Jack Hearne combined to bowl Australia out for 44Â runs to win the Test by 66Â runs and retain the Ashes for England . In the three Tests, Trumble took 18Â wickets at an average of 18.83Â runs per wicket.
