Saadiq recorded generally at Blakeslee Recording Company; Additional sessions occurred at Harmonie Park Studios in Detroit and The Music Shed Studios in New Orleans. While recording, he submerged himself in a composite character of great soul vocalists from recordings he viewed, including Al Green, Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Four Tops, and the Temptations. He recorded his vocals with just Brungardt present in the studio, an inclination he felt kept him from "searching for answers from someone who may not so much know". Saadiq said he tended to "record total takes, and if something isn't exactly right yet it has a vibe that I realize I can never under any circumstance catch again, I'll abandon it, regardless of whether it's level. That is to say, there are level parts on my record, since it's not about flawlessness, it's about the spirit." He recorded foundation vocals for all melodies. Saadiq played a large portion of the instruments, including drums, guitar, piano, sitar, and low register guitar, his instrument of decision all through his vocation. He saw the bass playing of James Jamerson as an essential piece of Motown chronicles, refering to it as the motivation for his own bass sound on the collection.
