As verified by antiquarian Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this situation at once in which enrollment and maintenance in the Navy especially falled behind targets. McNicoll was furthermore delegated as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund amid this period. Finishing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and lifted his standard on board , the lead of the RAN. The Australian government had assigned the job of the RAN to be fundamentally one of hostile to submarine fighting, a stance which McNicoll thought impulsive. McNicoll contended that surface and air weapons represented a risk equivalent to that of submarines toward vessels in present day maritime fighting. All things considered, he crusaded for a contemporary plane carrying warship to supplant that of HMAS "Melbourne". The Army and Air Force restricted McNicoll's position, and the administration eventually presumed that there was no vital necessity for another transporter in light of understandings contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In any occasion, McNicoll encountered an especially requesting residency as Fleet Commander since the RAN was presently a total update of its request of fight and, as a result, he needed to deal with the presentation and organization into administration of six Ton-class minesweepers obtained from the Royal Navy, alongside the main group of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernized above water bolster capacities. Moreover, McNicoll was accused of the obligation of guaranteeing Australian maritime responsibilities to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met.
