In the eighteenth and nineteenth hundreds of years history specialists described Isabeau as "a two-faced, extravagant, nosy, conspiring, and prodigal ruler", ignoring her political accomplishments and impact. A famous book composed by Louise de Karalio (1758Ã¢ÂÂ 1822) about the "terrible" French rulers preceding Marie Antoinette is, as per Adams, where "Isabeau's dark legend achieves its full articulation in a fierce assault on the French sovereignty when all is said in done and rulers specifically." Karalio expressed: "Isabeau was raised by the wraths to realize the ruin of the state and to pitch it to its adversaries; Isabeau of Bavaria showed up, and her marriage, celebrated in Amiens on 17 July 1385, would be viewed as the most alarming crossroads in our history". Isabeau was painted as OrlÃÂ©ans' enthusiastic sweetheart, and the motivation for the Marquis de Sade's unpublished 1813 novel "Histoire emit d'Isabelle de Baviere, reine de France", about which Adams expresses, "presenting the ruler to his belief system of courage, [the Marquis de Sade] gives her greed a cold and figuring violenceÃÂ ... a lady who cautiously deals with her covetousness for greatest delight." She proceeds to state that de Sade confessed to "being splendidly mindful that the charges against the ruler are without ground."
