The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service shortly thereafter in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser Friedrich III" and her sisters. The ship had her crew reduced on 6 March in Kiel, where she was assigned as a harbor defense ship. The V Squadron staff came aboard the ship on 25 April, until Begas, by now promoted to "Konteradmiral", left for . On 20 November, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned for the last time. "Kaiser Friedrich III" was disarmed and used as a floating prison stationed in Kiel after 1916. The guns taken from "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the rest of the ships of her class were emplaced in coastal batteries; eight guns were placed on the mole outside Libau and four each were placed on the islands of Norderney and Sylt. The following year, the ship was moved to Flensburg, where she was used as a barracks; later that year she was again moved to SwinemÃ¼nde. "Kaiser Friedrich III" was stricken from the navy list on 6 December 1919 and subsequently sold to a ship breaking firm based in Berlin. The ship was ultimately broken up at Kiel-Nordmole in 1920. Her bow ornament ("bugzier") is on display at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.
