After creation started in February 2006 and happened simultaneously with continuous important photography. Supervisor Olivier Wicki drove after creation, working intimately with Owens; the two had recently teamed up on the "First of the Species" music video. More than 100 hours of film were shot, highlighting exhibitions of 26 unique tunes. To engage a standard group of onlookers, 14 tracks were picked for the finished product, including 12 of U2's singles and two non-singles from "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb", the collection that the Vertigo Tour bolstered. While choosing tunes for the undertaking, the team needed to guarantee that the exhibitions of each track fit with each other. U2 needed to incorporate "Strange Ways" and "Until the End of the World", however they were forgotten since Owens felt that those melodies were strange with the remainder of the film. She expressed that the fundamental focal point of the film depended on U2's association with each other and with their gathering of people, and the test of choosing the melodies was to make a story inside the band's execution. In spite of the fact that "City of Blinding Lights" opened most shows on the visit, "Vertigo" was chosen as the opening melody of "U2 3D". Different tracks that were performed at a large portion of the taped shows that did not influence the polished product to incorporate "Height", "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For", "Unique of the Species", and "Zoo Station". "With or Without You" was picked as the last melody before the end credits, in spite of the fact that it shut just a single show on the visit.
