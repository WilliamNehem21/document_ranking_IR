Before the finish of 1997, "Be Here Now" had sold eight million units around the world. Be that as it may, the business volume was generally picked up in the initial two weeks of discharge, and once the collection was discharged to UK radio stations the turnover decreased. Purchasers understood that the collection was not another "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?", and by 1999, "Tune Maker" announced that it was the collection most sold to second-hand record stores. In the 2003 John Dower-coordinated narrative "", music pundit Jon Savage pinpointed "Be Here Now" as the minute where the Britpop development finished. Savage said that while the collection "isn't the incredible fiasco that everyone says", he noticed that "[i]t should be the enormous, huge triumphal record" of the period. "Q" communicated comparative notions, stating, "So hugely was "Here Now" miss the mark concerning desires that it slaughtered Britpop and introduced a time of progressively driven, less exaggerated music". "Irish Times" writer Brian Boyd stated: "Enlarged and over-warmed (much like the band themselves at the time), the collection has all that shocking braggadocio that is so normal for a cocaine client." Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland conceded, "the way that nothing could have satisfied the fevered desires that encompassed its discharge doesn't change the certainties. The third Oasis collection is a noisy, blundering clamor implying nothing."
