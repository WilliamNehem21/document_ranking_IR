In the wake of Chancellorsville, papers piled disdain on the German regiments, accusing the 68th and the others for the annihilation. The XI Corps experienced low assurance, and a few officers surrendered their payments, including Lt. Col. Carl Vogel and five others from the 68th. The Army of the Potomac pulled over from the Rappahannock, and was soon progressing as the Army of Northern Virginia slipped past and walked north toward Pennsylvania. Driven by still another new administrator, Maj. Gen. George Meade, the Union armed force pursued the Confederates north. The 68th, presently with 267 present for obligation, had been moved to the XI Corps' first Brigade under Brig. Gen. Leopold von Gilsa when the Army of the Potomac arranged to meet the dissidents at the Battle of Gettysburg. The XI Corps was among the first to touch base on the scene on July 1, 1863. Schurz's unit arrived first, and he requested them to take up cautious positions north of the town. The other two divisions touched base straightaway, and Howard showed them to oppose the agitator surge he knew was just around the corner. The scene was generally without highlights that would help in resistance, however Gilsa's men had the capacity to settle in on one low ascent, Blocher's Knoll. The 68th was sent forward to encounter, alongside the 54th New York and part of the 153rd New York, and were the first to be assaulted and expelled from their positions when Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's Confederate division entered numbers and outmaneuvered them. The military withdrew south of the town, however Howard, subsequent to belligerence with Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock over who was in direction in Meade's nonappearance, aroused the troops there and requested them to dig in.
