Numerous melodic craftsmen have made references to Jason Voorhees. Motivated by his very own involvement, Ari Lehman established a band called FIRSTJASON. Lehman's band is named frightfulness punk, and is impacted by the hints of the Dead Kennedys and The Misfits. The band's name pays respect to Lehman's depiction of Jason Voorhees in the first "Friday the thirteenth". One of the band's tunes is entitled "Jason is Watching". In 1986, harmonizing with the arrival of "Jason Lives", Alice Cooper discharged "He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)" from his collection "Constrictor". The melody was composed to "flag Jason's huge return" to the film, as he had been essentially missing in the past film. Rapper Eminem has referenced Jason in a few of his tunes. The tune "Criminal", from the collection "The Marshall Mathers LP", makes reference to Jason explicitly, while melodies "Amityville" and "Off the Wall"Ã¢ÂÂ the last highlighted individual rapper RedmanÃ¢ÂÂcontain Harry Manfredini's music "ki, ki, ki ... mama, mama, mama" from the film arrangement. Eminem in some cases wears a hockey cover amid shows. Other rap craftsmen that have referenced Jason incorporate Tupac Shakur, Dr. Dre, LL Cool J, and Insane Clown Posse. In 1989, Puerto Rican rapper Vico C had a tune titled "Viernes 13" which included Jason in Puerto Rico. The melody was so well known in the island that Vico C composed a second part titled "Viernes 13, Parte II". VH1 issued an ad for their Vogue Fashion Awards which was named "Friday the twentieth", and included Jason's cover made out of rhinestone.
