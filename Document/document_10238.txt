Amid a term as praetor in Iberia, Pompey's contemporary Julius Caesar of the Roman Julii faction vanquished the Calaici and Lusitani in fight. Following a consular term, he was then designated to a five-year term as Proconsular Governor of Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (the bank of Dalmatia). Not content with an inert governorship, Caesar endeavored to discover motivation to attack Gaul, which would give him the emotional military achievement he looked for. To this end he worked up well known bad dreams of the primary sack of Rome by the Gauls and the later apparition of the Cimbri and Teutones. At the point when the Helvetii and Tigurini clans started to move on a course that would take them close (not into) the Roman territory of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the scarcely adequate reason he required for his Gallic Wars, battled between 58 BC and 49 BC. In the wake of butchering the Helvetii clan, Caesar indicted a "long, severe and expensive" crusade against different clans over the expansiveness of Gaul, a considerable lot of whom had battled nearby Rome against their shared adversary the Helvetii, and added their domain to that of Rome. Albeit "wild and capable" the Gauls were impeded by inner disunity and fell in a progression of fights through the span of 10 years.
