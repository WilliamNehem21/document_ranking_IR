After MalcolmÂ X's death in 1965, ClarenceÂ 13X mourned his loss but did not attend his funeral. In May 1965, while visiting the site of Mosque No.Â 7, then closed, ClarenceÂ 13X and several of his companions were told to leave by a police officer. They left, began to vandalize nearby buildings, and blocked the street near the former headquarters of Muslim Mosque, Inc. More police arrived and subdued ClarenceÂ 13X after an altercation, bringing him into custody with several of his followers. After being arrested, he refused to identify himself and was charged with assault and drug possession. About 60 of his followers attended his arraignment, but were removed from the court after shouting "Peace". ClarenceÂ 13X proclaimed his innocence and announced his intent to defend himself in court. He told the judge that he was Allah, and that the city would face grave judgment if he were not released. The judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at $9,500. At a court date in June, about 50Â Five Percenters protested outside the court; afterwards, several were arrested on charges of making Molotov cocktails. In July, the court sent ClarenceÂ 13X to Bellevue Hospital Center for a psychiatric examination. While in the hospital, he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window. Under his instructions, Five Percenters resisted future NOI leader Louis Farrakhan's attempts to convert them.
