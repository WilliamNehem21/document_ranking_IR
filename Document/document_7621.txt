Back on Harvest, Johnson and his squad of civilian army are vigorously out-kept an eye on and out-gunned. Maccabeus is requested to "glass" the planet from space, yet resists and dispatches a ground strike with an end goal to recoup the "relics". The human volunteer army endeavors to keep the outsiders occupied while emptying the regular people from the planet; this requires Johnson and his group to load up an orbital stage constrained by Dadab and his troops. Tartarus challenges Maccabeus for control of the Jiralhanae pack, executing his uncle and turning into the following head. Lighter than Some is executed by Tartarus' troops, and Dadab heads out to murder those he accepts are capable. As his weapon just has one increasingly shot left, Dadab looks for Tartarus, who is battling Johnson. Dadab annihilates Tartarus' shield, and the rankled Brute murders the elder. Wallace Jenkins, a youthful local army part that had lost his family in the fight, endeavors to complete Tartarus off, however the outsider getaways. The human regular folks and overcomers of Harvest effectively empty earth on several vessels, while on "High Charity", the Minister of Fortitude, Tranquility, and The Philologist become the new Prophet Hierarchs. They take the names Truth, Regret, and Mercy, announcing another age for the Covenant has started, and that the people must be demolished for their violations.
