The presence of numerous "Mahasatikals" (or "Mastikal" â hero stones for a woman who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty. Ritual death by "sallekhana" and by "jalasamadhi" (drowning in water) were also practiced. Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds. Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces ("honnasara" and "honnagala sara"), bracelets ("Kaduga") and wristlets ("Kaftkina"). Women wore a nose jewel ("bottu"), nose ring ("mugutti"), bangles ("bale" or "kankana") and various types of necklaces ("honna gante sara" and "kati sutra"). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights and ram fights. There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as "agraharas", "ghatikas", "brahmapura" or "matha". Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Talagunda, Aihole, Arasikere and other places.
