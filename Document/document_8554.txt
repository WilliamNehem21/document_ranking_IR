In mid 1938, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (, VVKJ) submitted a request with Hawker Aircraft for twelve Hawker Hurricane Mk I contenders, the primary outside buy of the flying machine. The British government was eager to supply abundance Hurricanes to countries that were probably going to restrict German extension on the grounds that the rate of creation of the airplane somewhat surpassed the ability of the RAF to present it at the time. The first of these flying machine bound for Yugoslav administration was No. 205 (some time ago L1751), which was flown from the United Kingdom to Belgrade through France and Italy, touching base on 15 December 1938. The main cluster of airplane were fitted with a Rolls-Royce Merlin II motor driving a two-sharp edge wooden propeller. The underlying request was trailed by a second request of twelve (N2718Ã¢ÂÂ N2729), which were fitted with Merlin III motors driving a three-edge variable-pitch propeller, and were conveyed in February and March 1940. In the meantime, the Yugoslav government connected to assemble progressively under permit. When the arrangements were effectively finished up, creation lines were built up at the RogoÃÂ¾arski plant in Belgrade and the Zmaj manufacturing plant in adjacent Zemun. The two plants were relied upon to construct forty and sixty of the air ship separately, at a rate of twelve every month. Of the privately assembled airplane, just twenty were finished by Zmaj; the RogoÃÂ¾arski plant did not deliver any. A sum of 44 flying machine were put into administration with the VVKJ.
