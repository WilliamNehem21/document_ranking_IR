In 1968, the Army Small Arms Program developed plans for a new 5.56Â mm caliber LMG, though no funds were allocated (5.56Â mm ammunition was viewed as underpowered by many in the armed forces). Studies of improved 5.56Â mm ammunition, with better performance characteristics, began. The earliest reference to studies of other caliber cartridges for the LMG did not appear until 1969. In July 1970, the U.S. Army finally approved development of an LMG, with no specified caliber. At this time, the nomenclature "Squad Automatic Weapon" (SAW) was introduced. Actual design of alternative cartridges for the LMG did not begin until July 1971. A month later, Frankford Arsenal decided on two cartridge designs for the new LMG: a 6Â mm cartridge and a new 5.56Â mm cartridge with a much larger case. Neither design was finalized by March 1972, when the Army published the specifications document for the planned SAW. The 6Â mm cartridge design was eventually approved in May that year. Prior to July 1972, SAW development contracts were awarded to Maremont, Philco Ford, and the Rodman Laboratory at Rock Island Arsenal. These companies produced designs with Army designations XM233, XM234 and XM235 respectivelyâX denoting "experimental". Designs were required to have a weight of less than 9.07Â kg (20Â lb) including 200 rounds of ammunition, and a range of at least 800Â meters (2,600Â ft).
