Clark got another call from General Shelton in July 1999 in which he was informed that Secretary Cohen needed Clark to leave his direction in April 2000, under three years after he expected the post. Clark was amazed by this, since he trusted SACEURs were relied upon to serve somewhere around three years. Clark was informed this was essential since General Joseph Ralston was leaving his post as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would require another 4-star direction inside 60 days or he would be compelled to resign. Ralston was not going to be selected Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff because of an extramarital undertaking from before, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this clarification "didn't wash"; he trusted the legitimate issues did not really ban him from a full term. Clinton marked on to Ralston's reassignment, in spite of the fact that David Halberstam composed that the president and Madeleine Albright were rankled at Clark's treatment. Clark invested the rest of his energy as SACEUR directing peacekeeper powers and, without another order to take, was constrained into retirement from the military on May 2, 2000.
