The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an electromechanical simple PC whose work was to constantly compute the weapon's bearing and height, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), to hit a future position of the objective. It did this via consequently accepting data from the executive (LOS), the FC Radar (run), the ship's gyrocompass (genuine ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative breeze speed and bearing). Likewise, before the surface activity began, the FTs made manual contributions for the normal introductory speed of the shots discharged out of the battery's weapon barrels, and air thickness. With this data, the Rangekeeper determined the relative movement between "Possess SHIP" and "TARGET". It at that point could figure a counterbalance edge and change of range between the objective's present position (LOS) and future position toward the finish of the shot's season of flight. To this bearing and range counterbalance, it included remedies for gravity, wind, Magnus impact of the turning shot, earth's ebb and flow, and coriolis impact. The outcome was the turret's bearing and height orders (LOF). Amid the surface activity, range and redirection Spots and target elevation (not zero amid Gun Fire Support) were physically entered.
