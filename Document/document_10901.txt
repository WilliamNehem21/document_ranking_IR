Stemmle compared the diversion's wordy advancement to a multi stage sprint, and the improvement of a full amusement, for example, "Break from Monkey Island", to a "long distance race". This creation strategy implied that specific angles, for example, the amusement's illustrations, were taken a shot at until the discharge due date. Every scene took around four months to finish. Just a couple of ecological assets were reused between scenes; while Telltale Games had fabricated past recreations, for example, "Sam and Max Save the World" and "Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures" around one lot of areas, utilizing the heroes' homes and close-by lanes reliably in every scene, the designers did without such focal center points and "safe places" in "Stories of Monkey Island", rather having every scene get off to another essential area, just once in a while returning to past areas. In any case, reusable skeletons and livelinesss were produced for the supporting cast, including conventional body types that could be outwardly changed to suit each character. While four of these were made, estimate limitations brought about just two being incorporated into the last diversion. By the amusement's third scene, Telltale ended up unsatisfied with this framework, and started differentiating facial highlights, and furnishing supporting characters with interesting outlines and livelinesss.
