"Cold Feet" started its first arrangement with the six primary cast individualsÃ¢ÂÂJames Nesbitt, Helen Baxendale, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert BathurstÃ¢ÂÂwho had showed up in the pilot. Thomson's character Pete Gifford was composed explicitly for him after his execution in "The Perfect Match" established a positive connection on Christine Langan. Norris initially tried out for the piece of Rachel however was given a role as Karen on the grounds that the job fit her social class. Nesbitt got a tryout through a common companion of pilot chief Declan Lowney, and read the part in his characteristic highlight since he was quick to play a Northern Irish character in a contemporary dramatization detached to The Troubles. Baxendale was best known for her job in "Heart failure" and was reluctant to star as Rachel since she didn't trust she could perform parody. Bathurst was known to Langan for his featuring job in "Kidding Apart". Ripley figured she would try out for the piece of Rachel, and needed to put on an emphasize for her job as common Mancunian Jenny. At the point when the fourth arrangement was authorized, Ripley declared that she was leaving the show to expand her vocation choices. Kimberley Joseph was given a role as Jo Ellison, a substitution character who stayed on screen until "Cold Feet"s end. Bullen shows up; he plays a neighbor and a spouse in the principal arrangement and a laborer in the third.
