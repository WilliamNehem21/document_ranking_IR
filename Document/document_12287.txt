John's size and power empowered him to make long reaches and dangerous thrust moves that were totally out of my range. I, then again, frequently discovered little middle holds that John couldn't envision grippingÃÂ ... Short or tall, man or lady, the stone is a target medium that is similarly open for translation by all."
