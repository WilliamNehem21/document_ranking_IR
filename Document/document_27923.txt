Although there is no evidence of lower or middle Paleolithic settlements in Tripura, Upper Paleolithic tools made of fossil wood have been found in the Haora and Khowai valleys. The Indian epic, the "Mahabharata"; ancient religious texts, the "Puranas"; and the Edicts of AshokaÂ â stone pillar inscriptions of the emperor Ashoka dating from the third century BCEÂ â all mention Tripura. An ancient name of Tripura is "Kirat Desh" (English: "The land of Kirat"), probably referring to the Kirata Kingdoms or the more generic term Kirata. However, it is unclear whether the extent of modern Tripura is coterminous with "Kirat Desh". The region was under the rule of the Twipra Kingdom for centuries, although when this dates from is not documented. The "Rajmala", a chronicle of Tripuri kings which was first written in the 15th century, provides a list of 179 kings, from antiquity up to Krishna Kishore Manikya (1830â1850), but the reliability of the "Rajmala" has been doubted.
The boundaries of the kingdom changed over the centuries. At various times, the borders reached south to the jungles of the Sundarbans on the Bay of Bengal; east to Burma; and north to the boundary of the Kamarupa kingdom in Assam. There were several Muslim invasions of the region from the 13th century onward, which culminated in Mughal dominance of the plains of the kingdom in 1733, although their rule never extended to the hill regions. The Mughals had influence over the appointment of the Tripuri kings.
