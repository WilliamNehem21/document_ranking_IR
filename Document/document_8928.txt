At the Botanic Garden he built up an exceptional enthusiasm for "Vinca", "Epimedium", "Hosta" and "Symphytum", all of which he distributed monographs on. A progression of plant distributions pursued, beginning with another types of "Allium" ("A. farreri" Stearn, 1930). Stearn more than once came back to the family "Allium", and was viewed as a world master on it; numerous species bear his name. 1930 would likewise observe his first bibliographic work, on the botanist Reginald Farrer, whom he named "Allium farreri" after, and furthermore portrayed "Rosa farreri" (1933) and different species named after Farrer. It was while he was accumulating Farrer's works in 1930 that he went over the last's work, "The English Rock-Garden" (1919) and its record of Barren-worts ("Epimedium"), and aroused a lifetime enthusiasm for the class. From 1932, he delivered a progression of papers on this family, contemplating it at Cambridge, Kew and Paris. It wound up one of the genera which he was best known, and numerous types of which currently bear his name. "Epimedium" and the related forest enduring "Vancouveria" (Berberidaceae) would be the subject of his first monograph (1938) and were genera to which he would return toward an amazing finish. At the time the scientific categorization of this family was exceptionally befuddled, and with the assistance of the Cambridge Herbarium he got examples from all over Europe to create an exhaustive monograph. The work was thorough to the point that it was erroneously viewed as a doctoral proposition by different botanists. He additionally started a progression of commitments to the list of the Herbarium, together with Gilmour and Tutin.
