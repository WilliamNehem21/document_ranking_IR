Abruptly the fountain of liquid magma emits. The seekers attempt to escape, however end up caught on the opposite side of the channel. The genuine Scuzzlebutt then shows up, and Jimbo apologizes to the young men for their apparently impending passings, just before understanding that Scuzzlebutt is weaving a wicker bin to convey the chasing gathering to wellbeing. The magma at that point moves through the channel similarly as Randy arranged, yet because of an error he made, the channel drives the magma to Denver, pulverizing it. Be that as it may, in a misinformed endeavor to demonstrate he can murder something and inspire his uncle, Stan slaughters Scuzzlebutt. Jimbo is not exactly awed, disclosing to Stan that "a few things you do slaughter and some you don't". Ned states that he presently comprehends the indiscretion of firearms and drops his rifle, which coincidentally shoot, murdering Kenny. Stan does not comprehend, since Jimbo attempted to execute Scuzzlebutt before and different creatures and needed to inspire Jimbo like Kenny did, Jimbo brings up that Kenny is dead and that Stan will dependably be Jimbo's nephew. At long last, the young men choose that chasing is inept and befuddling, hence chose to return home to watch kid's shows.
