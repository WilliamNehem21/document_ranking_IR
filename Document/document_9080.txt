"Elasmosaurus" had four sacral vertebrae (the melded vertebrae that structure the sacrum associated with the pelvis), a number commonplace of elasmosaurids. The transverse procedures here were short, and the rib aspects expanded in size from the first to the fourth sacral vertebra. An edge kept running along the highest point of these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were adjusted, and bore sets of nutritive foramina, isolated by low edges. The principal tail (or caudal) vertebra could be recognized by the previous sacral vertebra by having littler rib features, and by being situated in the lower half of the centrum. These vertebrae were practically roundabout fit as a fiddle, and the initial two bore a limited bottom amidst the upper side. The rib aspects of the tail vertebrae were situated on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape increased and more extensive from the third vertebra and onwards, however decreased from the fourteenth vertebra. Here, the pre-zygapophyses likewise come to over the dimension of the centra for a large portion of their length, while the post-zygapophyses came to over this dimension significantly their length. The lower some portion of the centra were adjusted from the first to the third tail vertebrae, however inward from the fourth to the eighteenth. The typical number of trail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were melded into a structure like the pygostyle of winged creatures, it is conceivable this upheld a tail-balance, however the shape it would have had is obscure.
