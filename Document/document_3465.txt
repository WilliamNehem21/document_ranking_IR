Since the finish of this alleged brilliant time of robbery, Teach and his adventures have turned into the stuff of legend, motivating books, films and even event congregation rides. Quite a bit of what is thought about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson's "A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates", distributed in Britain in 1724. A perceived specialist on the privateers of his time, Johnson's depictions of such figures as Anne Bonny and Mary Read were for a considerable length of time required perusing for those keen regarding the matter. Perusers were titillated by his accounts and a second version was immediately distributed, however creator Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson's entrance on Blackbeard was "shaded a little to make a progressively shocking story." "A General Historie", however, is commonly viewed as a dependable source. Johnson may have been an expected false name. As Johnson's records have been supported in close to home and authority dispatches, Lee (1974) thinks about that whoever he was, he had some entrance to official correspondence. Konstam conjectures further, proposing that Johnson may have been the English dramatist Charles Johnson, the British distributer Charles Rivington, or the essayist Daniel Defoe. In his 1951 work "The Great Days of Piracy", creator George Woodbury composed that Johnson is "clearly a nom de plume", "one can't resist presuming that he may have been a privateer himself."
