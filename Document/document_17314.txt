LutosÅawski's parents were both born into the Polish landed nobility. His family owned estates in the area of Drozdowo. His father JÃ³zef was involved in the Polish National Democratic Party (""Endecja""), and the LutosÅawski family became intimate with its founder, Roman Dmowski (Witold LutosÅawski's middle name was Roman). JÃ³zef LutosÅawski studied in ZÃ¼rich, where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became LutosÅawski's mother. JÃ³zef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the National-Democratic newspaper, "Goniec". He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman LutosÅawski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of World War I. In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, Prussian forces drove towards Warsaw. The LutosÅawskis travelled east to Moscow, where JÃ³zef remained politically active, organising Polish Legions ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which was divided according to the 1815 Congress of ViennaâWarsaw was part of Tsarist Russia). Dmowski's strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. However, in 1917, the February Revolution forced the Tsar to abdicate, and the October Revolution started a new Soviet government that made peace with Germany. JÃ³zef's activities were now in conflict with the Bolsheviks, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the LutosÅawskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in Butyrskaya prison in central Moscow, where Witoldâby then aged fiveâvisited his father. JÃ³zef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial.
