The planning of the upgrade ended up being foreboding as the Great Purge was spreading through the positions of the military and related enterprises. The first due date for consummation of configuration work by 15 October was missed, and an inadequate variant was displayed to the naval force's Shipbuilding Administration the following month. Various subtleties stayed to be worked out, including the last structure of the apparatus plant, the 152ÃÂ mm weapons and the 100ÃÂ mm firearm mounts. Meanwhile, broad and costly testing was led on the ship's body structure, deck defensive layer and torpedo security; 27 million rubles were spent on test work in 1938 alone. More than 100 models of the structure were tried in a ship demonstrate bowl to locate the best body structure and two one-tenth-scale dispatches were worked at Sevastopol to test the body's mobility. An old steamship was fitted with an imitation of the plan's reinforcement decks and tried against bombs, demonstrating that such arms would for the most part infiltrate both the upper and center decks before detonating on the defensively covered deck. The principle reinforcement deck was brought one deck up in result and a chip deck added underneath it to stop any bomb or shell pieces that may enter the defensive layer deck. The submerged assurance framework was tried on fifteen one-fifth scale models and two full-sized trial freight ships. These tests demonstrated that the torpedo belt arrangement of various bulkheads was better than the Pugliese arrangement of a vast cylinder loaded up with littler fixed cylinders, yet it was past the point where it is possible to join these test results into the plan as development was well in progress when they were finished in late 1939.
