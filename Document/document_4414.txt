Bruce and his siblings looked to enroll with regards to the Empire, however each of them three would serve in the British Army instead of the Australian Imperial Force. It was simpler to acquire officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a nearby relationship with (and for a considerable lot of them, extensive stretches of residency in) Great Britain. Bruce enrolled and got a commission as lieutenant on 7 February 1915 and was joined to the second Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in Egypt, which was then allocated to the British 29th Division. The 29th consequently joined activities in Turkey alongside Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir Ian Hamilton, officer of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF). First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill had contrived a procedure of catching the Dardanelles from Turkey to enable maritime access to Allied Russia. Anyway partnered maritime powers were unfit to verify entry through the tight straits, and the MEF under Hamilton formulated an arrangement to wrest control through land and/or water capable arrivals. This was the start of the now scandalous Gallipoli Campaign.
