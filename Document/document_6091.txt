On 4 March, DiÃ¡Â»Âm held an audit of the VNAF in focal Saigon. Vast groups rushed to the banks of the Saigon River to watch developments of VNAF air ship on ethereal procession, albeit ordinary regular citizens were not permitted inside a square of the presidential box, where DiÃ¡Â»Âm was joined by Nolting and General Paul D. Harkins, leader of the US military mission to Vietnam. The showcase included 29 of the airplane used to assault Independence Palace. DiÃ¡Â»Âm talked about the occasions of 27 February and noticed that he was "not ignorant" of the steady response of the different sections of society to "the absurd demonstration executed by some deceptive components" that had "endeavored to energize wicked inconveniences which would have benefitted just adversaries of the mother country". He said that the bombarding was "simply a detached activity off a couple of crazy tricksters to the country and to the general population, while the whole aviation based armed forces, similar to the remainder of the military, showed enduring faithfulness and a relentless soul of national solidarity by quickly and adequately countering the animosity of two crooks". He depicted that assault as "the detestable demonstration of mavericks" and called upon the VNAF "to remain constantly watchful, to get some distance from all enticements, to hate every single treacherous plan and to put the higher enthusiasm of the mother country above close to home intrigue". Accordingly, the VNAF boss Vinh, approached DiÃ¡Â»Âm for "pardoning and mercy" and gave a plaque engraved a goals from the VNAF denouncing assault.
