Jeffrey touched base in Australia in January 1942, and the next month quickly assumed responsibility for RAAF Bankstown, New South Wales. On 4ÃÂ March he turned into the debut administrator of No. 75 (Fighter) Squadron, working recently conveyed P-40 Kittyhawks. Framing the squadron in Townsville, Queensland, Jeffrey was in charge of preparing it for the safeguard of Port Moresby, which would wind up one of the essential early fights in the New Guinea battle. Despite the fact that it included two different veterans of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron in the Middle East, Flight Lieutenants "Old John" Jackson and Peter Turnbull, the greater part of the unit's pilots were untried, and Jeffrey had just nine days to impart in them fundamental standards of battle flying, gunnery and strategies. He gave over direction to Jackson on 19ÃÂ March, yet helped with shipping the Kittyhawks to Moresby two days after the fact, just to be shot upon by anxious enemy of air ship heavy armament specialists as he came in to arrive with Turnbull and two different pilots. Every one of the four flying machine were harmed, and Jeffrey came surprisingly close to death as a projectile flew past his skull and into the headrest of his seat. By 24ÃÂ March, No.ÃÂ 75 Squadron had effectively shot down a few Japanese thieves; having seen it "immediately settled as a battling unit", Jeffrey came back to Australia. He quickly started stirring up a second new Kittyhawk unit for administration in New Guinea, No. 76 (Fighter) Squadron. Situated in Townsville at this stage, it was along these lines directed by Peter Turnbull and joined No.ÃÂ 75 Squadron in the Battle of Milne Bay.
