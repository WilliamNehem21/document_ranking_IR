Amid the twentieth century, a few sauropods were allocated to Brachiosauridae, including "Astrodon", "Bothriospondylus", "Pelorosaurus", "Pleurocoelus", and "Ultrasauros". These assignments were regularly founded on wide similitudes as opposed to unambiguous synapomorphies, shared new attributes, and the greater part of these genera are at present viewed as questionable. In 1969, in an examination by R.F. Kingham, "Brachiosaurus altithorax", "B." "brancai" and "B." "atalaiensis", alongside numerous species currently doled out to other genera, were set in the sort "Astrodon", making an "Astrodon altithorax". Kingham's perspectives on brachiosaurid scientific classification have not been acknowledged by numerous different creators. Since the 1990s, PC based cladistic investigations take into consideration proposing nitty gritty speculations on the connections between species, by computing those trees that require the least developmental changes and in this way are the well on the way to be right. Such cladistic investigations have provided reason to feel ambiguous about the legitimacy of the Brachiosauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado recommended that they were an unnatural gathering into which a wide range of disconnected sauropods had been joined. In 1997, he distributed an investigation in which species customarily considered brachiosaurids were ensuing branches of the stem of a bigger gathering, the Titanosauriformes, and not their very own different part. This examination additionally brought up that "Brachiosaurus altithorax" and "B. brancai" did not have any synapomorphies, so that there was no proof to accept they were especially firmly related.
