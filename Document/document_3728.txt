McCain lay in state in the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix on August 29 (McCain's birthday), trailed by an administration at North Phoenix Baptist Church on August 30. His body headed out to Washington to lie in state in the rotunda of the United States Capitol on August 31, preceding an administration at the Washington National Cathedral on September 1. He was a "long lasting Episcopalian" who visited, yet did not join, a Southern Baptist church for somewhere around 17 years; dedication administrations were planned for the two categories. He was covered at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery on September 2, by his Naval Academy colleague and long lasting companion Admiral Charles R. Larson. Preceding his passing, McCain mentioned that previous Presidents George W. Shrub and Barack Obama convey commendations at his memorial service, and asked that both President Donald Trump and previous Alaska Governor and 2008 bad habit presidential chosen one Sarah Palin not go to any of the administrations. McCain himself arranged the burial service courses of action and chose his pallbearers for the administration in Washington, including previous Vice President Joe Biden, previous Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold, previous Secretary of Defense William Cohen, performer Warren Beatty, and Russian dissenter Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza.
