The second season of "Homicide" drew several comparisons to "NYPD Blue", an ABC police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received a large amount of publicity and better ratings than "Homicide", which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like "Homicide", "NYPD Blue" featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support "Homicide". Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to "NYPD Blue" because "Homicide" debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described "NYPD Blue" as "the television version of "Homicide"". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [is] to be mimicked by someone else. So, thank you, "NYPD Blue," because it's the knockoff of "Homicide."" "NYPD Blue" co-creator Steven Bochco took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish "Homicide" the best â and they should be so lucky as to do as well as we're doing right now."
