In 1946 Tippett organised at Morley the first British performance of Monteverdi's "Vespers", adding his own organ "Preludio" for the occasion. Tippett's compositions in the immediate postwar years included his First Symphony, performed under Sargent in November 1945, and the String Quartet No. 3, premiered in October 1946 by the Zorian Quartet. His main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, "The Midsummer Marriage". During the six years from 1946 he composed almost no other music, apart from the "Birthday Suite for Prince Charles" (1948).
The musical and philosophical ideas behind the opera had begun in Tippett's mind several years earlier. The story, which he wrote himself, charts the fortunes of two contrasting couples in a manner which has brought comparisons with Mozart's "The Magic Flute". The strain of composition, combined with his continuing responsibilities at Morley and his BBC work, affected Tippett's health and slowed progress. Following the death in 1949 of Morley's principal, Eva Hubback, Tippett's personal commitment to the college waned. His now-regular BBC fees had made him less dependent on his Morley salary, and he resigned his college post in 1951. His farewell took the form of three concerts which he conducted at the new Royal Festival Hall, in which the programmes included "A Child of Our Time", the British premiÃ¨re of Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana", and Thomas Tallis's rarely performed 40-part motet "Spem in alium".
