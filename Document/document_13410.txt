The Russians assaulted on a wide front with three armed forces. KoÃÂciuszko suggested that the whole Polish armed force be thought and draw in one of the Russian armed forces, so as to guarantee numerical equality and lift the assurance of the generally unpracticed Polish powers with a fast triumph; yet Poniatowski rejected this arrangement. On May 22, 1792, the Russian powers crossed the fringe in Ukraine, where KoÃÂciuszko and Poniatowski were positioned. The Crown Army was judged too frail to even think about opposing the four adversary segments progressing into West Ukraine, and started a battling withdrawal toward the western side of the Southern Bug River, with KoÃÂciuszko directing the back gatekeeper. On June 18, Poniatowski won the Battle of ZieleÃÂce; KoÃÂciuszko's division, on disengaged back watchman obligation, did not partake in the fight and rejoined the primary armed force just at sunset; regardless, his persistent security of the fundamental armed force's back and flanks won him the recently made Virtuti Militari, right up 'til the present time Poland's most noteworthy military design. (StoroÃÂ¼yÃÂski, nonetheless, states that KoÃÂciuszko got the Virtuti Militari for his later, July 18 triumph at Dubienka.) The Polish withdrawal proceeded, and on July 7 KoÃÂciuszko's powers battled a postponing fight against the Russians at Volodymyr-Volynskyi (the Battle of WÃÂodzimierz). On achieving the northern Bug River, the Polish Army was part into three divisions to hold the waterway cautious lineÃ¢ÂÂdebilitating the Poles' point numerical prevalence, against KoÃÂciuszko's direction of a solitary solid, concentrated armed force.
