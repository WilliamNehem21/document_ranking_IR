Polk had ceased in his location from attesting a case to the whole region, which stretched out north to 54 degrees, 40 minutes north scope, in spite of the fact that the Democratic Party stage called for such a case. Notwithstanding Polk's hawkish talk, he saw war over Oregon as indiscreet, and Polk and Buchanan started arrangements with the British.

In that message, he cited from the Monroe Doctrine to signify America's expectation of keeping European powers out, the principal critical utilization of it since its starting point in 1823.
