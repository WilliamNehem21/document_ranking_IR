Most faultfinders feel that Baxter is exhibited well in "Mother and Me and Mom". Candace Smith, who audits the sound adaptation of the book, expresses that Angelou commends the unlimited acknowledgment and backing of her mom, who appears to be "a road savvy, mindful lady who molded the writer's life and inheritance by her words and model". Vanessa Bush of "Booklist" considers the book an "adoring memory of an entangled relationship" and a "wonderful and profoundly uncovering annal of adoration and recuperating". Russo states that the book is "a delightful tribute to Baxter's free, lively, and fearless soul". Evaristo deviates, and expresses that Baxter seems to be "less adjusted, less intriguing, progressively purified and less valid" than Angelou depicts her somewhere else. Sturges calls the book "a significantly moving story of detachment and gathering, and an at last hopeful picture of the maternal bond". The most intriguing piece of the book, as per Sturges, is "Angelou's easygoing upsetting of the possibility of the mother who deserts her kids as gigantic and coldhearted". Sturges additionally says that Baxter is displayed as proud, alluring, autonomous, and flexible, attributes that "have apparently been passed on to her little girl". Commentator Valerie Sayers demands that the scenes that delineate Angelou's "stopping ventures" towards her absolution and acknowledgment of her mom are among the best in the book. Sayers names "Mother and Me and Mom" "a record of absolution", and like Angelou and Baxter, "sufficiently uncovering, and quite overwhelming". Like her mom anticipated from her, Angelou anticipates that her perusers should move past their feelings of hatred and "whatever was horrendous". Sayers likewise calls both Baxter and Angelou "a Large Dramatic Presence", and says that Angelou matches her mom's soul.
