In 2002, of arrive on the Little Chetco River were sold to Washington land designer David Rutan, just a while after the Biscuit Fire tore through the area. He opened a gold mining camp on the site in 2007, flying in clients by helicopter. Curry County authorities before long expressed that the camp abused zoning and sanitation laws, yet reviews were frustrated as a result of the region's unavailability. Rutan purchased a few additional cases in the Wild and Scenic area of the Chetco River in the next years, starting inside the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, and closure downstream. In spite of earthy people's worries, he proposed digging the Chetco riverbed for gold and minerals by means of business suction digs, allowed by the General Mining Act of 1872. In 2010, the Chetco River was distinguished as the seventh most imperiled waterway in America by backing association American Rivers, confronting a danger of "mechanized instream mining". Oregon's representative, Ted Kulongoski, two congresspersons, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and congressman Peter DeFazio all solicited the United States Department from Agriculture to pull back the Chetco River from the 1872 Mining Act, along these lines forestalling mineral mining on the waterway. Nonetheless, Rutan relinquished his cases by not paying his yearly documenting charges to the Bureau of Land Management in 2011.
