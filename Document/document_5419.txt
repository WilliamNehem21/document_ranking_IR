Disclosures during the 1990s shed all the more light on the connections of "Baryonyx" and its relatives. In 1996, a nose from Morocco was alluded to "Spinosaurus", and "Irritator" and "Angaturama" from Brazil (the two are conceivable equivalent words) were named. "Cristatusaurus" and "Suchomimus" were named dependent on fossils from Niger in 1998. In their portrayal of "Suchomimus", Sereno and associates set it and "Baryonyx" in the new subfamily Baryonychinae inside Spinosauridae; "Spinosaurus" and "Irritator" were put in the subfamily Spinosaurinae. Baryonychinae was recognized by the little size and bigger number of teeth in the dentary behind the terminal rosette, the profoundly keeled front dorsal vertebrae, and by having serrated teeth. Spinosaurinae was recognized by their straight tooth crowns without serrations, little first tooth in the premaxilla, expanded dividing of teeth in the jaws, and perhaps by having their noses put further back and the nearness of a profound neural spine cruise. They likewise joined the spinosaurids and their nearest relatives in the superfamily Spinosauroidea, yet in 2010, the British scientist Roger Benson thought about this as a lesser equivalent word of Megalosauroidea (a more seasoned name). In a 2007 gathering dynamic, the American scientist Denver W. Fowler recommended that since "Suchosaurus" is the first named class in its gathering, the clade names Spinosauroidea, Spinosauridae, and Baryonychinae ought to be supplanted by Suchosauroidea, Suchosauridae, and Suchosaurinae, paying little mind to whether the name "Baryonyx" is held. A recent report by the Brazilian scientistss Marcos A. F. Deals and Cesar L. Schultz found that the clade Baryonychinae was not very much upheld, since serrated teeth might be a hereditary quality among spinosaurids.
