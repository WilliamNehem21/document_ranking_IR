Swearing off the conclusion supported by its peers, "Changeling"s last arrangement mirrors Collins' reestablished expectation that Walter is alive. The shot is an over two moment arrangement demonstrating Collins' strolling off to wind up lost in a group. The succession is illustrative of the scope of impacts that include all through the film; Los Angeles is displayed as real character, enlivened by inconspicuous fringe symbolism that enables the watcher to concentrate on the story and the enthusiastic signs. The "buzzing about" of the grouping was required to pass on that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a clogged urban focus. In the end shot, the camera tilts up to uncover miles of city squares, people on foot in the city, vehicles passing by and streetcars running along their tracks. The adaptation of the film that screened at Cannes did exclude this arrangement; the scene blurred to dark as Collins left. The new 4,000-outline shot was Owens' thought. He felt the unexpected slice to dark hauled the watcher out of the film too rapidly, and that it ruled out passionate reflection. Owens stated, "There is a legend toward the end before the credits. The legend addresses what occurred sometime later, and I think you have to simply swallow that for a couple of minutes with the visual still with you." Owens disclosed to Eastwood the film should end like "Chinatown"ÃÂ (1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: "The camera blasts up and she leaves us from an enthusiastic, impactful scene toward the end, leaves into this mass of individuals and traffic. It's extremely confident and dismal in the meantime."
