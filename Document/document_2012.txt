Offering proof to the court, S. O. Davies said he had since a long time ago presumed that the Aberfan tips were unsteady, yet had stayed silent for dread that if tipping was ceased on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies included: "Yet on the off chance that I had been approached to do as such, I would have done it". His declaration was firmly tested by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that "[i]f Mr Davies is to be acknowledged as honest and precise in his recollectionÃÂ ... at that point he bears what must be one of the biggest individual weights of obligation regarding the debacle". Be that as it may, Gibbens thought that it was mind blowing that a man in Davies' one of a kind neighborhood position of power and impact would not have referenced his feelings of dread to any of the formal bodiesÃ¢ÂÂdistrict chamber, Coal Board, association or nearby Labor Party: "On the off chance that anybody could have practiced impact to defeat a willful or oblivious stone monument like the Coal Board, [Davies] was all around set to do as such." Gibbens presented that Davies' declaration ought to be rejected, in light of the fact that he "never refreshing what in reality was the import of his words". The council agreed, tolerating that Davies had not completely comprehended the gravity of his confirmation, and including that had they been persuaded else, he couldn't have gotten away reproach. The council's discoveries, distributed in July 1967, put duty regarding the fiasco solidly on the National Coal Board, explicitly on the nonappearance of any tipping strategy.
