An informal fan interpretation fix was declared in mid-2012. Work on the fan interpretation occurred over the accompanying two years, amid which time Square Enix was hesitant concerning an official Western discharge. The fix was at first declared for an August 2014 discharge, yet was rather was discharged on June 9, 2014. As indicated by the interpretation group pioneer, the fix was downloaded multiple times in the initial four days. It was brought down in July of that year after Square Enix purportedly undermined unspecified legitimate activity, initially thought to be a restraining request. Later articulations uncovered that the fix was discharged sooner than initially declared because of the lead interpreter on the task needing fans to see their accomplishments, which wound up causing a fracture among him and the remainder of the group. Prior to the discharge, Square Enix and the interpretation group had been in neighborly correspondence concerning the interpretation. The formal solicitations to bring the fix down were made in the weeks following its discharge, without further ado before the declaration of "Type-0 HD". Work on the fix was in the long run continued and a second form, which included informal similarity with the PlayStation 3 framework and further interpretation bugfixes, was in the long run discharged in 2015.
