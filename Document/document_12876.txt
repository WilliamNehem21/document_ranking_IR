In 1918, when Wisconsin at first numbered its interstate framework, the course of what later moved toward becoming USÃÂ 141 pursued two separate state parkways: WISÃÂ 17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WISÃÂ 16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Portions that later progressed toward becoming USÃÂ 141 in Wisconsin were numbered WISÃÂ 15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WISÃÂ 38 among Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered auxiliary thruway. In 1919, Michigan marked its parkway framework, yet the state did not have a thruway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The thruway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was a piece of M-12. The section through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WISÃÂ 69, and from the Crystal Falls territory north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was utilized. In 1919, the WISÃÂ 38 assignment was stretched out northward to Niagara and the state line. The parkway was fixed to wipe out a progression of sharp bends among Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. That year, WISÃÂ 17 was realigned among Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run by means of Oostburg. WISÃÂ 17 was additionally realigned in 1922 to pursue a different directing south of Port Washington; already it was steered simultaneously with WISÃÂ 57 in the zone. By 1924, maps demonstrated an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to interface with WISÃÂ 57 at the state line.
