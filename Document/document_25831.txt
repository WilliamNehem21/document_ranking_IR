Reviewers felt that the archival game content and developer interviews were among "Rare Replay" best features. Some were frustrated that the features were locked behind time-consuming in-game challenges. Sam Machkovech ("Ars Technica") found himself stuck not even halfway through the stamp card progress after finishing the easiest achievements. This made the unreleased game footage particularly hard to access. Stephen Totilo ("Kotaku") similarly became uninterested in finishing the stamp collection. He called the stamps the package's "sickest joke" in consideration of Rare's reputation for collectible-heavy games. Some reviewers found the developer content more important than individual games. "Polygon" reviewer called the compilation "an essential piece of gaming history", while "Kotaku" critic noted that the features lacked a straightforward history of the company and hid Rare's significant, former ties with Nintendo. Whitehead ("Eurogamer") wondered why "Mire Mare" and other early games were ignored in the bonus content. Machkovech ("Ars Technica") found "Rare Replay" to be as much a "memorial" as an anthology since Rare had become "a shadow of its former self". He noted how the compilation's final games coincide with the Stamper brothers' exit from the company. Reviewers felt that the Stampers, Rare's founders, were a conspicuous absence from the compilation and Jaz Rignall figured that the compilation's stamps feature was a reference to the brothers.
