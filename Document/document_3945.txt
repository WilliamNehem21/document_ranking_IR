The places of worship in van Eyck's work are not founded on authentic structures, yet were amalgams of various structures and imaginary spaces. The congregation may take after St. Donatian's, which has since been devastated; it appears to impart likenesses to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, with components of Romanesque design. Van Eyck's artistic creations are frequently spatially equivocal; the more the watcher takes a gander at them the more inquiries are raised. Mirroring an agreement among craftsmanship students of history, Ward deciphers the logical inconsistencies as "either inquisitively mixed up or purposely intended to order a complex emblematic message." Mary holds a stem that seems to develop from the parrot's plumes, finishing in a bundle of red, white and blue blossoms. A parrot was once in a while utilized as a token for the Virgin, yet its juxtaposition with the plant is incoherent. The parrot and plant stress the botanical foundation, symbolizing the Garden of Eden, complemented by the figures of Adam of Eve. The blooms' hues speak to immaculateness, love and lowliness; its petals are an image of the cross and Christ's penance. The story of unique sin, the removal and reclamation is in this way caught in a solitary practical gadget.
