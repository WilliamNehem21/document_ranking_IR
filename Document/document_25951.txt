Secretary of Agriculture Claude R. Wickard granted use of some of United States Forest Service land to the War Department "for so long as the military necessity continues". The need for land for a new road, and later for a right of way for a power line, eventually brought wartime land purchases to , but only $414,971 was ultimately spent. The big ticket items were the school, which cost $350,000, and the Anchor Ranch, which cost $25,000.
