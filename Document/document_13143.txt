The French researchers gained great ground on the plan of a watery homogeneous reactor, however there were questions that their work was applicable to the primary undertaking of the British Tube Alloys venture, that of structure a nuclear bomb, and assets were firmly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a probability that a reactor could be utilized to breed plutonium, however its utilization in a bomb appeared a distant chance. The MAUD Committee consequently felt that they ought to migrate to America. It seemed well and good to pool assets, and America had focal points, strikingly access to materials, for example, overwhelming water. American researchers, for example, Henry D. Smyth, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor encouraged that the Cambridge group be sent to America. Then again, American authorities had worries about security, since just a single of the six senior researchers in the Cambridge bunch was British, and about French patent cases. These included licenses on controlling atomic chain responses, advancing uranium, and utilizing deuterium as a neutron arbitrator. There were additionally two patent applications related to Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather on the creation and utilization of plutonium. George Thomson, the administrator of the MAUD Committee, proposed a trade off: migrating the group to Canada.
