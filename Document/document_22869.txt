The earliest felids are known from the Oligocene of Europe, such as "Proailurus", and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus "Pseudaelurus". The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats was similar to that of the modern clouded leopards ("Neofelis"). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high bite force. As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from fossils, the lineages of "Homotherium" and "Smilodon" are estimated to have diverged about 18 Ma ago. The earliest species of "Smilodon" is "S.Â gracilis", which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of "Megantereon", from which it probably evolved. "Megantereon" itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with "Homotherium". "S.Â gracilis" reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. The younger "Smilodon" species are probably derived from "S.Â gracilis". "S.Â fatalis" existed 1.6 millionâ10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced "S.Â gracilis" in North America. "S.Â populator" existed 1 millionâ10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.
