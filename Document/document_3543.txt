By June President Habyarimana had come to see Hutu Power, instead of the standard resistance, as the greatest risk to his initiative. This drove him to change strategies and connect completely with the Arusha harmony process, giving it the driving force it expected to attract to a finish. As indicated by Prunier this help was more representative than certifiable. Habyarimana trusted that he could keep up power all the more effectively through a blend of constrained concessions to the resistance and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were permitted to upset the harmony procedure. The exchange of troop numbers was extended and troublesome; double the discussions nearly fallen. The Rwandan Government needed to dispense just 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, mirroring the extent of Tutsi in the nation, while the RPF was contending for a 50/50 split. The RPF were in a predominant position following their fruitful February crusade and were sponsored in their requests by Tanzania, which was leading the discussions. The legislature in the long run consented to their requests. Just as half of the officer corps, the RPF was distributed up to 40% of the non-order troops. The arrangement additionally commanded vast scale retirement; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF warriors at the season of the accords, just 19,000 would be drafted into the new national armed force. With all subtleties concurred the Arusha Accords were at long last marked on 4 August 1993 at a formal function gone to by President Habyarimana just as heads of state from neighboring nations.
