In spite of this new opportunity, van der Weyden's representations of ladies are strikingly comparative in idea and structure, both to one another and to female pictures by Campin. Most are three-quarter face and half-length. They ordinarily set their models before a dull foundation that is uniform and unexceptional. While the representations are noted for their expressive feeling, the facial highlights of the ladies unequivocally take after each other. This demonstrates in spite of the fact that van der Weyden did not hold fast to the custom of romanticized portrayal, he looked to satisfy his sitters in a way that reflected contemporary standards of magnificence. The greater part of van der Weyden's representations were painted as commissions from the honorability; he painted just five (counting "Picture of a Lady") that were not contributor pictures. It is realized that in his "Picture of Philip de CroÃÂ¿" (c.ÃÂ 1460), van der Weyden complimented the youthful Flemish aristocrat by hiding his extensive nose and undershot jaw. While portraying this inclination in connection to the Washington picture, craftsmanship history specialist Norbert Schneider stated, "While van Eyck demonstrates nature 'in the crude', in a manner of speaking, Rogier enhances physical reality, cultivating and refining Nature and the human structure with the assistance of a brush." The high caliber of the composition is featured when contrasted with the National Gallery's fundamentally the same as workshop painting. The London subject has gentler, increasingly adjusted highlights and is more youthful and less independently described than the c.ÃÂ 1460 demonstrate. The system likewise is more obvious and fine in the London work. In any case, both offer a comparable articulations and dress.
