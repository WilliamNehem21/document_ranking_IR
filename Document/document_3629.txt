The activity at Wertingen persuaded Mack to work on the left (north) bank of the Danube as opposed to making an immediate eastwards retreat on the correct bank. This would require the Austrian armed force to cross toward the north at GÃÂ¼nzburg. On 8 October Ney was working under Louis Alexandre Berthier's headings that required an immediate assault on Ulm the next day. Ney sent in Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's third Division to catch the GÃÂ¼nzburg connects over the Danube. In the Battle of GÃÂ¼nzburg, a section of this division kept running into some Tyrolean jaegers and caught 200 of them, including their authority Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'AsprÃÂ©, alongside two guns. The Austrians saw these improvements and strengthened their situations around GÃÂ¼nzburg with three infantry units and 20 guns. Malher's division led a few courageous assaults against the Austrian positions, however all fizzled. Mack at that point sent in Ignaz Gyulai with seven infantry contingents and fourteen mounted force squadrons to fix the annihilated scaffolds, however this power was charged and cleared away by the postponed French 59th Infantry Regiment. Furious battling resulted and the French at long last figured out how to set up a decent footing on the right (south) bank of the Danube. While the Battle of GÃÂ¼nzburg was being battled, Ney sent Louis Henri Loison's second Division to catch the Danube spans at Elchingen, which were delicately safeguarded by the Austrians. Having lost the vast majority of the Danube spans, Mack walked his military back to Ulm. By 10 October Ney's corps had gained noteworthy ground: Malher's third division had crossed to one side (south) bank, Loison's second division held Elchingen, and Pierre Dupont de l'ÃÂ©tang's first Division was going towards Ulm.
