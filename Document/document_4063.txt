At 4:00ÃÂ pm Lucan called at a scientific expert's on Lower Belgrave Street, near Veronica's home, and asked the drug specialist there to distinguish a little container. It ended up being LimbitrolÃÂ 5, a medication for the treatment of uneasiness and gloom. Lucan had evidently made a few comparable visits since he isolated from his better half; he never told the drug specialist where he got the medications. At 4:45ÃÂ pm he called a companion, scholarly specialist Michael Hicks-Beach, and somewhere in the range of 6:30ÃÂ pm and 7:00ÃÂ pm met with him at his level on Elizabeth Street. Lucan needed his assistance with an article on betting he had been approached to compose for an Oxford University magazine. He drove Hicks-Beach home at about 8:00ÃÂ pm, not in his Mercedes-Benz, yet in "an old, dull, and scruffy Ford", potentially the Ford Corsair he obtained from Michael Stoop a little while prior. At 8:30ÃÂ pm he called the Clermont to beware of a booking for supper with Greville Howard and companions. Howard had called him at 5:15ÃÂ pm and inquired as to whether he wished to go to the theater, however Lucan had declined and made the elective recommendation to meet at the Clermont at 11:00ÃÂ pm. He neglected to arrive and did not answer his phone when called.
