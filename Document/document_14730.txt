Beecham was incidentally missing from the show lobby and musical show house somewhere in the range of 1920 and 1923, yet Coates gave the principal execution of "A Song of the High Hills" in 1920, and Henry Wood and Hamilton Harty customized Delius' music with the Queen's Hall and HallÃÂ© Orchestras. Wood gave the British premiÃÂ¨re of the Double Concerto for violin and cello in 1920, and of "A Song Before Sunrise" and the "Move Rhapsody No. 2" in 1923. Delius had a budgetary and aesthetic accomplishment with his coincidental music for James Elroy Flecker's play "Hassan" (1923), with 281 exhibitions at His Majesty's Theater. With Beecham's arrival the writer progressed toward becoming, in Hadley's words, "what his most intense admirers had never imaginedÃ¢ÂÂan authentic famous achievement." Hadley refers to, specifically, the six-day Delius celebration at the Queen's Hall in 1929 under Beecham's general course, within the sight of the arranger in his shower seat. "[T]he cream of his instrumental yield with and without soli and tune was incorporated", and the corridor was filled. Beecham was aided the association of the celebration by Philip Heseltine, who composed the point by point program notes for three of the six shows. The celebration included orchestral arrangements and melodies, a passage from "A Village Romeo and Juliet", the Piano and Violin Concertos, and premiÃÂ¨res of "Cynara" and "A Late Lark", finishing up with "A Mass of Life".
