In 1846, Fillmore was associated with the establishing of the University of Buffalo, and turned into its first chancellor; he served until his demise in 1874. He had restricted the addition of Texas, and opposed the consequent MexicanÃ¢ÂÂ American War, considering it to be a contraption to broaden bondage's domain. Fillmore was irritated when President Polk vetoed a waterway and harbors charge that would have profited Buffalo, and expressed, "May God spare the nation for it is apparent the general population won't." New York governors at the time served a two-year term, and Fillmore could have had the Whig designation in 1846, had he needed it. He really came quite close to it while moving to get the assignment for his supporter, John Young, who was chosen. Another constitution for New York state gave that the workplace of officer was made elective, similar to the lawyer general and some different positions that were previously picked by the state governing body. Fillmore's work in account while Ways and Means executive made him an undeniable contender for officer, and he was fruitful in getting the Whig selection for the 1847 race. With an assembled gathering at his back, Fillmore won by 38,000 votes, the biggest edge a Whig contender for statewide office could ever have in New York.
