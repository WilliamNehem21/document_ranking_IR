On the flare-up of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer examined whether the Proms should proceed as arranged. They had at this point turned into a built up establishment, and it was consented to proceed. Notwithstanding, hostile to German inclination constrained Speyer to leave the nation and look for asylum in the US, and there was a crusade to forbid all German music from shows. Newman put out an announcement proclaiming that German music would be played as arranged: "The best instances of Music and Art are world belongings and unassailable even by the biases and interests of great importance." When Speyer left Britain, the music distributers Chappell's assumed on the liability for the Queen's Hall and its symphony. The Proms proceeded all through the war years, with less major new works than previously, in spite of the fact that there were all things considered British debuts of pieces by BartÃÂ³k, Stravinsky and Debussy. An antiquarian of the Proms, AteÃÂ Orga, stated, "Shows frequently must be re-coordinated to harmonize with the 'All Clear' between air attacks. Falling bombs, shrapnel, hostile to flying machine fire and the rambling of Zeppelins were consistently compromising. In any case, [Wood] kept things in a hurry and at last had an undeniable part to play in boosting spirit."
