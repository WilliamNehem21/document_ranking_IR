After affecting the FSM, Chataan began a northwest track as an intensifying typhoon. Its eye passed just north of Guam on JulyÂ 4, though the eyewall moved across the island and dropped heavy rainfall. Totals were highest in southern Guam, peaking at 536Â mm (21.1Â in). Flooding and landslides from the storm severely damaged or destroyed 1,994Â houses. Damage on the island totaled $60.5Â million, and there were 23Â injuries. The typhoon also affected Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands with gusty winds and light rainfall. Typhoon Chataan attained its peak intensity of 175Â km/h (110Â mph) on JulyÂ 8. It weakened while turning to the north, and after diminishing to a tropical storm, Chataan struck eastern Japan on JulyÂ 10. High rainfall, peaking at , flooded 10,270Â houses. Damage in Japan totaled about $500Â million (Â¥59Â billion JPY).
The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on JulyÂ 5 near the Marshall Islands, near where Chataan originated. For much of its duration, Halong moved toward the northwest, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm. Early on JulyÂ 10, Halong passed just south of Guam as a tropical storm, according to the JMA, although the JTWC assessed it as a typhoon near the island. It had threatened to strike the island less than a week after Chataan's damaging landfall, and although Halong remained south of Guam, it produced high waves and gusty winds on the island. The storm disrupted relief efforts following Chataan, causing additional power outages but little damage.
