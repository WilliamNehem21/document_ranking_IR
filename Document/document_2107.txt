The video starts with a blonde lady, played by model and on-screen character Lauren Hastings (purportedly depicting Britney Spears), leaving her home connected at the hip with a unidentified man. The couple leaves in the lady's vehicle (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake moves down the window of a dark Mercedes 500 W220, from which he and his companion have been viewing the lady. Timberlake breaks into the house by tossing a stone through a window and continues through the lady's home, with repulsive force hops and slides, not causing some other unmistakable harm, aside from kicking an image casing of the lady over the family room. At that point he looks through certain drawers and finds a camcorder, while the driver of the vehicle, Timbaland, signals for his female associate in the back of the vehicle, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She goes into the house and runs with Timberlake to a room, where she begins to strip and kiss him while being shot. They remain in the room for a minute; at that point the assistant leaves the house yet Timberlake remains. As the blonde lady returns, he pursues her around the house and covers up in a storage room as she showers. He draws nearer to her and contacts the glass encompassing the shower. The blonde lady detects somebody in the room and pivots, however Timberlake is gone. She leaves the washroom and goes into her room, where the video he made with his new sweetheart plays on the TV.
