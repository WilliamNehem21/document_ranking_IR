Jeff Garlin claims that "I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With" was the first Hollywood movie to incorporate Millennium Park. The film was not released until 2006, after the release of several other movies. These include the 2005 film "The Weather Man", which starred Nicolas Cage and was filmed in part at the park's McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The 2006 romantic comedy "The Break-Up" shot scenes in the park, then had to reshoot some of them because "Cloud Gate" was under cover in some of the initial shots. Other movies which include scenes filmed in Millennium Park include the 2005 thriller "Derailed", the 2006 romance "The Lake House", and the 2007 thriller "Butterfly on a Wheel". At least two television series have filmed in the park, including "Leverage" and "Prison Break", which featured shots of the "Crown Fountain" in the first few episodes of its first season (2005). In the ending scene of "Source Code" (2011), Jake Gyllenhaal's and Michelle Monaghan's characters are seen walking through Millennium Park, and make their way to the "Cloud Gate". In the 2012 romantic comedy, "The Vow", the characters run from the Art Institute of Chicago across the Nichols Bridgeway to Millennium Park, where they kiss under "Cloud Gate".
The book series Divergent has several events set in the part, with mentions of the Cloud Gate sculpture (referred to as The Bean), the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, as well as the park itself, though it is only referred to as Millennium in the novel. The faction Erudite has their headquarters across from the park in the book series. The park was featured in the 2014 action-adventure video game Watch Dogs.
