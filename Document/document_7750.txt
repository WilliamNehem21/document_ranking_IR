In 2000, plans were made for Ross to join Wilson and Birdsong for an arranged "Diana Ross and the Supremes: Return to Love" gathering visit. Be that as it may, Wilson passed on the thought, in light of the fact that while the advertisers offered Ross $15ÃÂ million to perform, Wilson was offered $4ÃÂ million and Birdsong under $1ÃÂ million. Ross herself offered to twofold the sums both Wilson and Birdsong had initially been offered, yet while Birdsong acknowledged, Wilson stayed unyielding, and therefore the arrangement fell through with both previous Supremes. In the long run, the "Arrival to Love" visit went on as booked, however with Payne and Laurence joining Ross, albeit none of the three had ever been in the gathering in the meantime and neither Payne nor Laurence had sung on any of the first hit chronicles that they were presently singing live. Susaye Greene was likewise considered for this visit, however wouldn't try out for it. The music pundits cried foul and numerous fans were disillusioned by both this and the shows' high ticket costs. Despite the fact that the visit did well in bigger markets including close limit at the premiere night in Philadelphia and a sellout at Madison Square Garden in New York, it failed to meet expectations in littler/medium markets. The visit was dropped in the wake of playing just 50% of the dates on schedule.
