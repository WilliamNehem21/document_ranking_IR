MDOT facilitated an open house along the unopened segment of M-6 among Kalamazoo and Byron Center roads. This occasion occurred on October 2, 2004, and was charged as the "Southbelt Shuffle", enabling the general population to walk or bicycle along the interstate. The occasion was intended to attract consideration regarding the M-6 Trail that runs parallel to the expressway. Some occasion members conveyed their steeds for the opportunity to ride on the expressway. The entire turnpike was opened to traffic on November 17, 2004, after a strip cutting service. Whenever opened, recreation work was all the while being finished on bridge spans at the I-196 exchange on the west end. The whole task cost $700 million (proportional to $ in ) to finish over the five-year development period, about $35ÃÂ million/mi (around $22ÃÂ million/km, proportionate to $/mi or $/km in ). At the point when the road was opened, it was the first in the province of Michigan to utilize a SPUI situated at the Kalamazoo Avenue exit. The majority of the extensions and sound wall dividers were painted sienna beige as a component of a "shading topic" to the expressway. MDOT likewise utilized another system to break the asphalt markings into the solid, intended to diminish the probability that snowplows would rub them off. The signs are in miles, yet "the whole M-6 road was planned and built in metric", as indicated by MDOT chief Suzette Peplinski. The last inclines opened to traffic on December 9, 2004.
