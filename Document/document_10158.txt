Another show in London in 1912 exhibited the best of music lobby's ability. The Royal Command Performance occurred at the Palace Theater in London, which was overseen by Alfred Butt. The show was sorted out by Oswald Stoll, an Australian manager who dealt with a string of West End and commonplace theaters. Stoll, in spite of the fact that a devotee of Lloyd's, disdained the indecency of her demonstration and supported an arrival to an all the more family-accommodating air inside the music corridor. Along these lines, and her investment in the prior music corridor war, Stoll left her out of the line-up. He put an advert in "The Era" upon the arrival of the execution cautioning that "Coarseness and indecency and so forth are not allowedÃÂ ... this hint is rendered important just by a couple of specialists". In striking back, Lloyd arranged her own show at the London Pavilion, publicizing that "all of her exhibitions was a direction act by request of the British open". She performed "One Thing Leads to Another", "Gracious Mr Porter", and "The Boy I Love Is up in the Gallery" and was hailed as "the Queen of Comedy" by faultfinders. That year, she went to Devon where she showed up at the Exeter Hippodrome to much achievement. "The Devon and Exeter Gazette", revealed that Lloyd's execution of "Each Movement Tells a Tale", was "altogether delighted in" by the gathering of people and "[received] round after round of commendation". The paper likewise adulated her presentation of a "Cockney young lady's special night in Paris", which was met by "thunders of chuckling".
