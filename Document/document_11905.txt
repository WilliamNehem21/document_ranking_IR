Elephants for the most part have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks, 12 deciduous premolars, and 12 molars. In contrast to most vertebrates, which develop infant teeth and after that supplant them with a solitary changeless arrangement of grown-up teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth turn for the duration of their lives. The biting teeth are supplanted multiple times in a normal elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not supplanted by new ones rising up out of the jaws vertically as in many well evolved creatures. Rather, new teeth develop in at the back of the mouth and push ahead to push out the old ones. The primary biting tooth on each side of the jaw drops out when the elephant is a few years of age. The second arrangement of berating teeth drops out at four to six years of age. The third set drops out at 9Ã¢ÂÂ 15 years old, and set four endures until 18Ã¢ÂÂ 28 years old. The fifth arrangement of teeth drops out at the mid 40s. The 6th (and normally last) set should last the elephant a mind-blowing remainder. Elephant teeth have circle formed dental edges, which are thicker and more jewel molded in African elephants.
