Bennett's stewardship of the Philharmonic Society symphony was not by any stretch of the imagination cheerful, and the student of history of the ensemble, Cyril Ehrlich, takes note of "a feeling of float and decay". Many driving individuals from the ensemble were likewise in the symphony of the Italian Opera House in London (and along these lines partisans of the dislodged Costa), and, what's more, Bennett demonstrated unfit to determine individual enmities among his driving players. Costa took to organizing plans for his artists which made practices (and now and then exhibitions) for the Society unreasonable. This gave a "feeling that [Bennett] was fit for applying just disappearing specialist among experts". In addition, contrasting London and different revolves around the mid-century, Ehrlich notes "Verdi was in Milan, Wagner in Dresden, Meyerbeer in Paris, Brahms in Vienna, and Liszt in Weimar. London had the most extravagant of groups of onlookers, and was offered Sterndale Bennett." He occasions the London debut of Schumann's "Heaven and the Peri" in the 1856 season, which, by drawing in Jenny Lind as soloist, and with Prince Albert in the gathering of people, acquired a significant membership, yet was musically tragic (and was not helped by the mayhem of a truly stuffed scene). One individual from the group of onlookers thought Lind's voice was "worn and stressed" and that there would have been "eager exhibitions of scorn had not the gathering of people been limited within the sight of Royalty". Paper faultfinders were hardly increasingly complimentary.
