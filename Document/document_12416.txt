A standout amongst the most helpless stretches is that between Blakeney Point and Weybourne, which incorporated the Cley and Salthouse Marsh saves. The coast here is secured by a shingle edge, however the ocean assaults the edge and spit through tidal and storm activity, with a solitary tempest once in a while moving a "fabulous" measure of shingle. The Blakeney Point spit has at times been broken, turning into an island for a period, and this may happen once more. The northernmost piece of adjacent Blakeney was lost to the ocean in the early Middle Ages, likely because of a tempest. The spit is moving towards the terrain at about 1ÃÂ m (1ÃÂ yd) every year, and for the last two hundred years maps have been sufficiently precise for the infringement of the ocean to be evaluated. Blakeney Chapel was 400ÃÂ m (440ÃÂ yd) from the ocean in 1817, yet this had diminished to 195ÃÂ m (215ÃÂ yd) before the finish of the twentieth century. The landward development of the shingle implies that the channel of the River Glaven ends up blocked progressively regularly, prompting flooding of the save and Cley town. The Environment Agency thought about a few healing choices to ensure these powerless regions, and another course for the waterway toward the south of its unique line was finished in 2007 at an expense of about ÃÂ£1.5ÃÂ million.
