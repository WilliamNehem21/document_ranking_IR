In 2006, Kapoor appeared in three films. She first starred in the thriller "36 China Town", followed by the comedy "Chup Chup Ke"; both were moderately successful. She next portrayed the character of Desdemona in "Omkara"âthe Hindi adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Othello". The film (directed by Vishal Bhardwaj) is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in Uttar Pradesh. Describing Bhardwaj as a "world-class director [with] a unique style", Kapoor was cast in the project after the director had seen her performance in "Yuva", and was subsequently required to attend script-reading sessions along with the entire cast. The feature premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened at the Cairo International Film Festival. "Omkara" was received positively by critics, and Kapoor's portrayal earned her a fourth Filmfare Award and first Screen Award. In a 2010 retrospective of the "Top 80 Iconic Performances" of Hindi cinema, "Filmfare" wrote that she was "brilliant" and praised her ability to "effortless[ly]" convey the various emotions her character went through. Kapoor considered her role in "Omkara" as a "new benchmark" in her career, and compared her portrayal of Dolly with her own evolving maturity as a woman.
