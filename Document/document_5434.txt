The lord endeavored to deny Neville of the chancellorship in 1236, which the priest countered by asserting that as he had been designated amid the imperial minority with the assent of the extraordinary chamber, just the board could expel him. In 1238 the church building section of the see of Winchester chose as Bishop of Winchester first William de Raley contrary to the lord's decision of William the Bishop of Valence, and when that race was subdued, they chose Neville. His decision to Winchester was subdued in 1239, prompting a squabble with Henry III. Valence was the uncle of Eleanor of Provence, whom Henry had hitched in 1236. Valence had increased much impact with the lord rapidly, and attempted to dispose of the more seasoned regal authorities and organization changes in the regal organization. This, alongside the questioned race to Winchester, was the reason for Neville's tumble from support. In spite of the fact that Henry denied Neville of the care of the Great Seal from 1238 until 1242, Neville held the title of chancellor until his passing, therefore qualifying him for the incomes he would ordinarily have gotten from the workplace. The Great Seal itself was held by various minor authorities, most likely to permit Henry more noteworthy command over its utilization by keeping the foundation of another incredible authority who may meddle with his arrangements. However, they came up short on the power base that Neville had, which empowered him to contradict the ruler.
