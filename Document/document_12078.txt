Eventually before 1897, another individual from the family, the specialist Edward Cave, left Holt Farm and moved to Crewkerne in Somerset, taking the Ooser with him. In 1897, he migrated to Bath, leaving the Ooser with his family coachman; when Edward Cave in this manner endeavored to recoup the head, he was educated that it had been "discarded", with some proposal that it had discovered its way to the United States. In 1935, an old stories gatherer named S. A. Ramsden embraced enquiries into the destiny of the head at the inciting of the Egyptologist and folklorist Margaret Murray. His enquiries drove him to meet with Cave's coachman, Lawrence, who Ã¢ÂÂ after Cave left Crewkerne Ã¢ÂÂ had along these lines filled in as the coachman for Cave's substitution, a specialist by the name of Webber. Lawrence said that Cave went out in the town, where it was hung up in a space and started to go to pieces; Lawrence wore it to scare individuals amid a procession around 1900, at which time the hair was dropping out. He said that the house was later pulled down, with the head likely still inside it, all together for a nearby mail station to be built in its place.
