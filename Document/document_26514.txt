For a later review of Saurischia, Huene in 1932 reassigned the species "Ornithopsis" "greppini", which he had named in 1922, to the genus "Cetiosauriscus". The known material, discovered in Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) deposits in the Reuchenette Formation of Switzerland, includes dorsal and caudal vertebrae, forelimb bones and a hindlimb and partial pes, from at least two individuals. The long humerus was built like "Cetiosauriscus leedsii", and the two species were originally distinguished from "Cetiosaurus" by having shorter dorsal vertebrae, a shorter forelimb, and a longer lower leg. "Cetiosauriscus greppini" differs from "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" by having caudal transverse processes that are antero-posteriorly flat and have a distinct wing-like upward expansion. It also differs in having posterior lamina projecting downwards from the anterior caudal transverse processes, a coracoid with a rounded outline and with a notch below the glenoid joint, remarkably straight shafts of humerus and femur, a distal end of the humerus with an inner condyle higher than the outer condyle, a more proximally placed fourth trochanter, and a longer and straighter ischium. These characters suggested that both taxa differ on the generic level, a position supported by Upchurch and John Martin in 2003, David Weishampel and colleagues in 2004, and John Whitlock in 2011, who considered "C. greppini" to be Eusauropoda "incertae sedis". The similarities like the anatomy of the caudal vertebrae were suggested by Christian Meyer and Basil ThÃ¼ring in 2003 to instead support both species being separate, but in the same genus.
