By July, the group had started beginning development of the amusement's dimensions. "Hoodlum II"s expanded spotlight on stealth required new dimension plan ideas: the most stealth-based missions in "Cheat" had focused on urban thievery, yet Pearsall clarified this "would get drained really quick" whenever rehashed in each dimension. The group expanded "Criminal II" by planning missions with so much destinations as abducting, shakedown and listening in. The initial two dimensions were intended to consistently acquaint new players with the center diversion mechanics, without an instructional exercise mission that may lose the enthusiasm of experienced players. While making a mission, the group would frequently start by settling on the player's target, after which they would create an unpleasant dimension plan. The mission would then experience a companion audit to decide whether it ought to be added to the amusement. Every one of the amusement's dimensions was a collaboration as opposed to crafted by a solitary creator. Fashioner Randy Smith clarified that, while "Thief"s levels had been intended to fit a prior story, the "Cheat II" group "attempted to consider great missions first" and after that balanced the plot to suit them. He noticed that it was exceedingly hard to orchestrate the two.
