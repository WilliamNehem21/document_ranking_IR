Regardless of the report created by the Office of Intelligence Research, by 1957 the CIA understood that its rendition of the historical backdrop of the ÃÂrbenz government and the upset was not picking up footing. Books composed by protectors of the ÃÂrbenz government, which were unequivocally disparaging of the US mediation, were commonly better gotten. Patriot Latin Americans were slanted to see the Castillo Armas government as a making of the US. Subsequently, the US government chose to permit Ronald Schneider, a student of history who was finishing his Ph.D, to get to the PBHistory chronicle. Schneider distributed "Socialism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954" in 1959. Later spectators have expressed that the production may have been sponsored here and there by the CIA: both the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who distributed Schneider's book, got CIA reserves. Schneider expressed in his book that the "ComitÃÂ©" was in charge of gathering the records he got to, yet did not make reference to the CIA's job in subsidizing the "ComitÃÂ©", nor did he clarify how the archives went to the US. Schneider's book did not depend on PBHistory material alone, yet in addition on data that he accumulated amid a trek to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was commonly generally welcomed.
