In 1955, DiÃ¡Â»Âm attempted to incorporate the remaining HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o armed forces into the VNA. Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t was one of four HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o military pioneers who denied the administration offer on 23 April, and kept on working self-rulingly. At one phase, the Cao ÃÂÃÂ i, HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o and BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn shaped a partnership called the United Front, trying to weight DiÃ¡Â»Âm into giving over power; Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t was named senior military authority. In any case, this had small significance as the different units were as yet self-ruling of one another, and the United Front was more a show-stopper than a methods for encouraging composed activity, and did not at all fortify any military risk to DiÃ¡Â»Âm. The pioneers were suspicious of each other and regularly sent subordinates to gatherings. At first, American and French agents in Vietnam trusted that DiÃ¡Â»Âm would take up a stylized job and permit the faction chiefsÃ¢ÂÂincluding Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥tÃ¢ÂÂto hold government positions. In any case, DiÃ¡Â»Âm would not share control and propelled an unexpected hostile against Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t in ThÃ¡Â»Ât NÃ¡Â»Ât on 12 March, shelling the zone vigorously. The fight was uncertain and the two sides accused the other for causing precariousness and disturbing the circumstance. DiÃ¡Â»Âm then assaulted the BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn's Saigon central command in late April, rapidly pounding them.
