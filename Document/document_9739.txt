Rowe was the primary biographer to record the convention, rehashed by Johnson, that Shakespeare resigned to Stratford "a few years before his passing". He was all the while filling in as a performing artist in London in 1608; in a response to the sharers' request in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage expressed that in the wake of obtaining the rent of the Blackfriars Theater in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men "put men players" there, "which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, and so forth.". In any case, it is maybe significant that the bubonic plague seethed in London all through 1609. The London open playhouses were more than once shut amid expanded flare-ups of the plague (an aggregate of more than 60 months conclusion between May 1603 and February 1610), which implied there was regularly no acting work. Retirement from all work was exceptional around then. Shakespeare kept on visiting London amid the years 1611Ã¢ÂÂ 1614. In 1612, he was called as an observer in "Bellott v. Mountjoy", a court case concerning the marriage settlement of Mountjoy's little girl, Mary. In March 1613, he purchased a gatehouse in the previous Blackfriars cloister; and from November 1614, he was in London for half a month with his child in-law, John Hall. After 1610, Shakespeare composed less plays, and none are credited to him after 1613. His last three plays were joint efforts, most likely with John Fletcher, who succeeded him as the house dramatist of the King's Men.
