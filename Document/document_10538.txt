To an overwhelming applause from around 200 occupants in participation, the Mahwah gathering on August 10 collectively casted a ballot to issue summonses on the grounds that the eruv had not been brought down. Civic chairman Laforet, however, asked the gathering not to make this stride, indicating the extensive cost the fruitless eruv prosecution had cost Tenafly, and upheld exchange. Because of the gathering's activity, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association (of which the South Monsey aggregate is a section) and a few Orthodox Jews inhabitant in Rockland County recorded suit in government court against Mahwah on August 11, and guaranteed to oppose any summonses. Inhabitants of Teaneck and Englewood, each in southeastern Bergen County and home to huge networks of Orthodox Jews, had gone to Mahwah and Upper Saddle River to make known their perspectives at gathering gatherings. Chamber individuals from Teaneck and Englewood had spoken there in help of the eruv's maintenance, just to meet an unfriendly gathering. Residents for a Better Upper Saddle River posted a screen capture of the Teaneck committee plan web based, encouraging individuals to check their date-books with the dates. Board part Mark Schwartz of Teaneck expressed that guests would be welcome, and could see how a various network worked. Michael Cohen of the Englewood board expressed, "We have more than once endeavored to convey to the authority of Upper Saddle River and Mahwah why it is that the talk and moves being seen and made by specific individuals from their overseeing bodies and by specific individuals from their networks are being seen by the outside world as hostile to Semitic. Nonetheless, those endeavors have to a great extent kept on failing to receive any notice."
