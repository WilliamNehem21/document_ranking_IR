While the overall population were confused that a man who just scored a century against Australia could be let alone for the group, the English cricketing press were partitioned on the choice. A few columnists upheld the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket journalists of "The Times" and "The Daily Telegraph". Others, unmistakably the previous England commander Ted Dexter, the previous Test player Trevor Bailey and E.ÃÂ W. Swanton, every one of whom by and large favored the cricket foundation, fought that D'Oliveira had the right to be in the group on legitimacy. Swanton said he had gotten no letters which really concurred with the exclusion. Different reporters, for example, the Worcestershire club secretary and the previous West Indies Test player Learie Constantine, transparently expressed that D'Oliveira was overlooked either on account of his race or in light of the fact that the MCC bolstered politically-sanctioned racial segregation. Some Labor government officials likewise communicated concern. John Arlott, while affirming that D'Oliveira had the right to be incorporated, proposed that to exhibit restriction to politically-sanctioned racial segregation, the MCC ought to maybe have chosen him regardless of whether this were not the situation. The general press took a more extensive view, with a few paper sections detailing that the choice seemed to have been made to abstain from culpable the South African government. As indicated by Williams, the open positions held by a great part of the MCC panel towards South Africa prompted doubts that D'Oliveira may have been forgotten essentially to spare the visit.
