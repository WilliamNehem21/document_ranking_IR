Ettelson was a solid supporter of the Pittsburgh Platform and its standards, which turned into the reason for what was later known as "traditional" Reform Judaism. The administrations he drove mirrored that: part cooperation in the administrations (which were for the most part in English) was constrained. While at Achduth Vesholom he moved administrations from Saturday to Sunday for a period, trying to improve participation. Indeed, even before his joining Children of Israel, the gathering had as of now significantly transformed its administrations; it never again held Jewish rights of passage, watched the laws of "kashrut", or enabled believers to take an interest in the Torah perusing. Beside the "Shema Yisrael" and "Kaddish", Hebrew or Aramaic supplications had been completely disposed of. In spite of the fact that he rolled out couple of ceremonial improvements himself, Ettelson proceeded with this custom, and stressed network administration over custom work on, advancing Judaism as a universalist religion with a mission of equity and harmony. The year he arrived he composed the Cross Cut Club, a between confidence assemble planned to counter religious preference. He filled in as its first president, and was its leader again in 1950. One of his drives there was the Union Civic Thanksgiving Service, an interdenominational eve-of-Thanksgiving administration that was held for various years. During the 1930s it held an incorporated gathering, and, subsequently, was not welcomed back to the setting the next year.
