Steiger's initial jobs, albeit minor, were various, particularly in TV arrangement amid the mid 1950s, when he showed up in excess of 250 live TV creations over a five-year time frame. He was spotted by Fred Coe, NBC's director of program improvement, who progressively gave him greater parts. Steiger believed TV to be what repertory theater had been for a before age, and considered it to be where he could test his ability with a plenty of various jobs. Before long subsequently he started getting positive surveys from commentators, for example, John Crosby, who noticed that Steiger consistently gave "easy enticing exhibitions". Among Steiger's credits were "Peril" (1950Ã¢ÂÂ 53), "Lux Video Theater" (1951), "Out There" (1951), "Stories of Tomorrow" (1952Ã¢ÂÂ 53), "The Gulf Playhouse" (1953), "Emblem Theater" (1953), "Goodyear Television Playhouse" (1953), and as Shakespeare's Romeo in "The First Command Performance of Romeo and Juliet (1957)" scene of "You Are There" in 1954, under chief Sidney Lumet. He kept on showing up in different playhouse TV creations, showing up in five scenes of "Kraft Theater" (1952Ã¢ÂÂ 54), which earned him acclaim from commentators, six scenes of "The Philco Television Playhouse" (1951Ã¢ÂÂ 55) and two scenes of "Schlitz Playhouse of Stars" (1957Ã¢ÂÂ 58). Steiger made his wide screen debut in 1953, with a little job in Fred Zinnemann's "Teresa", shot in 1951. Steiger, who depicted himself as "presumptuous", prevailed upon Zinnemann by commending his heading. Zinnemann reviewed that Steiger was "exceptionally well known, incredibly well-spoken and loaded with astounding recollections", and the two remained profoundly aware of one another forever.
