Writers bilingual in Kannada and Telugu gained popularity which caused interaction between the two languages, a trend that continued into modern times. The Veerashiva canon of the Kannada language was translated or adapted into Telugu from this time period. Palkuriki Somanatha (1195), a devotee of social reformer Basavanna, is the most well-known of these bilingual poets. The Chola chieftain Nannechoda (c.Â 1150) used many Kannada words in his Telugu writings. After the decline of the Hoysala empire, the Vijayanagara empire kings further supported writers in both languages. In 1369, inspired by Palkuriki Somanatha, Bhima Kavi translated the Telugu "Basavapurana" to Kannada, and King Deva Raya II (c.Â 1425) had Chamarasa's landmark writing "Prabhulingalile" translated into Telugu and Tamil. Many Veerashaiva writers in the court of the 17th century Kingdom of Mysore were multilingual in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit while the Srivaishnava (a sect of Vaishnavism) Kannada writers of the court were in competition with the Telugu and Sanskrit writers. 
Information from contemporary records regarding several writers from this period whose works are considered lost include: Maghanandi (probable author of "Rama Kathe" and guru of Kamalabhava of 1235), Srutakirti (guru of Aggala, and author of "Raghava Pandaviya" and possibly a "Jina-stuti", 1170), Sambha Varma (mentioned by Nagavarma of 1145), Vira Nandi ("Chandraprabha Kavyamala", 1175), Dharani Pandita ("Bijjala raya Charita" and "Varangana Charita"), Amrita Nandi ("Dhanvantari Nighantu"), Vidyanatha ("Prataparudriya"), Ganeshvara ("Sahitya Sanjivana"), Harabhakta, a Veerashaiva mendicant ("Vedabhashya", 1300), and Siva Kavi (author of "Basava Purana" in 1330).
