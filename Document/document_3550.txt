There had been congressional examinations concerning whether competitors and others were given ideal treatment to maintain a strategic distance from enrollment and, in mid 1954, Martin was drafted into the military, his recharged solicitation for a hardship release denied. He griped to a columnist that he was given more awful treatment than his individual fighters, permitted less end of the week passes and not permitted to play on the Fort Ord baseball crew. He missed the whole 1954 season, in which the Yankees, interestingly amid Martin's vocation with them, didn't win the flag, and a great part of the 1955 season. He was exchanged to Fort Carson in Colorado, where he was permitted to live off course. He played on and dealt with the baseball crew, and rose to the position of corporal. In August 1955, a leave of absence enabled him to come back to the Yankees and, when they won the flag, it was stretched out for the 1955 World Series. In spite of the fact that Martin batted .300 for the standard season, and .320 with four runs batted in amid the Series, the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in seven amusements, and Martin censured himself for letting down Stengel. He was released from the military later in October, having been granted the Good Conduct Medal.
