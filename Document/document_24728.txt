In 2012, Witherspoon started the production company Pacific Standard. The goal of the company was to produce movies with strong female lead roles, as she said that she was tired of seeing only movies with a strictly male focus being produced. Through the company, Witherspoon served as a producer in the film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel "Gone Girl", though she did not star. Indeed, Witherspoon and her producing partner "had little to do with the production of "Gone Girl"", leaving it to director David Fincher while focusing their efforts on another adaptation produced via Pacific Standard, that of Cheryl Strayed's memoir "", which began production in fall 2013 on the same day as "Gone Girl". Witherspoon starred in the project, portraying Strayed herself on her hike along the Pacific Crest Trail. "Wild" was released in December 2014 to critical acclaim; Michael Phillips of "Chicago Tribune" wrote in his review, "Witherspoon does the least acting of her career, and it works. Calmly yet restlessly, she brings to life Strayed's longings, her states of grief and desire and her wary optimism." "Wild" was promoted as Witherspoon's primary "comeback" vehicle following her previous career slump, and she earned her second Academy Award nomination for the role.
