Interspersed with his stage plays, Richardson made thirteen cinema films during the decade. On screen he played historical figures including Sir Edward Carson ("Oscar Wilde", 1960), WEGladstone ("Khartoum", 1966) and Sir Edward Grey ("Oh! What a Lovely War", 1969). He was scrupulous about historical accuracy in his portrayals, and researched eras and characters in great detail before filming. Occasionally his precision was greater than directors wished, as when, in "Khartoum", he insisted on wearing a small black finger-stall because the real Gladstone had worn one following an injury. After a role playing a disabled tycoon and Sean Connery's father in "Woman of Straw", in 1965 he played Alexander Gromeko in Lean's "Doctor Zhivago", an exceptionally successful film at the box office, which, together with "The Wrong Box" and "Khartoum", earned him a BAFTA nomination for best leading actor in 1966. Other film roles from this period included Lord Fortnum ("The Bed Sitting Room", 1969) and Leclerc ("The Looking Glass War", 1969). The casts of "Oh! What a Lovely War" and "Khartoum" included Olivier, but he and Richardson did not appear in the same scenes, and never met during the filming. Olivier was by now running the National Theatre, temporarily based at the Old Vic, but showed little desire to recruit his former colleague for any of the company's productions.
