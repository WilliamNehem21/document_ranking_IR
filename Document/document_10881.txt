In 1909, Australian partner Trumper moved from Paddington, a suburb on Sydney's south shore to Chatswood on the northern side of the harbor, where Macartney lived. Macartney and Trumper played together for Gordon Cricket Club on the north shore and turned out to be dear companions. Macartney consistently rehearsed on the Trumper family's patio turf pitch. Trumper's movement made progressively visit gatherings conceivable, since the Sydney Harbor Bridge was not to open until 1932, and the main method for going between either side of the narrows was by ship. Trumper was viewed as the "crown sovereign of the brilliant period of cricket", the best and most up-to-date batsman of his time, and a standout amongst the most exquisite strokemakers ever. Under Trumper's impact, Macartney turned out to be increasingly venturesome and courageous; Unlike their English partners, the Australians were glad for their unconstrained play. Macartney worshipped Trumper as both a cricketer and an individual, and was to be a pall carrier when Trumper kicked the bucket in 1915 at 37 years old. Nonetheless, dissimilar to Trumper, Macartney was known for his propensity for "strolling", the demonstration of leaving the ground previously or in opposition to an umpire's choice if a batsman realizes that he is out. On one event, Macartney felt so remorseful that the umpire had erroneously precluded him not in spite of a reasonable edge that he endeavored to discard his wicket with a wild airborne shot. In any case, the ball went for six, and Trumper, his batting accomplice at the time, scolded him, saying that his good karma would be adjusted by events when the umpire would give him out inaccurately.
