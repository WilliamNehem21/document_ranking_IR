In Croatian tradition, objects of two different types are referred to as "badnjak". The first type includes leaved branches cut from Turkey oaks or hazel trees, up to long with as many catkins as possible. Such a branch used to be placed on Christmas Eve morning above the house door, under the eaves, or on the roof, and had an aesthetic role. The other type includes logs cut usually from oak trunks. In the evening the family used to ritually bring three such logs into the house and burn them on the hearth. These practices are no longer performed, but in some places a modified form of badnjak is used: a cross is carved into the bark of pieces of firewood which are burned in kitchen stoves on Christmas Eve. In Bulgaria, the youngest man of the family goes on the Eve into a forest to cut down an oak, elm, or pear tree, which will be used as the "badnik" (Ð±ÑÐ´Ð½Ð¸Ðº). After the man brings it into the house, a hole is bored in one end of the "badnik" and filled with wine, cooking oil, and incense. The hole is plugged, and that end of the log is wrapped with a white linen cloth before the "badnik" is festively burned on the hearth.
