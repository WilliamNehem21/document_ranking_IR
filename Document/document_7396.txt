Gifford arrives, and the vast majority of the town goes to the celebratory occasion, where Chef sings a tune to tempt her. Mr. Army takes his situation in a tall book vault, however he is disappointed to see that Gifford is holed up behind an impenetrable glass bubble. Wendy and Stan arrive and attempt ineffectively to stop Mr. Army, saying that they comprehend his agony, yet when Stan coincidentally reignites Garrison's resentment, he chooses to proceed with the death. Similarly as he is going to shoot, Cartman's new tremendous weight makes the stage breakdown, catapulting Gifford off it, and making the projectile hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is moved through the air and skewered on a flagpole. Gifford's guardians whisk Gifford away, costing a baffled Cartman his opportunity to be on TV. Wendy makes that big appearance and uncovers that Cartman undermined his exposition, yet the townspeople are too disturbed about Gifford's takeoff to mind. Mr. Army is taken to a psychological clinic, where Mr. Cap is set into a straitjacket. Mr. Battalion apologizes to the children for costing the town an opportunity to be on TV, despite the fact that Kyle discloses to him that Cartman is presently showing up on television show "Geraldo" due to his colossal heftiness. Then, Chef is lying in bed with Gifford post-coital while viewing "Geraldo".
