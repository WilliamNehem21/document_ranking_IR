The tollway specialist held a strip cutting and commitment function on Veterans Day (November 11), 2007, authoritatively renaming the whole length of I-355 the Veterans Memorial Tollway. Functions were hung on the tollway close to the 127thÃÂ Street trade in Lemont, at 147thÃÂ Street in Homer Glen, and at USÃÂ 6 in New Lenox. Notwithstanding the devotion, the tollway specialist supported a Charity Walk/Run/Roll and "Roll the Tollway", a philanthropy pre-opening bike ride on the interstate's south augmentation. In the wake of taking note of the accomplishment of the celebration, a tollway representative declared designs to rehash the occasion every year, including the conclusion of the whole southern augmentation. He later cleared up the tollway's position, demonstrating that while the augmentation would presumably not be shut completely later on, a conceivable ride over the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge might be held. At around 10:00ÃÂ p.m. on November 11, a gathering of Illinois State Police vehicles and tollway upkeep vehicles escorted the primary drivers southbound along the I-355 expansion, ceasing at each trade to evacuate blockades. When the support teams started to evacuate blockades along the northbound paths of the augmentation, a gathering of 50 to 60ÃÂ vehicles had accumulated behind the groups.
