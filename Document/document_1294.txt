In mid-1893, Cao Thang proposed a full-scale assault on the commonplace seat of NghÃ¡Â»Â An and the encompassing posts. The arrangement proposed to Phan included redirections toward the south and the preparation of right around 2,000 men in ordinary military strategies. Unconvinced of its reasonability, Phan reluctantly endorsed the arrangement. The troops were excited, yet in the wake of overwhelming a few little posts "in transit", the fundamental power was bound while assaulting the French fortress of No on September 9, 1893. Alongside his sibling, Cao Thang was mortally injured while driving an unsafe frontal assault with 150 men, and the powers withdrew in chaos. Phan respected the loss of Cao Thang as a huge one, conceding as much in conveying the tribute and burial service address. As per the antiquarian David Marr, there was proof that Phan unmistakably understood the points of interest and restrictions of delayed opposition. In spite of the fact that Phan had recently expressed that he was not anticipating extreme achievement, the guerrilla chief suspected that it was imperative to continue constraining the French so as to show to the masses that there was an option in contrast to what he felt was a pessimist disposition from the HuÃ¡ÂºÂ¿ court.
