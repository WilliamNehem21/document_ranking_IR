Structure 7 is a large platform located to the east of the plaza on TerraceÂ 3 in the Central Group and is considered to have been one of the most sacred buildings at Takalik Abaj due to a series of important finds associated with it. StructureÂ 7 measures and dates to the Middle Preclassic, although it did not attain its final form until the latter part of the Late Preclassic. Built upon the northern part of StructureÂ 7 are two smaller structures, designated as StructuresÂ 7A and 7B. In the Late Classic, Structures 7, 7A and 7B were all refaced with stone. StructureÂ 7 supports three rows of monuments aligned northâsouth that may have served as an astronomical observatory. One of these rows was aligned with the constellation Ursa Major in the Middle Preclassic, another aligned with Draco in the Late Preclassic, while the middle row was aligned with StructureÂ 7A. Another important find in StructureÂ 7 was a Late Classic cylindrical incensario given the name "La NiÃ±a" by archaeologists due to its prominent female appliquÃ© figure. It dates to the earliest levels of K'iche' occupation of the site and is high and wide at the base. It was found together with a large quantity of other offerings including further ceramics and fragments of broken sculptures.
