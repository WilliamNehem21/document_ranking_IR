Within "C.Â pepo", the pumpkins, the scallops, and possibly the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of "C.Â pepo" have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of "C.Â pepo", botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin.
"C.Â argyrosperma" is not as widespread as the other species. The wild form "C. a." subsp. "sororia" is found from Mexico to Nicaragua, and cultivated forms are used in a somewhat wider area stretching from Panama to the southeastern United States. It was probably bred for its seeds, which are large and high in oil and protein, but its flesh is of poorer quality than that of "C.Â moschata" and "C.Â pepo". It is grown in a wide altitudinal range: from sea level to as high as in dry areas, usually with the use of irrigation, or in areas with a defined rainy season, where seeds are sown in May and June.
