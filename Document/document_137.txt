Past cricket, Headley's prosperity was viewed as essential. Of Headley's gathering with the lord of England in 1939, the West Indian essayist Frank Birbalsingh stated: "That one of usÃ¢ÂÂa dark manÃ¢ÂÂcould shake the hand of a ruler presented potential outcomes in the past undreamt of in our frontier backwater of racial inadequacy, mental subjection and political feebleness." Manley takes note of that Headley rose to progress during a period of political arousing in Jamaica, when the dark larger part of the populace were progressively resolved to end the minority standard of landowners and challenge the bigotry of the time. As per Manley, the white collar classes saw in Headley "the consolation which they required. He showed dark limit." The white high societies were glad for his accomplishments as a West Indian, yet Manley states "it was to the dark masses that Headley had the most profound significanceÃÂ ... [He] turned into the concentration for yearning of a whole people for verification: evidence of their own self-esteem, their very own ability. Moreover, they needed this confirmation to be laid at the entryway of the white man who claimed the world which characterized their conditions." Manley sees the title of "Chart book" in donning terms, yet in his conveying "the expectations of the dark, English-speaking Caribbean manÃÂ ... He was dark perfection exemplified in a white world and in a white game."
