Williams proclaimed his goal to represent race on 15 May 1860, one day after MÃÂ¼ller. In his composed accommodation to Convocation, he underlined his appropriateness for arrangement in the light of Boden's evangelist wishes. Subsequent to giving subtleties of his life and profession, especially his involvement in Sanskrit acquired at Haileybury, he expressed that for as long as 14 years "the one thought of my life has been to make myself altogether familiar with Sanskrit, and by each mean in my capacity to encourage the investigation of its writing." He guaranteed voters that, whenever chose, "my most extreme energies will be given to the one item which its Founder had in view;Ã¢ÂÂ in particular "The advancement of a progressively broad and basic learning of the Sanskrit language, as a methods for empowering Englishmen to continue in the change of the locals of India to the Christian religion." Unlike MÃÂ¼ller, he respected the investigation of Sanskrit "as mainly a way to the minister transformation of the Hindus as opposed to as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. Along these lines, Dowling says, he could endeavor to divert consideration from his "humble capacities in traditional Sanskrit" when contrasted with MÃÂ¼ller's "globally recognized accomplishments".
