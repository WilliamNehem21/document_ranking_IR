After "Rio de Janeiro" was purchased by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of "Rio de Janeiro".
The "New-York Tribune" reported in late April that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5Â million offer for "Moreno" alone, which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12Â million). The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did. Similarly, news outlets reported in late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile's first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of "Rio de Janeiro", but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.
