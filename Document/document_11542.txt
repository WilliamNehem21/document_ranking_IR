After a few additional endeavors at chose office, he was again chosen to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for development of the cash supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white repayment. As the Greenback Party went into disrepair, another enemy of enormous business outsider, the People's Party ("Populists"), emerged. Weaver sorted out the gathering and was their chosen one for president in 1892. This time he was increasingly effective and increased 8.5 percent of the prominent vote and won five states, yet at the same time missed the mark regarding triumph. The Populists converged with the Democrats before the finish of the nineteenth century, and Weaver ran with them, advancing the application of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. In the wake of filling in as city hall leader of the place where he grew up, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver resigned from his quest for elective office. He kicked the bucket in Iowa in 1912. A large portion of Weaver's political objectives stayed unfulfilled at his demise, however many happened in the next decades.
