On March 1, 1861, Davis selected General P. G. T. Beauregard to order every single Confederate troop in the region of Charleston, South Carolina, where state authorities arranged to claim Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to set up his powers however anticipate requests to assault the post. Inside the fortress the issue was not of the comforts of geopolitical posing but rather of survival. They would be out of sustenance on the fifteenth. The little Union army had however about six officers and 127 troopers under Major Robert Anderson. Broadly, this incorporated the baseball society saint Captain (later significant general) Abner Doubleday. Increasingly implausible yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being provoked for his name yet not his devotion toward the Northern reason. The recently introduced President Lincoln, not wishing to start threats, educated South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a little armada of boats from the naval force yard in New York to resupply however not re-implement Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The U.S. President did not advise CSA President Davis of this planned resupply of nourishment and fuel. For Lincoln, Davis, as the pioneer of a rebellion, was without legitimate remaining in U.S. issues. To manage him is offer authenticity to the defiance. The way that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the purpose behind keeping up the army on the island post. He educated Pickens that the resupply mission would not arrive troops or weapons except if they were discharged upon. As it turned out, similarly as the supply ships moved toward Charleston harbor, the assault would start and the flotilla viewed the scene from 10 miles adrift.
