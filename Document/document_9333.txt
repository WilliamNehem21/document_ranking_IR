Mukesh Chhabra was the movie's throwing executive. Swara Bhaskar was the first to be thrown in the job of Chanda Sahay, a single parent of a 15-year-old young lady. At first distrustful about playing a mother on screen right off the bat in her profession, she altered her opinion in the wake of perusing the content. To comprehend the job better, Bhaskar remained with expert household aides from Agra, Uttar Pradesh, where the film is set. She purchased such props as a purse, a brush, a pocket mirror, and elastic "chappals". She additionally drew direction from her mom's encounters of dealing with a high school little girl. After the film's discharge, Bhaskar said in a meeting with "Day by day News and Analysis" that her companions in the Hindi film industry prompted her not to take up the job as they felt it would be a "lifelong suicide" for her. She consented to take an interest in the undertaking on the grounds that "the story remained in [her] mind". The following job to be thrown was that of the 15-year-old girl of the hero. Ria Shukla was chosen for the job after tryouts in Lucknow. Ratna Pathak and Pankaj Tripathi assume supporting jobs in the film. A gathering of around 25 nearby kids played the understudies at the school.
