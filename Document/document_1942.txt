Alabama Governor Thomas Kilby had a three-part commission headed by Marie Bankhead Owen choose what plan the state ought to prescribe for the coins, and it requested recommendations from the general population, yet dismissed all entries. On June 1, 1920, Owen proposed to Kilby that one side have a delineation of the Alabama Capitol building and the other jugate heads of James Monroe (president at the season of Alabama's affirmation in 1819) and Woodrow Wilson (president in 1919). Kilby sent the proposition, which included harsh portrayals, to the Director of the Mint, Raymond T. Bread cook, who sent it to the Commission of Fine Arts for its assessment. Its stone carver part, James Earle Fraser, planner of the Buffalo nickel, hated the legislative hall as a subject, feeling that structures never made an interpretation of well to coins. At the point when this revisited channels to Owen, her advisory group reevaluated the structure, and on June 24 she kept in touch with Baker substituting a plan dependent on the Seal of Alabama, centered upon the bird that was then a piece of it, and if that was not worthy, Owen recommended the structure of the half dollar ebb and flow in 1819. There the issue rested for a whole year.
