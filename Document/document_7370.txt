Cruttwell's regulatory capability was perceived in 1930, when he was chosen essential of Hertford College. In this office, he built up the college's geology school and masterminded that the main Oxford residency in topography was based at Hertford. Amid his residency as chief, he finished his most critical scholarly works, including his Great War history (1934) which earned him the Oxford level of DLitt. In 1936 Cruttwell conveyed the Lees-Knowles Lecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, under the title "The Role of British Strategy in the Great War". Around the same time he distributed a memoir of the Duke of Wellington and in 1937 delivered his last significant scholarly work, "A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World". An endeavor in 1935 to imitate his granddad and become one of the college's individuals from parliament fizzled when, as a Conservative applicant in the general race of 1935, Cruttwell was crushed. An Independent, A. P. Herbert, beat him on the third tally in a solitary transferable vote framework. This was the first run through since the 1860s, that a Conservative had neglected to hold both of the two college situates, a mortification noted with relish by Waugh who harbored a profound threatening vibe towards his previous coach. As indicated by "The Times", Cruttwell had belittled the nature and assurance of the restriction and had underestimated his race as a Conservative for allowed. In first inclinations, he came base of the survey with just 1,803 votes, while his Conservative running mate, Lord Hugh Cecil, increased 7,365, very nearly five fold the number. Since he surveyed short of what one-eighth of the main vote cast a ballot, Cruttwell relinquished his store.
