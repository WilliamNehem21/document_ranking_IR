About a year into improvement, the group found that their second makerÃ¢ÂÂthe first having stopped Origin close to the start of advancementÃ¢ÂÂhad left the undertaking. Neurath later said that "neither [producer] had much contribution" in the amusement, and that, following the second's flight, the group invested energy with no maker by any stretch of the imagination. Bits of gossip circled that Origin intended to drop the task. Following a proposition by the group around this time, Spector, who had recently worked with Neurath on "Space Rogue", accepted the job of maker. Church later depicted this occasion as "a major win for everybody". Spector started to collaborate normally with the group by telephone and to visit the studio face to face. Neurath later stated, "Warren saw promptly what we were endeavoring to achieve with the diversion, and turned into our greatest victor inside Origin. Had not Warren ventured in this job at that organize, I don't know "Ultima Underworld" would have ever observed the light of day." Church said that Spector helped the group clean the diversion and "make it genuine", and that Spector's past involvement in the business empowered him to keep the group concentrated on finishing the amusement. He clarified that Spector "had that capacity to support me and the remainder of the folks reset, from the 10,000 foot view perspective on somebody who has done it previously."
