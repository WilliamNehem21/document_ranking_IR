In July 2011, Scott said that he was recording "Prometheus" with both grown-up arranged R and increasingly available PG-13 film appraisals as a main priority, enabling the more grown-up substance to be cut if important without hurting the general introduction. Scott said he had a duty to twentieth Century Fox to have the capacity to introduce a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio requested, enabling it to be seen by a more extensive potential gathering of people. When gotten some information about the rating, Scott stated, "the inquiry is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it ought to be, which is R? Monetarily it makes all in all a differenceÃÂ ... basically it's kinda RÃÂ ... it's not just about blood, it's about thoughts that are extremely upsetting." Scott likewise said that, paying little heed to rating, he would display the most forceful cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be compelled to bargain the film's quality to keep away from a R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox affirmed that the film had gotten a R-rating and would be discharged with no cuts being made. As indicated by Scott, the scene of Shaw carefully expelling her outsider posterity was the huge reason for the prohibitive rating, and it was recommended that evacuating the scene would be the best way to pick up a lower one. A battle scene among Shaw and the Engineer was abbreviated in light of the fact that Scott chose that Shaw straightforwardly injuring the Engineer reduced his job. Scott finished up work on the film in March 2012.
