In early 1929 Gernsback went bankrupt, and his magazines were sold to Bergan A. Mackinnon; both "Amazing Stories" and "Amazing Stories Quarterly" continued publication under their new ownership, and Sloane remained as editor. Within two months Gernsback had launched two new magazines, "Air Wonder Stories" and "Science Wonder Stories". Gernsback still believed in the educational value of science fiction, and contrasted his goals for "Air Wonder Stories" with the fiction appearing in aviation pulps such as "Sky Birds" and "Flying Aces", which were "purely 'Wild-West'-world war adventure-sky busting" stories, in his words. He planned to fill "Air Wonder" with "flying stories of the future, strictly along scientific-mechanical-technical lines, full of adventure, exploration and achievement". Both "Air Wonder" and "Science Wonder" were edited by David Lasser, who had no prior experience as an editor and who knew little about sf, but whose degree from MIT had convinced Gernsback to take him on. Lasser printed work by some popular authors, including Fletcher Pratt, Stanton Coblentz, and David H. Keller, and two of the winners of the contests Gernsback frequently ran subsequently became well known in the field: Raymond Palmer, later the editor of "Amazing Stories", and John Wyndham, best known for his 1951 novel "The Day of the Triffids". The readership of the two magazines overlapped strongly, most readers being science fiction fans rather than aviation fans. With these two titles established, Gernsback added "Science Wonder Quarterly" in October 1929, also edited by Lasser. At the same time Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought stories from, asking for "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good "scientific" background", and in January 1930 he launched "Scientific Detective Monthly", edited by his deputy, Hector Grey, as a new cross-genre title, giving him four magazines in all.
