The rulers of the Vijayanagara empire maintained the well-functioning administrative methods developed by their predecessors, the Hoysala, Kakatiya and Pandya kingdoms, to govern their territories and made changes only where necessary. The King was the ultimate authority, assisted by a cabinet of ministers ("Pradhana") headed by the prime minister ("Mahapradhana"). Other important titles recorded were the chief secretary ("Karyakartha" or "Rayaswami") and the imperial officers ("Adhikari"). All high-ranking ministers and officers were required to have military training. A secretariat near the king's palace employed scribes and officers to maintain records made official by using a wax seal imprinted with the ring of the king. At the lower administrative levels, wealthy feudal landlords ("Goudas") supervised accountants ("Karanikas" or "Karnam") and guards ("Kavalu"). The palace administration was divided into 72 departments ("Niyogas"), each having several female attendants chosen for their youth and beauty (some imported or captured in victorious battles) who were trained to handle minor administrative matters and to serve men of nobility as courtesans or concubines.
The empire was divided into five main provinces ("Rajya"), each under a commander ("Dandanayaka" or "Dandanatha") and headed by a governor, often from the royal family, who used the native language for administrative purposes. A "Rajya" was divided into regions ("Vishaya" "Vente" or "Kottam") and further divided into counties ("Sime" or "Nadu"), themselves subdivided into municipalities ("Kampana" or "Sthala"). Hereditary families ruled their respective territories and paid tribute to the empire, while some areas, such as Keladi and Madurai, came under the direct supervision of a commander.
