Because many of the primary accounts contradict each other at times, it is impossible to provide a description of the battle that is beyond dispute. The only undisputed facts are that the fighting began at 9Â am on Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the battle lasted until dusk. Sunset on the day of the battle was at 4:54Â pm, with the battlefield mostly dark by 5:54Â pm and in full darkness by 6:24Â pm. Moonrise that night was not until 11:12Â pm, so once the sun set, there was little light on the battlefield. William of JumiÃ¨ges reports that Duke William kept his army armed and ready against a surprise night attack for the entire night before. The battle took place north of Hastings at the present-day town of Battle, between two hillsÂ â Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south. The area was heavily wooded, with a marsh nearby. The name traditionally given to the battle is unusualÂ â there were several settlements much closer to the battlefield than Hastings. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" called it the battle "at the hoary apple tree". Within 40 years, the battle was described by the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis as "Senlac", a Norman-French adaptation of the Old English word "Sandlacu", which means "sandy water". This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the battlefield. The battle was already being referred to as "bellum Hasestingas" or "Battle of Hastings" by 1087, in the "Domesday Book".
