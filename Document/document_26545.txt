Test cricket resumed in Australia with the visit of the English team in 1946â47. Before the Test matches started, the touring team played Victoria in a warm-up match. Johnson took 4Â wickets for 38Â runs in the English second innings but was unable to prevent the tourists from winning by 244Â runs. He was included in the Australian team for the First Test at Brisbane, scoring 47Â runs in the Australian total of 645. Once again Johnson was not given an opportunity to bowl as Australia won the match by an innings and 332Â runs. Johnson took his first Test wicket with only his third delivery in Test cricket, dismissing Len Hutton caught behind down the leg side in the Second Test in Sydney. Making use of the breeze, in one 11Â over stretch Johnson conceded only three runsâincluding eight maidens, taking one wicket. Johnson went on to take 6Â wickets for 42Â runs in the innings as England were bowled out for 255. Johnson, batting as a nightwatchman, joined Sid Barnes at the wicket late on the second day of the match, batting through until stumps. He was dismissed the next day having scored 7Â runs in an Australian total of 659. In the English second innings Johnson took another two wickets; England were dismissed for 371Â runs and lost the Test by an innings and 33Â runs.
