Gyllenhaal's break-out job was operating at a profit satire, "Secretary" (2002), a film around two individuals who set out on a commonly satisfying BDSM way of life. "The New York Times" pundit Stephen Holden noticed: "The job of Lee, which Maggie Gyllenhaal saturates with a controlled comic delicacy and sweetness, should make her a star." Mick LaSalle of the "San Francisco Chronicle" expressed: "Maggie Gyllenhaal, as the reckless secretary, is puzzling and, at minutes, thoughtful." The film got commonly great audits, and Gyllenhaal's execution earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress grant from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, her first Golden Globe designation, and an Independent Spirit Award assignment. "Secretary" was Gyllenhaal's first film job which highlighted full frontal bareness. Albeit awed with the content, she at first had a few misgivings about doing the film, which she accepted could convey an enemy of women's activist message. However after cautiously talking about the content with the movie's chief, Steven Shainberg, she consented to join the undertaking. In spite of the fact that demanding Shainberg did not abuse her, Gyllenhaal has said she felt "frightened when shooting started" and that "in the wrong handsÃÂ ... indeed, even in just marginally less wise hands, this motion picture could state something extremely unusual." Since at that point, she is monitored about talking about her job in the film, saying just that "notwithstanding myself, once in a while the dynamic that you are investigating in your work overflow into your life."
