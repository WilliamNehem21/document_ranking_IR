At 09:53, about 81ÃÂ seconds after Moosally's structure to stack and 20ÃÂ seconds after the left weapon had revealed stacked and prepared, Turret Two's middle firearm detonated. A fireball between and going at with a weight of extinguished from the inside firearm's open breech. The blast collapsed the entryway between the inside weapon room and the turret officer's stall and clasped the bulkheads isolating the middle firearm room from the left and right weapon rooms. The fireball spread through every one of the three weapon rooms and through a significant part of the lower dimensions of the turret. The subsequent flame discharged harmful gases, including cyanide gas from copying polyurethane froth, which filled the turret. Not long after the underlying blast, the warmth and flame lighted of powder packs in the powder-taking care of zone of the turret. After nine minutes, another blast, probably brought about by a development of carbon monoxide gas, happened. Each of the 47 crew members inside the turret were slaughtered. The turret contained the greater part of the power of the blast. Twelve crew members working in or close to the turret's powder magazine and annular spaces, found nearby the base of the turret, had the capacity to escape without genuine damage. These men were ensured by impact entryways which separate the magazine spaces from the remainder of the turret.
