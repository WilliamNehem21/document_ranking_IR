Meanwhile, Minh left the JGS base camp and made a trip to Gia Long Palace in a vehicle with his assistant and protector, Captain NguyÃ¡Â»Ân VÃÂn Nhung. Minh landed at the royal residence at 08:00 in full military formal uniform to manage the capture of DiÃ¡Â»Âm and Nhu. Minh had additionally dispatched a M-113 reinforced work force bearer and four jeeps to Gia Long Palace to transport a captured DiÃ¡Â»Âm and Nhu back to JGS home office for authority surrender. While Minh was en route to manage the takeover of the castle, Generals ÃÂÃÂ´n, TrÃ¡ÂºÂ§n ThiÃ¡Â»Ân KhiÃÂªm and LÃÂª VÃÂn Kim arranged the military home office for DiÃ¡Â»Âm's entry and a formal handover of capacity to the junta. DiÃ¡Â»Âm's photos were brought down and his statue was concealed. An extensive table secured with green felt was acquired with the goal of seating DiÃ¡Â»Âm for the handover to Minh and Vice President NguyÃ¡Â»Ân NgÃ¡Â»Âc ThÃÂ¡, who was to turn into the regular citizen Prime Minister. In a broadly broadcast occasion seen by universal media, DiÃ¡Â»Âm would "ask" the officers that he and his sibling be conceded outcast and refuge in a remote nation, which would be allowed. The siblings were then to be held in a protected spot at JGS central command while anticipating expelling.
