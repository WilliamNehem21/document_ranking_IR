At the Magic Box, Giles perceives that he should stand aside if Buffy is to confront her obligations in thinking about Dawn as opposed to depending on him ("Standing") and Tara finds an image of the overlook me-not bloom Willow used to do magic on her in a book of enchantment. Giles and Tara independently resolve to leave their loved ones, separately Buffy and Willow Ã¢ÂÂ Giles needs to leave Buffy to her benefit, while Tara needs to leave Willow since she has turned out to be sickened by Willow's mysterious control of their relationship ("Under Your Spell/StandingÃ¢ÂÂReprise"). Caught by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet's flunkies passes on a test from Sweet for Buffy to protect Dawn from The Bronze. Giles denies the posse to help Buffy, so she goes alone, notwithstanding having no will to do as such; in the long run Giles and the Scoobies alter their opinions and leave to make up for lost time. Despite the fact that Spike at first conceives that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he likewise alters his opinion and chooses to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is attracted to peril ("Walk Through the Fire").
