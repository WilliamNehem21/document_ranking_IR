In 1839, while Liszt proceeded with his movements, Marie went for broke of coming back to Paris with her girls. Her expectations of recuperating her status in the city were gouged when her persuasive mother, Madame de Flavigny, wouldn't recognize the youngsters; Marie would not be acknowledged socially while her girls were unmistakably in proof. Liszt's answer was to expel the young ladies from Marie and spot them with his mom, Anna Liszt, in her Paris home while Daniel stayed with attendants in Venice. By this implies, both Marie and Liszt could proceed with their free lives. Relations between the couple cooled, and by 1841 they were seeing little of one another; all things considered, both occupied with different issues. By 1845 the rupture between them was to such an extent that they were imparting just through outsiders. Liszt precluded contact among mother and girls; Marie blamed him for endeavoring to take "the products of a mother's belly", while Liszt demanded his sole ideal to choose the youngsters' future. Marie took steps to battle him "like a lioness", however before long surrendered the battle. Despite the fact that they were living in a similar city, she didn't see both of her girls for a long time, until 1850.
