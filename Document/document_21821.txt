The Supreme Court's 1982 "Plyler v. Doe" decisionâin a case involving illegal alien children (i.e., children born abroad who had come to the United States illegally along with their parents, and who had no basis for claiming U.S. citizenship)âhas also been cited in support of a broad application of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens and their children. A Texas state law had sought to deny such children a public education, and the Texas government had argued that "persons who have entered the United States illegally are not 'within the jurisdiction' of a State even if they are present within a State's boundaries and subject to its laws." A "dictum" footnote in the Court's majority opinion remarked that according to "Wong Kim Ark", the Fourteenth Amendment's phrases "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" (in the Citizenship Clause) and "within its jurisdiction" (in the Equal Protection Clause) were essentially equivalent; that both expressions referred primarily to physical presence and not to political allegiance; and that the "Wong Kim Ark" decision benefited the children of illegal as well as legal aliens. As a result, the court rejected the claim that Fourteenth Amendment "jurisdiction" depended on whether someone had entered the U.S. legally or not. Although the four dissenting justices disagreed with the opinion of the Court regarding whether the children in question had a right to a public education, the dissenters agreed with the majority regarding the applicability of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens. James Ho considers "Plyler v. Doe" to have "put to rest" any doubt over whether the sweeping language regarding jurisdiction in "Wong Kim Ark" applies to all aliens, even illegal aliens.
