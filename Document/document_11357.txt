In the north, Philip I governed until his passing, after which Cleopatra Selene asserted the privileges of her youngsters with Antiochus X to the empty honored position. The ruler's cases of power were not commonly acknowledged by the Syrians, and the general population of Antioch welcomed Tigranes II to govern Syria, being baffled by the Seleucids' steady polite wars. The year in which this occasion occurred is discussed; 83 BC is, with no verification, regularly acknowledged as Philip I's time of death by most of researchers who depend on the record of Appian, who doled out a rule of fourteen years for Tigranes II, which finished in 69 BC. Oliver D. Hoover recommended that Tigranes II attacked Syria just in 74 BC, with Philip I governing until 75 BC in Northern Syria, permitting Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus XIII to guarantee the nation unopposed for some time. A contention for Cleopatra Selene and her child being the sole claiments of Syria in 75 BC is an announcement by Cicero: the Roman statesman composed that Antiochus XIII and his sibling were sent to Rome by their mom in 75 BC. They came back to Syria in 240 SE (73/72 BC); the siblings asserted the position of royalty of Egypt dependent on their mom's claim. To inspire the Roman Senate, the ruler blessed her youngsters with adequate resources, which incorporated a jeweled candlestick that was committed to the sanctuary of Jupiter Capitolinus. The Senate would not hear their appeal for the Egyptian honored position, be that as it may, as indicated by Cicero, their "by right" appropriate to the Syrian royal position which they had acquired from their precursors was at that point recognized.
