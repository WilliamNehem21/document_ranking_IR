The Bearcats' kickoff was come back to the Tech 14-yard line, and the Hokies started the primary drive of the second from last quarter. Evans scrambled for four yards, yet Oglesby lost four yards on a keep running amid the following play. Confronting third and ten, Taylor got the first down with a 11-yard run, yet bobbled the ball toward the finish of the play. The free ball was gathered up by Boone, who propped the Hokies' drive up at the Tech 30-yard line. After the bobble, Evans kept running for seven yards and Taylor finished a 10-yard go to Roberts for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Coale then scrambled for seven yards on an end-around, and his run was trailed by one by Boone, who kept running for 16ÃÂ yards and a first down at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. Two additional surges by Roberts and Evans brought about another first down, yet once the Hokies passed the Cincinnati 20-yard line, the Bearcats' barrier hardened and denied the Hokies another first down. Confronting fourth down, Tech again sent in Keys, who kicked a 35-yard field objective. The kick stretched out Tech's lead to 13Ã¢ÂÂ 7 with 8:32 staying in the quarter.
