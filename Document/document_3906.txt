Hand's investigation of logic at Harvard left an enduring engraving on his idea. As an understudy, he lost his confidence in God, and starting there on he turned into a cynic. Hand's perspective on the world has been recognized as relativistic; in the expressions of researcher Kathryn Griffith, "[i]t was his dedication to an idea of relative qualities that provoked him to address conclusions of the Supreme Court which seemed to put one esteem completely over the others, regardless of whether the esteem was that of individual opportunity or equity or the security of youngsters from vulgar writing." Hand rather looked for target models in established law, most broadly in indecency and common freedoms cases. He saw the Constitution and the law as trade offs to determine clashing interests, having no ethical power of their own. This disavowal that any perfect or characteristic rights are epitomized in the Constitution drove Hand to a positivistic perspective on the Bill of Rights. In this methodology, arrangements of the Constitution, for example, opportunity of press, the right to speak freely, and break even with security, ought to be deciphered through their wording and in the light of authentic investigation as opposed to as "guides on solid events". For Hand, moral qualities were a result of their occasions and a matter of taste.
