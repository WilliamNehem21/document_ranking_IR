Two music recordings were shot for the tune, both coordinated by Motellet Film. The primary adaptation, discharged on 15 March 2013, highlighted the vocalist at a casual get-together while getting alcoholic with her visitors. It achieved a large portion of a-million perspectives on YouTube before it was made private one year after its discharge. The second form was shot at a Swedish club more than three days and delineates Lo in a night of celebrating with her companions. The artist played out the single at celebrations, for example, South by Southwest and the Hangout Music Festival, and included it on the set rundown of her visits, the Queen of the Clouds Tour (2015) and the Lady Wood Tour (2017). The single was granted the Song of the Year grant at the Grammis of 2015 in Sweden. A remix by record generation couple Hippie Sabotage, titled "Remain High", was discharged as the third single from "Truth Serum" and achieved the main ten in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and different nations in Europe. The tune has been secured by craftsmen, for example, Vin Diesel, whose execution was a tribute to his late companion Paul Walker, and Kelly Clarkson, who played out the track on her Piece by Piece Tour (2015).
