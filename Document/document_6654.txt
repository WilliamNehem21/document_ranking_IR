The top of this species grows up to 15ÃÂ cm (6ÃÂ in) in measurement, however some North American examples achieve 30ÃÂ cm (12ÃÂ in) over. Dim yellow to pale-or walnut-dark colored, it is somewhat fleece at first and later winds up smooth with a matte gloss. It is at first raised before straightening out with development. The top skin does not strip far from the tissue. The pores underneath are white at first and turned out to be pinkish with development. They are adnate to the stalk and lump downwards as the mushroom ages. The pores wound carmine or caramel, frequently creating corroded dark colored spots with age, and number around a couple for each millimeter. The cylinders are long with respect to the extent of the top, estimating somewhere down in the center piece of the top. The stalk is at first bulbous before extending and diminishing in the upper part; the lower some portion of the stalk stays swollen, some of the time contracting at the base where it appends to the substrate. It quantifies Ã¢ÂÂ once in a while to Ã¢ÂÂ tall, and wide, and can swell out to crosswise over at the base. It is lighter in shading than the top, and secured with a coarse darker system of markings, which have been compared to fishnet leggings in appearance. Depicted as "appealing" in appearance, the tissue is white or velvety, and pink underneath the top fingernail skin; the substance can likewise create pinkish tones where it has been cut. It has a slight smell, which has been portrayed as lovely, just as faintly horrendous. The substance is milder than that of different boletes, and will in general become progressively light as the mushroom develops. Creepy crawlies seldom invade this species.
