The League settled a question between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the previous Ottoman region of Mosul in 1926. As indicated by the British, who had been granted a League of Nations order over Iraq in 1920 and in this manner spoke to Iraq in its remote undertakings, Mosul had a place with Iraq; then again, the new Turkish republic guaranteed the region as a major aspect of its memorable heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish individuals, was sent to the area in 1924; it found that the general population of Mosul did not have any desire to be a piece of either Turkey or Iraq, however in the event that they needed to pick, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission prescribed that the district stay some portion of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the command over Iraq for an additional 25 years, to guarantee the self-sufficient privileges of the Kurdish populace. The League Council received the suggestion and chose 16 December 1925 to grant Mosul to Iraq. Despite the fact that Turkey had acknowledged League of Nations' intervention in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), it dismissed the choice, scrutinizing the Council's position. The issue was alluded to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which decided that, when the Council settled on a consistent choice, it must be acknowledged. In any case, Britain, Iraq and Turkey approved a different arrangement on 5 June 1926 that generally pursued the choice of the League Council and furthermore alloted Mosul to Iraq. It was concurred that Iraq could at present apply for League enrollment inside 25 years and that the command would finish upon its affirmation.
