Since 1998, the dark stork has been appraised as an animal groups ofÃÂ least concernÃÂ on theÃÂ IUCN Red ListÃÂ of Endangered Species. This is on the grounds that it has a substantial rangeÃ¢ÂÂmore than 20,000ÃÂ kmÃÂ (7,700ÃÂ mi)Ã¢ÂÂ and in light of the fact that its populace is thought not to have declined by 30% more than ten years or three ages and along these lines is anything but a fast enough decrease to warrant a helpless rating. All things being equal, the condition of the populace by and large is hazy, and in spite of the fact that it is broad, it isn't plenteous anyplace. Dark stork numbers have declined for a long time in western Europe, and the species has just been extirpated from Scandinavia. The populace in IndiaÃ¢ÂÂa noteworthy wintering groundÃ¢ÂÂis declining. Already a customary winter guest to the Mai Po Marshes, it is currently only from time to time observed there, and has all the earmarks of being in decrease in China by and large. Its living space is changing quickly in quite a bit of eastern Europe and Asia. Different preservation measures have been taken, including Wetlands International's Conservation Action Plan for African dark storks, which centers around improving the wintering states of the feathered creatures which breed in Europe. It is ensured by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
