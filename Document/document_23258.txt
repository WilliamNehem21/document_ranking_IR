Subfossil bones of a starling-like bird were first discovered on Rodrigues by the police magistrate George Jenner In 1866 and 1871, and by the reverend Henry Horrocks Slater in 1874. They were found in caves on the Plaine Coral, a limestone plain in south-west Rodrigues. These bones included the cranium, mandible, sternum, coracoid, humerus, metacarpus, ulna, femur, tibia, and metatarsus of several birds; the bones were deposited in the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum. In 1879, the bones became the basis of a scientific description of the bird by ornithologists Albert GÃ¼nther and Edward Newton (the brother of Alfred). They named the bird "Necropsar rodericanus"; "Nekros" and "psar" are Greek for "dead" and "starling", while "rodericanus" refers to the island of Rodrigues. This binomial was originally proposed by Slater in an 1874 manuscript he sent to GÃ¼nther and Newton. Slater had prepared the manuscript for an 1879 publication, which was never released, but GÃ¼nther and Newton quoted Slater's unpublished notes in their own 1879 article, and credited him for the name. BirdLife International credits Slater rather than GÃ¼nther and Newton for the name. GÃ¼nther and Newton determined that the Rodrigues starling was closely related to the hoopoe starling, and they only kept it in a separate genus due to what they termed "present ornithological practice". Due to the strongly built bill, they considered the new species likely the same as the bird mentioned in Tafforet's account.
