Villani was a Guelph, however his book is considerably more taken up with an investigation into what is valuable and valid than with factional party contemplations. In a takeoff from Guelph legislative issues, he supported republicanism over government, adulating the thinker Brunetto Latini as "the ace and initiator in refining the Florentines, in making them gifted in great talking and in realizing how to guide and control our republic as indicated by political theory." However, Villani conceded in his composition that republicanism reproduced factional difficulty, that kind rulers like Robert of Naples were now and again expected to maintain control, and republicanism could end up oppressive on the off chance that it came to speak to just a single class, (for example, elite favoring of privileged people, vendors, or craftsmans). When enumerating the development of the Florence Cathedral and the craftsman Giotto di Bondone as the planner of the new ringer tower, Villani called him "the most sovereign ace of painting in his time." Villani's "Cronica" likewise gives the main known memoir of Dante Alighieri (1265Ã¢ÂÂ 1321), creator of the "Divine Comedy", who Villani depicted as haughty, hateful, and held. In his modified "Cronica" of 1322, Villani abbreviated Dante's life story and the measure of citations taken from his "Divine Comedy". Villani's activities are clarified by Richard H. Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, who express: "Obviously two decades after the artist's demise a traditionalist author firmly related to the Florentine state still felt obliged to remove himself from the most frank pundit of the premise of that state's notoriety."
