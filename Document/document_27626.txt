Originally, "Opisthocoelicaudia" was classified as a member of the family Camarasauridae, together with "Camarasaurus" and "Euhelopus". This classification was based on several shared features of the skeleton, most importantly the forked neural spines of the back vertebrae. In 1977, Borsuk-BiaÅynicka considered "Opisthocoelicaudia" closer to "Euhelopus" than to "Camarasaurus", placing it in the subfamily Euhelopodinae. A 1981 study by Walter Coombs and Ralph Molnar, on the other hand, considered it a member of the subfamily Camarasaurinae and therefore a close relative of "Camarasaurus". Today, both "Euhelopus" and "Opisthocoelicaudia" are classified outside the Camarasauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado and Rodolfo Coria showed "Opisthocoelicaudia" to represent a titanosaur and classified it within the family Titanosauridae. The name Titanosauridae is currently considered invalid by many scientists; instead, the name Lithostrotia is often used as an equivalent.
Within the Lithostrotia, "Opisthocoelicaudia" has been found to be closely related to the genera "Alamosaurus", "Neuquensaurus", "Rocasaurus" and "Saltasaurus", together forming the family Saltasauridae. Interrelationships of these genera are contested. Many scientists considered "Opisthocoelicaudia" to be most closely related to "Alamosaurus", with both genera forming a monophyletic group, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. Other scientists came to the conclusion that the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that "Alamosaurus" has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of "Pellegrinisaurus", and therefore is not related to "Opisthocoelicaudia" at al.
