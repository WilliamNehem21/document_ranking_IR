In his craving to support an affection for the farmland, particularly amid the Second World War, Beach Thomas was like different essayists on country matters, for example, G. M. Trevelyan and H. J. Massingham. He depicted Massingham as "maybe the best of every single present author on Rural England" and considered him among those essayists who were "so partial to the past that they appear to be now and then nearly to give up on what's to come". Malcolm Chase, a history specialist, says that these creators, including Beach Thomas himself, pushed a ultra-moderate, socially reactionary and optimistic rationality that shaped an imperative piece of a national discussion about the eventual fate of the land and agribusiness. This demeanor was combined with an expanding open enthusiasm for hobbies, for example, cycling, motoring and strolling; it was upheld by the distribution of well known, genuinely shabby and vivid articles, books and maps that provided food both to those seeking after such interests and the individuals who were worried about protection and the impacts of the inundation of urban and rural guests. John Musty, in his near scholarly survey of crafted by Beach Thomas and Massingham, trusts that Beach Thomas had a progressively "delicate touch" than Massingham, whose compositions have "as often as possible been made a decision as tight and reactionary"; he cites Beach Thomas as saying of any semblance of Massingham that they "lecture an unthinkable belief, yet an appealing one".
