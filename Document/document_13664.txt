The squadron got its fifth KC-30 on 3ÃÂ December 2012, and accomplished introductory working capacity in February 2013. It expected to achieve last working ability, with both blast and test and-drogue conveyance frameworks, in 2014. On 14ÃÂ September that year, the Federal government focused on conveying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as a component of an alliance to battle Islamic State powers in Iraq. The air ship was cleared for activities with the test and-drogue framework, as by this stage the blast framework was not prepared. The KC-30 started flying missions in Iraq on 1ÃÂ October 2014. The primary effective contact utilizing the blast framework (working together with another RAAF KC-30) occurred close Amberley on 13ÃÂ May 2015. In July, the Federal government reported the buy of two more KC-30s, taking No.ÃÂ 33 Squadron's armada to seven flying machine; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 traveler liners, changed over via Airbus Defense and Space at Getafe, close Madrid. The KC-30 sent to Iraq attempted the main operational utilization of the blast framework in late October 2015, refueling a RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No.ÃÂ 33 Squadron was granted the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most capable squadron of the earlier year, just as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy. The unit's 6th KC-30 was conveyed to Amberley in September 2017; the seventh and last airplane is expected to land in 2019, and will have a VIP traveler conveying capacity expanding its elevated refueling job.
