The palatal territory at the tip of "T. sethi's" nose was a sharp edge, like the bottom seen on the upper surface of the mandibular symphysis where the two parts of the lower jaw associated. Little cut like foramina (openings) on the lower side edges of the edge show that it had a horny covering throughout everyday life, like "Tupandactylus". The lower edge of the territory was to some degree bended, which likely made a little hole when the jaws were shut. Further back, preceding the nasoantorbital fenestra, the palatal edge turned into a solid, gruff, curved bottom. This convexity fit into the symphyseal rack at the front end of the lower jaw, and they would have firmly interlocked when the jaws were shut. The palatal edge finished in an emphatically curved region extraordinary to this species. The postpalatine fenestrae (openings behind the palatine bone) were oval and little, varying from those of related species. The ectopterygoid (bone in favor of the sense of taste) had expansive, plate-like sides, and was very much created contrasted with related species. The supraoccipital bone, which framed the rearmost base of the cranial peak, had muscle scars at its upper end (most likely relating to the connection of neck muscles).
