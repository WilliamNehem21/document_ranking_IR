In spite of the fact that Hewitt was playing out a "fantastic occupation" as indicated by Fifth Air Force administrator Major General Ennis Whitehead, he was dubiously expelled from his post in mid-November 1943 via Air Vice Marshal Jones, over allegations of poor control and assurance inside No.ÃÂ 9 OG. RAAF history specialist Alan Stephens later depicted the conditions of Hewitt's expulsion as "dim", and the charges prompting it as informal. Drakeford protected Hewitt's administration record, educating the Prime Minister that "the present position might be to a great extent, if not by any means, because of some transitory physical pressure realized by the strain of his imperative obligations as A.O.C. of No.ÃÂ 9 Group." Hewitt himself trusted that he had been spread by a displeased previous staff officer; student of history Kristen Alexander recognized Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, who might have a main influence in the "Morotai Mutiny" of 1945, as having made charges with respect to Hewitt's alleged "absence of equalization, vanity and absence of direction in the indictment of the war". Thus, Hewitt came back to his past position as Director of Intelligence at Allied Air Headquarters, while the Air Member of Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, took over as AOC No.ÃÂ 9 OG in December. General Kenney considered Hewitt's expulsion "terrible news".
