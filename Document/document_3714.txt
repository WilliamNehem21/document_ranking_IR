Dana Jan expressed the reason they had the diversion occur between "Divine force of War" and "Lord of War II" was on the grounds that "It appeared to bode well to fill in that void." Jan said with certain scenes, "the group didn't know how gamers would respond" in light of the fact that ""God of War" generally doesn't slow...down" and the group "stressed if these scenes would dazzle enough to keep player intrigued and still feel like "Divine force of War"." For riddles, Jan expressed that they endeavored to make the results startling in light of the fact that players expect that they should "push something, convey a body or crush something with [the] cutting edges." Hinting at a conceivable future portion from Ready at Dawn, Jan expressed that he is "charmed" by the flashbacks in "Lord of War" and "Lord of War II" and that "There's unquestionably a back story to Kratos that no one's addressed." For the character Deimos, Jan expressed that the main reference was very the "Chains of Olympus" finale. In the amusement, Helios states "Do you feel that they'll endure?" and Athena says "They should." Jan said that this line was "deliberately put" in that diversion and that there are likewise references to Deimos in "Divine force of War III". He affirmed that Kratos and Deimos are not twins and that while Kratos' dad is Zeus, "Deimos' dad is to a greater extent a puzzle." He affirmed that a character named Dominus shows up in the amusement (Kratos' unique name) and "the scene highlighting an officer named Dominus was a gesture to that." He additionally expressed that he doesn't have even an inkling where "Lord of War: Betrayal" fits sequentially in the arrangement.
