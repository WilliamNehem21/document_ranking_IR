The amusement's masterful heading was created by previous LucasArts individuals Derek Sakai and Dave Bogan; them two had chipped away at "The Curse of Monkey Island", "Break from Monkey Island", and a few prior LucasArts experience diversions. The diversion's last workmanship course was an endeavor to join the reasonable look of the initial two "Monkey Island" amusements with the capricious, adapted illustrations of the third. While those diversions include altogether two-dimensional illustrations, and their successor, "Getaway from Monkey Island", is to a great extent pre-rendered, "Stories of Monkey Island" is rendered in full 3D. Grossman clarified that both Telltale's craft division and amusement motor are arranged toward 3D illustrations advancement, and that the organization appreciates the advantages 3D offers in the zones of activity and cinematography. Improved limit with respect to the last brought about the arrangement of a "true to life executive": somebody to enable the fashioners to find scenes requiring increasingly emotional movement, and to help the artists and choreographers in making it. Amid advancement, the need of this position was featured by a ship fight scene in "Dispatch of the "Shouting Narwhal"", which was at first static and unexciting. This was helped by changing the season of day from nightfall to night, including precipitation and other climate impacts, and utilizing camera development to recreate unpleasant waters.
