While the "amir al-umara" Ibn Ra'iq was in power in Baghdad (936Ã¢ÂÂ 938) with al-Ikhshid's old companion al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat as vizier, relations with Baghdad were great. Following Ibn Ra'iq's substitution by the Turk Bajkam, be that as it may, Ibn Ra'iq got a designation by the caliph to the governorship of Syria and in 939 walked west to guarantee it from al-Ikhshid's powers. Ibn Ra'iq's arrangement goaded al-Ikhshid, who sent an agent to Baghdad to illuminate the circumstance. There Bajkam educated him that the caliph may designate whomever he picked, yet that it at last did not make a difference: it was military quality that would figure out who was legislative leader of Syria and even of Egypt, no arrangement by a nonentity caliph. On the off chance that either Ibn Ra'iq or al-Ikhshid developed triumphant from the contention, caliphal affirmation would before long pursue. Al-Ikhshid was considerably progressively rankled by the answer, and supposedly for a period even took steps to give one of his little girls to the Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im and to have coins printed and the Friday supplication read in his name instead of the Abbasid caliph, until the Abbasids formally reconfirmed his position. The Fatimids themselves were engrossed with the revolt of Abu Yazid and were unfit to offer any help.
