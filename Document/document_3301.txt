Barrymore picked up his first driving job in mid 1907, in the satire "The Boys of Company B" at the Lyceum Theater. Despite the fact that he was generally welcomed by the criticsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "The Washington Post" noticed that "his work has been articulated incredibly astute by the pundits wherever he played"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ now and again he proceeded with his amateurish stage conduct, which prompted a censure from John Drew, who went to an exhibition. After a short keep running in "Meanders" at the Garrick Theater, Barrymore was given the lead job of Mac in "A Stubborn Cinderella", both on visit and at the Broadway Theater in Boston. He had recently been procuring $50 every week amid his sporadic work however at this point appreciated a compensation increment to $175. He quickly showed up in "The Candy Shop" in mid-1909, preceding he assumed the lead job in Winchell Smith's play "The Fortune Hunter" at the Gaiety Theater in September that year. It was his longest-held job, running for 345 exhibitions until May 1911, at first at the Gaiety Theater in New York, and after that on visit. The commentator for "The New York Times" thought the play was, "acted with fine parody soul by John BarrymoreÃÂ ... [who] gave unquestionable signs the previous evening of developed and developing forces."
