Parker and Stone were discontent with the turkey assault subplot, which they felt "never truly went anyplace" and finished suddenly with no delightful end. They in any case included it since they felt committed to incorporate a B story, since each scene in the season so far had included one. Later in the arrangement, they said they understood this was a bit much and made numerous scenes without a B story. In spite of the fact that the pair loved the "result" of the Starvin' Marvin primary plot, they didn't have a clue how to end the turkey subplot, so they basically had the characters murder all the turkeys and guarantee that there were none left; they chose this abrupt closure was the most entertaining conceivable choice. Stone said of the subplot, "The turkeys were only a reason to have the "Braveheart" arrangement." The artists delighted in making the turkey fight scene, which was intended to be appeared in widescreen angle proportion while the remainder of the scene was energized typically. Be that as it may, the liveliness turned out to be exceptionally troublesome and set aside a long effort to do in light of the fact that it included a bigger number of characters and creatures in a single scene than had at any point been highlighted already in the show. A portion of the characters in the far foundation were energized in a dark and shadowyy style, which Parker said was less an enhanced visualization but rather more it was a "lighting impact meaning we would not like to draw every one of these individuals".
