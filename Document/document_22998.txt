Elena Pignatti, who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras in 1857âher words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Popeâtestified that "seven or eight years agoÂ ... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and it was said that he was going to die. Around then, one morningÂ ... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, sheâwithout mentioning the child's illnessâasked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the cribâ"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.
