The absence of trust Polk had in Taylor was returned by the Whig general, who dreaded the factional president was endeavoring to devastate him. In like manner, Taylor defied requests to stay close Monterrey. In March 1847, Polk discovered that Taylor had kept on walking south, catching the northern Mexican town of Saltillo. Proceeding past Saltillo, Taylor's military destroyed a bigger Mexican power, driven by Santa Anna, in the Battle of Buena Vista. Mexican setbacks were multiple times that of the Americans, and the triumph made Taylor significantly to a greater extent a military saint in the open's eyes, however Polk wanted to credit the valiance of the officers as opposed to the Whig general. In March 1847, Scott arrived in Veracruz, and rapidly won control of the city. With the catch of Veracruz, Polk dispatched Nicholas Trist, Buchanan's central assistant, to go with Scott's military and arrange a harmony settlement with Mexican pioneers. Trist was told to look for the cession of Alta California, New Mexico, and Baja California, acknowledgment of the Rio Grande as the southern outskirt of Texas, and American access over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Trist was approved to influence an installment of up to $30 million in return for these concessions.
