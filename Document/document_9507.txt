"Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All" is Metallica's first full-length studio collection to include bassist Jason Newsted after the demise of Cliff Burton in 1986. Newsted had recently played on Metallica's "", an all-inclusive play discharged in 1987. The band had planned to record the collection prior, yet was diverted the huge number of celebration dates booked for the late spring of 1987, including the European leg of the Monsters of Rock celebration. Another reason was frontman James Hetfield's arm damage in a skateboarding mishap. The band's past studio collection, "Ace of Puppets", denoted the finish of Metallica's agreement with the Music for Nations mark. Chief Peter Mensch needed the band to sign with British record wholesaler Phonogram Records, and Phonogram director Martin Hooker was quick to acquire the band's agreement. To convince Metallica to pick his name Hooker offered them a greater arrangement, "worth well over ÃÂ£1 million, which around then was the greatest arrangement we'd at any point offered anybody". His clarification was that the last figure for consolidated British and European offers of every one of the three Metallica collections was more than 1.5ÃÂ million duplicates. The collection title was uncovered in April 1988: "Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All", after the last expressions of the Pledge of Allegiance. The fine art was made by Stephen Gorman, in view of an idea created by Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich. It delineates a split statue of a blindfolded Lady Justice, bound by ropes with her bosoms uncovered and her scales flooding with dollar greenbacks. The title shows up spray painting style in the lower right corner.
