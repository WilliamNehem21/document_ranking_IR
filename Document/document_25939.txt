Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Kaiser removed Admiral von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet. Admiral von Pohl conducted a series of fleet advances in 1915 in which "KÃ¶nig Albert" took part; in the first one on 29â30 March, the fleet steamed out to the north of Terschelling and returned without incident. Another followed on 17â18 April, where "KÃ¶nig Albert" and the rest of the fleet covered a mining operation by the II Scouting Group. Three days later, on 21â22 April, the High Seas Fleet advanced toward the Dogger Bank, though again failed to meet any British forces. On 15 May, a bushing came loose in the ship's starboard turbine, which forced the crew to turn the engine off and decouple it. The center and port side shafts were still capable of propelling the ship at , however. On 29â30 May, the fleet attempted to conduct a sweep in the North Sea, but inclement weather forced Pohl to cancel the operation some off Schiermonnikoog. The fleet remained in port until 10 August, when it sortied to Helgoland to cover the return of the auxiliary cruiser . A month later, on 11â12 September, the fleet covered another mine-laying operation off the Swarte Bank. The last operation of the year, conducted on 23â24 October, was an advance in the direction of Horns Reef which concluded without result.
