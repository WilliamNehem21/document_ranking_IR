Worried about likely Whig resistance to the coinage charge, McKay got his kindred Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to present the bill in the Senate on February 1, 1849Ã¢ÂÂAtherton was administrator of the Senate Finance Committee. McKay presented a form of the bill into the House on February 20; banter started that day. The dollar was assaulted on the ground it would be excessively little; the twofold bird on the case that it would be intensely scraped available for use, and would wind up lightweight. McKay did not react substantively, however expressed that if nobody needed these categories, they would be unasked-for at the Mint, and would not be begat. Pennsylvania Representative Joseph Ingersoll, a Whig, criticized the bill, noticing that Patterson restricted the new divisions. Ingersoll expressed that a twenty-dollar piece would be "multiplied into an awkward and unparalleled size". All things considered, the bill accommodating the issuance of the gold dollar and twofold hawk passed the two houses by huge edges, and was marked into law by President James K. Polk on March 3, 1849. As indicated by numismatist David Lange, "the twofold bird was a broker's coin planned to disentangle exchanges of extensive totals between money related establishments and between countries".
