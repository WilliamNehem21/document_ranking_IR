The scarlet myzomela was depicted in three paintings in a set of early illustrations known as the Watling drawings, done in the first years of European settlement of Sydney between 1788 and 1794. Based on these, English ornithologist John Latham described it as three separate species in 1801. He based the description of "Certhia sanguinolenta" on an immature male moulting into adult plumage with incomplete red colouration, calling it the sanguineous creeper. In the same publication he described "Certhia dibapha", the cochineal creeper, and "C. erythropygia", the red-rumped creeper. English naturalist James Francis Stephens called it "Meliphaga sanguinea" in 1826 as a replacement name for Latham's "Certhia sanguinolenta". John Gould determined Latham's three names to be the one species in 1843, adopting the first-written binomial name as the valid one and relegating the others to synonymy, though the name "Myzomela dibapha" was occasionally used, particularly in New Caledonia. In 1990, Ian McAllan proposed that the first drawing did not confirm the species identity and proposed the name "Myzomela dibapha" to hence be the oldest validly published name, however Richard Schodde countered in 1992 that the drawing of an immature male could not be of any other species, meaning that "M. sanguinolenta" should stand. He added that the alternative proposed name had not been in use since the 1850s. The Wakolo myzomela, Sulawesi myzomela, Banda myzomela, and New Caledonian myzomela were all previously considered to be conspecific with the scarlet myzomela. There are no recognized subspecies nor regional variations; differences in observed plumage are due to wear after moulting.
