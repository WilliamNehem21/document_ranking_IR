Enlivened by Crowley's epic "Moonchild" (1917), Parsons and Hubbard planned to mysteriously treat a "supernatural kid" through perfect origination, which when destined to a lady some place on Earth nine months following the working's culmination would turn into the Thelemic savior epitomizing Babalon. To cite Metzger, the reason for the Babalon Working was "a challenging endeavor to break the limits of reality" encouraging, as per Parsons, the development of Thelema's ÃÂon of Horus. At the point when Cameron withdrew for a trek to New York, Parsons withdrew to the desert, where he trusted that a supernatural element psychographically given him "Liber 49", which spoke to a fourth piece of Crowley's "The Book of the Law", the essential holy content of Thelema, just as a major aspect of another holy content he called the "Book of Babalon". Crowley was puzzled and worried by the undertaking, griping to Germer of being "genuinely wild eyed when I think about the incompetence of these boors!" Believing the Babalon Working was cultivated, Parsons sold the Parsonage to designers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could keep on living in the mentor house, and he delegated Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now need to meet somewhere else for its customs.
