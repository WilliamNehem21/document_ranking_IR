The first Boden teacher, Horace Hayman Wilson, was chosen in 1832 and kicked the bucket on 8 May 1860. The race for his successor came during a period of open discussion about the idea of British evangelist work in India, especially after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The East India Company, which controlled the British regions until they were assimilated into the British Empire in 1858, had a general arrangement until 1813 of non-impedance with Indian traditions, including religion. Christian preachers required a permit to convert. By and by, most could work without a permit, aside from Evangelicals, who were viewed as excessively radical during a time when Christians from different foundations were increasingly arranged to be tolerant of different religions. As the Evangelical development developed in quality, it squeezed for more noteworthy endeavors to convey Christianity to India, thus the organization loosened up its way to deal with teachers in 1813. After 1858, the British government was hesitant to incite further distress by obstruction with neighborhood customs and religion, however a large number of those accused of running India were themselves Evangelicals thoughtful to endeavors to change over the nation. As Beckerlegge has remarked, "the encouragement of Christian mission had turned out to be inseparably bound up with endeavors to characterize Britain's job in India and without a doubt to legitimize Britain's quality in India." The issue was whether Britain was there just to oversee India or to "cultivate" it, and if the last mentioned, regardless of whether to draw up or wreck India's current culture and religion. A considerable lot of the individuals who bolstered expanded preacher work in India, says Beckerlegge, viewed the occasions of 1857 as "nothing not exactly a perfect judgment" on Britain's inability to convey Christianity to the nation.
