With the passing of his mom in January 1933, Hordern chose to seek after an expert acting vocation. He quickly accepted a position at a private academy yet became sick with poliomyelitis and needed to leave. Upon his recovery, he was offered a vocation as a voyaging sales rep for the British Educational Suppliers Association, a family-run business having a place with a previous school companion at Windlesham House. As an aspect of his responsibilities he invested some energy in Stevenage where he joined a novice dramatizations organization and showed up in two plays; "Adventure's End", in which he played Raleigh, and "Strategy", a piece which the performing artist loathed as he believed it to be "too out-dated". The two creations gave him the opportunity to work with a sign content, something which he observed to be useful for the remainder of his profession. That mid year he joined a Shakespearian performance center organization which visited stately homes all through the United Kingdom. His first execution was Orlando in "As You Like It", trailed by "Affection's Labor's Lost", in which he co-featured with Osmond Daltry. Hordern appreciated Daltry's acting capacity and later admitted to him being a consistent effect on his Shakespearean profession.
