Another factor that conveyed Cardus to England in 1948 was the possibility of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as boss music faultfinder of "The Sunday Times" was thought to be approaching. In any case, Newman had no expectation of resigning, and clarified that he would detest any successor-assign investigating his shoulder. Feeling insulted, Cardus left the paper and acknowledged an idea from the London "Night Standard" to be its music pundit. This new arrangement was brief; Cardus' long and rambling show audits were contradictory with this present paper's style, and were savagely cut by subeditors. Toward the finish of 1948 he was back in Australia, announcing his goal to settle there forever. This assurance, as well, was brief; the draw of London life demonstrated compelling. On account of the business accomplishment of his "Self-portrayal", distributed in 1947, and the quick appointing of a second self-portraying work, Cardus was not under prompt money related weight. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and in spite of the fact that he spent the English winter of 1950Ã¢ÂÂ 51 in Australia, expounding on the 1950Ã¢ÂÂ 51 England v. Australia Test arrangement for the "Sydney Morning Herald", London was from that point his perpetual home. Here he filled in as an independent author, in which job he continued his relationship with "The Manchester Guardian". In December 1951 he was delegated the paper's London music faultfinder, on a changeless salaried premise.
