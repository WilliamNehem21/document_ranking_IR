Such was the controversy over these works that two points were overlooked by the critics. First, Liszt's own attitude toward program music was derived from Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony, and he would have likely argued that his music, like the "Pastoral", was "more the expression of feeling than painting." Second, more conservative composers such as Felix Mendelssohn and Brahms had also written program music. Mendelssohn's "The Hebrides" Overture could be considered a musical seascape based on autobiographical experience but indistinguishable in musical intent from Liszt's symphonic poems. By titling the first of his Op. 10 Ballades as "Edward", Brahms nominated it as the musical counterpart of its old Scottish saga and namesake. This was not the only time Brahms would write program music.
Liszt's new works did not find guaranteed success in their audiences, especially in cities where listeners were accustomed to more conservative music programming. While Liszt had "a solid success" with "Prometheus" and "Orpheus" in 1855 when he conducted in Brunswick, the climate for "Les PrÃ©ludes" and "Tasso" that December in Berlin was cooler. His performance of "Mazeppa" two years later in Leipzig was almost stopped due to hissing from the audience. A similar incident occurred when Hans von BÃ¼low conducted "Die Ideale" in Berlin in 1859; after the performance, the conductor turned on the audience and ordered the demonstrators to leave, "as it is not customary to hiss in this hall." Matters improved somewhat in the following decades, thanks to the efforts of Liszt disciples such as BÃ¼low, Carl Tausig, Leopold Damrosch and Karl Klindworth. Nevertheless, audiences at the time found the compositions puzzling.
