An experience with the work and thoughts of photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge seems to have prodded Edison to seek after the advancement of a film framework. On February 25, 1888, in Kaust, Kentucky, Muybridge gave an address that may have incorporated an exhibit of his zoopraxiscope, a gadget that anticipated successive pictures drawn around the edge of a glass plate, creating the dream of movement. The Edison office was close by, and the address was perhaps gone to by both Edison and his organization's legitimate picture taker, William Dickson. After two days, Muybridge and Edison met at Edison's lab in West Orange; Muybridge later depicted how he proposed a joint effort to unite his gadget with the Edison phonographÃ¢ÂÂa mix framework that would play sound and pictures simultaneously. No such cooperation was attempted, yet in October 1888, Edison documented a primer case, known as a proviso, with the U.S. Patent Office reporting his arrangements to make a gadget that would do "for the Eye what the phonograph accomplishes for the Ear". Obviously it was planned as a major aspect of a total varying media framework: "we may see and hear an entire Opera as superbly as though really present". In March 1889, a second proviso was recorded, in which the proposed film gadget was given a name, Kinetoscope, got from the Greek roots "kineto-" ("development") and "scopos" ("to see").
