Scotland has dependably taken an interest independent from anyone else in a large portion of the significant competitions, for example, the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. At the Olympic Games the International Olympic Committee contract just grant a Great Britain Olympic football crew, speaking to the entire of the United Kingdom, to contend. Groups of novice players spoke to Great Britain at the Olympics from 1900 until 1972, yet the FA quit entering a group after then in light of the fact that the qualification among novice and expert was nullified. The effective offered by London for the 2012 Summer Olympics provoked the FA to investigate how a group could be entered. The SFA reacted by expressing that it would not take part, as it expected this would compromise the autonomous status of the Scotland national group. FIFA President Sepp Blatter denied this, however the SFA communicated worry that a future President could take an alternate view. An understanding was come to in May 2009 whereby the FA would be allowed to sort out a group utilizing just England-qualified players, however this was effectively tested by the British Olympic Association. Just English and Welsh players were chosen for the men's squad, however two Scottish players were chosen for the ladies' group.
