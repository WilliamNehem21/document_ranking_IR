This doubt rongorongo may not be completely syllabic is upheld by positional examples inside the writings. The conveyances of Rapanui syllables inside polysyllabic words and of rongorongo glyphs inside ligatures are fundamentally the same as, reinforcing the syllabic association. Be that as it may, monosyllabic words and separated glyphs act in all respects in an unexpected way; here rongorongo does not take a gander at all syllabic. For instance, all glyphs yet are authenticated in detachment, while just 50% of the 55 Rapanui syllables happen as monosyllabic words. Moreover, among those syllables which do happen in disengagement, their rate of doing as such is much lower than that of the glyphs: Only three syllables, , and , happen the greater part the time in disconnection (as linguistic particles), though a score of glyphs are more ordinarily found in detachment than not. Relevant investigation may help clarify this: Whereas Rapanui monosyllables are linguistic particles and by and large go before polysyllabic things and action words, with the goal that monosyllables once in a while happen together, separated rongorongo glyphs are "typically" discovered together, recommending an altogether different capacity. Pozdniakov conjectures that the distinction might be because of the nearness of determinatives, or that glyphs have double capacities, as phonograms in blend yet as logograms in segregation, parallel to the Maya content. Then again, no glyph approaches the recurrence, when in disconnection, of the articles "te" and "he" or the relational word "ki" in running content. It might be that these particles were basically not composed, yet Pozdniakov suspects that they were composed together with the accompanying word, just like the case with relational words and articles in Classical Latin and composed Arabic.
