As his boats prepared for activity, Brueys requested his chiefs to accumulate for a gathering on "Situate" and hurriedly reviewed his shore parties, albeit most had still not returned by the beginning of the fight. To supplant them, substantial quantities of men were removed from the frigates and conveyed among the boats of the line. Brueys likewise planned to draw the British armada onto the shores at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs "Alerte" and "Railleur" to go about as distractions in the shallow waters. By 16:00, "Alexander" and "Swiftsure" were likewise in sight, albeit some separation from the principle British armada. Brueys offered requests to desert the arrangement to stay at grapple and rather for his line to set sail. Blanquet challenged the request in light of the fact that there were insufficient men on board the French boats to both sail the boats and man the firearms. Nelson gave orders for his driving boats to back off, to enable the British armada to approach in a progressively composed arrangement. This persuaded Brueys that as opposed to hazard a night fight in bound waters, the British were intending to hang tight for the next day. He cancelled his prior request to cruise. Brueys may have been trusting that the postponement would enable him to slip past the British amid the night and hence pursue Bonaparte's requests not to connect with the British armada legitimately in the event that he could dodge it.
