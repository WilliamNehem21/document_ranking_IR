As Dean of Christchurch, Hilary reestablished the association to its customary round of religious services that had been surrendered by his forerunners, just as verifying gifts of benefits and terrains. He requested the composition of a past filled with the congregation at Christchurch, a book which still endures. Hilary was fruitless as a contender for the archbishopric of York against Henry Murdac in 1147, however Pope Eugene III remunerated him by delegating him to the see of Chichester. His nomination to York had been bolstered by Hugh de Puiset, at that point treasurer of York and later Bishop of Durham, and by Robert of Ghent, who was Dean of York and Lord Chancellor of England, just as by King Stephen of England. Hilary appears to have gotten the biggest number of votes, but since the race was debated by Murdac's supporters the outcome was alluded to the papacy, and Eugene picked Murdac. Hilary was designated to Chichester in July 1147, and he was sanctified on 3 August 1147. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, sanctified him at Canterbury, with Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, Robert, the Bishop of Bath, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, aiding the service. For various years, Hilary kept on holding the deanship in majority, which is the holding of at least two ministerial benefices immediately.
