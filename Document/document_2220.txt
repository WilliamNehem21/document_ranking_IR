The first thought for "Drakengard" began between Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki when they were working at Cavia. It was considered as an aeronautical fight diversion like "Pro Combat". The four-year advancement was Shiba's first undertaking as a maker. The group building up the diversion went under the moniker of "Task Dragonsphere". As advancement advanced, ground-based fights were likewise fused after the accomplishment in Japan of "Administration Warriors 2". Making the change from ground to aeronautical ongoing interaction was astoundingly troublesome for the group as they experienced issues with the PlayStation 2 equipment. Jun Iwasaki, president and CEO of Square Enix USA, portrayed "Drakengard" as an "ideal half breed of classifications", refering to its story and interactivity as reasons why it would be appreciated by players who needed a "more profound activity amusement". Talking in 2013, Shiba remarked that Cavia had been unpracticed in making activity amusements, and all things considered it was not up to the guidelines of its counterparts. The diversion's fight scenes were roused by movies, for example, the 1999 variant of "The Mummy" and its turn off "The Scorpion King", just as movies like "Dragonheart" and epic movies from Asia. Iwasaki was unfit to take up the situation of chief on account of different tasks he was included with: the situation rather went to Yoko Taro. Cavia staff part Yosuke Saito went about as the amusement's software engineerÃ¢ÂÂSaito would proceed to take a shot at later sections in the arrangement.
