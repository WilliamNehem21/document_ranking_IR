A portion of the cast was not content with Fincher's demanding ways and compulsiveness. A few scenes required upwards of 70 takes. Gyllenhaal was disappointed by the chief's techniques and remarked in a meeting, "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. A few spots, 90 takes. However, there is a halting point. There's a time when you go, 'That is the thing that we need to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would state, well, what do I do? Where's the hazard?" Downey stated, "I simply chose, beside a few times I needed to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he needed. I believe I'm an ideal individual to work for him, since I get gulags". Fincher reacted, "If a performing artist is going to give the job a chance to come to them, they can't despise the way that I'm willing to hold up as long as that takes. You know, the main day of creation in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and JakeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and it's the 56th take that is in the film". Ruffalo likewise sponsored up his executive's techniques when he stated, "as far as I can tell is, you go into another person's reality as a performing artist. You can set your desires aside and have an encounter that is new and pushes and changes you, or clutch what you figure it ought to be and have a difficult, resolute adventure that is loaded up with frustration and outrage."
