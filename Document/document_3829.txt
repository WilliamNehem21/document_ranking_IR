On leaving the ÃÂcole Niedermeyer, FaurÃÂ© was selected organist at the Church of Saint-Sauveur, at Rennes in Brittany. He took up the post in January 1866. Amid his four years at Rennes he enhanced his pay by taking private students, giving "innumerable piano exercises". At Saint-SaÃÂ«ns' normal inciting he kept on forming, however none of his works from this period endure. He was exhausted at Rennes and had an uneasy association with the ward minister, who accurately questioned FaurÃÂ©'s religious conviction. FaurÃÂ© was normally observed taking out amid the lesson for a cigarette, and in mid 1870, when he swung up to play at Mass one Sunday still in his night garments, having been out throughout the night at a ball, he was approached to leave. Very quickly, with the watchful guide of Saint-SaÃÂ«ns, he verified the post of right hand organist at the congregation of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, in the north of Paris. He stayed there for just a couple of months. On the episode of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he volunteered for military administration. He made part in the move to raise the Siege of Paris, and saw activity at Le Bourget, Champigny and CrÃÂ©teil. He was granted a "Croix de Guerre".
