Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and depicted by Campbell as the genuine power behind the coin, slaughtered himself. The day preceding he passed on, he told a gathering of the enterprise that there were subsidizes enough to pay all obligations, and that Fraser was not owed any cash. Neither turned out to be the situation, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no cash to pay them. Actually, Fraser's charge of $1,200 was remarkable, and she endeavored to get paid even with the half dollars, yet her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid with a money order. The half dollars were not claimed by the company, as the Vancouver National Bank had propelled cash for them. Deals went to a virtual end before the finish of October. Texas coin seller B. Max Mehl offered to purchase the rest of the issue without needing any proof, yet this was rejected the same number of individuals had paid $1 for their coins. An aggregate of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for reclamation and softening, leaving 14,966 pieces extraordinary. As indicated by Swiatek and Breen, "given the remoteness and solely neighborhood nature of the festival, it is astonishing that upwards of fourteen thousand coins were sold."
