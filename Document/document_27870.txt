The isometric, flip-screen trend continued in Britain for several years. Apart from "Fairlight", "Sweevo's World" and "Get Dexter", other isometric flip-screen games included Jon Ritman's "Knight Lore"-inspired "Batman" (1986), "Head over Heels" (1987), "The Last Ninja" (1987), "La AbadÃ­a del Crimen" (1987), "Cadaver" (1990), and console games "Solstice" (1990) and "Landstalker" (1992). As players tired of the genre's similar reiterations, Ritman's games, in particular, brought new ideas. Sandy White, who developed the pre-"Knight Lore" isometric game "Ant Attack", was impressed at Ultimate's in-game "balance" and gutsy design decisions. The developer of "The Great Escape", another isometric game, considered "Knight Lore" to be more "a rival title than an inspiration", but it still spurred him to spend nine months making "Where Time Stood Still". "Retro Gamer" wrote that "Knight Lore" influence persisted 30 years later through titles such as "Populous" (1989), "Syndicate" (1993), "" (1994), and "Civilization II" (1996). The style also spread to computer role-playing games like "Baldur's Gate", "", "Diablo", and "Fallout". Though "GamesRadar" Matt Cundy reported in 2009 that isometric perspective was no longer as prominent a topic in game design, in 2014, Chris Scullion of "Vice" traced "Knight Lore" isometric influence to "The Sims 4" (2014) and "Diablo III" (2012).
