The credibility of the 1975 collection was addressed by an analyst of the remastered variant of The Band's "Music from Big Pink", issued in 2000. Dave Hopkins noticed that "Katie's Been Gone", which shows up as a little something extra track on the "Huge Pink" reissue, is a similar chronicle that showed up on "The Basement Tapes", however at this point "in surround sound and with improved sound quality past what the remastering procedure alone would give". Hopkins announced, "The real truth out in the open: 'Katie' and the other Band-just tracks on "The Basement Tapes" probably been purposefully muddied in the studio in 1975 so they would fit better nearby the Dylan material recorded in the storm cellar with a home reel-to-reel." Heylin likewise protests Robertson's going off The Band's melodies as beginning from the storm cellar sessions. By including eight Band accounts to Dylan's sixteen, he says, "Robertson tried to infer that the union among Dylan and The Band was unquestionably more equivalent than it was: 'Hello, we were composing every one of these melodies, doing our very own thing, gracious and Bob would once in a while come around and we'd swap a couple of tunes.'" Heylin affirms that "however uncovering in their own right, The Band tracks just dirty the official set and diminish its stature."
