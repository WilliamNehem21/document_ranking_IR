DÃÂ¶nitz was helped by top notch photos from a surveillance overflight by Siegfried Knemeyer, (who got his first Iron Cross for the mission), and which uncovered the shortcomings of the barriers and a bounty of targets. He coordinated Prien to enter Scapa Flow from its east by means of Kirk Sound, going toward the north of Lamb Holm, a little low-lying island among Burray and Mainland. Prien at first confused the more southerly Skerry Sound with the picked course and his abrupt acknowledgment that "U-47" was setting out toward the shallow blocked entry constrained him to arrange a fast swing toward the upper east. Superficially, and lit up by a splendid showcase of the aurora borealis, the submarine strung between the submerged blockships "Seriano" and "Numidian", establishing itself incidentally on a link hung from "Seriano". It was quickly gotten in the headlights of a taxi coastal, however the driver raised no alert. On entering the harbor legitimate at 00:27 on 14 October, Prien entered a triumphant in the log and set a south-westerly course for a few kilometers before turning around heading. Incredibly, the jetty had all the earmarks of being practically unfilled; obscure to him, Forbes' organization to scatter the armada had expelled probably the greatest targets. "U-47" had been going legitimately towards four warships, including the recently appointed light cruiser , secured off Flotta and Hoy 4 nautical miles (8ÃÂ km, 5ÃÂ mi) far off, yet Prien gave no sign that he had seen them.
