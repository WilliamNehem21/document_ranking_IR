Despite its simplicity, the music to "Space Invaders" was revolutionary for the gaming industry. Video game scholar Andrew Schartmann identifies three aspects of the music that had a significant impact on the development of game music:
In the first few months following its release in Japan, "Space Invaders" became popular. Specialty arcades opened with nothing but "Space Invaders" cabinets, and by the end of 1978 Taito had installed over 100,000 machines and grossed over 600 million in Japan alone. By 1980, Taito had sold over 300,000 "Space Invaders" arcade machines in Japan, and 60,000 machines in the United States within one year, where prices ranged from $2000 to $3000 for each machine. By mid-1981, "Space Invaders" machines had grossed more than four billion quarters, or $1Â billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million a year until 1982, by which time it had grossed $2Â billion in quarters (equivalent to $ in 2019), with a net profit of $450Â million (equivalent to $ in 2019). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing "entertainment product" of its time, with comparisons made to the then highest-grossing film "Star Wars", which had grossed $486Â million, with a net profit of $175Â million. "Space Invaders" earned Taito profits of over $500Â million.
