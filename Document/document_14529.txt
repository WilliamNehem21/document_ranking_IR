He was told there was no opening, however the paper's editorial manager, Abdul Samad Ismail, offered him the post of a wrongdoing journalist. Lat acknowledged, a choice he clarified was borne from need instead of decision: "It was an issue of survival. I needed to win cash to help bolster the family." around then, Lat's dad had fallen truly sick and couldn't work; Lat needed to turn into the provider of his family. Beside taking the activity, he kept contributing kid's shows to different productions. Lat was later exchanged to "Berita"s parent production, "New Straits Times". Moving all through the city to provide details regarding violations gave Lat chances to watch and cooperate with the hordes of lives in the urban scene, empowering him to accumulate material for his kid's shows and expanding his comprehension of the world.

Lat wound up persuaded that he was a disappointment at his chosen form of employment, and his discouragement drove him to delicate his abdication. Samad, trusting Lat had a splendid future with the press, angrily dismissed the letter.
