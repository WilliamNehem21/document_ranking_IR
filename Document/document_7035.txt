Sebree's last mission before his retirement saw him lead the Pacific Fleet on a voyage through ports in east Asia. The armada left San Francisco on SeptemberÃÂ 5, 1909, cruising west to the Philippines, with just concise stops in transit. Speed testing was a noteworthy objective of the early piece of the voyage and he and his armada of eight boats broke speed records by cruising to Honolulu in a little more than four days. Six of the eight boats had the capacity to make the voyage in that time; the "Colorado" and "West Virginia" had mechanical disappointments which kept them from finishing the voyage on schedule. On the "Colorado", those disappointments prompted the passings of two crew members because of a steam pipe blast. From Hawaii, the armada proceeded onward to Manila where the boats performed target practices and activities, just as being cleaned and repainted, before continuing their essential mission by cruising to Yokohama, Japan. In Japan, the armada scattered and little gatherings of cruisers were dispatched to the ports of British-controlled Hong Kong, Wusong in China, and Kobe, Japan. Subsequently, the armada returned home. Just before Sebree's retirement the Pacific Fleet was part into two: a littler Pacific Fleet and an Asiatic Fleet instructed by Rear Admiral John Hubbard. On FebruaryÃÂ 19, 1910, Sebree formally resigned and was supplanted as leader of the Pacific Fleet by Rear Admiral Giles B. Harber.
