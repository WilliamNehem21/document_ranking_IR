In late 1960 or early 1961, a new I-75/USÂ 10/USÂ 23 freeway was built from the north end of the Saginaw bypass to Kawkawlin, utilizing the Zilwaukee drawbridge (later replaced by the Zilwaukee Bridge) over the Saginaw River; when it opened, MSHD extended M-13 along the former route of USÂ 23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City to the end of the freeway at Kawkawlin. Another section connected the Whitmore Lake area with Brighton in the same timeframe. General Motors was bidding in 1961 to construct an electronic highway. USÂ 23 between Ann Arbor and Toledo was under consideration to be the location of this project; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead. By the end of the year, freeway sections opened to bypass Saginaw south and ran south to Birch Run, another connected south from Fenton to Hartland, and a third connected Milan with Dundee. The remaining gaps were eliminated with additional freeway openings in 1962: Brighton to Hartland opened in September, and Milan to Ann Arbor opened in November. The I-75/USÂ 23 freeway north of the Kawkawlin area to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 was shown on maps following USÂ 23's former route through Linwood and Pinconning after the change.
