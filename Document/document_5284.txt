The diversion's hero is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a Spartan warrior who broke his blood pledge to the god Ares in the wake of being deceived into slaughtering his family by his previous ace. The primary opponents are the three Furies: Megaera (Nika Futterman), Tisiphone (Debi Mae West), and the Fury Queen, Alecto (Jennifer Hale). The Furies are the gatekeepers of respect and the worst thing about tricksters, who rebuff those they esteem liable. They were brought forth from the ages long war between the Primordials, the creatures who made the Earth. Different characters incorporate the pledge attendant Orkos (Troy Baker), the child of Ares and Alecto, who was abandoned by the god as he was not the ideal warrior that Ares looked for; Aletheia (Adrienne Barbeau), the Oracle of Delphi with prophetic sight; the defiled Prophet Castor (David W. Collins) and his conjoined twin Pollux (Brad Grusnick), who usurped the prophet, choosing who can counsel her; and the Scribe of Hecatonchires (Robin Atkin Downes), the primary human detained by the Furies who has been keeping records to keep up his rational soundness. Kratos' significant other Lysandra (Jennifer Hale) and his little girl Calliope show up in a fantasy made by Alecto, and the King of Sparta (Crispin Freeman) and the Village Oracle (Susan Blakeslee) show up in a dream made by Tisiphone with the assistance of her well-known, Daemon.
