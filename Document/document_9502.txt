The book starts with Knight disclosing how he came to meet Joseph Gorman, and afterward he reveals to Gorman's story which "did not come in clear, exact, sequential request yet I needed to gather it from drifting and some of the time obscure discourse". Gorman says that Albert Victor's mom, Princess Alexandra, acquainted Walter Sickert with her child with the expectation that Sickert would show Albert Victor craftsmanship. Gorman claims that Albert Victor met one of Sickert's models, Annie Elizabeth Crook, a Catholic shop young lady, at Sickert's studio at 15 Cleveland Street, London. They took part in an extramarital entanglements, he says, and wedded in a mystery service with Sickert and Annie's companion, Mary Jane Kelly, going about as observers. Gorman asserts that Albert Victor and Annie's girl, Alice Margaret Crook, was conceived on 18ÃÂ April 1885, and that Albert Victor settled Annie and Alice into a loft in Cleveland Street. In April 1888, Gorman proceeds, Queen Victoria and the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury found Albert Victor's mystery. Gorman blames Salisbury for requesting an assault on the loft since he was worried about the possibility that that open information of a potential Catholic beneficiary to the royal position would result in an unrest. Gorman claims that Albert Victor was set in the authority of his family, while Annie was set in the care of Sir William Gull, who guaranteed her crazy; she went through the following 30 years floating all through establishments before passing on in 1920.
