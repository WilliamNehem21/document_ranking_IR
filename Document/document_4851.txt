In 2003, also, RKO Pictures went into a fight in court with Wall Street Financial Associates (WSFA). Hartley and Merrill guaranteed that the proprietors of WSFA falsely instigated them into consenting to an obtaining arrangement by disguising their "skeptical and ravenous" plans to buy RKO with the expectation just of destroying it. WSFA looked for a starter directive disallowing RKO's greater part proprietors from pitching their interests in the organization to any outsiders. The WSFA movement was denied in July 2003, liberating RKO to manage another potential buyer, InternetStudios.com. In 2004, that arranged deal fell through when InternetStudios.com clearly collapsed. The organization's insignificant contribution in new film creation kept on concentrating on its revamp rights: "Are We Done Yet?", in view of "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" (1948), was discharged in April 2007 to dreary audits. In 2009, "Past a Reasonable Doubt", a revamp of a 1956 RKO movie coordinated by Fritz Lang, fared far more detestable basically, accepting a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Two years prior, RKO had declared the starting of a ghastliness division, Roseblood Movie Company. By mid 2010, Roseblood's central goal had extended, as indicated by the RKO site, to include the "mainstream repulsiveness/spine chiller type ... youth-arranged full length movies that are restless, erotic, startling and business" A phase variant of "Top Hat" visited Great Britain in the second 50% of 2011. The latest RKO film coproductions are the generally welcomed "A Late Quartet" (2012) and the 2015 failure "Scarcely Lethal".
