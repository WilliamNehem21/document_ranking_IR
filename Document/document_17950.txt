In a retrospective review for AllMusic, John Bush gave "FÃ´rÃ§a Bruta" four-and-a-half out of five stars. He regarded it as one of Ben's best records and said it retained each musician's abilities over the course of "a wonderful acoustic groove that may have varied little but was all the better for its agreeable evenness". A reviewer for "The Boston Globe" said Ben's masterful performance of this musicâ"a fusion of bright samba and mellow soul"âstill sounded original and essential nearly forty years after its recording; recommended even for non-Lusophones, it "transcends language and era with an organic vibe and breezy spontaneity". "NOW Magazine"s Tim Perlich called it a "samba-soul heater", while Matthew Hickey from "Turntable Kitchen" deemed it "one of the most buoyantly textured and warmly melodic LPs ever recorded" and "Oba, LÃ¡ Vem Ela" among its "loveliest tunes". In "Impose" magazine, Jacob McKean highlighted the two opening tracks, finding "ZÃ© Canjica" particularly attractive, and believed "Apareceu Aparecida" features the album's most appealing hook. He also found Trio MocotÃ³ incomparable in their performance and the album elegant and exquisite overall, but added that Ben's nasally singing on "Terezinha" sounded unusual and the string section was given slightly too much emphasis on "Mulher Brasileira".
