In the wake of coming back from his get-away, Saadiq began composing and recording "The Way I See It", which took four months. In a meeting for "Sound on Sound", he talked about his solace level when coming back to Blakeslee Recording Company: "The music for this collection streamed naturally, normally, and since I have my very own studio I had the capacity to consummate it and require my investment to make it right. I had the capacity to live with it for quite a while, and I feel that had a ton to do with how the collection turned out." He composed the melodies spontaneously, regularly by playing guitar and ad libbing riffs. He in this manner sung them while playing each instrument each one in turn, including guitar, bass, and fundamental piano parts that he intended to incorporate on the accounts. He credited this disconnected way to deal with "the condition of the business" and glorified "bounc[ing] thoughts off other individuals, do some composition with them, take the material to my band and state, 'alright, how about we cut it,' with the ensemble as of now there. That is my fantasy. I'd wrench records out week after week on the off chance that I had staff journalists as they did at Stax and Motown".
