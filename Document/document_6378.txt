In May 2007 "Time" magazine ran an article by James Poniewozik titled "Is "Shrek" Bad for Kids?" which considered the negative consequences for offspring of being raised with fantasy parodies, rather than the first stories. Poniewozik referenced "Tricked!" stating, "I thought "Duped!" and the vast majority of the "Shrek" arrangement were hilariousÃÂ ... Yet, regardless of whether you eventually dismiss their messages, old fashioned fantasies are a piece of our social vocabulary. There's something a little miserable about children experiencing childhood in a culture where their fantasies come pre-caricaturized, the wariness, scrutinize and correction having been accomplished for them by the mom flying creatures of Hollywood." Cory Edwards composed into the magazine, communicating his comparative notions and expressing, "As the author executive of "Tricked", it might astonish you that I can't help but concur with James Poniewozik's article. Indeed, even as I was making the film, I made a similar inquiry: Are we mocking something that children ought to get the opportunity to encounter first, 'un-spoofed?' We put it all on the line to separate our film from "Shrek"s humor (and no, I don't think "Shrek" thinks about children). I would trust that "Tricked" and its spin-offs will be viewed as endeavoring to accomplish something real with its characters, as opposed to search for the following joke to the detriment of honesty. We as a whole need the genuine old stories of fantasies, regardless of whether we let it be known or not."
