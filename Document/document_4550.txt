The Writers Guild of America took to the streets on November 4, 2007Ã¢ÂÂthe day that the authors wrapped up the last draft of the content of "Meet Kevin Johnson". The scholars needed to hold the eight scenes until they had the capacity to deliver a greater amount of the period in light of the fact that the eighth scene has a "cool" yet uncertain cliffhanger that was not composed to end the season; they contrasted it with "the finish of an energizing book section [but] not the finish of the novel." ABC chose that the eight scenes would be disclosed from January to March, paying little heed to whether any more scenes were created in the 2007Ã¢ÂÂ 2008 season. After the strike's end on February 12, 2008, the journalists begged ABC to air "Meet Kevin Johnson" on April 17 with the second case of scenes, because of "the eighth scene [being] non-conventional and the beginning of something new". Jorge Garcia, who plays Hurley Reyes, concurred that "it's a quite stunning end however it doesn't finish off the way our past [finales] have finished [because] it doesn't have that conclusion to it [and] finishes it could be said of cacophony." ABC in any case organized booking "Dark's Anatomy", "Terrible Betty" and "Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s restores just for April 24.
