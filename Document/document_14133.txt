Contrasted with most different raptors which for the most part home in April or May, bald eagles are early raisers: home structure or strengthening is frequently by mid-February, egg laying is regularly late February (here and there amid profound snow in the North), and hatching is normally mid-March and early May. Eggs bring forth from mid April to early May, and the youthful fledge late June to early July. The home is the biggest of any winged creature in North America; it is utilized more than once over numerous years and with new material included every year may in the end be as vast as profound, crosswise over and weigh ; one home in Florida was observed to be profound, over, and to weigh . This home is on record as the biggest tree home at any point recorded for any creature. Normally settles are utilized for under five years or somewhere in the vicinity, as they either breakdown in tempests or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. Be that as it may, one home in the Midwest was involved constantly for something like 34 years. The home is worked out of branches, more often than not in extensive trees found close water. When rearing where there are no trees, the bald eagle will settle on the ground, as has been recorded generally in territories to a great extent disconnected from earthly predators, for example, Amchitka Island in Alaska.
