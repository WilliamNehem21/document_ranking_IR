On joining the rest of the fleet, "Schlesien" became the flagship of the Commander of the Naval Forces of the North Sea, "Konteradmiral" ("KAdm"âRear Admiral) Alexander Werth, which was renamed on 1 January 1930 the Commander of Battleships. She was based in Wilhelmshaven. In May 1927, President Paul von Hindenburg came to Wilhelmshaven to visit the fleet. The annual fleet maneuvers were conducted in August and September, as they had been in the prewar years, and they culminated in a naval review on 14 September for Hindenburg. "KAdm" Wilhelm Prentzel replaced Werth on 29 September and in October 1928 he was in turn replaced by "KAdm" Walther Franz. In the course of 1928, "Schlesien" went on a fleet cruise in the Atlantic in July and conducted shooting training in August with the old ironclad, now target ship, . Another Atlantic cruise followed in April and May 1929. In February 1930, Franz, who had by then been promoted to the rank of "vizeadmiral", turned command of the unit to "KAdm" Richard Foerster. From 3 April to 6 June, "Schlesien" embarked on a major training cruise by herself to the Mediterranean Sea, during which she visited Messina, Sicily, where her senior officers met King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.
