Toward the beginning of January 2015, Ranariddh declared his goal to break down the CRPP and come back to FUNCINPEC. At a gathering congress on 19 January 2015, he was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president; his relative and past FUNCINPEC president, Norodom Arunrasmy turned into the main VP, while Nhek Bun Chhay was designated as second VP. In March 2015, Ranariddh held another gathering congress where he named four more VPs to the FUNCINPEC official panel. He likewise persuaded the congress to embrace another gathering logo, which had a plan practically indistinguishable that of the now-dead CRPP. Ranariddh bolstered the development of the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement in July 2015, an adolescent association went for collecting constituent help for FUNCINPEC from more youthful voters, which he was named as its privileged president. In November 2017, he came back to the National Assembly as an individual from parliament, following the disintegration of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, after which the FUNCINPEC got 41 of the 55 cleared seats. The gathering performed inadequately in the 2018 general race, neglecting to win a solitary seat in the National Assembly. In spite of the fact that they were sprinters up behind the Cambodian People's Party, their count of prominent vote was less than the 594,659 invalid tickets thrown by disappointed supporters of the previous resistance.
