Under manager George Scherger, the Sounds started the 1979 season poorly, before rallying to win 20 of 31Â games in late May and June. They entered the last day of the first half in first place, but lost their game to their cross-state rivals, the Chicks, and finished in second place at 35â34, a mere half game from winning the first-half title. The Sounds and Chicks met again on the last day of the second half in a split doubleheader; both games were won by Nashville to give them a 48â27 second-half record and the second-half title. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series, two games to one, before advancing to the league championship series against the Columbus Astros. Nashville entered game four one win away from capturing their first Southern League championship. In the top of the ninth inning with the game tied 2â2 and the bases loaded, Sounds catcher Dave Van Gorder hit a bases-clearing triple giving his team the lead. Reliever Geoff Combe struck out the last two batters in bottom half of the inning on the way to a 6â2 Sounds win, a three-games-to-one series victory, and the Southern League title. Schmittou wanted to give each player a $1,000 bonus for winning the pennant, but as that would have been against the National Association's rules, he settled for buying them championship rings instead. Combe, with a league-leading 27Â saves, won the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. The Sounds compiled an 83â61 composite record in their sophomore season.
