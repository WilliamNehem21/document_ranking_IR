"Of Human Feelings" was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had connected with Prime Time, an electric group of four presented on his 1975 collection "Moving in Your Head". The gathering contained guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's child. Tacuma was still in secondary school when Coleman enrolled him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the collection "Body Meta", which was discharged in 1978. Tacuma had played in a gathering for jazz organist Charles Earland, however Earland rejected him as he felt groups of onlookers gave extreme consideration regarding his playing. Coleman discovered Tacuma's playing perfect for harmolodics and urged him not to change. Despite the fact that Coleman's hypothesis at first tested his insight and view of music, Tacuma came to like the capricious job each band part was given as a soloist and melodist: "When we read Ornette's music we have his notes, yet we tune in for his expressions and expression the manner in which he needs to. I can take a similar song, at that point, and expression it like I need to, and those notes will decide the stating, the beat, the harmonyÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the majority of that."
