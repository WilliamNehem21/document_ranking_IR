On the resulting kickoff, Egekeze endeavored to dismiss the ball as it tumbled from the tee. This brought about an unexpected squib that was returned 36ÃÂ yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick endeavored to surge yet was halted for no addition. On the following play, he tossed the ball into the end zone, yet it was blocked by Maryland wellbeing Kenny Tate, bringing about a touchback. The Terps began their very own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett scrambled for 13ÃÂ yards and a first down. Turner at that point connected up with green bean collector Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a bogus begin punishment, the Terps were unfit to pick up a first down and punted the ball away. The ball folded into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada began the last drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then go for two first downs, grabbed another because of a pass obstruction call against Maryland, and mixed for one more. He at that point gave off to Taua, who surged 17ÃÂ yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-led the pack, 14Ã¢ÂÂ 13, with 46 seconds staying in the quarter.
