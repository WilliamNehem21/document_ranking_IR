More moves made spot on the fourteenth. Murat's powers joined Dupont at Albeck in the nick of time to drive off an Austrian assault from Werneck; together Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians toward the north toward Heidenheim. By night on the fourteenth, two French corps were positioned in the region of the Austrian settlements at Michelsberg, directly outside of Ulm. Mack was presently in a hazardous circumstance: there was never again any expectation of getting away along the north bank, Marmont and the Imperial Guard were floating at the edges of Ulm toward the south of the waterway, and Soult was moving north from Memmingen to keep the Austrians getting away south to the Tyrol. Inconveniences proceeded with the Austrian direction as Ferdinand superseded the protests of Mack and requested the departure of all rangers from Ulm, a sum of 6,000 troopers. Murat's interest was so powerful, be that as it may, that just eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat proceeded with his badgering of Werneck and constrained him to surrender with 8,000 men at Treuchtlingen on 19 October; Murat additionally took a whole Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, at that point cleared on towards Neustadt a der Donau and caught 12,000 Austrians.
