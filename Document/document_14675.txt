With a vast segment of his armada no longer battleworthy, Howe was unfit to continue his scan for the French escort in the Bay of Biscay. The Admiralty, however uninformed of Howe's particular conditions, realized a fight had occurred through the landing of HMS "Bold" in Portsmouth, and was setting up a second undertaking under George Montagu. Montagu had come back to England after his fruitless May voyage, and was refitting in Portsmouth when requested to ocean once more. His power of ten boats was expected to both spread Howe's withdrawal from Biscay, and find and assault the French grain guard. Montagu came back to ocean on 3 June, and by 8 June was off Ushant looking for indications of either the French or Howe; obscure to him, neither had yet entered European waters. At 15:30 on 8 June Montagu spotted sails, and before long recognized them as the adversary. He had found Cornic's squadron, which was likewise watching for the caravan and the returning armadas. Montagu gave pursue and drove Cornic into Bertheaume Bay, where he barred the French squadron medium-term, wanting to convey them to activity the next day. Be that as it may, on 9 June, Montagu located 19 French boats showing up from the westÃ¢ÂÂthe leftovers of Villaret's armada. Quickly turning his boats, Montagu cruised south to abstain from getting to be caught between two powers which may effectively overpower him. Villaret and Cornic gave pursue for multi day before turning east towards the security of the French ports.
