As indicated by Brothwell, Lindow Man is a standout amongst the most intricate instances of "pointless excess" in a swamp body, and conceivably has custom significance as it seemed to be "indulgent" for a direct homicide. Archeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand propose that lowland bodies may have been identified with religious practice, in spite of the fact that there is division in the scholarly network over this issue. On account of Lindow Man, researchers banter whether the slaughtering was murder or done as a feature of custom. Anne Ross, a specialist on Iron Age religion, recommended that the demise was a case of human penance and that the "triple passing" (throat cut, choked, and hit on the head) was an offering to a few unique divine beings. The wide date run for Lindow Man's passing (2ÃÂ BC to 119ÃÂ AD) implies he may have met his death after the Romans vanquished northern England in the 60sÃÂ AD. As the Romans prohibited human penance, such planning would open up different conceivable outcomes. This end was accentuated by student of history Ronald Hutton, who tested the elucidation of conciliatory demise. Connolly proposes that as Lindow Man was discovered bare, he could have been the casualty of a vicious theft.
