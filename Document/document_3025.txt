LÃÂ¼ and associates doled out "Xixiasaurus" to the family Troodontidae dependent on its high tooth-check, tightening between the crowns and underlying foundations of the teeth, close pressing of teeth close to the tip of the dentary, and unmistakable notch for the neurovascular foramina on the dentary. They discovered "Xixiasaurus" to be most firmly identified with "Byronosaurus" of Mongolia, and recommended the two may have shaped a clade with "Urbacodon" from Uzbekistan comprising of troodontids with unserrated teeth, which emanated crosswise over Asia (while taking note of that serrations had been lost autonomously in various gatherings of theropods). A 2012 phylogenetic examination by the scientist Alan H. Turner and partners rather discovered "Xixiasaurus" to have a place in a clade with "Sinovenator" and "Mei" (both likewise from China), because of sharing a maxillary procedure of the premaxilla that isolated the maxilla from the nasal behind the narial opening. In 2016, the scientistss Alexander Averianov and Hans-Dieter Sues did not recognize a clade framed of troodontids with unserrated teeth, however observed them to be progressive sister taxa to an increasingly inferred (or "propelled") clade of troodontids with serrated teeth. They recommended that the D-formed cross-segment of the premaxillary teeth could be one conceivable element joining "Xixiasaurus", "Byronosaurus", and "Urbacodon".
