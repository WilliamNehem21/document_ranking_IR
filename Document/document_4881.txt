Rhodes, its horizon overwhelmed by the monstrous statue, the Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under ambush by Kratos, the God of War, and his Spartan armed force. The Lair of Typhon, covered up in an obscure area, is a snow-topped mountain and jail of the Titans Typhon and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is an immense island situated at the edge of the world and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to lethal snares, riddles, and beasts. On the edges of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which shrouds the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last fight. Past the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: an immense partition that obstructs the route to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of the Chasm is the domain of TartarusÃ¢ÂÂjail of the Titan Atlas, sentenced to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of the Fates is likewise loaded up with snares and beasts, while the last fight happens on Mount Olympus, home to the divine beings.
