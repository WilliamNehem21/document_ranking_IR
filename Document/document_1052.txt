Encourage et al. contend that it is impossible there were two episodes, a shooting that was examined, and a harming that was not, on the grounds that Brown's appearance under the steady gaze of the court is normal to the two stories, yet is known to have just happened on account of the shooting murders. They advance the view that regardless of whether the two episodes occurred, the first story of the shooting murders has been changed through the channel of the "pioneer legend" into one where Brown is recalled not for carrying out a monstrosity, however for an epic steed ride. This change incorporated the transforming of an unfeeling shooting into a wily and aloof "set and overlook" harming, where the Aboriginal exploited people are "complicit in their own downfall" by taking the flour. They land at the judgment that, by focussing on a harming as opposed to a shooting, the story plays down the earnestness of the wrongdoing. Further, they see that the homicide of Aboriginal individuals viably turned into a plot gadget, while the steed ride ended up fundamental to the legend. They reason that the advancement of the story is "demonstration of the impact of the 'pioneer legend' in molding White Australia's perspective on the past".
