The most powerful storm to affect the Gulf of Thailand in more than 35Â years, Gay produced swells that caught many ships in the region off-guard. At least 16 vessels were reported missing by 5 November, including the Unocal Corporation oil drilling ship "Seacrest". According to survivors, the vessel received no warning of the developing typhoon. Just when all crew members were about to abandon ship, the eye of Typhoon Gay passed over. Winds fluctuated violently and changed direction, preventing the ship from remaining stabilized despite being within safe operating limits. The vessel abruptly capsized with all 97 crew members on board during the overnight hours of 3 November, before any life boats could be deployed. Initial rescue attempts on 4 November were hampered by rough seas. Two days after the sinking, four rescue ships and two helicopters in the region were searching for survivors; four people were rescued from the wreckage on 6 November. Divers from the Thai Navy were sent to search the capsized vessel for anyone trapped inside. Of the crew, only 6 survived; 25 bodies were recovered, and the remaining 66 members were presumed dead. Losses from the sinking of the "Seacrest" totaled $40Â million. Another 20 cargo and fishing ships sank during the storm, resulting in 140 fatalities.
