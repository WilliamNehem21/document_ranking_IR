Amid the winter of 1926Ã¢ÂÂ 27, with different competitors inaccessible, Gilligan was picked to commander a MCC group which visited India; the side was not completely delegate and did not play Test matches. In five star recreations, he scored three fifties and, bowling rarely, took ten wickets on the visit. The group, the first to visit India under the shades of the MCC, was exceptionally fruitful. Gilligan left the greater part of the everyday association to his bad habit skipper, Raleigh Chichester-Constable, and did not pay attention to his discourse making obligations especially. He in any case had a few issues to manage. One of his players, Jack Parsons, rejected for religious motivations to play in any matches in which play occurred on a Sunday; Gilligan took steps to send him home however at last he consented to play on condition that he could leave at an early stage a Sunday to go to religious administrations. Parsons was likewise transparently incredulous of racial and social separation that he saw. Gilligan mediated at one moment that his group's experts were avoided from certain solicitations in Calcutta and told their hosts that nobody would go to the capacities if the experts were excluded. Both the donning and social projects for the visit were requesting, and Gilligan needed to go to most capacities inspired by a paranoid fear of culpable the European or Indian hosts. The individuals from the group were left depleted, requiring the utilization of fortifications to their number, including the incidental utilization of English cricketers who were instructing in India, and on a few events, the Maharajah of Patiala, who was an individual from the MCC and qualified for play.
