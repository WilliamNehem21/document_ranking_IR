The entire river lies within the nearly flat Pamlico terrace, giving it an overall gradient of per mile (km); it is one of the flattest major rivers on the continent. Its proximity to the ocean in the lower basin affects its rise and fall with tides and salinity. Tides regularly affect water levels as far south as Lake George; when combined with extreme winds, the river's tidal effects can extend to Lake Monroe away and have on occasion reached Lake Harney. Tides typically raise the river level about at Jacksonville, decreasing some to at Orange Park where the river widens, and increasing back to at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate. However, the estimated rate of discharge between the Ocklawaha River and the center of Jacksonville ranges from per second. The nontidal discharge at the mouth at Mayport averages per second, but with tides it exceeds per second, and following heavy rains combined with tides can top per second. Farther upriver, the discharge rate ranges from per second near Lake Poinsett to per second near DeLand. The confluence of numerous springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River causes the average discharge to increase by per second between Lake Harney and DeLand, representing the greatest annual average increase of streamflow along the St. Johns.
