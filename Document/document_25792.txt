Frank Cifaldi of Gamasutra covered a speech by Jaffe on the development of "God of War" at the 2006 D.I.C.E. Summit in Las Vegas. Cifaldi said ""God of War" was a rare opportunity for a game designer" because Sony gave Jaffe nearly complete creative control to develop a game on his terms with a substantial budget. He stated that Jaffe wanted to make the game "out of passion, not fear, and that it would be a game that [Jaffe] himself, as a game player, would want to play". Jaffe said the 1981 film "Raiders of the Lost Ark" also inspired the development of "God of War"; he wanted to make players feel like he felt as a child watching that film, but did not want to put the player in the role of an adventurer, referencing "The Legend of Zelda" games. He elaborated that "God of War" was designed to be simplistic and forward-moving, but the game "is not innovative or unique, and that's intentional". Jaffe said that their system was shallow and "it forced the team to constantly create new content to trapeze the player from one area of interest to the next". He said he understood modular game designâthe need to have great looking, high-detail levels without having to build and texture every minuscule piece of the environmentâbut "[he] was going to get bored" if they did not step outside of those boundaries.
