In 1987, the British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke found the described colour-pattern of "N. borbonicus" remiscent of "Psittacula" parrots, but considered "N. francicus" to be based on confused reports. In 2001 the British writer Errol Fuller suggested Dubois' account of "N. borbonicus" could either have referred to an otherwise unrecorded species or have been misleading, and found "N. francicus" to be "one of the most dubious of all hypothetical species". In 2007, Hume suggested that Rothschild had associated "N. borbonicus" with the Rodrigues parrot because he had mistakenly incorporated Dubois' account into his description of the latter; he stated the Rodrigues parrot also had red plumage (though it was all-green), and had been mentioned by Dubois (who never visited Rodrigues). Rothschild also attributed the sighting of "N. francicus" to Dubois, repeating the colour-pattern he had described earlier for the Rodrigues parrot, and this lead Hume to conclude that the name "N. francicus" was based solely on "the muddled imagination of Lord Rothschild". Hume added that if Dubois' description of "N. borbonicus" was based on a parrot endemic to RÃ©union, it may have been derived from the Alexandrine parakeet ("Psittacula eupatria"), which has a similar colouration, apart from the red tail.
