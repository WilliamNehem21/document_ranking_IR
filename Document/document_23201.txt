Meanwhile, German botanist Karl Friedrich von Gaertner had coined the name "Pentadactylon angustifolium" in 1807 from a specimen in the collection of Joseph Banks to describe what turned out to be the same species. The genus name derived from the Greek "penta-" "five" and "dactyl" "fingers", and refers to the five-lobed cotyledons. The horticulturist Joseph Knight described this species as the narrow-leaved persoonia ("Persoonia angustifolia") in his controversial 1809 work "On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae", but the binomial name is illegitimate as it postdated Andrews' description and name. Carl Meissner described a population from the Tambo River in Victoria as a separate variety, "Persoonia linearis" var. "latior" in 1856, but no varieties or subspecies are recognised. German botanist Otto Kuntze proposed the binomial name "Linkia linearis" in 1891, from Cavanilles' original description of the genus "Linkia" but the name was eventually rejected in favour of "Persoonia". In 1919, French botanist Michel Gandoger described three species all since reallocated to "P.Â linearis"; "P. phyllostachys" from material collected at Mount Wilson sent to him by the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney, and "P.Â walteri" and "P.Â breviuscula" from Melbourne-based plant collector Charles Walter, whose records have been questioned. The short-leaved material of "P.Â breviuscula" was noted to have been collected in Queensland but this is now thought to have been incorrectly recorded. Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants, almost all of which turned out to be species already described.
