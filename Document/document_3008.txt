Following his triumph, the Palmyrene ruler expected the title King of Kings. Afterward, Odaenathus delegated his child Hairan I as co-King of Kings close Antioch in 263. In spite of the fact that he didn't take the Persian capital, Odaenathus drove the Persians out of every single Roman land vanquished since the start of Shapur's wars in 252. In a second crusade that occurred in 266, the Palmyrene ruler came to Ctesiphon once more; in any case, he needed to leave the attack and move north, joined by Hairan I, to repulse Gothic assaults on Asia Minor. The ruler and his child were killed amid their arrival in 267; as per the "Augustan History" and Joannes Zonaras, Odaenathus was executed by a cousin (Zonaras says nephew) named in the "History" as Maeonius.
