Sanctuaries worked in and around the Kalyani area (in the Bidar locale) were very not the same as those inherent different areas. Regardless, the explanation was "nagara", and the sanctuary plan generally speaking was either ventured precious stone or stellate. The heights relating to these two plans were comparable in light of the fact that star shapes were delivered by turning the corner projections of a standard ventured plan in augmentations of 11.25 degrees, bringing about a 32-pointed intruded on plan in which three star focuses are skipped in the focal point of each side of the altar. Instances of ventured jewel plans getting by in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga region. The "nagara" holy place at Chattarki is a ventured jewel of anticipating corners with five projections for each side. Due to the ventured precious stone arrangement, the divider columns have two completely uncovered sides, with a high base square enlivened with a reflected stalk theme and two extensive divider pictures above. The shapes and enrichments on the remainder of the divider column have a striking similarity to the genuine columns supporting the roof.
