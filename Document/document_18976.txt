A tropical disturbance organized within the monsoon trough in early October near the FSM. The convection gradually consolidated around a single circulation, developing into a tropical depression on OctoberÂ 8. Wind shear was weak and outflow was good, which allowed for slow strengthening; however, the system was elongated, with a separate circulation to the west. Around this time, the system produced gale-force winds on Kosrae in the FSM. Late on OctoberÂ 9, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bavi to the east of Guam, although it was still a broad system at the time. After becoming a tropical storm, Bavi moved generally northward due to a ridge retreating to the northeast. By OctoberÂ 11, winds were fairly weak near the center and were stronger in outer rainbands. That day, the JMA estimated peak winds of 100Â km/h (65Â mph). Despite the broad structure, with an exposed circulation at the peak, the JTWC estimated winds as high as 130Â km/h (80Â mph), making Bavi a typhoon. Shortly after reaching peak winds, the storm turned to the northeast and entered the westerlies. Increasing shear weakened the convection, and Bavi became extratropical on OctoberÂ 13. It continued to the northeast and crossed into the Central Pacific on OctoberÂ 16.
