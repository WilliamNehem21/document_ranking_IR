On account of his news-casting, Driberg was an outstanding figure inside the Labor Party for the most part, and in 1949 was chosen to the gathering's National Executive Committee (NEC). In the February 1950 General Election he was again chosen at Maldon, while broadly Labor lost 68 seats, diminishing its parliamentary greater part to six. With so little a lion's share, individuals' customary participation in the Commons chamber ended up essential; in any case, in August 1950 Driberg left the nation for Korea, where Britain had joined the United States in a United Nations military campaign to repulse the North Korean intrusion of the South. Driberg and a couple of other left-wing MPs had questioned British association; In his "Reynolds News" segment, Driberg had composed of "Tories (Conservatives) who ... can't resist baying their enjoyment at the smell of blood noticeable all around", a remark that caused shock in parliament among the Conservative individuals. Whatever his reservations, Driberg's war dispatches to "Reynolds News" were unequivocally steady of the British troops. He took an interest in a few night tasks, and won regard from huge numbers of the warriors for his valor notwithstanding, as one Marine put it "being somewhat twisted". He was from parliament for three months, missing numerous basic House of Commons divisions, and on his arrival was seriously rebuffed by his individual Labor MPs for dismissing his obligations. His general remaining in the gathering was unaffected; he had been re-chosen "in absentia" to the NEC in September 1950.
