John Gould set the fire robin in its present variety as "Petroica phoenicea" in his 1837 depiction, and it was this last binomial name that has been utilized since that time. Given this, Quoy and Gaimard's name was pronounced a "nomen oblitum". The nonexclusive name is gotten from the Ancient Greek words "petros" "shake" and "oikos" "home", from the winged creatures' propensity for sitting on rocks. The particular designation is additionally gotten from Ancient Greek, from the modifier "phoinikes" "red". It is one of five red-or pink-breasted species conversationally known as "red robins", as particular from the "yellow robins" of the sort "Eopsaltria". In spite of the fact that named after the European robin, isn't firmly identified with it or the American robin. The Australian robins were put in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, and the whistler family Pachycephalidae, before being grouped in their own family Petroicidae, or Eopsaltridae. Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridisation considers put the robins in a Corvida parvorder containing numerous tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes, pixie wrens and honeyeaters just as crows. Be that as it may, resulting sub-atomic research (and flow agreement) puts the robins as an all around early branch of the Passerida, or "propelled" warblers, inside the lark ancestry.
