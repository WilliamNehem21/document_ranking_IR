The rest of the region was settled by the people called "Gall-Gaidhil" (modern Scottish Gaelic: "Gall-GhÃ idheil") in their own language, variations of "Gallwedienses" in Latin, and normally Galwegians or Gallovidians in modern English. References in the 11th century to the kingdom of the Gall-Gaidhil centre it far to the north of what is now Galloway. Kingarth ("Cenn Garadh") and Eigg ("Eic") were described as "in Galloway" ("Gallgaidelaib") by the "Martyrology of Ãengus", in contrast to WhithornÂ âpart of modern Gallowayâwhich was named as lying within another kingdom, The Rhinns ("Na Renna"). These areas had been part of the Kingdom of Northumbria until the 9th century, and afterward were transformed by a process very poorly documented, but probably carried out by numerous small bands of culturally Scandinavian but linguistically Gaelic warrior-settlers moving in from Ireland and southern Argyll. "Galloway" today only refers to the lands of Rhinns, Farines, Glenken, Desnes MÃ³r and Desnes Ioan (that is, Wigtownshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright), but this is due to the territorial changes that took place in and around Donnchadh's lifetime rather than being the contemporary definition. For instance, a 12th-century piece of marginalia located the island of Ailsa Craig "lying between "Gallgaedelu" [Galloway] and "Cend Tiri" [Kintyre]", while a charter of MÃ¡el Coluim IV ("Malcolm IV") describes Strathgryfe, Cunningham, Kyle and Carrick as the four "cadrez" (probably from "ceathramh", "quarter"s) of Galloway; an Irish annal entry for the year 1154 designated galleys from Arran, Kintyre, the Isle of Man as "Gallghaoidhel", "Galwegian".
