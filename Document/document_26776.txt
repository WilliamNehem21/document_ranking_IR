Controversy surrounding "The Big Issue", the world's most widely circulated street newspaper, is a good example of these two schools of thought. "The Big Issue" is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced "The Big Issue" or that "The Big Issue" did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to "The Big Issue" raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as "The Big Issue" emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to "fill the void" in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.
