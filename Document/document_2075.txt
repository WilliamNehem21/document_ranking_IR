Later in 1899, while going via train among Atlanta and Covington, Georgia, Sledd saw the outcome of the lynching of an African-American man named Sam Hose. The optimistic youthful priest was insulted. In response, he composed an exposition entitled "The Negro: Another View," which was distributed as an article in the July 1902 issue of "The Atlantic Monthly". In the article, Sledd impugned the lynchings of dark men in the South in realistic terms: "lynching isn't 'equity,' anyway impolite; it is a wild and insidious jubilee of blood." While he straight affirmed that the "negro race" was not the equivalent of the "white race," he by the by requested equivalent equity for blacks and whites alike, expressing "There is nothing in a white skin or a dark to invalidate the basic privileges of man as man." Even however Sledd's exposition excused the proceeded with racial isolation of white and dark Southerners as an important social catalyst, an open firestorm resulted in Georgia over Sledd's analysis of the South's treatment of its dark residents, with the contention fed by the hostile letters and publication assaults of agrarian populist Rebecca Felton in "The Atlanta Constitution" paper. As the discussion developed, "The Atlanta Journal" and "Atlanta News" immediately joined the counter Sledd tune. At the point when a larger part of the individuals from Emory's leading body of trustees took steps to pull back their help of the school due to the negative attention, the recently introduced school president, James E. Dickey, requested Sledd's acquiescence from the personnel, and Sledd surrendered on August 9, 1902. The Sledd Affair consequently pulled in consideration all through the United States as an issue of scholastic opportunity and the right to speak freely.
