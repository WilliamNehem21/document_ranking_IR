Amid a story bend in which Allen attempts to spare a previous Exorcist named Suman Dark, Allen's very own InnocenceÃ¢ÂÂhis disfigured arm "Cross"Ã¢ÂÂ is pulverized in an encounter. Since Allen prepares in a sub-part of the Black Order to recapture his Innocence, Hoshino needed to demonstrate Allen's genuine forces. Hoshino said she encountered an absence of motivation in what it would be its actual structure to the point of inclination Allen's dissatisfaction at not having the capacity to battle once more. In the long run, Hoshino was propelled to draw Allen's genuine InnocenceÃ¢ÂÂthe Crowned ClownÃ¢ÂÂwhich depends on the Italian Pierrot. She was happy with Allen's exchange that he would battle for the two people and Akumas, symbolized by his two hands, and drew this scene cautiously. By the arrangement's start, Hoshino proposed Allen's weaponry to develop in light of the fact that she began feeling that Allen's first weapon, Cross, may advance the perusers. Crown Clown was made to be a progressively beautiful and cooler weapon for Allen. Since Allen conceals his personality from the Order yet at the same time professes to be an exorcist in a later circular segment, Hoshino imagined another plan for him that speaks to his self-announcement of being one.
