In late 1942, the Germans solidified some little ghettos in the Vilnius area with Gens' assistance. These incorporated the ghettos at Oszmiana, ÃÂ venÃÂionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. Amid one of these solidifications, on 25 October, Gens surrendered 400 elderly individuals as a byproduct of sparing the staying 600 Jewish occupants of Oszmiana. He renumerated Martin Weiss, leader of the Ponary executing squad, to acknowledge the lower amount. The Jewish police from Vilnius just as certain Lithuanians were compelled to slaughter the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist guaranteed that the Vilnius ghetto was shocked by Gens' support in the killings, however different diarists expressed that most ghetto occupants endorsed of Gens' decision to spare a few. By April 1943, the majority of these little ghettos were gone, with their occupants either moved to work camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5 April, the last occupants were stacked into trains under the supervision of the Vilnius Jewish police, and the police went with the trains, which went through Vilnius on their approach to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train experienced Vilnius, and was captured alongside them when the train touched base at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were discharged, yet different Jews on the train were executed. It gives the idea that the Germans deceived Gens about the goal of the trains. Gens legitimized the support of the Vilnius ghetto police in these gatherings by asserting that their cooperation spared probably a portion of the ghetto occupants, when generally the Germans would have shot them all.
