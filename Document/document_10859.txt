The retrochoir stretches out over the east end of the choir and into the east transepts. At its inside the vault is upheld by an exceptional structure of calculated wharfs. Two of these are so put as to finish the octagonal state of the Lady Chapel, an answer portrayed by Francis Bond as "an instinct of Genius". The wharfs have connected shafts of marble, and, with the vaults that they support, make a vista of extraordinary intricacy from each edge. The windows of the retrochoir are in the Reticulated style like those of the Lady Chapel, yet are completely Flowing Decorated in that the tracery moldings structure ogival bends. The arrangement of this territory between the presbytery and the Lady Chapel is extraordinary, and it has been proposed that the inability to secure the canonization of William of March prompted a shortening of the presbytery as space was never again required for his hallowed place. There was then an ensuing need to fill in the subsequent additional room behind the High Altar. It was done keenly and wonderfully. A comparative circumstance had emerged at St Albans Abbey, where the old apse had been expelled leaving space between the Lady Chapel and the sanctuary of St Alban. The space there, be that as it may, was not treated as inventively as it was at Wells.
