Sullivan composed on 1 April 1884 that he had "arrive at the finish of my tie" with the musical dramas: "I have been ceaselessly holding down the music all together that not one [syllable] ought to be lost.ÃÂ ... I should get a kick out of the chance to set an account of human intrigue and likelihood where the comical words would arrive in a diverting (not difficult) circumstance, and where, if the circumstance were a delicate or sensational one the words would be of comparative character." In a protracted trade of correspondence, Sullivan articulated Gilbert's plot sketch (especially the "tablet" component) inadmissibly mechanical, and excessively comparative in the two its bizarre "components of topsyturveydom" and in genuine plot to their prior work, particularly "The Sorcerer". He more than once mentioned that Gilbert locate another subject. The impasse was at last settled on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not rely upon any powerful gadget. The outcome was Gilbert and Sullivan's best work, "The Mikado" (1885). The piece kept running for 672 exhibitions, which was the second-longest keep running for any work of melodic theater, and one of the longest keeps running of any auditorium piece, up to that time.
