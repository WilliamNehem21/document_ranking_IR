There was no known elective fuel for atomic reactors other than uranium, so verifying a satisfactory supply was essential to the British nuclear vitality program. Amid the war, Britain led the pack in reviving the world's most extravagant uranium mine, the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, which had been overwhelmed and shut, as 30 percent of the stock in Union MiniÃÂ¨re du Haut Katanga, the organization that possessed the mine, was constrained by British interests. In May 1944, Sir John Anderson and US Ambassador John Winant arranged an arrangement with the Belgian government in a state of banishment and Edgar Sengier, the chief of Union MiniÃÂ¨re, for the mine to be revived and of metal to be acquired at $1.45 a pound. American and British pioneers reasoned that it was to their greatest advantage to deal with however much of the world's uranium stores as could be expected. The Combined Development Trust was set up for this reason on 14 June 1944. It comprised of three American, two British and one Canadian individuals, with an American, at first Groves, as administrator. Before the finish of the war, it had control of 97 percent of the world's uranium and 65 percent of the thorium.
