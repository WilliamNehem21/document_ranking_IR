Zhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first odometer, an achievement also attributed to Archimedes (c.Â 287â212Â BC) and Heron of Alexandria (fl.Â ADÂ 10â70). Similar devices were used by the Roman and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rdÂ century, the Chinese had termed the device the "ji li gu che", or "li-recording drum carriage" (the modern measurement of liÂ =Â 500Â m/1640Â ft).
Ancient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm. However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered on the "huang men"âcourt people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal "drum-chariot". There is speculation that at some time during the 1stÂ centuryÂ BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels. This might have actually been the design of Luoxia Hong (c.Â 110Â BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb.
