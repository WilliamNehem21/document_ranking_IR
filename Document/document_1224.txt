Lincoln's answer would wind up celebrated, substantially more so than the supplication that incited it. "My principal object in this battle "is" to spare the Union, and is "not" either to spare or to wreck bondage. On the off chance that I could spare the Union without liberating "any" slave, I would do it, and on the off chance that I could spare it by liberating "every one of" the slaves I would do it; and in the event that I could spare it by liberating a few and disregarding others I would likewise do that. What I do about bondage, and the hued race, I do on the grounds that it spares the Union; and what I hold back, I shun on the grounds that I do "not" trust it would spare the Union." Lincoln's announcement rankled abolitionists; William Seward's significant other Frances grumbled to her better half that Lincoln had influenced it to appear "that the unimportant keeping together various states could easily compare to human opportunity." Greeley felt Lincoln had not genuinely addressed him, "however I'll excuse him everything in the event that he'll issue the decree". At the point when Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as an "extraordinary help of opportunity". As indicated by Williams, "Lincoln's war for Union was presently likewise Greeley's war for liberation."
