The worst of the damage occurred on the island of Yap. Initially, the typhoon was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced the brunt of the storm. Typhoon Lupit affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm.
On AprilÂ 9, the eye of Sudal briefly passed over the southern portion of the island, and winds of 185Â km/h (115Â mph) struck the island for about four hours. The entire island, only in length, experienced typhoon force winds. Yap International Airport recorded a peak wind gust of 181Â km/h (112Â mph); a subsequent survey estimated wind gusts on the island reached 226Â km/h (140Â mph). Heavy rainfall occurred during Sudal's passage, including 20.0Â cm (7.88Â inches) in a 48âhour period at the airport. The lowest pressure on the island was . Along the coast, the typhoon produced waves of 6.7Â m (22Â ft) in height, along with a 3.7Â m (12Â ft) storm surge; the combination sunk several ships and heavily damaged the island's coral reefs, the latter which is one of Yap's primary tourism attractions.
