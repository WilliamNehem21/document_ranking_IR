After the promotion of Henry II, Nigel was gathered to rearrange the Exchequer, or treasury, that was in charge of the creation of the administration's money related records, including the Pipe Rolls. The lord needed to ask Nigel a few times to return before the religious administrator concurred, and one purpose behind Nigel's hesitance may have been that he would need to work with Robert, Earl of Leicester, one of the Beaumonts, who had been in charge of turning Stephen against Nigel's family in 1139. Another of Nigel's partners in the organization was a layman, Richard de Lucy, who filled in as an equity until 1178. Nigel was the main enduring pastor of Henry I, and his insight into the Exchequer was expected to help revamp the incomes of the lord and reestablish regulatory practices lost amid Stephen's rule. The solitary pipe move to make due from Henry I's rule, for the year 1130, might be Nigel's very own duplicate, conveyed with him to the Exchequer when he returned under Henry II. Nigel had the capacity to expand the incomes contrasted with what had been gathered under Stephen, however he was unfit to rapidly return them to the sums gathered under Henry I. It might have been Nigel who encouraged the ruler to endeavor to recuperate homes that had been distanced amid Stephen's rule.
