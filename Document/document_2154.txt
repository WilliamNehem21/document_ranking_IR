Nagachandra, a researcher and the manufacturer of the Mallinatha Jinalaya (a Jain sanctuary out of appreciation for the 19thÃÂ Jain tirthankar, Mallinatha, in Bijapur, Karnataka), expressed "Mallinathapurana" (1105), a record of the development of the spirit of the Jain holy person. As per a few antiquarians, King Veera Ballala I was his benefactor. Afterward, he composed his "perfect work of art", a Jain adaptation of the Hindu epic Ramayana called "Ramachandra Charitapurana" (or "Pampa Ramayana"). Written in the conventional "champu" meter and in the "Pauma charia" custom of Vimalasuri, it is the most punctual surviving variant of the epic in the Kannada language. The work contains 16ÃÂ sections and strays essentially from the first epic by Valmiki. Nagachandra speaks to King Ravana, the antagonist of the Hindu epic, as a terrible legend, who in a snapshot of shortcoming submits the transgression of kidnapping Sita (spouse of the Hindu god Rama) however is in the end sanitized by her commitment to Rama. In a further deviation, Rama's unwavering sibling Lakshmana (rather than Rama) executes Ravana in the last fight. In the long run, Rama takes "jaina-diksha" (changes over to "Digambara priest"), turns into a parsimonious and achieves "nirvana" (edification). Considered a corresponding work to the "Pampa Bharatha" of Adikavi Pampa (941, a Jain variant of the epic Mahabharata), the work earned Nagachandra the honorific "Abhinava Pampa" ("new Pampa"). Just in the Kannada language do Jain adaptations exist of the Hindu legends, the Mahabharata and Ramayana, notwithstanding their brahminical form.
