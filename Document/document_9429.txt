In 1998, the diary "African Primates" distributed three papers by primatologists on the bogus potto. Colin Groves asserted that it was most likely unmistakable from the potto and Simon Bearder refered to it for instance of unrecognized ordered decent variety in lorisids, however Esteban Sarmiento contrasted the new taxon with examples of the potto and found that the supposed particular characteristics of the bogus potto in reality fell inside the scope of variety of the potto, and that the bogus potto was presumably not by any means an animal categories unmistakable from "Perodicticus potto". In 2000, primatologist B.S. Leon concurred that the bogus potto was not particular from the subspecies "Perodicticus potto", however noticed that different types of potto were sufficiently unmistakable from one another that there may to be sure be more than one types of potto. Suppositions from that point forward have been partitioned: a 2003 arrangement of African primate decent variety reasoned that there was lacking proof that the bogus potto is an unmistakable animal varieties, the primate section of the 2005 third release of "Warm blooded creature Species of the World", composed by Groves, recorded "Pseudopotto" as a class however noticed that it might have been "dubious"; and Schwartz kept on perceiving the bogus potto as a sort in 2005. Additionally in 2005, primatologist David Stump assessed a portion of the distinctive highlights of "Pseudopotto" with regards to contemplating variety among pottos, and found that a few however not the majority of the bogus potto's characteristics were found in some pottos, for the most part western populaces (subspecies "potto").
