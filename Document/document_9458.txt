When Pope struck, Cibber turned into an obvious objective for different comedians. He was assaulted as the encapsulation of ethically and stylishly terrible composition, generally for the wrongdoings of his personal history. In the "Statement of regret", Cibber talks daringly in the main individual and in his very own recognition. In spite of the fact that the real figures of the day were envious of their acclaim, self-advancement of such an obvious sort was stunning, and Cibber annoyed Christian quietude just as respectful humility. Moreover, Cibber reliably neglects to see blame in his own character, adulates his indecencies, and makes no statement of regret for his offenses; so it was not simply the reality of the collection of memoirs, however the way of it that stunned peers. His diffuse and effusive composition style, customary in verse and now and again unintelligible in exposition, will undoubtedly look far more terrible rather than beauticians like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically attempted Cibber for homicide of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of "The Champion". The Tory minds were out and out so effective in their parody of Cibber that the recorded picture of the man himself was nearly devastated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to children.
