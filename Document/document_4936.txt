One of Walter's first recommendations was to bring down the charges for having sanctions affirmed, from nine pounds and five shillings to eighteen shillings and four pence. Going with this measure was a prerequisite that no sanction would be acknowledged in a lord's court without having been affirmed by King John. In addition to the fact that this reduced falsifications, it prompted the foundation of the Charter Roll, a managerial duplicate of all contracts issued and affirmed by the legislature. In his relations with different officers, Walter worked intimately with the justiciar Geoffrey Fitz Peter, on the accumulation of tax assessment, and the two men went to Wales in 1203 on a strategic mission. Another joint activity of the two men concerned a duty of a seventh piece of all movables gathered from both lay and religious people. The medieval recorder Roger of Wendover said that the ruler "had Archbishop Hubert of Canterbury to represent him in the matter of the congregation property, Geoffrey fitz-Peter in the matter of lay property; and these two saved nobody in completing their requests." Walter was likewise in charge of the keeping of duplicates of other illustrious letters in the Close Rolls and the Patent Rolls. The Patent moves record letters that were issued in "patent", or transparently and not fixed, and the Close moves record letters issued fixed, or letters close. The different rolls are surviving from 1199 for the Charter roll, 1201 for the Patent roll, and 1204 for the Close roll. Walter additionally kept on improving in nearby government, as the most punctual record of the coroner's rolls, or province records, being utilized to cross-check oral declaration in the region courts date from 1202 and 1203, amid Walter's chancellorship.
