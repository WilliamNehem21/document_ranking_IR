For the last obliteration of the Genesis planet, film from the Paramount set must be deliberately coordinated with ILM impacts film. ILM incorporated scale miniatures slice with segments to depict portions of Genesis' change (shake slides, crevices opening in the ground) that live-activity scenes couldn't without much of a stretch repeat. One of the biggest miniatures, estimating , had trap trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane planes for whirlwinds, and solenoid-activated rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge fight at a cliff over a pit of magma, the shot joined enlivened magma, mists (truly cotton smears on dark), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the magma were made by lighting a bit of clear Plexiglass with shaded gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the blend dribbled off the surface and covered the team underneath. ILM reproduced Kruge's destruction, a long dive into the pool of magma, with the assistance of a stop-movement manikin. Lloyd fell a couple of feet onto a dark sleeping pad; amid a lightning streak the on-screen character was supplanted by the manikin that fell the remainder of the separation. Since the shot was recorded on dark rather than the customary bluescreen, the illustrators needed to expel or rotoscope the dark foundation around Lloyd one edge at any given moment. The progress between the recording of Lloyd and the manikin was covered up by a solitary casing streak as an electrical discharge struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock radiating without end as the ground breakdown was another made at ILM, as the dimension of annihilation was just unrealistic for the real to life team.
