There are five multiplayer modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, Capture the Flag, and Bout of Honor. Group coordinates haphazardly dole out players to contend on either the Spartan or Trojan group. The "signature" multiplayer mode is Team Favor of the Gods, in which two groups of two-to-four players attempt to win by aggregating an objective amount of focuses. Focuses, known as Favor, are earned by slaughtering and different strategies. At the point when players are not in all out attack mode, they may enable their group to gain focuses by catching special raised areas, gathering red circles from chests, and setting devices for contradicting players. The non-group form, Match of Champions, is a four-to-eight-player deathmatch with a comparable objective to Team Favor of the Gods. Preliminary of the Gods is a two-player, helpful (center), time-preliminary mode in which the pair faces five rushes of legendary beasts finishing up with a manager battle. A solitary player rendition is likewise accessible. In Capture the Flag, two groups of four players fight to catch the restricting group's banner and return it to their base until an objective number of banners have been acquired. In Bout of Honor, included the July 11, 2013 update, players test their aptitudes in a best-of-seven-rounds one-on-one battle.
