In 406 BC Alcibiades set out from Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred boats. He neglected to take Andros and afterward he went on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the foe at Ephesus. In the in the interim Tissaphernes had been supplanted by Cyrus the Younger (child of Darius II of Persia) who chose to monetarily bolster the Peloponnesians. This new income began to pull in Athenian traitors to the Spartan naval force. Furthermore the Spartans had supplanted Mindarus with Lysander, an entirely proficient chief naval officer. These variables caused the fast development of the Peloponnesian armada to the detriment of the Athenian. Looking for assets and expecting to constrain another conclusive fight, Alcibiades left Notium and cruised to help Thrasybulus in the attack of Phocaea. Alcibiades knew the Spartan armada was adjacent, so he left almost eighty boats to watch them under the direction of his own helmsman Antiochus, who was given express requests not to assault. Antiochus resisted this single request and attempted to draw Lysander into a battle by impersonating the strategies utilized at Cyzicus. The circumstance at Notium, notwithstanding, was drastically not the same as that at Cyzicus; the Athenians had no component of shock, and Lysander had been very much educated about their armada by cowards. Antiochus' ship was sunk, and he was murdered by an unexpected Spartan assault; the rest of the boats of the distraction constrain were then pursued fast back toward Notium, where the principle Athenian power was gotten ill-equipped by the abrupt landing of the entire Spartan armada. In the following battling, Lysander picked up a whole triumph. Alcibiades before long returned and frantically attempted to fix the annihilation at Notium by scoring another triumph, yet Lysander couldn't be constrained to assault the armada once more.
