Lynchings achieved a crest around the beginning of the twentieth century as southern states were disappointing dark voters and forcing racial oppression; racial oppressors utilized it as a methods for social control all through the South. In 1866 Florida, as did numerous Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disappointing dark natives.
