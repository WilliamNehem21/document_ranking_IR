OsmÃÂ³lska and associates called attention to that the front piece of the neck of "Gallimimus" would have been portable (the rear part was progressively inflexible), the neural curves in the vertebrae of that area being like chicken and different Galliformes, demonstrating comparative bolstering propensities. They found the bill of "Gallimimus" like that of a duck or goose, and that it would have benefited from little, living prey which it gulped down. The portability of the neck would have been valuable in finding prey on the ground, since the eyes were situated on the sides of the skull. They expected that all ornithomimids had comparative nourishing propensities, and called attention to that Russel had contrasted the noses of ornithomimids and those of insectivorous flying creatures. OsmÃÂ³lska and partners proposed that "Gallimimus" was fit for cranial kinesis (because of the apparently free association between a portion of the bones at the back of the skull), an element which enables singular bones of the skull to move in connection to one another. They likewise recommended that it didn't utilize its under-staffed forelimbs for conveying nourishment to the mouth, however to round or uncovering the ground to get to sustenance. The hands of "Gallimimus" may have been more fragile than for instance those of "Struthiomimus", which may rather have utilized its hands for snaring and grasping, as per a 1985 article by scientistss Elizabeth L. Nicholls and Anthony P. Russell.
