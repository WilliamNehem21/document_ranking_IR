f. As indicated by chronicled inquire about in the late 1990s, El Greco was still in Candia at the age of twenty-six. It was there where his works, made in the soul of the post-Byzantine painters of the Cretan School, were enormously regarded. On 26 December 1566 El Greco looked for authorization from the Venetian specialists to sell a "board of the Passion of Christ executed on a gold foundation" ("un quadro della Passione del Nostro Signor Giesu Christo, dorato") in a lottery. The Byzantine symbol by youthful DomÃÂ©nicos delineating the "Energy of Christ", painted on a gold ground, was evaluated and sold on 27 December 1566 in Candia at the concurred cost of seventy gold ducats (The board was esteemed by two craftsmen; one of them was symbol painter Georgios Klontzas. One valuation was eighty ducats and the other seventy), break even with in an incentive to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that period. Thusly, it appears that El Greco made a trip to Venice at some point after 27 December 1566. In one of his last articles, Wethey reassessed his past estimations and acknowledged that El Greco left Crete in 1567. As indicated by other chronicled materialÃ¢ÂÂillustrations El Greco sent to a Cretan cartographerÃ¢ÂÂhe was in Venice by 1568.
