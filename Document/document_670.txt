In a post on the official Nine Inch Nails site, Reznor denounced Universal Music GroupÃ¢ÂÂthe parent organization of Interscope RecordsÃ¢ÂÂfor its estimating and circulation plans for "Year Zero". He composed that he loathed Interscope for setting the cost of the collection higher than expected, amusingly marking the organization's retail evaluating of "Year Zero" in Australia as "Ridiculous", and reasoning that "as a reward for being a 'genuine fan' you get ripped off." Reznor proceeded to state in later years the "atmosphere" of record names may have an inexorably irresolute effect on purchasers who purchase music. Reznor's post, explicitly his analysis of the chronicle business everywhere, inspired significant media consideration. Reznor proceeded with his assault on Universal Music Group amid a September 2007 show in Australia, where he asked fans to "take" his music online as opposed to obtaining it lawfully. Reznor proceeded to urge the group to "take and take and take some more and offer it to every one of your companions and keep on stealin'." Although Universal never answered openly to the analysis, a representative for the Australian Music Retailers Association said "It is a similar cost in Australia all things considered in the US in light of the additional bundling." Due to the estimating question, plans to discharge a "Capital G" maxi-single in Europe were rejected. The track was rather discharged as a constrained version single, without a "Radiance number", not at all like most authority Nine Inch Nails discharges.
