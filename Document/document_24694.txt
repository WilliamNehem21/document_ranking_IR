Many reviews negatively compared the film to the "Shrek" series. Liam Lacey of "The Globe and Mail" considered the film to be "a sort of discount Shrek", while Burr called it ""Shrek" with added drek." Westbrook wrote that "Echoing such a popular predecessor as Shrek is not a good thingÂ â especially when the echo is so faint." Berardinelli felt that the fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in the first Shrek film, while Bernard felt that "Hoodwinked!" took fairy tale revisionism too far. He felt that the humor in "Shrek" worked due to the fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout the film, and wrote, "It's pointless to scold them for behaving the way fairy tales intended, and that's far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms." Bill Muller of "The Arizona Republic", considered Red's kung fu abilities to be overly similar to Princess Fiona's ""Matrix" agility." Gleiberman also noted the similarities between the film and "Shrek", but he was positive in the comparison, feeling that its independent production gave the filmmakers "the freedom to follow their flakiest corkscrew whims." While Wilmington did not find "Hoodwinked!" as impressive or beguiling as "Shrek", he wrote that "when it's cooking, it does make you laugh."
