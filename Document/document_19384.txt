Parkinson defines tales as "...non-commemorative, non-functional, fictional narratives" that usually employ the key word "narrate" ("sdd"). He describes it as the most open-ended genre, since the tales often incorporate elements of other literary genres. For example, Morenz describes the opening section of the foreign adventure tale "Sinuhe" as a "...funerary self-presentation" that parodies the typical autobiography found on commemorative funerary . The autobiography is for a courier whose service began under Amenemhat I. Simpson states that the death of Amenemhat I in the report given by his son, coregent, and successor Senusret I (r. 1971â1926 BC) to the army in the beginning of "Sinuhe" is "...excellent propaganda". Morenz describes "The shipwrecked sailor" as an expeditionary report and a travel-narrative myth. Simpson notes the literary device of the story within a story in "The shipwrecked sailor" may provide "...the earliest examples of a narrative quarrying report". With the setting of a magical desert island, and a character who is a talking snake, "The shipwrecked sailor" may also be classified as a fairy tale. While stories like "Sinuhe", "Taking of Joppa", and the "Doomed prince" contain fictional portrayals of Egyptians abroad, the "Report of Wenamun" is most likely based on a true account of an Egyptian who traveled to Byblos in Phoenicia to obtain cedar for shipbuilding during the reign of Ramesses XI.
