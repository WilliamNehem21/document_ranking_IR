DJ Evil Dee and Mr. Walt of Da Beatminerz, who created the collection, put their samplers to use here, binding the collection with their mark cellar sound, loaded up with hard drums, unsanitary horn courses of action and profound basslines. In the collection's liner notes, DJ Evil Dee expressed: "This collection was done on blunted terms. Any individual who is outraged by the substance of the collection, FUCK YOU. Nuff said." Allmusic portrays the dull generation: "The Beatminerz creation team make underground beats to coordinate Buckshot's pandemonium. The tracks are dull, layered with quieted jazz tests, and apparently unlimited." A couple of the examples utilized here were later reproduced by various hip jump specialists during the 1990s. The single "Buck Em Down" highlights an example from Donald Byrd's "Wind Parade", an example which was later re-utilized for Organized Konfusion's 1994 idea track "Stray Bullet". "What number of MC's..." highlights an example from Grover Washington, Jr's. "Hydra", which was utilized for before hip bounce tracks like EPMD's "Underground". The famous "Who Got Da Props" intensely uses a circled test from Ronnie Laws' jazz exemplary "Tsunami", which was highlighted in a few hip-bounce and R&B tracks, including Usher's "Consider You" from his self-titled 1994 collection. Underhanded Dee and Walt take a segment of the example and art it into an alternate circle.
