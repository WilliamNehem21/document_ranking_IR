Parlett incorporated a broad discography in his 1999 "A Catalog of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax", later extended and refreshed in a site. At 2015 the last records in excess of 250 works by Bax that have been recorded and distributed. The discography incorporates three complete cycles of Bax's ensembles discharged on CD, two by Chandos Records, the first led by Bryden Thomson (recorded 1983Ã¢ÂÂ 88) and the second by Handley (2003); between them was a cycle issued by Naxos Records led by David Lloyd-Jones (recorded 1997Ã¢ÂÂ 2001). The real tone ballads and other symphonic works have been recorded, huge numbers of them in a few distinct renditions. Bax's orchestral arrangements is all around spoken to on plate, with chronicles of the greater part of the works, and different forms of many, including the Elegiac Trio, the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata. A significant part of the piano music has been recorded by musicians including Iris Loveridge, John McCabe, Ashley Wass and Michael Endres, however by 2015 no necessary review had yet been recorded. Of the vocal works, by a long shot the regularly recorded is "Mater ora Filium", however other choral works, and a delegate determination of the tunes are on circle.
