In the skull, the platform (front part) is short and line-formed, yet longer than in other "manavi"- like species. The focal notch in the nasal sorrow is generally tight. The frontal bones are adjusted and bear an all around created sagittal peak. Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid peak is likewise conspicuous. The center piece of the sense of taste is level, as in "M.ÃÂ manavi" however not at all like in "M.ÃÂ brachytragos", "M.ÃÂ griveaudi", and "M.ÃÂ mahafaliensis", which have a bended sense of taste. At the sense of taste's back edge is a long, meager back palatal spine. "Miniopterus aelleni" has 36ÃÂ teeth in the dental recipe (two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in both upper toothrows and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars in the lower toothrows). As is normal for "Miniopterus", the principal upper premolar (P2; P1 and P3 are missing) is littler and more improved than the second (P4). There are clear diastemata (holes) between the upper canine (C1) and P2 and somewhere in the range of P2 and P4, which are flimsier or missing in "M.ÃÂ griveaudi" and "M.ÃÂ manavi". Behind C1, the toothrows are about parallel, not unique as in "M.ÃÂ manavi". The third upper molar (M3) is more packed than in "M.ÃÂ manavi" and "M.ÃÂ griveaudi". In certain estimations of the skull and teeth, Anjouan examples are bigger than those from Madagascar.
