In a 2007 meeting with GameTrailers, "Divine force of War" maker and diversion chief David Jaffe clarified his unique aim for the arrangement, which is not quite the same as the genuine completion of "Lord of War III", which depended on amusement executive Stig Asmussen's vision. Jaffe's thought was that ""God of War" clarifies, or eventually will clarify, why there are not any more Greek legends". He said that it would have been "terrible" as the divine beings and Titans fought each other for mastery. Other legendary pantheons would have progressed toward becoming required after Kratos murdered Zeus and the other Greek divine beings, and the outcome would be that mankind never again had confidence in the divine beingsÃ¢ÂÂas indicated by Jaffe, the main way a divine being can genuinely kick the bucket. "Divine force of War III" was first referenced by "Lord of War II" diversion executive Cory Barlog at a "Divine force of War II" dispatch occasion. Barlog said that the diversion would have full 1080p HD goals (changed to 720p in definite discharge) and bolster Sixaxis tilt and vibration capacities. Declared before the DualShock 3 controller was presented, this caused disarray since the Sixaxis controller does not bolster thunder. Amid the 2009 Game Developers Conference (GDC), the inventive group said that the Sixaxis tilt capacity had been evacuated on the grounds that they "couldn't locate an appropriate circumstance to utilize Sixaxis in the amusement viably".
