One contemporary survey of this book alluded to the measure of specific phonetic images and diacritics as an "abundance of diacritical imprints that is fairly befuddling". Pe Maung Tin reacted to this by elucidating the diacritics were important to pass on the communication of tone and prosody and to guarantee that English speakers did not peruse the writings with an English pitch. He additionally guarded other translation decisions like utilizing "" to speak to a suctioned alveolar fricative as in the Burmese word (, "oil"), which Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin interpreted as ""; the commentator suspected it was confounding to utilize "" to allude to a sound other than the post-alveolar fricative spoken to by the English as in "she" (). R. Concede Brown, a previous individual from the Indian Civil Service in Burma, applauded "A Burmese Phonetic Reader" for being the joint work of a phonetician and a local speaker, expressing "This great little book sets a standard which different essayists on living Oriental dialects should pursue on the off chance that they don't want their work to be viewed as below average", despite the fact that he thought their interpretation framework was "unreasonably intricate for common use". English language specialist John Rupert Firth utilized a wide interpretation which he streamlined from Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's framework situated to a limited extent on his experience utilizing their "Peruser" with Burmese speakers and with understudies of Burmese phonetics at Oxford's Indian Institute. Burmese language specialist Minn Latt said their interpretation framework utilized too much "new images" for a perfect romanization plot. English etymologist Justin Watkins utilized Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's interpretation of "The North Wind and the Sun" for his 2001 representation of the IPA for Burmese in the "Diary of the International Phonetic Association".
