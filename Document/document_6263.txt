In 1245, Ferdinand III of Castile attacked the intensely invigorated JaÃÂ©n. Ferdinand did not have any desire to chance ambushing the city, so his strategy was to cut it off from the remainder of the Muslim region and starve it into accommodation. Muhammad endeavored to send supplies to this essential city, yet these endeavors were frustrated by the besiegers. Because of Muhammad's trouble in protecting and calming JaÃÂ©n, he consented to terms with Ferdinand. In return for harmony, Muhammad surrendered the city and consented to pay Ferdinand a yearly tribute of 150,000 maravedÃÂ­esÃ¢ÂÂa sum that turned into Ferdinand's most essential wellspring of salary. This understanding was made in March 1246, seven months into the attack of JaÃÂ©n. As a feature of the understanding he was required to kiss Ferdinand's hand to mean his vassalage, and guaranteed him "insight and help". Castilian sources would in general underscore this occasion as a demonstration of medieval accommodation and thought about Muhammad and his successors as vassals of Castile in the primitive sense. On different hands, Muslim sources dodged notices of any vassal-master connection and would in general casing the relationship as between equivalents with specific commitments. After the understanding, the Castilians entered the city and removed its Muslim occupants.
