Andy Kellman of AllMusic regarded it quintessential popular music and said every one of its tracks was a potential hit. Quentin B. Fit of PopMatters commended the collection, portraying it as "increasingly crude, maybe edgier and more racy" than Rihanna's past material. Kelefa Sanneh of "The New York Times" composed that the collection "seems as though it were experimentally designed to convey hits". Subside Robinson of "The Observer" recognized her partners for "covering her own weaknesses" and remarked that, "While Rihanna does not have her companions' allure, she's an extraordinary vessel for thrilling standard pop." Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the collection differed and fulfilling. Neil Drumming of "Diversion Weekly" felt that, in spite of the fact that it "turns sour when Rihanna attempts her hand at treacly ditties and sad assumption", now and again "Great Girl Gone Bad" is an "exciting return to over 10 years back, when upstart makers randomly pounded R&B with hip-bounce to make stout jeep songs of praise, for example, Mary J. Blige's 'Genuine Love'."
