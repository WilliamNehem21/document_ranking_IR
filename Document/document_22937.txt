The nest is large, constructed from sticks and twigs, and sometimes also large branches, at an elevation of . The black stork prefers to construct its nest in forest trees with large canopies where the nest can be built far from the main trunkâgenerally in places far from human disturbance. For the most part, deciduous trees are chosen for nesting sites, though conifers are used as well. A 2003 field study in Estonia found that the black stork preferred oak ("Quercus robur"), European aspen ("Populus tremula"), and to a lesser extent Scots pine ("Pinus sylvestris"), and ignored Norway spruce ("Picea abies"), in part due to the canopy structure of the trees. Trees with nests averaged around high and had a diameter at breast height of . Furthermore, 90% of the trees chosen were at least 80 years old, highlighting the importance of conserving old-growth forests. A 2004 field study of nesting sites in Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Park in north-eastern Greece found that it preferred the Calabrian pine ("Pinus brutia"), which had large side branches that allowed it to build the nest away from the trunk, as well as black pine ("Pinus nigra") and to a lesser extent Turkey oak ("Quercus cerris"). It chose the largest trees in an area, generally on steeper ground and near streams. Trees chosen were on average over 90 years old. In the Iberian peninsula it nests in pine and cork oak ("Quercus suber").
