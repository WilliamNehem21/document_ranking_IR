Portrayed by Amanda Beresford as Australia's "just evident present day classicist", Bellette is for the most part viewed as a compelling figure in the cutting edge craftsmanship development in Sydney in the mid-twentieth century. Craftsmanship antiquarian Janine Burke depicted Bellette as "a pioneer of the post-war workmanship world", and the University of Queensland Art Museum's guardian put her as "an original figure in the visual expressions from the 1930s until her passing in Majorca in 1991". Of her artistic creations, sentiments differ. Burke portrayed her as "seemingly the best painter" of the Sydney circle. History specialist Geoffrey Dutton was unconvinced about her decision of subject yet adulated Bellette's "guaranteed whenever quieted" style, while rejecting the lesser endeavors of her significant other. Craftsmanship student of history and author Sasha Grishin had an alternate view. Remarking on Bellette's sketches of Greek fanciful subjects made during the 1940s, he stated, "they were neither extremely persuading as artistic creations, nor works that had a specific reverberation in Sydney or Australian workmanship at the time". John Passmore and Bellette examined together both in Australia and England, went in Europe, and displayed next to each other in gathering appears. He was exceedingly condemning of Bellette's work, while Yvonne Audette, who went to a couple of the craftsman's illustration classes, portrayed her established fills in as "dull postures, and in all respects severely drawn, and significantly more seriously painted, as cumbersome shading in".
