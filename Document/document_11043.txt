In spite of their endeavors, the Nicaean sovereigns neglected to effectively challenge the Venetian control of the oceans, and were compelled to swing to the Genoese for help. Subsequent to recovering Constantinople in 1261 notwithstanding, Michael VIII started an extraordinary exertion to reduce this reliance by structure a "national" naval force, framing various new corps to this reason: the "Gasmouloi" (), who were men of blended Greek-Latin plunge living around the capital; and men from Laconia, called "LakÃÂnes" (ÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂºÃÂÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂ, "Laconians") or "TzakÃÂnes" (ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¶ÃÂ¬ÃÂºÃÂÃÂ½ÃÂµÃÂ), were utilized as marines, shaping the heft of Byzantine maritime labor during the 1270s. Michael likewise set the rowers, called "Prosalentai" (ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ±ÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂÃÂ±ÃÂ¯) or "ProselÃÂntes" (ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂµÃÂ»Ã¡Â¿Â¶ÃÂ½ÃÂÃÂµÃÂ), separated as a different corps. Every one of these gatherings got little allows of land to develop in return for their administration, and were settled together in little states. The "Prosalentai" were settled close to the ocean all through the northern Aegean, while the "Gasmouloi" and "TzakÃÂnes" were settled for the most part around Constantinople and in Thrace. These corps stayed surviving, though in a lessened structure, all through the only remaining a very long time of the Empire; to be sure the "Gasmouloi" of Gallipoli shaped the main part of the groups of the principal Ottoman armadas. All through the Palaiologan time frame, the armada's primary base was the harbor of Kontoskalion on the Marmara shore of Constantinople, dug and refortified by Michael VIII. Among the commonplace maritime focuses, presumably the most imperative was Monemvasia in the Peloponnese.
