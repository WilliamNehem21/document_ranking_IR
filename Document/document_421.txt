Volume I of "Examinations and Observations on Different Kinds of Air" illustrated a few revelations: "nitrous air" (nitric oxide, NO); "vapor of soul of salt", later called "corrosive air" or "marine corrosive air" (anhydrous hydrochloric corrosive, HCl); "soluble air" (smelling salts, NH); "reduced" or "dephlogisticated nitrous air" (nitrous oxide, NO); and, most broadly, "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen, O) just as exploratory discoveries that demonstrated plants revived encased volumes of air, a disclosure that would in the long run lead to the revelation of photosynthesis. Priestley additionally built up a "nitrous air test" to decide the "integrity of air". Utilizing a pneumatic trough, he would blend nitrous air with a test, over water or mercury, and measure the decline in volumeÃ¢ÂÂthe rule of eudiometry. After a little history of the investigation of show, he clarified his own tests in an open and earnest style. As an early biographer states, "whatever he knows or supposes he tells: questions, perplexities, bungles are set down with the most invigorating realism." Priestley additionally depicted his modest and simple to-collect test mechanical assembly; his partners thusly trusted that they could without much of a stretch duplicate his trials. Looked with conflicting trial results, Priestley utilized phlogiston hypothesis. This, nonetheless, drove him to infer that there were just three kinds of "air": "fixed", "soluble", and "corrosive". Priestley rejected the of his day. Rather, he concentrated on gases and "changes in their reasonable properties", as had characteristic rationalists before him. He disengaged carbon monoxide (CO), yet evidently did not understand that it was a different "air".
