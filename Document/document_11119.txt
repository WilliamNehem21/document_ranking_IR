Amid the Napoleonic Wars, the British economy relied upon its capacity to exchange with the British Empire, especially the profitable provinces in British India. The intercontinental exchange was led by the governors of India, the Honorable East India Company (HEIC), utilizing their armada of expansive, all around outfitted vendor vessels known as East Indiamen. These boats were of somewhere in the range of 500 and 1200 ostensible tons burthen (bm) and could convey up to 36 weapons for barrier against privateers, privateers and little warships. They were not, be that as it may, able under typical conditions of warding off a foe frigate or ship of the line. Their weapons were generally of sub-par structure, and their group littler and less very much prepared than those on a maritime ship. The East Indiamen tried to guarantee the security of their freight and travelers, not vanquish adversary warships in fight. In spite of these detriments, the measure of East Indiamen implied that from a separation they showed up very like a little ship of the line, a duplicity normally enlarged by paintwork and sham gun. At the Bali Strait Incident of 28 January 1797 an unescorted guard of East Indiamen had utilized this similitude to threaten an incredible French frigate squadron into pulling back without a battle. In February 1799 an assault by a consolidated French-Spanish squadron on the gathered guard at Macau was driven off in the Macau Incident without battle by the little Royal Navy escort squadron.
