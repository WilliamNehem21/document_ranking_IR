The fourth alert was issued on lap 54 when Ambrose reached Logano, causing a numerous fender bender including Earnhardt, Kenseth, and Truex. The majority of the pioneers made pit quits amid the alert. Amid lap 55 Harvick and Logano headed to their carports, resigning from the race. Biffle drove at the lap 61 restart before Gordon recovered the lead, with Johnson moving into second spot. Ten laps later, Kyle Busch led the pack until Stewart passed him two laps later. On lap 74, Kyle Busch lost control of his vehicle which caused Gordon to reach the stopping point; his vehicle moved over, provoking the fifth and last alert. Kurt Busch, Johnson and McMurray were gotten up to speed in the disaster area. The race restarted on lap 81, for a greenÃ¢ÂÂ whiteÃ¢ÂÂ checker wrap up (the race to 82 laps) with Stewart driving Ambrose, Bowyer and Keselowski until Ambrose (with help from Keselowski) passed him. On the last lap, Stewart recovered the lead (with assistance from Kyle Busch) before Busch passed him to win the race. The edge of triumph was 0.013 seconds, the nearest ever of occasion. Ambrose completed third, Keselowski fourth and Hamlin fifth. Biffle, Newman, Bowyer, Edwards and Montoya adjusted the best ten finishers in the race.
