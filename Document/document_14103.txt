Analysts lauded the work as "engaging, astute and famously decipherable", albeit some idea it was excessively melancholy in spots. Isolating Shelley's movement journal from the new manuals and handbooks, audits, for example, that from the "Chart book", lauded her "rich extravagant, her extreme love of nature, and her touchy anxiety of all that is great, and wonderful and free". They commended its freedom of thought, mind, and feeling. Shelley's analysis on the social and political existence of Italy, which was for the most part thought better than the German segments, made one analyst consider the book crafted by "a lady who thinks for herself regarding all matters, and who sets out to state what she considers", a lady with a "manly and unique personality". Not all analysts commended her freedom of brain. "The Observer" expressed: "With her, similarly as with all ladies, governmental issues involves the heart, and not likewise with the more hearty nature of man, of the headÃÂ ... It is an inactive and unfruitful subject for a lady." Most of the audits reacted emphatically to Shelley's political points; those that were unsympathetic to her political position commonly debated her particular cases. For instance, one commentator guaranteed that Italy had been improved by Austrian guideline.
