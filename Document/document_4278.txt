He proceeded onward to Ipswich Town in 1969 and it was there that he set up his notoriety for being an effective director, upheld by the club executive John Cobbold and after that later by his sibling Patrick Cobbold. He won the empty employment at the Suffolk club after an opportunity experience with Town executive Murray Sangster while exploring at Portman Road for Chelsea director Dave Sexton. After four unremarkable seasons, Robson drove Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division and achievement in the Texaco Cup in the 1972Ã¢ÂÂ 73 season. In the accompanying nine seasons, Ipswich completed lower than 6th spot in the First Division just once, in the 1977Ã¢ÂÂ 78 season. In any case, that season was a triumph with a 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 triumph over Arsenal in the FA Cup last. His rule at Ipswich kept going 13 years, amid which time the club twice completed as League sprinters up, and showed up in European rivalries, catching the UEFA Cup in 1981 with a 5Ã¢ÂÂ 4 total triumph over Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar. Amid his 13-year residency, he acquired just 14 players from different clubs, most eminently Allan Hunter, Bryan Hamilton and Paul Mariner, depending rather on players created through Ipswich's childhood programs, including Terry Butcher, George Burley, John Wark, Mick Mills, Colin Viljoen, Alan Brazil, Trevor Whymark, Brian Talbot, Kevin Beattie and Eric Gates, who all proceeded to play global football. His imports included Dutch players Frans Thijssen and Arnold MÃÂ¼hren. Robson was not a strategic virtuoso but rather he demonstrated an ability for growing new players, with his great relational aptitudes, mindful demeanor, diligent work and energy helping them to accomplish their best.
