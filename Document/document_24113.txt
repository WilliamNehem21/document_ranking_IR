Carmen dropped moderate rainfall along its path, though the heaviest rainfall occurred well to the east of the storm's center, in southern Alabama and the northern Florida Panhandle. Precipitation peaked at over in Atmore, Alabama. Winds gusted up to , and along the coast, tides ran as high as above normal. Over northwestern Louisiana, winds ranged from and brought down several trees. In New Orleans, despite wind gusts to , minimal damage was reported. The hurricane's effects in Baton Rouge were confined to strewn debris and a few downed trees. Because Carmen moved ashore over uninhabited marshland, it caused far less damage than initially feared. Nonetheless, tidal flooding from the Gulf of Mexico and coastal bodies of water was severe. Freshwater flooding was less extreme. In total, the storm inundated of land in Louisiana, including in Terrebonne Parish and in Plaquemines Parish. A large oak tree was overturned by high winds in the town of Jeanerette in Iberia Parish.
The storm's greatest impact was the loss of sugar cane crops in Louisiana. An estimated of sugar cane in 16Â parishes was damaged, and about 20Â percent was completely ruined. After a tour of the affected area, then-Governor Edwin Edwards estimated crop damage alone at $400Â million, although a more recent estimate placed total agricultural damage from the hurricane at $74Â million. The sugar cane crop was crucial to the country's sugar supplies, rendering the losses "doubly bad", and sugar futures rose drastically after the storm. Other crops damaged by Carmen included soybeans, rice, and cotton.
