Following early September premieres at the Renaissance Theatre in Mansfield, and the Toronto International Film Festival, "The Shawshank Redemption" began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theatersâan average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the "Los Angeles Times" pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 millionâan average of $2,545 per theaterâfinishing as the number nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy "Exit to Eden" ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama "Quiz Show" ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. "The Shawshank Redemption" closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.
