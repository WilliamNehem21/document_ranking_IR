The caliph appointed every one of his officers to a stretch of the dividers. The two besiegers and assaulted had numerous attack motors, and for three days the two sides traded rocket fire while Arab sappers attempted to undermine the dividers. As indicated by Arab accounts, an Arab detainee who had changed over to Christianity abandoned back to the caliph, and educated him about a spot in the divider which had been severely harmed by substantial precipitation and just quickly and externally fixed because of the city leader's carelessness. Thus, the Arabs focused their endeavors on this area. The protectors endeavored to secure the divider by hanging wooden bars to assimilate the stun of the attack motors, yet they chipped, and following two days a rupture was made. Promptly Aetios understood that the resistance was undermined, and chose to attempt and leap forward the assaulting armed force amid the night and connection up with Theophilos. He sent two errand people to the head, yet both were caught by the Arabs and brought before the caliph. Both consented to change over to Islam, and Mu'tasim, subsequent to giving them a rich reward, marched them around the city dividers in full perspective on Aetios and his troops.
