Five and a half months after his last begin, American Pharoah started his second season in the Grade II Rebel Stakes on a messy track at Oaklawn Park on March 14. He conveyed top load of 119 pounds and began as the 2Ã¢ÂÂ 5 most loved against six adversaries, headed by the Todd Pletcher-prepared Madefromlucky. The foal drove from the begin and attracted away the end stages to win by six and a quarter lengths. Espinoza called the victor "an astounding pony", while Baffert was happy with the run, particularly as the yearling came back with a wound shoe which would have hampered his advancement. After a month at a similar track, American Pharoah began as the chances on most loved against seven rivals in the Grade I Arkansas Derby. In the wake of dashing in second spot behind untouchable Bridget's Big Luvy, he led the pack a fourth of a mile from the completion and consistently expanded his leeway to win by eight lengths from Southwest Stakes champ Far Right. Baffert noticed, "He's developed considerably. He's a decent pony and he continues pushing ahead. I would prefer not to lose track of the main issue at hand, yet Dortmund is another who we don't yet realize how great he is. We have a one-two punch and that is a decent position to be in." After the race, Ron Moquett, the mentor of sprinter up Far Right, depicted American Pharoah as "a superhorse".
