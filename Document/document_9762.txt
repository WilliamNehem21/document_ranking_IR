MWC 922 is a star encompassed by a planetary cloud. Named the Red Square Nebula because of its similitudes to the Red Rectangle Nebula, the planetary cloud has all the earmarks of being an almost ideal square with a dim band around the central districts. The cloud contains concentric rings, which are like those found in the supernova SN 1987A. MWC 922 itself is a FS Canis Majoris variable, implying that it is a Be star containing outstandingly brilliant hydrogen outflow lines just as select illegal lines, likely because of the nearness of a nearby parallel. East of Xi Serpentis is another planetary cloud, Abell 41, containing the double star MT Serpentis at its middle. The cloud seems to have a bipolar structure, and the pivot of symmetry of the cloud has been observed to be inside 5ÃÂ° of the line opposite to the orbital plane of the stars, reinforcing the connection between paired stars and bipolar planetary nebulae. On the opposite end of the excellent age range is L483, a dull cloud which contains the protostar IRAS 18418-0440. Albeit named a class 0 protostar, it has some bizarre highlights for such an item, for example, an absence of high-speed outstanding breezes, and it has been recommended that this article is on the move between class 0 and class I. A variable cloud exists around the protostar, despite the fact that it is just noticeable in infrared light.
