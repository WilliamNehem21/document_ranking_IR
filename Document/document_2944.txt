Despite the fact that he had just scored 41 keeps running in four innings between Tests, Harvey was held for the Fifth and last Test at The Oval. Britain chose to bat on a downpour influenced pitch. Precipitation in the week paving the way to the match had deferred the begin, and Yardley's choice to bat was viewed as an amazement, as the climate recommended that bowlers would appreciate the conditions. This ended up being right as Australia chopped England down for 52 on the main day, with Lindwall (6/20) specifically figuring out how to make the ball bob at variable statures. Australia had just passed England by the end of play, achieving 2/153. The following day, Harvey went to the wrinkle at 4/243 and immediately showed the extravagance of youth. He hit Jack Young for a straight-determined four and after that pulled him for another. Harvey at that point surrendered to Eric Hollies for 17, hitting a catch to Young, leaving Australia at 5/265. The Warwickshire spinner saw this, and conveyed a topspinner that plunged more than expected, and the batsman confused his off-drive, which went noticeable all around towards mid-off. Australia completed at 389 and after that bowled England out for 188 to finish triumph by an innings and 149 runs and seal the arrangement 4Ã¢ÂÂ 0.
