Between July 2 and September 11, 1892, Crane distributed no less than ten news writes about Asbury Park issues. Despite the fact that a "Tribune" partner expressed that Crane "was not profoundly recognized over some other kid of twenty who had picked up a notoriety for saying and composing brilliant things," that late spring his announcing took on an increasingly doubtful, affectation collapsing tone. A tempest of debate emitted over a report he composed on the Junior Order of United American Mechanics' American Day Parade, entitled "Marches and Entertainments". Distributed on August 21, the report compares the "bronzed, slant carried, boorish" walking men "begrimed with residue" and the onlookers wearing "summer outfits, ribbon parasols, tennis pants, straw caps and apathetic grins". Trusting they were being mocked, some JOUAM marchers were offended and kept in touch with the manager. The proprietor of the "Tribune", Whitelaw Reid, was that year's Republican bad habit presidential competitor, and this possible expanded the affectability of the paper's administration to the issue. In spite of the fact that Townley composed a piece for the "Asbury Park Daily Press" in his sibling's safeguard, the "Tribune" immediately apologized to its perusers, considering Stephen Crane's piece "a touch of irregular correspondence, passed coincidentally by the duplicate editorial manager". Hamlin Garland and biographer John Barry authenticated that Crane revealed to them he had been rejected by the "Tribune", in spite of the fact that Willis Fletcher Johnson later denied this. The paper did not distribute any of Crane's work after 1892.
