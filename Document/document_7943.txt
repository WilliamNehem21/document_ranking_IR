Tyler and his partners had, since 1843, formulated and empowered national purposeful publicity advancing Texas extension, which downplayed Southern slaveholder's yearnings with respect to the eventual fate of Texas. Rather, Tyler depicted the addition of Texas as something that would demonstrate monetarily valuable to the country all in all. The further presentation of bondage into the tremendous fields of Texas and past, they contended, would "diffuse" instead of concentrate subjugation provincially, eventually debilitating white connection and reliance on slave work. This hypothesis was burdened to the developing eagerness among Americans for Manifest Destiny, a craving to see the social, financial and moral statutes of republicanism spread over the mainland. Besides, Tyler proclaimed that national security was in question: If outside forcesÃ¢ÂÂGreat Britain specificallyÃ¢ÂÂwere to pick up impact in Texas, it is diminished to a British cotton-creating hold and a base to apply geostrategic impact over North America. Texas may be constrained into giving up bondage, initiating slave uprisings in bordering slave states and developing sectional clashes between American free-soil and slave-soil interests. The arrangement of Calhoun, with his southern states' rights notorietyÃ¢ÂÂwhich some accepted was "synonymous with servitude"Ã¢ÂÂ took steps to give occasion to feel qualms about Tyler's painstakingly made notoriety as a patriot. Tyler, however undecided, felt obliged to enroll Calhoun as Secretary of State, since Tyler's nearest partners had, in scurry, offered the situation toward the South Carolinian statesman in the quick repercussions of the "Princeton" catastrophe. Calhoun would be affirmed by Congress by consistent vote.
