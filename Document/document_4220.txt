When Roebling was called to the Niagara Suspension Bridge venture in 1851, he had six suspension structures to his name. He observed Ellet's last intend to be unreasonable; the extension would have been excessively substantial and costly. Roebling had another structure at the top of the priority list: the twofold deck connect he had proposed before amid the offering. The lower deck, level with the edge of the gorge, would pass on travelers and carriages, and the upper deck, above, would enable completely loaded trains to proceed their voyages relentless, though at a speed of . Roebling contemplated that the decks and adequate supports would shape an inflexible cylinder, making the extension stiffer than an ordinary suspension connect. The hypothesis was like that of the rounded scaffold yet actualized at a lower cost. The building network was incredulous of Roebling's venture. Robert Stephenson, manufacturer of the rounded Britannia Bridge, was among those short-leaned to finish the Niagara Suspension Bridge before Roebling's choice. Stephenson had presented a plan for a rounded scaffold, and in 1859 he manufactured a vast and costly cylindrical extension for the Grand Trunk Railway at Montreal, Quebec. The extension manufacturer at that point said in scorn of Roebling's suspension railroad, "If your scaffold succeeds, mine is an eminent bumble."
