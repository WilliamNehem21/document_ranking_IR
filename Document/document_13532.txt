The "Liber Eliensis" was composed at Ely Abbey, which turned out to be Ely Cathedral upon transformation into a church district in 1109. The student of history Elisabeth van Houts trusts that it was written in two phases: first under Bishop Hervey le Breton, in office from 1109 to 1133; and proceeded under Bishop Geoffrey Ridel, who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the main stage was the interpretation of an Old English work into Latin, dispatched by Bishop Hervey. The remainder of the work, van Houts contends, was created during the 1170s. Nonetheless, E. O. Blake, who altered the main Latin printing of the work, presumes that the "Liber" was most likely formed in three sections, in light of its substance; the primary book of the "Liber" was started after 1131, when one of the sources utilized in the "Liber" was finished. The second has a prelude saying 'sorry' for the postponement in its culmination, and couldn't have been begun before 1154, as it records occasions from that year. The third and last book was finished between 1169, when Bishop Nigel kicked the bucket and whose passing is referenced in the book, and 1174, when another cleric was named. As there is no notice of Nigel's substitution, Blake expresses this recommends book three was done before the new religious administrator got down to business.
