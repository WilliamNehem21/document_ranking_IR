"Deinocheirus" and "Therizinosaurus" possessed the longest forelimbs known for any bipedal dinosaurs. The holotype forelimbs measure long â the humerus (upper arm bone) is , the ulna , and the hand is â including the long recurved claws. Each scapulocoracoid of the shoulder girdle has a length of . Each half of the paired ceratobranchialia measure . The shoulder-blade was long and narrow, and the deltopectoralis crest was pronounced and triangular. The upper arm (humerus) was relatively slender, and only slightly longer than the hand. The ulna and radius (lower arm bones) were elongate and not firmly connected to each other in a syndesmosis. The metacarpus was long compared to the fingers. The three fingers were about equal in length, the first being the stoutest and the second the longest. Various rough areas and impressions on the forelimbs indicate the presence of powerful muscles. Most articular surfaces of the arm bones were deeply furrowed, indicating that the animal had thick pads of cartilage between the joints. Though the arms of "Deinocheirus" were large, the ratio between them and the shoulder girdle was less than that of the smaller ornithomimosaur "Ornithomimus". The arm bones of "Deinocheirus" were similar in proportions to those of the small theropod "Compsognathus". The wishbone (furcula), an element not known from any other ornithomimosaurs, was U-shaped. The hindlimbs were relatively short, and the thigh bone (femur) was longer than the shin bone (tibia), as is common for large animals. The metatarsus was short and not arctometatarsalian, as in most other theropods. The claw bones of the feet were blunt and broad-tipped instead of tapered, unlike other theropods, but resembled the unguals of large ornithischian dinosaurs. The proportions of the toe bones resembled those of tyrannosaurs, due to the large weight they had to bear.
