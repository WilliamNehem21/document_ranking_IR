The composer Richard Arnell wrote that Beecham preferred making records to giving concerts: "He told me that audiences got in the way of music-makingÂ â he was apt to catch someone's eye in the front row." The conductor and critic Trevor Harvey wrote in "The Gramophone", however, that studio recordings could never recapture the thrill of Beecham performing live in the concert hall.
Beecham began making recordings in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras to use only principal instruments, placed as close to the recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for HMV, were of excerpts from Offenbach's "The Tales of Hoffmann" and Johann Strauss's "Die Fledermaus". In 1915, Beecham began recording for the Columbia Graphophone Company. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925â26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemealÂ â his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's "EspaÃ±a" was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.
