Amid her pre-war New York Ã¢ÂÂ Antwerp sailings, "Kroonland" conveyed some prominent and intriguing travelers. On 1 August 1904, one of the ship's travelers touched base in New York as fairly a secret lady. She described that she had gone out for supper in Antwerp and stirred to wind up adrift with just the white silk evening outfit she was wearing. Having no cash or baggage, she was banished from entering the United States and was constrained to stay on board the ship. After her issue was accounted for in "The New York Times", she got letters and messages that included propositions to be engaged. Her experience story and a letter of credit in the long run checked her character, however she was ousted after a New York specialist articulated her crazy. Later that month "The New York Times" gave an account of top notch travelers' protests over benefits for their puppies and the conditions in the pet hotel on board the liner. One traveler was resolved to have her pooch in her state room, and after others joined her in expelling canine sidekicks from the pet hotel, "Kroonland"s group returned every one of the puppies to the pet hotel. A large number of the pooch proprietors wouldn't address the others required for the span of the voyage.
