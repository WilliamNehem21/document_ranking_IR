Inferable from the scarcity of contemporaneous hotspots for Menkauhor, his connection to his antecedent, Nyuserre Ini, and to his successor, Djedkare Isesi, can't be found out certain. Menkauhor may have been a child of Nyuserre Ini; in reality Nyuserre Ini is known to have fathered a sovereign Khentykauhor as appeared by an alleviation referencing the ruler from the morgue complex of ruler Khentkaus II, the mother of Nyuserre Ini. The comparability of Khentykauhor's name to that of Menkauhor drove the Egyptologists Miroslav Verner and Vivienne Callender to suggest that the two are a similar individual, with Khentykauhor taking the name "Menkauhor" after rising the royal position. This speculation is perhaps repudiated by an engraving found in 2008 in the mastaba of Werkaure, the oldest child of an anonymous ruler. The engraving makes reference to a "Menkauhor", however does not credit any imperial ascribes to him. The Egyptologists Hana VymazalovÃÂ¡ and Filip Coppens propose this may allude to the future pharaoh Menkauhor Kaiu when he was as yet a sovereign. They note that Menkauhor may have offered brilliant stone squares for the development of the tomb of his (conceivable) relative, which would clarify the engraving. This repudiates the distinguishing proof of Menkauhor with Khentykauhor; VymazalovÃÂ¡ and Coppens guess that Khentykauhor and Menkauhor were siblings and children of Nyuserre Ini.
