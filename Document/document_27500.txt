The infructescence is small, with up to 20 small follicles concentrated at the lower end of the spike. Each follicle is long, high, and 2â3Â mm (c. 0.1Â in) wide and usually opens with fire. The long seed is composed of the cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed body proper, measuring long and wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is grey-black and wrinkled and the otherâthe inner surfaceâprotrudes and is black and glistening. The seeds are separated by a dark brown seed separator that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. It measures long and wide. The dull green cotyledons of seedlings are long and wide, described by Alex George as "cuneate to obovate". Each cotyledon has a auricle at its base. The thick, smooth hypocotyl is high and 1.5Â mm thick. The seedling leaves are crowded above the cotyledons and linear to spathulate in shape, with recurved and deeply serrated margins with v-shaped sinuses, almost dividing the leaves into triangular lobes. The first pair are long, with the next 2â4 leaves up to long. Successive leaves are more obovate in shape and up to long and wide. The seedling stems are covered in white hair.
