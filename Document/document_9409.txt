Birmingham won the hurl and Manchester City commenced. The Birmingham objective went under weight very quickly. Inside a moment a far post cross from Roy Clarke barely escaped Hayes. Two corners pursued, the second bringing about a shot by Roy Paul. The following assault, in the third moment, brought about the opening objective. Revie started the move, trading goes with Clarke, and back-behaving for the plain Hayes to clear the ball past Gil Merrick to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's certainty was shaken, bringing about a progression of Manchester City corners and a shot for Hayes, however they battled back to even out in the 15thÃÂ minute. Astall slipped the ball to Brown, who helped it forward. It bounced back off a Manchester City safeguard into the way of Welsh universal insideÃ¢ÂÂforward Noel Kinsey, who terminated home through Trautmann's far post. For the rest of the principal half Birmingham had a large portion of the play, applying weight on Manchester City full-back Leivers, yet were unfit to make an achievement. Despite the fact that Birmingham put the ball in the net twice, Brown was pronounced to be offside on the two events. With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not completely fit, Birmingham's quality and parity was upset, abandoning them especially powerless against Manchester City's eccentric style.
