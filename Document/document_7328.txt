The scapula (shoulder bone) was longer than the humerus (upper arm bone); its edge was thin and restricted, and marginally turned, after the form of the ribs. The scapula did not extend at the upper end but rather was extended at the base. The coracoid was for the most part slight and plate-like. The humerus had a slim shaft, was somewhat bent along its length, and was marginally bowed. The (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles appended) was feebly created. The closures of the ulna were extended, and edges reached out along the pole. The span was more hearty than the ulna, which is unordinary. At the point when seen from over, the pelvic support was expansive for a bipedal archosaur, and ended up more extensive towards the rear part. The broadness of the pelvic area may have obliged a back augmentation of the gut. The ilium was stretched and the ischium was long and thin. In spite of the fact that the pubis isn't known, it was presumably decreased in size like that of "Homalocephale". The femur (thigh bone) was slim and inwards bended, the tibia was thin and turned, and the fibula was slim and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot seems to have been limited, and the single known ungual (hook bone) of a toe was thin and somewhat bended. In spite of the fact that the appendages of "Stegoceras" are not totally known, they were probably similar to different pachycephalosaurs in having five-fingered hands and four toes.
