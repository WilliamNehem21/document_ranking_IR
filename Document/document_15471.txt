In Rahul Dholakia's crime-drama film "Raees" (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-heroa bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of "The Telegraph" thought Khan's performance to be "inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms". Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about worldwide. Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (played by Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali's "Jab Harry Met Sejal" (2017). Writing for "Mint", Uday Bhatia criticised Khan's pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed "similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age". The film proved to be a box office flop. Khan next reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai's comedy-drama "Zero" (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle. The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan's performance. Writing for "Hindustan Times", Raja Sen commended his "dominating performance and tremendous energy" and Anna M. M. Vetticad of "Firstpost" called him an "excellent fit" for the role for allowing his "naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight". Commercially, it failed to do well. According to a Box Office India report, Khan's stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well.
