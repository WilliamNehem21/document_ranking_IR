Alternately, Andy Webster of "The New York Times" stated, "Its clearance room generation esteems and absence of mind suddenly demonstrate a more prominent obligation than an advantage". Robert Abele of the "Los Angeles Times" scrutinized its characters, ensembles, and exchange; he said it "so frantically needs to be obsessively admiredÃÂ ...ÃÂ that it neglects to be really unique or interesting". Scott Tobias of "The A.V. Club" gave the film a C+, referencing the impacts of John Carpenter, "The Warriors", "Frantic Max 2", and "A Clockwork Orange", and censuring Jason Trost's execution. He said the film was "a junky, expendable songbird, made for a midnight crowd to swallow, burp, and disregard the following morning". Scratch Schager of "Inclination Magazine" gave it 1ÃÂ½ stars out of 4, and considered it a "humorless void" and a "wannabe clique hit". Eric Hynes of "The Village Voice" stated, "the film's appeal blurs quick" and , "[t]he issue with paying such hounded tribute to crappy motion pictures is that honesty is best accomplished by delivering a crappy motion picture thus. Mission achieved, for whatever that is value." Ethan Gilsdorf of "The Boston Globe" gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not "mindlessly sufficiently ghastly to be 'so awful it's great'". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press resounded this assessment, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is "out and out badand exhausting, and dull" and that "as satire, it just feels desensitizing". Max Nicholson of IGN said the film "is in no way, shape or form the most noticeably bad thing I've at any point seen", yet that it "ought to have been a three-minute sketch on Funny or Die".
