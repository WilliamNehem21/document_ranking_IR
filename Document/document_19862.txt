At the beginning of the development, the game was intended to be released on the PlayStation 2. In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of "Final Fantasy VII", the team decided to move the game to the PlayStation 3 and developed it with the new Crystal Tools engine, a seventh generation multiplatform game engine created by Square Enix for its next generation games. Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to "XIII". Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of "Final Fantasy XII", which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3. A PC port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as security issues. "Final Fantasy XIII" was first shown at the 2006 E3 convention. The trailer shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game. Announced alongside the game was "Final Fantasy Versus XIII", later retitled as "Final Fantasy XV", and the PlayStation Portable game "Final Fantasy Type-0", originally titled "Final Fantasy Agito XIII", the three of which form the "Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy" series. Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.
