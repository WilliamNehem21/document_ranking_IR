Temperley expresses: "After 1855 [Bennett] was impelled by late distinctions, and periodic commissions, to make a decent number out of noteworthy and generous works, however it was past the point where it is possible to recover his initial self-assurance." Works from his later years incorporated the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a peaceful cantata, "The May Queen", Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an "Establishment Ode for Cambridge University" (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which incorporated a regret for the late Prince Albert; an orchestra in G minor (Op. 43); a consecrated cantata,"The Woman of Samaria" for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; lastly a second Piano Sonata ("The Maid of Orleans", Op. 46). A considerable lot of these works were made amid his mid year occasions which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the reason for a further imbroglio with Costa, who in spite of the fact that accountable for music for the Exhibition would not lead anything by Bennett. In the long run it was directed by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber additionally charged for the event. The undertaking spilled into the press, and Costa was generally censured for his conduct.
