The third British ship enthusiastically was HMS "Orion" under Captain Sir James Saumarez, which adjusted the commitment at the leader of the fight line and go between the French fundamental line and the frigates that lay nearer inshore. As he did as such, the frigate "SÃÂ©rieuse" opened flame on "Orion", injuring two men. The tradition in maritime fighting of the time was that boats of the line did not assault frigates when there were boats of equivalent size to connect with, however in terminating first French Captain Claude-Jean Martin had invalidated the standard. Saumarez held up until the frigate was at short proximity before answering. "Orion" required only one broadside to decrease the frigate to a disaster area, and Martin's incapacitated ship floated away over the shore. Amid the defer this bypass caused, two other British boats joined the fight: Theseus, which had been veiled as a top notch deliver, pursued Foley's track crosswise over "Guerrier"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bow. Mill operator guided his ship through the center of the skirmish between the tied down British and French boats until he experienced the third French ship, "Spartiate". Tying down to port, Miller's ship opened flame at short proximity. HMS "Bold" under Captain Davidge Gould crossed the French line among "Guerrier" and "ConquÃÂ©rant", tying down between the boats and raking them both. "Orion" at that point rejoined the activity further south than planned, terminating on the fifth French ship, "Peuple Souverain," and Admiral Blanquet's lead, "Franklin".
