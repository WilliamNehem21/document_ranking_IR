Composing for the "Hartford Courant", Malcolm Johnson expressed, "Despite seemingly insurmountable opposition, this since quite a while ago postponed movie variant ends up being a work of adoration for chief Alan Parker and for his stars, the renewed Madonna, the new genius Antonio Banderas, the changeable veteran Jonathan Pryce." Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, stating "Parker's visuals breath life into the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it energy. Before the finish of the film we have a feeling that we've had our cash's value, and we're certain Evita has." On the syndicated TV program "Siskel and Ebert and the Movies", Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel gave the film a "two thumbs up" rating. Siskel, in his survey for the "Chicago Tribune", expressed, "Executive Alan Parker has mounted this generation well, which is more fruitful as scene than everything else." According to "Time" magazine's Richard Corliss, "This "Evita" isn't only a long, complex music video; it works and inhales like a genuine film, with characters deserving of our love and most profound doubts." Critic Zach Conner remarked, "It's an alleviation to state that "Evita" is really damn fine, well-cast, and abundantly envisioned. Madonna by and by jumbles our desires. She plays Evita with a powerful exhaustion and has something beyond a touch of star quality. Love or detest Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for everyone's eyes."
