For Dunne, the Dooley pieces were a weight, however one that brought him notoriety and cash, neither of which was sufficient to keep him at his work area once he picked up the Whitney inheritance. Before he passed on in 1936, Dunne realized that enthusiasm for the Dooley pieces was blurring, and this disheartened him. Understanding that perusers were experiencing difficulty with the Irish tongue, he tried different things with making an interpretation of the segments into customary English, yet distributed none in that structure. In 1938, "The New Republic" noted in an article, "on the off chance that you have a go at citing Mr. Dooley's brogue to the normal audience you will be remunerated with a look of exceptional torment. In any case, in the event that you interpret Mr. Dooley into customary English almost everything accelerates out as unadulterated insight." Ellis, writing in 1941, contended, "that the Dooley papers are news coverage of the best sort few will question; that they are writing in the more perpetual sense may not be so clear. Were the American-Irish brogue of Mr. Dooley still a living and developing language there may be no uncertainty about it, however Mr. Dooley's language has progressed toward becoming at any rate out of date, and that puts the eventual fate of the Dooley exposition in genuine inquiry." Ellis noticed that endeavors to mimic Dunne's prosperity with other Irish-lingo segments fizzled, and recommended the brogue was not basic to the firsts' notoriety, "Dunne's papers lose nothing today when converted into common English words".
