Jansson, WessÃÂ©n and SvÃÂ¤rdstrÃÂ¶m (1978) remark that the individual name that is viewed as most fascinating by researchers is "Ormika", which is generally just known from the "Gutasaga", where it was the name of a free rancher who was absolved by the Norwegian ruler Saint Olaf in 1029. The main component "ormr" ("snake") is outstanding from the Old Norse naming custom, yet the second component is the West Germanic minute - "ikan", and the absence of the last "- n" recommends an acquiring from Anglo-Saxon or Old Frisian, in spite of the fact that the name is unattested in the West Germanic region. The runologists value the presence of the nominative structure "GrikkiaÃÂ" ("Greece") as it is generally unattested while other case shapes are found on various runestones. The spot name Jerusalem shows up in the Old Gutnish structure iaursaliÃÂ while the western-most tongue of Old Norse, Old Icelandic, has "JÃÂ³rsalir", and both speak to a Scandinavian people etymological rendering where the main component is translated as the name component "jÃÂ³r-" (from a more seasoned *"eburaz" signifying "pig"). The engraving likewise demonstrates the main runic appearance of the name of Iceland, while there are five other runic engravings in Sweden that notice Serkland.
