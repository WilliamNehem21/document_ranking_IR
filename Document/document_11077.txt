Perry has freely pushed for LGBT rights. She upheld Stonewall amid their "It shows signs of improvement... today" crusade to avert homophobic harassing, and devoted the music video to her melody "Firecracker" to the It Gets Better Project. Perry revealed to Do Something in November 2008 she was glad to be a LGBT rights dissident, saying "I've generally been an extremely receptive individual, yet I unquestionably trust in balance." She affirmed that she casted a ballot against Proposition 8, a correction (at last governed illegal) that lawfully characterized marriage as an association exclusively between a man and a lady in California. In June 2012, Perry communicated her expectations for LGBT correspondence, remarking "ideally, we will glance back as of now and figure as we do now concerning [other] social liberties issues. We'll simply shake our heads in dismay, saying, 'Express gratitude toward God we've developed.' That would be my petition for what's to come." In December 2012, Perry was granted the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism in the interest of LGBT youth. On March 18, 2017, she got a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for "utilizing her incredible voice and worldwide stage to stand up for LGBTQ fairness", with the association further expressing that "Katy's message of incorporation and uniformity keeps on moving us and the world".
