During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a considerable amount of poetry, most notably "Helen in Egypt" (written between 1952â54), an examination from a feminist point of view of a male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play "Helen" as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's "Cantos", a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include "Sagesse", "Winter Love" and "Hermetic Definition". These three were published posthumously with the collective title "Hermetic Definition" (1972). The poem "Hermetic Definition" takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's "Canto 106". "Sagesse", written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to "Trilogy". being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. "Winter Love" was written together with "End to Torment" and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to "Helen in Egypt."
