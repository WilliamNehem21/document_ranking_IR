The arrangement can follow its birthplace back to a seven-minute, independent energized short film of a similar name (this short would later be recognized as the show's pilot "post facto"). Ward made the short essentially without anyone else's input, and finished up its creation in mid 2006. It was first communicated on Nicktoons Network on January 11, 2007, and was re-communicated as a component of Frederator Studios' compilation show "Arbitrary! Kid's shows" on December 7, 2008. After its underlying discharge, the video turned into a viral hit on the Internet. Frederator Studios at that point pitched an "Undertaking Time" arrangement to Nicktoons Network, which rejected it twice. In the end, Nicktoons' rights to bonus a full arrangement terminated, and Frederatorthe short's creation activity studiopitched it to different channels. One of the studios that Frederator drew closer was Cartoon Network, which was keen on creating a full arrangement. Nonetheless, they would possibly focus on an arrangement if Ward could demonstrate that the pilot "was certainly not a one-hit wonder." Rob Sorcher, the central substance officer at Cartoon Network, was compelling in getting the system to take a risk on the show; he perceived the arrangement as "something that felt truly indieÃÂ ... comic book-y [and] new".
