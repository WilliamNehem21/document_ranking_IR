"The Sunday Times" is a British national broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister paper of "The Times". In 1968, under the ownership of Lord Thomson, "The Sunday Times" had been involved in a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of Â£250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of Â£60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both "The Times" and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of "The Sunday Times". The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of "The Times" in 1974. Trevor-Roperâwho was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979âwas a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the FÃ¼hrer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published "The Last Days of Hitler" (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in "Hitler's War Directives" (1964) and "Hitler's Place in History" (1965).
