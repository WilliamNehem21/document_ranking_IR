As indicated by Sabine Scholz, the use of the "Anekantavada" as a religious reason for "scholarly Ahimsa" is a cutting edge time reinterpretation, one ascribed to the works of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view expresses that "Anekantavada" is a declaration of "religious resilience of different assessments and amicability". In the 21st century, a few journalists have displayed it as a scholarly weapon against "narrow mindedness, fundamentalism and fear based oppression". Different researchers, for example, John E. Cort and Paul Dundas express that, while Jainism undoubtedly instructs peacefulness as the most astounding moral esteem, the reinterpretation of "Anekantavada" as "religious resistance of different sentiments" is a "misreading of the first precept". In Jain history, it was a supernatural teaching and a philosophical strategy to plan its unmistakable parsimonious routine with regards to freedom. Jain history appears, in actuality, that it constantly was cruelly basic and prejudiced of Buddhist and Hindu otherworldly hypotheses, convictions and belief systems. John Cort states that the "Anekantavada" regulation in pre-twentieth century Jain writing had no connection to religious resilience or "scholarly Ahimsa". Jain scholarly and social history toward non-Jains, as per Cort, has been in opposition to the cutting edge revisionist endeavors, especially by diaspora Jains, to introduce "Jains having displayed a soul of comprehension and resistance toward non-Jains", or that Jains were uncommon or novel in rehearsing religious resilience in Indian scholarly history. As per Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, aimless receptiveness and the methodology of "tolerating every single religious way as similarly right when in certainty they are not" is a mistaken view in Jainism and not upheld by the "Anekantavada" precept.
