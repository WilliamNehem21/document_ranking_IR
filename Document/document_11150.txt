Dubious asked Mark Saunders to co-produce "Maxinquaye" subsequent to being inspired by his past work with English musical crew The Cure on their collections "Stirred Up" (1990) and "Wish" (1992). They recorded "Maxinquaye" in the main portion of 1994 at Tricky's home studio in Kilburn; further chronicle later occurred at the Loveshack and Eastcote studios in Notting Hill. Island Records, fourth and B'Way's parent mark, set up gear in the home studio at Tricky's solicitation, including an Akai S1000 sampler, an Atari 1040 PC with Logic programming, an Alesis ADAT recorder, an AKG C3000 receiver, a Behringer Composer blower, and a Mackie 1604 blending work area. The chronicle sessions were to some degree clamorous, and Saunders, who had the impression he would just perform building obligations, frequently wound up filling in as a DJ and software engineer. Precarious taught him on what to test, paying little heed to various rhythms and pitches, and requested that he sort the outcomes out, something Saunders accomplished by pitch-moving the particular examples until the blend sounded attractive. The examples they explored different avenues regarding were taken from the numerous vinyl records that Saunders reviewed were "littered" everywhere on Tricky's floor. Affected by name music's generation methods, Tricky comprehensively changed acquired sounds on his sampler, blended tracks as they were being recorded live in the studio, and safeguarded sounds that generally would have been undesirable in the last blend, including glitches and pops.
