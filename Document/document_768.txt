"Isopogon anethifolius" is a bush as a rule between high with an upstanding propensity (tall and slim with for the most part vertical stems). It for the most part becomes taller in increasingly shielded territories, for example, forests, and shorter in progressively uncovered zones. The stems are ruddy in shading, and new development in winter is tinged with rosy and tan tones. The leaves are terete (round in cross segment) and under 1ÃÂ mm (ÃÂ in) in distance across. They branch more than once in their length. The globular yellow flowerheads, known as inflorescences, show up at the finishes of branches in spring and late-spring (September to December), however once in a while at different occasions of year. These are up to in measurement. The individual blooms emerge out of the focal woody globe in a winding example, and are around long. They are straight stalkless structures that start from a scale on the globe, made out of a cylindrical structure known as the perianth, which envelopes the bloom's sexual organs. The perianth parts into four portions, uncovering a slight sensitive style that is tipped with the disgrace. At the finishes of the four perianth fragments are the male dust bearing structures known as anthers. Organized in a winding example, the blooms open from the external/base of the flowerhead inwards. The egg-molded dark cones are uncovered as the old bloom parts fall away, and are up to 2.5ÃÂ cm (1ÃÂ in) in distance across. The seed-bearing nuts are littleÃ¢ÂÂup to overÃ¢ÂÂand fixed with hairs. The seed weighs around .
