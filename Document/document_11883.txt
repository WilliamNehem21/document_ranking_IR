There was visit ice sheet arrangement on the mountain as Mazama created. They cut channels in the flanks of the spring of gushing lava notwithstanding U-formed valleys under the base of the volcanic cone. These can be seen at three extensive frosty gullies on its southern slants: Kerr Notch, Munson Balley, and Sun Notch. At whatever point ejections occurred within the sight of ice, magma was chilled by icy masses, making smooth bone stores. Now and again, the magma coursed into regions recently cut by ice sheets like at Sentinel Rock, filling gullies with volcanic shake. Moraines happen up to from the edge of Mazama's caldera, and there are cold striations unmistakable at a few destinations in the territory. At the point when the climactic ejection happened, the atmosphere was warm and dry, and the latest time of frosty development stopped around 27,000 years back, so when Mazama crumbled, ice was likely just present at higher rises. Utilizing argon geochronology and paleoclimatic records, researchers have recognized that the Sand Creek, Sun Creek, and Annie Creek gorge were cut by the development of ice over magma streams, pushing trash towards Klamath Marsh and Klamath Graben or adjacent waterways. An icy cirque can be seen on Mount Scott's northwestern flank, and frigid till happens on Mazama's slants, particularly on the western inclines and at lower rises. Till and fluvial silt happen in the caldera dividers, framing especially thick stores under Roundtop and Wineglass. Numerous magma streams that were glaciated have since been secured by later magma streams.
