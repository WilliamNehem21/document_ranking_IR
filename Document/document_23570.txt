"Dendrocollybia racemosa" is a saprobic species, meaning it derives nutrients by breaking down dead or dying tissue. Its fruit bodies grow on the well-decayed remains of agarics, often suspected to be "Lactarius" or "Russula", although the hosts' identities are often unclear due to an advanced state of decay. A 2006 study used molecular analysis to confirm "Russula crassotunicata" as a host for "D.Â racemosa". This "Russula" has a long and persistent decay period, and, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States where the study was conducted, provides a "nearly year-round substrate for mycosaprobic species". "Dendrocollybia" is one of four agaric genera obligately associated with growth on the fruit bodies of other fungi, the others being "Squamanita", "Asterophora", and "Collybia". "Dendrocollybia" is also found less commonly in deep coniferous duff, in groups or small clusters. The fungus can form sclerotia in the mummified host fruit bodies, and may also develop directly from their sclerotia in soil. The fungus is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but rarely collected "probably due to its small size, camouflage color, and tendency to be immersed in its substrate." In North America, where the distribution is restricted to the Pacific Northwest, fruit bodies are found in the late summer to autumn, often after a heavy fruiting period for other mushrooms is over. In Europe, it is known from the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and Belgium. "Dendrocollybia racemosa" is in the Danish, Norwegian, and British Red Lists.
