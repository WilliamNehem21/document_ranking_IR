Nielsen examined Renaissance polyphony intently, which represents a portion of the melodic and symphonious substance of his music. This intrigue is exemplified in his "Tre Motetter" (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish commentators, Nielsen's music at first had a neo-traditional sound however turned out to be progressively current as he built up his very own way to deal with what the essayist and arranger Robert Simpson called dynamic tonality, moving starting with one key then onto the next. Ordinarily, Nielsen's music may finish in an alternate key from that of its initiation, now and again as the result of a battle as in his orchestras. There is banter with respect to how much such components owe to his people music exercises. A few commentators have alluded to his rhythms, his utilization of acciaccaturas or appoggiaturas, or his successive utilization of a straightened seventh and minor third in his works, as being ordinarily Danish. The writer himself expressed "The interims, from my perspective, are the components which initially stir a more profound enthusiasm for musicÃÂ ... [I]t is interims which amazement and pleasure us once more every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its intrigue would be less if its call were all on one note."
