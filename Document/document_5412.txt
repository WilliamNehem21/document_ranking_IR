Albert appears to have gotten Luther's letter with the "Proposals" around the finish of November. He mentioned the supposition of scholars at the University of Mainz and consulted with his guides. His counselors prescribed he have Luther precluded from lecturing against guilty pleasures as per the extravagance bull. Albert mentioned such activity from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was quickly seen as a risk. In February 1518, Pope Leo solicited the head from the Augustinian Hermits, Luther's religious request, to persuade him to quit spreading his thoughts regarding guilty pleasures. Sylvester Mazzolini was likewise selected to compose a sentiment which would be utilized in the preliminary against him. Mazzolini stated "A Dialog against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope", which concentrated on Luther's scrutinizing of the pope's position as opposed to his objections about guilty pleasure lecturing. Luther got a request to Rome in August 1518. He reacted with "Clarifications of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences", in which he endeavored to clear himself of the charge that he was assaulting the pope. As he set down his perspectives all the more broadly, Luther appears to have perceived that the ramifications of his convictions set him further from authority educating than he at first knew. He later said he probably won't have started the contention had he known where it would lead. The "Clarifications" have been called Luther's first Reformation work.
