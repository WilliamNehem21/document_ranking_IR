The house of God was worked by the Divine Word Missionaries (abridged "SVD," from their Latin name: "Societas Verbi Divini"), the principal German Catholic evangelist society. The request was established in 1875 "for the spread of the Catholic religion among agnostic countries," at Steyl (today in the Limburg Province of the Netherlands), by German Catholic clerics escaping the Kulturkampf. The general public's first mission was built up in 1882 in southern Shantung, a region of more than 10ÃÂ million individuals, which contained 158 Catholics. At the time, the zone was a piece of the Apostolic Vicariate of Shantung, overseen by Italian Franciscans, who were entrusted with revamping the before Catholic mission work. Be that as it may, the mission work continued gradually, because of lacking staff and assets. The southern portion of the region, specifically, had been everything except dismissed. Thus, it was exchanged to the SVD on December 2, 1885, and turned into the Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan-tung. The new Vicariate Apostolic was headquartered in Yanzhou, Shandong and headed by Bishop Johann Baptist von Anzer, SVD, who drove it until November 24, 1903. By 1907, the mission numbered 35,378ÃÂ Catholics and 36,367 catechumens, and by 1924, 44,000ÃÂ catechumens. The SVD's quality in Qingdao was first recorded when the mission bought land there in 1899 and started assembling a mission lobby.
