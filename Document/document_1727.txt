On 8ÃÂ February 1601 he joined the Earl of Essex in open defiance to the administration. Essex's point was to verify his very own desire, however the Jesuit Henry Garnet portrayed the young fellows who went with him as being intrigued generally in advancing the Catholic reason. Caught and detained, Tresham spoke to Katherine Howard, yet was reprimanded. His sister, Lady Mounteagle, cautioned his cousin John Throckmorton, who swung to "three most decent parsons and one especiall instrument" for help. The character of these people is vague, however Tresham was guaranteed opportunity depending on the prerequisite that throughout the following three months his dad pay ÃÂ£2,100 to William Ayloffe, to "spare his lyef attainder in bloode." He was discharged on 21ÃÂ June. The experience did not prevent him from taking part in further tricks; in 1602 and 1603 he was engaged with the missions to Catholic Spain made by Thomas Wintour, Anthony Dutton (potentially a false name of Christopher Wright) and Guy Fawkes, later named by the English government as the Spanish Treason. Nonetheless, upon James' increase to the honored position, he told Thomas Wintour (secretary to Tresham's brother by marriage William Parker, fourth Baron Monteagle), that he would "stand completely for the King", and "to have no discourse with him of Spain."
