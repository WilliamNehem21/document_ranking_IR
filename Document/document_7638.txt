Following his capture, the ancestral court of the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe accused Lara of ambushing the capturing officers, alongside four different charges. Lara conceded to the innate charge of "viciousness to a policeman". Before long, government investigators accused Lara of attack on a bureaucratic officer and an administrative great jury arraigned him. Lara moved to expel the charge dependent on twofold peril and other sacred grounds. The Federal District Court, with Magistrate Judge Alice R. Senechal sitting by assent, denied the movements and Lara entered a contingent blameworthy request, maintaining all authority to offer. Senechal noticed that two other preliminary courts in the circuit had effectively decided that twofold peril did not have any significant bearing, that the ICRA just perceived the inborn sway of the clans and did not appoint prosecutorial capacity to the clan. She further noticed that another circuit court had ruled a similar way. Lara additionally contended that the "Petite" precept, whenever connected, would block his arraignment, and that since it was never connected to government indictments following feelings in inborn court, it victimized Indians. Senechal denied this movement, taking note of that Lara had demonstrated no instances of different races not being arraigned for like offenses.
