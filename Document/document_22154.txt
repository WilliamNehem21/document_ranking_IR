According to the "Chicago Sun-Times" and the "St. Petersburg Times", "Everything Tastes Better with Bacon" is a niche work in the cookbook genre. Perry stated that bacon had undergone a renaissance period. "Christian Science Monitor" noted in a 2003 article that bacon was becoming an increasingly used cooking ingredient, despite having been maligned by nutritionists. Recipes from the book were selected for inclusion in "The Best American Recipes 2003â2004: The Year's Top Picks from Books, Magazines, Newspapers and the Internet". Perry's recipe for "Succulent Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp" was referenced in the 2003 book "Smoke & Spice: Cooking with Smoke, the Real Way to Barbecue". Fran McCullough, the author of "The Best American Recipes", commented that the book was a surprising addition to the field. "The Atlantic" said that three years after the book's publication, bacon had become as popular as chocolate or olive oil. Leah A. Zeldes observed in a 2006 article for the "Chicago Sun-Times" that the book contributed to the body of works that display the adaptability of bacon in recipes. In his 2009 book "Hungry Monkey", author Matthew Amster-Burton commented on the phenomena involving bacon and books on the subject in prior years, listing the book along with "The Bacon Cookbook" and "Seduced by Bacon". A 2013 article in the British newspaper "The Independent" cited the book as an example of increasing interest in pork.
