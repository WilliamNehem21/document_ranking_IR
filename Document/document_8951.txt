Naval commander Sir Michael Denny supplanted Creasy as Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, on 5 January 1954 and "Vanguard" took an interest in Exercise Medflex A with Dutch and French ships in March. Amid the remainder of the year she took an interest in hostile to submarine and against flying machine practices just as making port visits to Oslo and Kristiansand in Norway and Helsingborg in Sweden. She was assessed on 11 July by King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden before returning home soon thereafter. Denny struck his banner on 15 September, and "Vanguard" cruised to Devonport for a ÃÂ£220,000 refit 10 days after the fact. The February 1955 Defense Estimates had expected her as the Home Fleet leader with a job as an executioner, however after the arrangement of Earl Mountbatten in April 1955 and with Antony Eden supplanting Churchill as PM, the legislature chose rather to keep up two additional cruisers in the armada, and "Vanguard" was set available for later when it finished its 1955 refit. She therefore turned into the leader of the Reserve Fleet when Vice Admiral Richard Onslow lifted his banner on 28 November. While moored in Fareham Creek, amid her time in the hold armada, waterline shots of "Vanguard" in Portsmouth Harbor were recorded for the title grouping of the 1957 satire film "Carry on Admiral". Just before decommissioning, scenes for the 1960 film "Sink the Bismarck!" were shot on board, with "Vanguard" being utilized to delineate insides of the extensions, Admiral's Quarters and firearm turrets for "Hood", "Bismarck" and "Lord George V".
