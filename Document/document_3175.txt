On 2 September 31 BC the maritime powers of Octavian, driven by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, met those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium. Cleopatra, on board her lead, the "Antonias", directed 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, at the back of the armada, in what was likely a move by Antony's officers to minimize her amid the fight. Antony had requested that their boats ought to have cruises ready for a superior opportunity to seek after or escape from the foe, which Cleopatra, at any point worried about safeguarding Egypt, used to quickly travel through the zone of significant battle in a vital withdrawal to the Peloponnese. Burstein composes that divided Roman journalists would later blame Cleopatra for weak betraying Antony, yet their unique aim of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the barricade and rescue however much of their armada as could be expected. Antony pursued Cleopatra and boarded her ship, recognized by its unmistakable purple sails, as the two got away from the fight and set out toward Tainaron. Antony purportedly maintained a strategic distance from Cleopatra amid this three-day voyage, until her women in holding up at Tainaron encouraged him to talk with her. The Battle of Actium seethed on without Cleopatra and Antony until the morning of 3 September, and was trailed by huge surrenders of officers, troops, and united lords to Octavian's side.
