Volubilis remained the capital of the district well into the Islamic time frame. Islamic coins dating to the eighth century have been found on the site, authenticating the landing of Islam in this piece of Morocco. They are focused outside the city dividers, which recommends that Arab settlement stayed unmistakable from the Berber settlement inside them. It was here that Moulay Idriss set up the Idrisid tradition of Morocco in 787-8. An immediate relative of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, he disappeared to Morocco from Syria following the Battle of Fakhkh in 787. He was broadcasted "imam" in Volubilis, involved by the Awraba, under Ishaq ibn Mohammad. He wedded Kanza, from the Awraba, and fathered a child, Idris II, who was announced imam in Volubilis. He, as well, lived outside the dividers of the city, along the banks of the Wadi Khoumane, where a complex has as of late been unearthed that might be related to his central station. Idriss I vanquished the greater part of Northern Morocco amid the three years of his rule, establishing the city of Fes. He was killed in Volubilis in 791 on the requests of the caliph of Baghdad, Harun al-Rashid. On his larger part Idriss II evacuated to Fes which filled in as his new capital, denying Volubilis of its last remnants of political essentialness.
