Bounce is discharged from jail by and by in "Sideshow Bob Roberts" (season six, 1994), and keeps running for Mayor of Springfield as the Republican Party competitor. He crushes Democratic Party officeholder Joe Quimby in an avalanche, however Bart and Lisa find that Bob fixed the decision, prompting another imprisonment. Bounce escapes from jail without precedent for "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" (season seven, 1995), and takes steps to explode Springfield with an atomic bomb except if the city quits telecom all TV programs. He is obstructed when he discovers that the bomb itself is a failure, at that point abducts Bart and flies the Wright Brothers' plane trying to slaughter himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is stowing away inside a shack, extemporizing an execution on the Emergency Broadcast System). This also is upset, and Bob comes back to jail. In the accompanying season, Bob exploits the jail's work discharge program, and gives off an impression of being truly reclaimed. In "Sibling from Another Series", Reverend Lovejoy proclaims him a changed man and prescribes him for a work discharge opportunity. Bounce is released from jail into the consideration of his sibling Cecil, who is Springfield's boss hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer. In any case, the plotting Cecil, as yet stinging over his fizzled tryout for Krusty, attempts to outline Bob by undermining the Springfield Dam. Weave, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and spare the town, and the two siblings, notwithstanding Bob's certifiable blamelessness, are sent to jail.
