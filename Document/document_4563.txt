Jackson was elevated to flight lieutenant on 1ÃÂ July 1941. At this point his more youthful sibling Ed had been presented on No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron and was presenting with him in Palestine. With the crusade in Syria finishing up in mid-July, the unit attempted no tasks in August and work force went on leave before coming back to activity in Egypt the following month. The provincial reproduced Jackson took to the night life in Alexandria, however his stay at a top notch lodging left him befuddled with regards to the motivation behind the room's bidet, which he in the end decided was "some female plan". Subside Ewer, in "Tempest Over Kokoda", watched: "There was something of the patrician about John Jackson, yet his wealthy foundation had an unmistakably Australian tinge to it. He preferred a round of cards, with a wager on the result." In "Murmuring Death", Mark Johnston noticed that albeit "tall and blue-peered toward", he "didn't have the quality of a 'kid's own' or motion picture star pilot", yet rather was "thinning up top, strolling and no outgoing individual". Jackson came back to Australia in November 1941. He was referenced in despatches, and granted the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his "checked insight and assurance" amid activities with No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron in the Middle East. The previous honor was proclaimed in the "London Gazette" on 1ÃÂ January 1942 and the last mentioned, which recorded him as "John Henry Jackson", on 7ÃÂ April. The DFC was introduced to Jackson's widow Elisabeth, after his demise.
