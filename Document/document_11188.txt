The cap is dated to the main portion of the primary century AD, in view of the style of the acanthus look on the back of the protective cap, and different items found with the head protector and in the tombs adjacent. It is the most punctual known Roman protective cap with a face veil, and is comprehensively named a mounted force sports head protectorÃ¢ÂÂtype D, as per the typology set forward by H. Russell Robinson. Type D protective caps are described by a solitary even pivot connecting the face cover to the head piece, and by head pieces that are brightened to speak to caps. A few kind D precedents exist, for example, the Nijmegen protective cap, however not at all like these, the Emesa head protector was presumably never planned for wearing use. It might rather have been given as a blessing by a Roman authority to a general of the decision group of Emesa, or fabricated in Syria to the similarity of head protectors seen amid Roman competitions. The last condition is thought more probable, for the acanthus ornamentation takes after that seen on Syrian sanctuaries. The cap may in this manner have been dispatched from the workshops of Antioch, known for their extravagance.
