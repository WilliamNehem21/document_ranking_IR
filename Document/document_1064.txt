The ice surface was separated, making travel moderate and troublesome. At first the gatherings had the capacity to go along a track that had been set apart out by the development parties. Be that as it may, late tempests had devastated a great part of the trail, and in spots advance was held up by breaking ice which at one point nearly destroyed Bartlett's camp as his group rested. On 28 February every one of the gatherings met up before the first of a progression of high edges, from in tallness, that ended their advancement. These extended east and west, hindering any course to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a dangerous voyage back to Shipwreck Camp to get supplies that had been left there, while the rest gradually slashed and carve a pathway through the transcending edges. At the point when McKinlay's gathering came back to the fundamental party seven days after the fact, the way ahead had been progressed by just three miles (5ÃÂ km), yet the most exceedingly awful of the edges had been survived. Hadley guaranteed that the edges were more terrible than anything he had found in his long periods of Arctic experience. The later phases of the voyage were simpler, as the gathering went over consistently smoother ice, and on 12 March they achieved land, a long spit of sand extending from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.
