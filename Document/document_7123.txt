After the German Ober Ost battalions were pulled back from the Eastern Front after the Armistice, both Soviet Russian armed forces and Polish ones moved in to fill the vacuum. The recently free Polish state and the Soviet government each looked for regional extension in the area. Clean and Russian troops initially conflicted in February 1919, with the contention forming into the PolishÃ¢ÂÂ Soviet War. In contrast to the Soviets' past clashes, this had more prominent ramifications for the fare of unrest and the eventual fate of Europe. Clean powers pushed into Ukraine and by May 1920 had taken Kiev from the Soviets. In the wake of compelling the Polish Army back, Lenin asked the Red Army to attack Poland itself, trusting that the Polish low class would ascend to help the Russian troops and in this way sparkle European insurgency. Trotsky and different Bolsheviks were distrustful, yet consented to the intrusion. The Polish low class did not rise, and the Red Army was crushed at the Battle of Warsaw. The Polish armed forces drove the Red Army once again into Russia, compelling Sovnarkom to sue for harmony; the war finished in the Peace of Riga, in which Russia surrendered an area to Poland.
