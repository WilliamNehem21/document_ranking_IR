Marcel Lihau was conceived on 29 September 1931 in Bumba, ÃÂquateur Province, Belgian Congo, the oldest of eight kids. After his optional instruction at the Bolongo theological school, he went to the Jesuit University Center in Kisantu, moving on from the school's managerial sciences division. One of Lihau's instructors, humanist Willy De Craemer, made plans to enable him to take on the UniversitÃÂ© catholique de Louvain in Belgium, a school for the most part inaccessible to Congolese. To do this, De Craemer coached him in Latin, Greek, and Flemish so he could take the Jury Central selection test. Lihau breezed through the test with a high score and was admitted to the college. Since it was his objective to think about law (not allowed to Congolese understudies at the time), De Craemer and a few thoughtful Jesuit teachers masterminded Lihau to take the important classes under the front of contemplating Roman philology. He additionally contemplated financial matters and theory. For the span of his investigations he remained with the group of a previous executive of LÃÂ©opoldville Radio, Karel Theunissen. Lihau filled in as leader of the little Congolese-Ruanda-Urundi understudies' association in Belgium, Association GÃÂ©nÃÂ©rale des ÃÂtudiants Congolais en Belgique (AGEC).
