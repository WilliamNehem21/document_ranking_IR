Grand Coulee Dam supports four different power houses containing 33 hydroelectric generators. The original Left and Right Powerhouses contain 18 main generators and the Left has an additional three service generators for total installed capacity of 2,280Â MW. The first generator was commissioned in 1941 and all 18 were operating by 1950. The Third Powerplant contains a total of six main generators with a 4,215Â MW installed capacity. Generators G-19, G-20 and G-21 in the Third Powerplant have a 600Â MW installed capacity but can operate at a maximum capacity of 690Â MW which brings the overall maximum capacity of the dam's power facilities to 7,079Â MW. The Pump-Generating Plant contains six pump-generators with an installed capacity of 314Â MW. When pumping water into Banks Lake they consume 600Â MW of electricity. Each generator is supplied with water by an individual penstock. The largest of these feed the Third Powerplant and are in diameter and can supply up to . The dam's power facilities originally had an installed capacity of 1,974Â MW but expansions and upgrades have increased generation to 6,809Â MW installed, 7,079Â MW maximum. Grand Coulee Dam generates 21 TWh of electricity annually. This means the dam generates about 2,397 MW of power on average, which results in a total plant factor efficiency of 35%. In 2014, 20.24 TWh of electricity was generated.
