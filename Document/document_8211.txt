Like different sirenians, Steller's ocean cow was a commit herbivore and gone through a large portion of the day sustaining, just lifting its head each 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5 minutes for relaxing. Kelp was its primary sustenance source, making it an algivore. The ocean dairy animals likely benefited from a few types of kelp, which have been distinguished as "Agarum" spp., "Alaria praelonga", "Halosaccion glandiforme", "Laminaria saccharina", "Nereocyctis luetkeana", and "Thalassiophyllum clathrus". Steller's ocean dairy animals just nourished legitimately on the delicate pieces of the kelp, which made the harder stem and holdfast appear on the shore in piles. The ocean bovine may have likewise benefited from seagrass, yet the plant was not normal enough to help a practical populace and couldn't have been the ocean dairy animals' essential nourishment source. Further, the accessible seagrasses in the ocean cow's range ("Phyllospadix" spp. furthermore, "Zostera marina") may have become excessively profound submerged or been unreasonably extreme for the creature to expend. Since the ocean dairy animals glided, it likely benefited from overhang kelp, as it is accepted to have just approached nourishment no more profound than underneath the tide. Kelp discharges a compound impediment to shield it from munching, yet shade kelp discharges a lower grouping of the synthetic, permitting the ocean bovine to touch securely. Steller noticed that the ocean dairy animals became slight amid the bone chilling winters, showing a time of fasting because of low kelp development. Fossils of Pleistocene Aleutian Island ocean bovine populaces were bigger than those from the Commander Islands, showing that the development of Commander Island ocean dairy animals may have been hindered because of a less positive environment and less nourishment than the hotter Aleutian Islands.
