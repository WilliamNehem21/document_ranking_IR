McNeile's initial works, the war stories distributed before 1919, are either "plot-driven experience narrative[s], for example, the short stories "The Song of the Bayonet" and "Private Meyrick, Company Idiot", or "air vignette[s], for example, "The Land of Topsy Turvy" and "The Human Touch". McNeile would expound on 1,000 words each morning in a standard that was infrequently irritated; he took no breaks while composing and would do no re-composes until he finished his work. The scholarly Jessica Meyer has reprimanded his style as having "minimal tasteful legitimacy, being stylised, threadbare and regularly dull"; Richard Usborne concurred, including that the female characters were "cardboard" and that McNeile was "magnificently absent minded" about characters dead in one book and alive in the following. In the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson recognizes the focal character as "an exaggerated creation, serviceable just inside a setting of acting". The scholarly Joan DelFattore brings up that while the characters and plots can't be viewed as one of a kind, dependable or balanced, his books "make no case to artistic brilliance", and are rather, "great, strong spine chillers". Usborne concurs, and trusts that McNeile composed great stories that were defective however well told. Meyer arranges the non-war stories as middlebrow, with "wistful plotlines and showing a social message about the state of England". His initial books, especially "Bull-Dog Drummond" and "The Black Gang", were organized freely and here and there as short stories. The scholarly Hans Bertens accused this for McNeile's absence of experience and fearlessness, noticing that in his later books, McNeile "aced the traps of his exchange".
