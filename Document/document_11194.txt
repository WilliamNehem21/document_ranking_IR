Pompey at first guaranteed Rome and the senate that he could crush Caesar in fight should he walk on Rome. Be that as it may, by the spring of 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon waterway with his attacking powers and cleared down the Italian promontory towards Rome, Pompey requested the surrender of Rome. Caesar's military was still under-quality, with specific units staying in Gaul, however then again Pompey himself just had a little power at his direction, and that with questionable steadfastness having served under Caesar. Tom Holland credits Pompey's eagerness to surrender Rome to rushes of freezing exiles as an endeavor to mix hereditary feelings of trepidation of attacks from the north. Pompey's powers withdrew south towards Brundisium, and afterward fled to Greece. Caesar initially guided his thoughtfulness regarding the Pompeian fortification of Iberia yet following crusading by Caesar in the Siege of Massilia and Battle of Ilerda he chose to assault Pompey in Greece. Pompey at first crushed Caesar at the Battle of Dyrrachium in 48 BC yet neglected to catch up on the triumph. Pompey was definitively vanquished in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC notwithstanding dwarfing Caesar's powers two to one. Pompey fled once more, this opportunity to Egypt, where he was killed trying to charm the nation with Caesar and keep away from a war with Rome.
