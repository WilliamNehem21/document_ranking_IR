The pyramid was quickly analyzed by John Shae Perring and not long after by Karl Richard Lepsius; the last indexed the pyramid on his spearheading list as number XXXV. Section was first picked up by Gaston Maspero, who analyzed its substructure in 1881. He had as of late found a lot of writings in the pyramids of Pepi I and Merenre I. Those equivalent writings were found in Unas' tomb, showing up. From 1899 to 1901, the planner and Egyptologist Alessandro Barsanti led the main efficient examination of the pyramid site, prevailing with regards to unearthing some portion of the funeral home sanctuary, just as a progression of tombs from the Second Dynasty and the Late Period. Later unearthings by Cecil Mallaby Firth, from 1929 until his passing in 1931, trailed by those of the modeler Jean-Philippe Lauer from 1936 to 1939, were led with little achievement. The archeologists Selim Hassan, Muhammed Zakaria Goneim and A. H. Hussein for the most part centered around the thoroughfare prompting the pyramid while directing their examinations from 1937 to 1949. Hussein found a couple of limestone-lined vessel pits at the upper end of the interstate. During the 1970s, Ahmad Moussa exhumed the lower half of the thoroughfare and the valley sanctuary. Moussa and another excavator, , directed a building study of the valley sanctuary from 1971 to 1981. The pyramids of Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Merenre were the subjects of a noteworthy structural and epigraphic venture in Saqqara, driven by Jean Leclant. From 1999 until 2001, the Supreme Council of Antiquities directed a noteworthy reclamation and reproduction venture on the valley sanctuary. The three doors and slopes were reestablished, and a low limestone divider worked to differentiate the sanctuary's arrangement.
