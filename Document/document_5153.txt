To begin with, Schicchi sets up that nobody other than those present realizes that Buoso is dead. He at that point arranges the body expelled to another room. A thump declares the landing of the specialist, Spinelloccio. Schicchi hides himself behind the bed window ornaments, emulates Buoso's voice and pronounces that he's feeling good; he requests that the specialist return that night. Flaunting that he has never lost a patient, Spinelloccio withdraws. Schicchi then uncovers his arrangement in the aria "Si corre dal notaio" (Run to the legal official); having set up in the specialist's mind that Buoso is as yet alive, Schicchi will camouflage himself as Buoso and manage another will. All are charmed with the plan, and plead Schicchi with individual solicitations for Buoso's different belongings, the most cherished of which are "the donkey, the house and the factories at Signa". A memorial service ringer rings, and everybody fears that the updates on Buoso's passing has developed, yet for reasons unknown, the chime is tolling for the demise of a neighbor's Moorish hireling. The relatives consent to leave the mien of the donkey, the house and the factories to Schicchi, however each thusly offers him an influence. The ladies help him to change into Buoso's garments as they sing the melodious trio "Spogliati, bambolino" (Undress, young man). Prior to having his spot in the bed, Schicchi cautions the organization of the grave discipline for those found to have distorted a will: banish from Florence together with the passing of a hand.
