Despite being blanked by their major league affiliate, the Sounds experienced their most successful season in the American Association in 1990, when they compiled an 86â61 record under manager Pete Mackanin. Ending the regular season in a tie for first place with the Buffalo Bisons, each with an 85â61 record, the Sounds won the Eastern Division championship in a one-game playoff on September 4. The extra-inning affair was ended by Chris Jones' two-run homer in the top of the eighteenth inning. The Sounds advanced to their first American Association championship series, where they lost the best-of-five series to the Omaha Royals, three games to two. In a decisive game five, Omaha got out to an 5â0 lead in the first inning, but Nashville mounted a comeback which included a sixth-inning grand slam by second baseman Keith Lockhart that tied the game. Both teams scored again, but the Royals came out on top, 8â7. Left-hander Chris Hammond, who led the circuit with 15Â wins, 149Â strikeouts, and a 2.17Â ERA, won the league's Most Valuable Pitcher Award for 1990. Nashville set their all-time attendance record that year when a total of 605,122Â fans came out to Greer Stadium. Skeeter Barnes, who had previously played with Nashville in 1979, set the franchise career records for games played (514), at bats (1,848), and hits (517) during his second stint from 1988 to 1990.
