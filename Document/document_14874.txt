With "Star Trek"s beginning as a top priority, the focal story turned into Cochrane's twist drive test and humankind's first contact. Drawing on signs from past "Star Trek" scenes, Cochrane was set in mid-21st century Montana, where people recuperate from an overwhelming world war. In the primary content with this setting, the Borg assault Cochrane's lab, leaving the researcher out cold; Picard accept Cochrane's place to proceed with the twist test and reestablish history. In this draft Picard has an affection enthusiasm for the neighborhood picture taker Ruby, while Riker drives the battle against the Borg on the "Undertaking". Another draft included John de Lancie's all-powerful character Q. Taking a gander at the early contents, the trio realized that genuine work was required. "It simply didn't bode well [...] that Picard, the one person who has a history with the Borg, never meets them," Braga reviewed. Riker and Picard's jobs were swapped, and the planetside story was abbreviated and told in an unexpected way. Braga and Moore concentrated the new curve on Cochrane himself, making the perfect fate of "Star Trek" originate from a defective man. The possibility of Borg battling among period ensembles mixed into a "Dixon Hill" holographic novel succession on the holodeck. The second draft, titled "Star Trek: Resurrection", was made a decision about total enough that the generation group utilized it to design costs. The film was given a financial plan of $45ÃÂ million, "extensively more" than "Ages" $35ÃÂ million sticker price; this enabled the creation to design a bigger measure of activity and enhancements.
