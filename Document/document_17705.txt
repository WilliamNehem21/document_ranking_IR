LÅÊ»ihi Seamount's first depiction on a map was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric rendering of part of HawaiÊ»i compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and KÄ«lauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the HawaiÊ»i hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented eastâwest (the direction of the volcanic fault) and there was no volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.
Geologists suspected the seamount could be an active undersea volcano, but without evidence the idea remained speculative. The volcano was largely ignored after the 1952 event, and was often mislabeled as an "older volcanic feature" in subsequent charts. Geologist Kenneth O. Emery is credited with naming the seamount in 1955, describing the long and narrow shape of the volcano as "Loihi". The Hawaiian word lÅÊ»ihi means "long". In 1978, an expedition studied intense, repeated seismic activity known as earthquake swarms in and around the LÅÊ»ihi area. Rather than finding an old, extinct seamount, data collected revealed LÅÊ»ihi to be a young, possibly active volcano. Observations showed the volcano to be encrusted with young and old lava flows. Fluids erupting from active hydrothermal vents were also found.
