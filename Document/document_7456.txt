Reeves and Baker finished a third and last draft that was "generously conditioned down" in substance from the past endeavors. This form of the screenplay, which was recorded with just a couple of minor corrections amid the generation, was missing a significant number of the more express snapshots of savagery portrayed in the first submitted drafts: the passing fits of the pre-credits hanging injured individual, Lowes getting cut multiple times with a steel spike, and a sharpshooter's unfortunate casualty somersaulting through the air and pummeling into a tree. A grouping delineating the Battle of Naseby was to be taped, amid which an officer's head was to be cut off on screen. Most essentially, the film's finale was totally modified. In the first consummation, Stearne falls in with a gathering of rovers and endeavors to assault one of their ladies, who effectively wards off her aggressor by diving her thumbs at him, blinding him. The vagabonds at that point stake him to death. Marshall arrives and persuades the wanderers to help him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is violently beaten by Marshall, who powers an "admission" out of the bloodied man. Marshall mostly suffocates Hopkins (whose thumbs have been attached to his feet), at that point at last hangs him. Tenser had recently communicated concerns with respect to the extent of the Battle of Naseby arrangement just as the rover finishing, taking note of that these would both require the work of extra gatherings of additional items. He requested that Reeves and Baker expel the fight grouping and disentangle the closure for the last draft.
