The investigator, Eugene Duchesne QC, started his case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh affirmed that three hours after the shootings his nephew had revealed to him that he "more likely than not done it". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him following his discharge from jail, he had dependably been incredibly neighborly and accommodating to his family. Be that as it may, amid the morning of 26 June Lamb had out of the blue been reluctant, not giving full responses to questions and for the most part acting in a less open way. Duchesne then called observers of the shootings, who concurred collectively that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and gathered. At the point when interviewed by Nosanchuk about this bizarre serenity, they said that Lamb had seemed far off and did not appear to have any bearing on what was going on around him: one of the observers said that Lamb had not seemed to try and notice an exceptionally noisy gathering in advancement over the road. Heaton said that the kid had looked alarmed and had fled without reason when she called to her better half. The cops who captured Lamb likewise concurred that the litigant had been curiously cool and quiet. Hesketh told the court that when he had gotten back home his nephew had been sleeping soundly in bed.
