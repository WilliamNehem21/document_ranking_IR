Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine says that the room is regularly bolted, however Rebecca reproaches her. Stuart rejoins the gathering in the wake of utilizing the can. As the gathering talk, Mark and his significant other, Liz, enter the room, ignorant of the general population stowing away in the closet. The pair talk authentically before starting foreplay and resting on the bed. Geraldine yells to alarm them, and those in the closet imagine they didn't hear Mark and Liz's discussion. Imprint and Liz reluctantly enter the closet. As the entryways close, Rachel's sweetheart Lee goes into the room, however as the closet has turned out to be increasingly confined, Stuart and Lee stow away under the bed and Ian moves to the "en suite" restroom. Stuart and Carl contend, and it is uncovered that Carl has a dread of closeness. Whenever "Stinky" John goes into the room, both those in the closet and under the bed guarantee there is no room, so he takes cover behind a drape. Jeremy goes into the room and reveals to Rebecca he is going to get another visitor from the train station, however as he swings to leave he erroneously calls her "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's dad, enters and ends up irritated when he sees individuals stowing away in better places. He powers Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the closet with every other person and tails them in.
