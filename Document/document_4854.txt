At an opportune time 23ÃÂ April, A Squadron was positioned at Qatia (or Katia), some south-east of Romani. At 09:15 it went under assault by a Turkish power of somewhere in the range of 1,000 and 1,500 infantry, bolstered by mounted force and a battery of mountain weapons, which had just overpowered two squadrons of the Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars and a gathering of Royal Engineers further east at Oghratina. The squadron was fortified by a squadron of Worcesters, and the regiment's own B and D Squadrons moved out of Romani in help. The safeguards at Qatia held out until mid-evening before being overpowered, and B and D Squadrons, which had been vigorously occupied with the endeavor to reach Qatia, resigned back to Romani. The Battle of Katia cost the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars 98 losses, the vast majority of them being taken prisoner, and just nine men of A Squadron dodged demise or bondage. The squadron was censured for progressing excessively far, and an Australian officer who visited Qatia named the yeomen "hicks driven by favored toffs". When he disclosed the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars war commemoration in 1922, Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Chetwode countered the "wrong analysis", saying that "there was not something to be embarrassed about, however everything to do right by them of their regiment".
