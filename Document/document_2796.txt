Starting on 1 June, the main track to be recorded was "Us and Them", pursued six days after the fact by "Cash". Waters had made impacts circles from chronicles of different cash related items, including coins tossed into a sustenance blending bowl taken from his better half's stoneware studio, and these were later re-recorded to exploit the band's choice to record a quadraphonic blend of the collection (Parsons has since communicated disappointment with the consequence of this blend, ascribed to an absence of time and the lack of accessible multi-track recording devices). "Time" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" were the following pieces to be recorded, trailed by a two-month break, amid which the band invested energy with their families and arranged for an up and coming voyage through the US. The account sessions endured customary intrusions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would regularly break to see his group contend, and the band would periodically stop work to watch "Monty Python's Flying Circus" on the TV, leaving Parsons to chip away at material recorded up to that point. Gilmour has, in any case, debated this case; in a meeting in 2003 he stated: "We would now and then watch them yet when we were having some fantastic luck, we would jump on."
