Synge's first account of life in the Aran Islands was published in the "New Ireland Review" in 1898 and his book, "", based largely on journals, was completed in 1901 and published in 1907 with illustrations by Jack Butler Yeats. Synge considered the book "my first serious piece of work". When Lady Gregory read the manuscript she advised Synge to remove any direct naming of places and to add more folk stories, but he refused to do either because he wanted to create something more realistic. The book expresses Synge's belief that beneath the Catholicism of the islanders it was possible to detect a substratum of the pagan beliefs of their ancestors. His experiences in the Aran Islands were to form the basis for the plays about Irish rural life that Synge went on to write.
In 1903 Synge left Paris and moved to London. He had written two one-act plays, "Riders to the Sea" and "The Shadow of the Glen", the previous year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and "The Shadow of the Glen" was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. "Riders to the Sea" was performed at the same venue in February the following year. "The Shadow of the Glen", under the title "In the Shadow of the Glen", formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help set the stage for each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.
