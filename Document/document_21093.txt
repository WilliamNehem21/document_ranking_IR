On 26 March, the five carriers of the First Air Fleet departed from Staring Bay; they were spotted by a Catalina about southeast of Ceylon on the morning of 4 April. Six of "HiryÅ«"s Zeros were on Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and helped to shoot it down. Nagumo closed to within of Colombo before launching an airstrike the next morning. "HiryÅ«" contributed 18 B5Ns and 9 Zeros to the force; the latter encountered a flight of 6 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from 788 Naval Air Squadron en route and shot them all down without loss. The Japanese aircraft encountered defending Hawker Hurricane fighters from Nos. 30 and 258 Squadrons RAF over Ratmalana airfield and "HiryÅ«"s fighters claimed to have shot down 11 with 3 Zeros damaged, although the fighters from the other carriers also made claims. British losses were 21 Hurricanes shot down and 2 more forced to crash land. The D3As and B5Ns inflicted some damage to the port facilities, but a day's warning had allowed much of the shipping in the harbor to be evacuated. The British were attempting to find Nagumo's ships all morning and "HiryÅ«"s Zeros on CAP over the fleet helped to shoot down an RAF Catalina, shot down a Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber and drove off another from the carrier . Later that morning the British heavy cruisers and were spotted and "HiryÅ«" launched 18 D3As. They sank both ships in combination with the dive bombers from the other carriers.
