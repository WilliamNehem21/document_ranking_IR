There are no records of offers figures of ukiyo-e from the period in which the print was made. Deciding the prominence of a print requires circuitous methods, one of which is to analyze the distinctions in enduring duplicates. For instance, the more duplicates printed, the more the woodblocks wore out, bringing about loss of line lucidity and subtleties. Another model is that distributers regularly made changes to the squares in later print runs. Analysts use hints, for example, these to decide if prints were much of the time reproducedÃ¢ÂÂan indication of their prominence. The first printing of "Three Beauties of the Present Day" had the title in a bookmark-shape in the upper right corner with the names of the three delights to one side. Just two duplicates of this state are accepted to have endure; they are in the accumulations of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Koishikawa Ukiyo-e Art Museum in Tokyo. Later printings come up short on the title, the names of the delights, or both, and the situation of the distributer's and edit's seals changes somewhat. The explanations behind the progressions are liable to hypothesis, for example, that the marvels may have moved away, or their acclaim may have fallen. In view of pieces of information, for example, these changes, analysts trust this print was a well known hit for Utamaro and Tsutaya.
