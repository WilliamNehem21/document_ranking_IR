The CIA activity was confused by an untimely upset on 29 March 1953, with a pointless attack against the military army at SalamÃÂ¡, in the focal Guatemalan division of Baja Verapaz. The insubordination was quickly squashed, and various members were captured. A few CIA operators and partners were detained, debilitating the upset exertion. In this manner the CIA came to depend all the more vigorously on the Guatemalan outcast gatherings and their enemy of fair partners in Guatemala. The CIA thought about a few contender to lead the upset. Miguel YdÃÂ­goras Fuentes, the moderate competitor who had lost the 1950 race to ÃÂrbenz, held support with the Guatemalan restriction yet was rejected for his job in the Ubico routine, just as his European appearance, which was probably not going to speak to the larger part blended race "mestizo" populace. Another well known competitor was the espresso grower Juan CÃÂ³rdova Cerna, who had quickly served in ArÃÂ©valo's bureau before turning into the lawful counsel to the UFC. The demise of his child in an enemy of government uprising in 1950 turned him against the administration, and he had arranged the fruitless SalamÃÂ¡ overthrow in 1953 preceding escaping to join Castillo Armas in a state of banishment. Despite the fact that his status as a non military personnel gave him favorable position over Castillo Armas, he was determined to have throat malignant growth in 1954, removing him from the retribution. In this way it was Castillo Armas, in a state of banishment since the fizzled 1949 overthrow and on the CIA's finance since the prematurely ended PBFORTUNE in 1951, who was to lead the coming upset.
