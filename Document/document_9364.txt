In 1953, amid the legislature of Manuel A. OdrÃÂ­a, Vargas Llosa took on Lima's National University of San Marcos, to think about law and writing. He wedded Julia Urquidi, his maternal uncle's sister-in-law, in 1955 at 19 years old; she was 10ÃÂ years more established. Vargas Llosa started his artistic profession decisively in 1957 with the production of his first short stories, "The Leaders" ("Los jefes") and "The Grandfather" ("El abuelo"), while working for two Peruvian papers. Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he got a grant to learn at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain. In 1960, after his grant in Madrid had lapsed, Vargas Llosa moved to France under the feeling that he would get a grant to consider there; in any case, after touching base in Paris, he discovered that his grant demand was denied. Notwithstanding Mario and Julia's unforeseen money related status, the couple chose to stay in Paris where he started to compose productively. Their marriage endured just a couple of more years, finishing off with separation in 1964. After a year, Vargas Llosa wedded his first cousin, Patricia Llosa, with whom he had three kids: ÃÂlvaro Vargas Llosa (brought into the world 1966), an author and editorial manager; Gonzalo (brought into the world 1967), a global government employee; and Morgana (brought into the world 1974), a picture taker. Starting at 2015, he is involved with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV character Isabel Preysler and looking for a separation from Patricia Llosa. He is a skeptic.
