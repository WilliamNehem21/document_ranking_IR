The "Oxford English Dictionary" characterizes "cunt" as "The female outside genital organs" and notes "Its money is limited in the way of other forbidden words: see the little sort note s.v. Screw v." During the Middle Ages the word may regularly have been considered simply indecent, sharing been for all intents and purpose use in its anatomical sense since at any rate the 13thÃÂ century. In "The Miller's Tale", Geoffrey Chaucer states "And prively he caughte enlist by the queynte" (and personally he got her by her groin), and "Philotus" (1603) makes reference to "put doun thy hand and graip hir cunt." Gradually however the word progressed toward becoming utilized more as the vulgarity it is commonly viewed as today. In John Garfield's "Wandring Whore II" (1660) the word is connected to a lady, explicitly a prostituteÃ¢ÂÂ"this is none of your pittiful Sneakesbyes and Raskalls that will offer a strong CÃ¢ÂÂhowever eighteen pence or two shillings, and apologize of the business a while later". Francis Grose's "A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue" (1785) records the word as "C**t. The "chonnos" of the Greek, and the "cunnus" of the Latin word references; an awful name for a frightful thing: "un con Miege"."
