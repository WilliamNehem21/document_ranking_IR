Nelson requested the armada to back off at 16:00 to enable his boats to fix "springs" on their stay links, an arrangement of joining the bow grapple that expanded soundness and enabled his boats to swing their broadsides to confront a foe while stationary. It additionally expanded mobility and in this manner decreased the danger of going under raking fire. Nelson's arrangement, formed through talk with his senior commanders amid the arrival voyage to Alexandria, was to progress on the French and go down the toward the ocean side of the van and focal point of the French line, so each French ship would confront two British boats and the monstrous "Situate" would battle against three. The course of the breeze implied that the French back division would be unfit to join the fight effectively and would be cut off from the front bits of the line. To guarantee that in the smoke and disarray of a night fight his boats would not inadvertently start shooting at each other, Nelson requested that each ship plan four level lights at the leader of their mizzen pole and derrick a lit up White Ensign, which was sufficiently distinctive from the French tricolor that it would not be mixed up in poor perceivability, decreasing the hazard that British boats may fire on each other in the murkiness. As his ship was prepared for the fight to come, Nelson held a last supper with "Vanguard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s officers, declaring as he ascended: "Before this time tomorrow I will have picked up a peerage or Westminster Abbey," in reference to the prizes of triumph or the customary entombment spot of British military saints.
