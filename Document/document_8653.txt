Regardless of Nelson Piquet winning the 1987 Drivers' Championship and Williams winning the Constructors' Championship, Honda chose not to supply the group with their motors, mostly because of Williams' refusal to dump Nigel Mansell and contract Japanese driver and Honda tester Satoru Nakajima (who appeared with Lotus in 1987), and rather provided the McLaren group for . Prost had persuaded Ron Dennis to sign Ayrton Senna to a three-year contract, which assumed a job in attracting Honda (Senna's capacity had been exceptionally respected by the Japanese monster when utilizing their motors with Lotus in 1987 and both were quick to proceed with their affiliation). In any case, this started the contention that pushed two of the game's most prominent drivers to uncommon statures of accomplishment and debate. McLaren-Honda ruled the season, winning 15 out of 16 races. Prost completed first or second in each race other than his two retirements at Silverstone and Monza. He won seven races and altogether outscored his new partner Ayrton Senna by 11 points, regardless of Senna winning one more race than Prost. Be that as it may, just the 11 best outcomes from the season tallied toward the title aggregate, and this gave Senna the title by three points. Prost proceeded to be an advocate of basically the 1990s scoring framework Ã¢ÂÂ all outcomes tallying to the last outcomes with the champ scoring 10, not 9.
