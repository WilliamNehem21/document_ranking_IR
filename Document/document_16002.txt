On May 18, 2011, "4"s release date in the United States was confirmed on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; BeyoncÃ©'s legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, BeyoncÃ© responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, "My music was leaked and while this is not how I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from BeyoncÃ© to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, "NME" reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of "4". The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.
