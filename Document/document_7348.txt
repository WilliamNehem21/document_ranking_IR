Lansbury was 76 years of age when he surrendered the Labor authority; he didn't, in any case, resign from open life. In the general decision of November 1935 he kept his seat at Bow and Bromley; Labor, presently driven by Attlee, improved its parliamentary portrayal to 154. Lansbury dedicated himself altogether to the reason for world harmony, a mission that took him, in 1936, to the United States. He tended to extensive groups in 27 urban areas before meeting President Roosevelt in Washington to exhibit his proposition for a world harmony gathering. In 1937 he visited Europe, visiting pioneers in Belgium, France and Scandinavia, and in April verified a private gathering with Hitler. No official report of the dialog was issued, yet Lansbury's own update demonstrates that Hitler communicated readiness to participate in a world gathering if Roosevelt would assemble it. Soon thereafter Lansbury met Mussolini in Rome; he depicted the Italian head as "a blend of Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin and Winston Churchill". Lansbury composed a few records of his tranquility ventures, outstandingly "My Quest for Peace" (1938). His mellow and hopeful impressions of the European despots were broadly scrutinized as innocent and distant; some British peaceful resistor were overwhelmed at Lansbury's gathering with Hitler, while the "Every day Worker" blamed him for occupying consideration from the forceful substances of extremist approaches. Lansbury kept on meeting European pioneers through 1938 and 1939, and was selected, ineffectively, for the 1940 Nobel Peace Prize.
