In May 1695 Antonio de Silva had appointed two groups of Franciscans to head for PetÃ©n; the first group was to join up with GarcÃ­a's military expedition. The second group was to head for Lake PetÃ©n Itza independently. This second group was headed by friar AndrÃ©s de AvendaÃ±o. AvendaÃ±o was accompanied by friar Antonio PÃ©rez de San RomÃ¡n, lay brother Alonso de Vargas and six Maya Christians recruited from MÃ©rida and towns en route to Campeche. This latter group left MÃ©rida on 2 June 1695 and made its way to Juan del Castillo y ArruÃ©'s supply base at Kawich, set up to support GarcÃ­a's military expedition. On 24 June AvendaÃ±o's party left Kawich and set off across sparsely inhabited territory. On 29 June they arrived at an abandoned Maya temple, which he referred to by the name Nojku, meaning "Big Temple". The Spanish had already passed through and had broken many "idols" but the friars climbed the temple and managed to find about 50 additional ceremonial sculptures, which they destroyed; they also placed a cross inside. The other group of friars, on their way to join GarcÃ­a, passed through Nojku a few days later and found that local Maya had already placed new offerings within. AvendaÃ±o's group continued southwards and found increasing signs of habitation and arrived at the military camp of captain JosÃ© FernÃ¡ndez de Estenos at the deserted Maya town of NojtÊ¼ubÊ¼, which had been cleared by the Spanish under GarcÃ­a some sixteen years previously.
