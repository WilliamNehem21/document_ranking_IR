In 2001, Andrew Billen looked at the contemporary social importance of the arrangement to "The Way We Live Now", as a follow-up to his examination of the main arrangement with "Vanity Fair": "In earlier years we have seen the anguish brought about by betrayal, weakness and fruitlessness. This season the characters face the dangers hurled by unnatural birth cycle, liquor addiction and a late-blooming profession. Continuing connections looks as hard as ever. However there is nothing every hero needs more than antiquated household joy." The audit reverberated with different faultfinders; in "The Scotsman", Linda Watson-Brown composed a general positive survey of the arrangement by and largeÃ¢ÂÂrejecting the spate of "hostile to "Cold Feet"" surveysÃ¢ÂÂyet censured "the simplicity with which issues are settled and profound quality used to slap the watcher in the face". The last scene set in Australia energized commentators; in a section concentrating on "Chewin' the Fat", "Scotsman" faultfinder Aidan Smith charged the huge spending scene "which some way or another figured out how to crush the Harbor Bridge into each shot" of being the point the arrangement hopped the shark, and "Times" journalist Caitlin Moran complimented it, however was worried that the arrangement's unique fundamental charactersÃ¢ÂÂAdam and RachelÃ¢ÂÂwere being sidelined by everybody including Mike Bullen.
