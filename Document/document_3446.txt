The quality and profile of the lines in the Eta Carinae range are very factor, however there are various steady unmistakable highlights. The range is commanded by emanation lines, normally wide in spite of the fact that the higher excitation lines are overlaid by a restricted focal segment from thick ionized nebulosity, particularly the Weigelt Blobs. Most lines demonstrate a P Cygni profile yet with the ingestion wing a lot more fragile than the discharge. The expansive P Cygni lines are commonplace of solid excellent breezes, with frail ingestion for this situation in light of the fact that the focal star is so vigorously clouded. Electron dissipating wings are available yet moderately frail, demonstrating a clumpy wind. Hydrogen lines are available and solid, demonstrating that Eta Carinae still holds quite a bit of its hydrogen envelope. He lines are a lot more fragile than the hydrogen lines, and the nonappearance of He lines gives a maximum cutoff to the conceivable temperature of the essential star. N lines can be recognized however are not solid, while carbon lines can't be identified and oxygen lines are, best case scenario exceptionally powerless, showing center hydrogen consuming by means of the CNO cycle with some blending to the surface. Maybe the most striking element is the rich Fe outflow in both allowed and prohibited lines, with the taboo lines emerging from excitation of low thickness nebulosity around the star.
