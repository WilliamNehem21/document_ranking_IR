E. W. Swanton sees that "from the war onwards [Chapman's] life went into a tragic shroud." In 1942, Chapman was separated from his better half; as indicated by Lemmon, "Beet had stood much, yet there is a point for all connections past which one must not go". She came back to live in New Zealand in 1946. After 1946, Chapman imparted a house to the steward of West Hill Golf Club, Bernard Benson, and his wellbeing kept on breaking down. He was often seen to be tanked out in the open, in spite of the fact that his appearance and habits stayed faultless; the cricket foundation disregarded him, seeing him as a shame, especially on the events he watched matches at Lord's. Before an incredible finish, he was unfit to go to any cricket matches. Notwithstanding his liquor abuse, Chapman turned out to be progressively segregated, experiencing dejection and sadness. By the 1950s, he had created joint inflammation, likely because of his brandishing exercises. On one event in 1955, Chapman was welcome to a supper sorted out by Kent; he was later found in the vehicle leave on the guard of a vehicle in an upset state and must be helped back inside.
