"Alceste" required a few fixes after a long voyage in harsh climate so Maxwell requested of the emissary of Canton for consent to head out up the Tigris to a safe harbor, uninformed that Amherst's central goal had been ineffective. The ruler's frame of mind towards the British emissary had been spur of the moment; he demonstrated little enthusiasm for Europe or its issues, and rejected a blessing from King George as he thought of it as inadequate. Having gotten an offending message in light of his solicitation, Maxwell chose to enter the waterway in any case yet was before long hailed by a nearby mandarin who took steps to have the batteries guarding the passageway sink "Alceste" in the event that she went any further. Still needing fixes and expecting route to Whampoa to gather Amherst, Maxwell told the mandarin that he would continue in any occasion. "Alceste" rapidly managed the shore safeguards and 17 war-throws out sent to stop her, and proceeded up the stream to Whampoa. There she moored and got crisp supplies while anticipating the entry of Amherst and his suite. The occurrence would later be freely portrayed as, ""A well disposed trade of salutes"". Having finished however much of his main goal as could be expected, Amherst boarded "Alceste" which left Whampoa on 21 January 1817.
