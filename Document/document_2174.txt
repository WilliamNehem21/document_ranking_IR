Be that as it may, Peter Ward, a columnist and previous Dunstan staff member distributed an anecdote about the documents. A request was led into the branch by Justice White of the Supreme Court of South Australia, and the report was put in Dunstan's grasp on 21 December 1977. It said that the dossiers did exist and that they were "shamefully wrong, immaterial to security purposes and preposterously out of line to hundreds, maybe thousands, of faithful and commendable natives". It additionally noticed that the reports overwhelmingly centered around left-wing government officials and activists, and that Dunstan had been misdirected by the police chief. Subsequent to surveying the report, Dunstan sacked Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury in January and took steps to discharge the report to people in general. Be that as it may, Salisbury had a notoriety for being a man of honesty, and debate ejected with respect to the request and Dunstan's activities, and whether he had definitely thought about the genuine substance of the documents for quite a long while, as asserted by Ward. A Royal Commission under Justice Mitchell, set up at the impelling of the Liberals, examined the issue. The request cleared the Dunstan Government of any mistake, as it had not thought about the Special Branch's exercises prior. Dunstan sacked Salisbury for misdirecting Parliament about the presence of the "pink records" and a large number of the Special Branch documents were scorched. Salisbury resigned to the United Kingdom with a $160,000 payout; a book, "The Salisbury Affair" by Stewart Cockburn, was expounded on the catastrophe.
