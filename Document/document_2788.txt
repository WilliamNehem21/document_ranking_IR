Louise Watson, composing for Screenonline, felt the film's outfit and make-up help "pass on the full Cinderella change of Austen's courageous woman. At first the underestimated family saint, Anne is the loner who has lost her 'sprout'. Her baggy ensembles allude to how she has pined away since denying Wentworth... As she recovers her certainty, she blooms; she dresses becomingly, her eyes shimmer and her highlights become vivified". Paulette Richards contends that the film's "temperamental" male characters, for example, Sir Walter, are recognized all things considered by the ostentatious idea of their dress. This colorfulness is particularly obvious to present day watchers, who live in a culture where "genuine men" are relied upon to think about their attire. On the other hand, the film's Wentworth is regularly delineated in maritime regalia, which is a difference to Bryan Marshall's variant of the character in the 1971 adjustment. This uniform helps set Wentworth separated from a considerable lot of the other male characters, enabling him to seem sentimental yet detached. Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a comparative perspective on the film, composing that it precisely catches Austen's parody by comparing the privileged societies' excess in design with the righteous characteristics of the Royal Navy. The maritime men's calling is accentuated by the recurrence of wearing their garbs, rather than different adjustments of the novel.
