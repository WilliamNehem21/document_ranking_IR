The revolt was driven by 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel VÃÂ°ÃÂ¡ng VÃÂn ÃÂÃÂ´ng, a northerner, who had battled with the French Union powers against the Viet Minh amid the First Indochina War. Later prepared at Fort Leavenworth in the United States, ÃÂÃÂ´ng was viewed by American military counselors as a splendid strategist and the most brilliant military prospect of his age and he served in the Airborne Division. Back in Vietnam, ÃÂÃÂ´ng ended up unhappy with DiÃ¡Â»Âm's discretionary guideline and consistent interfering in the interior issues of the military. DiÃ¡Â»Âm advanced officers on steadfastness instead of aptitude, and played senior officers against each other so as to debilitate the military initiative and keep them from testing his standard. A long time after the upset, ÃÂÃÂ´ng affirmed that his sole target was to drive DiÃ¡Â»Âm to improve the administration of the nation. ÃÂÃÂ´ng was secretly upheld by his brother by marriage Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, the chief of preparing at the Joint General Staff School, and Hong's uncle Hoang Co Thuy. Thuy was a well off Saigon-based legal advisor, and had been a political lobbyist since World War II. He was the secretary-general of a minority resistance called the Movement of Struggle for Freedom, which had a little nearness in the elastic stamp National Assembly.
