In "Pinafore", Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte utilized a few of the essential cast individuals whom they had collected for "The Sorcerer". As Gilbert had proposed to Sullivan in December 1877, "Mrs. Cripps [Little Buttercup] will be a capital part for EverardÃÂ ... Barrington will be a capital skipper, and Grossmith a top notch First Lord." However, Mrs Howard Paul, who had played Lady Sangazure in "The Sorcerer", was declining vocally. She was under contract to assume the job of Cousin Hebe in "Pinafore". Gilbert endeavored to compose a diverting part for her in spite of Sullivan's hesitance to utilize her, yet by mid-May 1878, both Gilbert and Sullivan needed her out of the cast; discontent with the job, she left. With just seven days to go before premiere night, Carte employed a show vocalist, Jessie Bond, to play Cousin Hebe. Since Bond had little understanding as an on-screen character, Gilbert and Sullivan cut the discourse out of the job, with the exception of a couple of lines in the last scene, which they transformed into recitative. Other new cast individuals were Emma Howson and George Power in the sentimental jobs, who were enhancements for the sentimental soprano and tenor in "The Sorcerer".
