The arrangement of an incorporated and completely working sewer framework for the capital, together with the related drop in cholera cases, drove the antiquarian John Doxat to express that Bazalgette "most likely accomplished all the more great, and spared more lives, than any single Victorian authority". Bazalgette kept on working at the MBW until 1889, amid which time he supplanted three of London's extensions: Putney in 1886, Hammersmith in 1887 and Battersea in 1890. He was selected leader of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in 1884, and in 1901 a landmark celebrating his life was opened on the Victoria Embankment. When he passed on in March 1891, his obituarist in "The Illustrated London News" composed that Bazalgette's "two incredible titles to notoriety are that he enhanced London and depleted it", while Sir John Coode, the leader of ICE at the time, said that Bazalgette's work "will ever stay as landmarks to his expertise and expert capacity". The obituarist for "The Times" opined that "when the New Zealander comes to London a thousand years henceÃÂ ... the sublime robustness and the perfect symmetry of the incredible rock squares which structure the mass of the Thames-bank will even now remain." He proceeded, "the extraordinary sewer that keeps running underneath LondonersÃÂ ... has added nearly 20 years to their shot of life". The student of history Peter Ackroyd, in his history of underground London, thinks about that "with [John] Nash and [Christopher] Wren, Bazalgette enters the pantheon of London legends" on account of his work, especially the structure of the Victoria and Albert Embankments.
