In later years, Davis protected Warner against bits of gossip about sexual inappropriateness when she stated: "No obscene manager was he! His wrongdoings lay somewhere else. He was the dad. The power. The wonder. What's more, he was ready to go to profit." Davis uncovered that, after the introduction of her youngster, Warner's mentality toward her turned out to be warm and defensive. "We progressed toward becoming dad and tyke, no inquiry concerning it." she said. "He revealed to me I didn't need to return to work until I truly felt like it. He was a mindful man. Relatively few pleasant things were said about him." Warner likewise earned the appreciation and fondness of Errol Flynn.
