In spite of his endeavors to change the area's arrangements, Howe was made a colonel of gunnery by Governor Tryon and served under the Governor against furnished dissidents in the piedmont amid the War of the Regulation. Howe was among the Governor's escort when he went up against the Regulators in Hillsborough in 1768, and in 1771, at the Battle of Alamance, Howe served in a double job as an officer of mounted guns and officer general. In mid 1773, when Josiah Quincy II visited North Carolina to cultivate participation between Southern activists and those in Boston, he explored the reasons for the War of the Regulation to which he had been thoughtful. Howe filled in as Quincy's guide and with the help of Cornelius Harnett and William Hooper persuaded Quincy that the Regulator development had been unjustified and wrong to wage war against Tryon. Quincy observed Howe to be a "most cheerful compound of the man of sense, the sword, the Senate, and the buckÃÂ ...ÃÂ a most loved of the man of sense and the female world", proceeding to state that "[Howe] has issues and bad habit Ã¢ÂÂ yet tsk-tsk who is without them." More imperatively, nonetheless, Quincy's visit with Howe, Hooper, and Harnett caused a longing among those present to open up between provincial lines of correspondence so as to facilitate reactions to future burdens by the British government.
