Area 5 necessitates that secured purviews get government endorsement, known as "preclearance", before executing changes to their race laws. A secured ward has the weight of demonstrating that the change does not have the reason or impact of separating based on race or language minority status; if the locale neglects to meet this weight, the government will deny preclearance and the purview's change won't go live. The Supreme Court extensively deciphered Section 5's degree in "Allen v. State Board of Election" (1969), holding that any adjustment in a ward's casting a ballot rehearses, regardless of whether minor, must be submitted for preclearance. The Court likewise held that if a ward neglects to have its casting a ballot change precleared, private offended parties may sue the purview in the offended party's neighborhood area court under the watchful eye of a three-judge board. In these Section 5 "requirement activities", a court thinks about whether the ward made a secured casting a ballot change, and provided that this is true, regardless of whether the change has been precleared. In the event that the purview inappropriately neglected to get preclearance, at that point the court will arrange the ward to get preclearance before actualizing the change. Be that as it may, the court may not consider the benefits of whether the change ought to be affirmed.
