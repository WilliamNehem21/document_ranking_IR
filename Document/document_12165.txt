By the mid 1980s, couple of government workers stayed at Somerset House and the legislature was renting portions of the structure for different employments. At the point when the issue was brought up in the House of Lords, Lord Houghton of SowerbyÃ¢ÂÂa previous individual from the regimentÃ¢ÂÂenquired with regards to the administration's arrangements for the war remembrance. Ruler Skelmersdale answered for the benefit of the administration: "This regiment had a recognized record of administration amid the Great War and it is altogether fitting that the dedication ought to be arranged in the yard of the main reason fabricated government place of business. I can guarantee the house there has been no idea of moving it, nor will there be". In any case, the commemoration was moved in the late 1990s, when the patio was redeveloped to give an open show space. It experienced rebuilding work, including repainting of the banners, before being reinstalled before the Navy Treasurer's entryway on the Embankment side of Somerset House, on a patio alongside the River Thames. The Royal Green Jackets (the successor regiment coming about because of further amalgamations following the Second World War and consequent rebuilding of the military) sorted out a rededication function, which was hung on 25 July 2002 and managed by Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London. The executive of the leading body of the Inland Revenue, which was based at Somerset House and whose authorities were among the establishing individuals from the Civil Service Rifles, laid a wreath. Among those present were relatives of previous individuals, and Walter Humphrys, the last known enduring veteran of the regiment from the First World War.
