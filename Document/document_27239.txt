A detailed computer analysis of the biomechanics of "Stegosaurus"'s feeding behavior was performed in 2010, using two different three-dimensional models of "Stegosaurus" teeth given realistic physics and properties. Bite force was also calculated using these models and the known skull proportions of the animal, as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness. The resultant bite forces calculated for "Stegosaurus" were 140.1 newtons (N), 183.7Â N, and 275Â N (for anterior, middle and posterior teeth, respectively), which means its bite force was less than half that of a Labrador retriever. "Stegosaurus" could have easily bitten through smaller green branches, but would have had difficulty with anything over 12Â mm in diameter. "Stegosaurus", therefore, probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage, and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless the animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study. However, a study published on May 20, 2016 by Stephen Lautenschlager et al. indicates "Stegosaurus" bite strength was stronger than previously believed. Comparisons were made between it (represented by a specimen known as "Sophie" from the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum) and two other herbivorous dinosaurs; "Erlikosaurus" and "Plateosaurus" to determine if all three had similar bite forces and similar niches. Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that "Stegosaurus" had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals, in particular, cattle and sheep. Based on this data, it is likely "Stegosaurus" also ate woodier, tougher plants such as cycads, perhaps even acting as a means of spreading cycad seeds. The findings were published in the journal "Scientific Reports".
