Ãthelred's health probably declined at some stage in the decade after Alfred died in 899, and ÃthelflÃ¦d may have become the de facto ruler of Mercia by 902. According to the "Three Fragments", the Norse (Norwegian) Vikings were expelled from Dublin and then made an abortive attack on Wales. When this failed they applied to ÃthelflÃ¦d, her husband being ill, for permission to settle near Chester. ÃthelflÃ¦d agreed and for some time they were peaceful. The Norse Vikings then joined with the Danes in an attack on Chester, but this failed because ÃthelflÃ¦d had fortified the town, and she and her husband persuaded the Irish among the attackers to change sides. Other sources confirm that the Norse were driven out of Dublin in 902 and that ÃthelflÃ¦d fortified Chester in 907. ÃthelflÃ¦d re-founded Chester as a burh and she is believed to have enhanced its Roman defences by running walls from the north-west and south-east corners of the fort to the River Dee. Simon Ward, who excavated an Anglo-Saxon site in Chester, sees the later prosperity of the town as owing much to the planning of ÃthelflÃ¦d and Edward. After ÃthelflÃ¦d's death, Edward encountered fierce resistance to his efforts to consolidate his control of the north-west and he died there in 924, shortly after suppressing a local rebellion.
