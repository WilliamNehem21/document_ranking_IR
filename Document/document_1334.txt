Following early September debuts at the Renaissance Theater in Mansfield, and the Toronto International Film Festival, "The Shawshank Redemption" started a restricted North American discharge on September 23, 1994. Amid its opening end of the week, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theatersÃ¢ÂÂa normal of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood convention of visiting distinctive auditoriums on premiere night to see the crowds see their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, yet found nobody there. Glotzer asserted that the pair really sold two tickets outside the performance center with the guarantee that if the purchasers disliked the film, they could approach Castle Rock for a discount. While commentators lauded the film, Glotzer trusted that a dreary survey from the "Los Angeles Times" pushed swarms away. It got a wide discharge on October 14, 1994, extending to a sum of 944 venues to win $2.4 millionÃ¢ÂÂa normal of $2,545 per theaterÃ¢ÂÂcompleting as the number nine film of the end of the week, behind sex-parody "Exit to Eden" ($3 million), and only in front of the recorded dramatization "Test Show" ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the films. "The Shawshank Redemption" shut in late November 1994, following 10 weeks with a rough absolute gross of $16 million. It was viewed as a film industry bomb, neglecting to recover its $25 million spending plan, excluding advertising costs and the film exhibitors' cuts.
