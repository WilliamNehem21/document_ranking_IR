At the tallness of the Vijayanagara Empire (1350Ã¢ÂÂ 1565), the Mysore and Coorg locale was administered by diverse chieftains, or rajas ("little rulers"). Every raja had domain over a little zone, and each provided warriors and yearly tribute for the realm's needs. Not long after the domain's fall and the consequent eastbound move of the decreased controlling family, numerous chieftains, particularly in the west, attempted to release their magnificent bonds and grow their domains. Detecting opportunity in the midst of the new vulnerability, different forces from the north attacked the district irregularly. Among these were the Sultanate of Bijapur toward the northwest, the Sultanate of Golconda toward the upper east, the juvenile Maratha realm, more remote northwest, and the Mughal domain, more remote north still. For a great part of the seventeenth century the tussles between the little lords and the huge forces, and among the little rulers, brought about moving sways, loyalties, and fringes. By the turn of the eighteenth century, the political scene had turned out to be better characterized. The northwestern slopes were being ruled by the Nayaka leaders of Ikkeri, the southwestern, in the Western Ghats, by the Rajas of Coorg, the southern fields by the Wodeyar leaders of Mysore, which were all Hindu administrations; while the eastern and northeastern areas were being ruled by the Muslim Nawabs of Arcot and Sira. Of these, Ikkeri and Coorg were free, Mysore, albeit much extended, was formally a Mughal reliance, and Arcot and Sira, Mughal "subahs" (or areas).
