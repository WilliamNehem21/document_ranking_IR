There was a British republish release from Pembertons somewhere in the range of 1949 and 1954. These were intensely cut, with here and there just a couple of stories and generally just 64 pages, however the October and December 1952 issues both had 80 pages. It was distributed sporadically; at first more than once per year, and afterward pretty much every other month starting in mid-1952. The issues were numbered from 1 to 18. Three diverse Canadian reproduce versions likewise showed up for a sum of 21 or 22 issues (sources contrast on the right number). Six quarterly issues showed up from Summer 1945 through Fall 1946 from Publication Enterprises, Ltd.; at that point another three every other month issues showed up, from May to September 1948, from Pines Publications. At last 12 all the more every other month issues showed up from March 1949 to January 1951, from Better Publications of Canada. Every one of these issues were practically indistinguishable to the American forms, despite the fact that they are a large portion of an inch taller. A Mexican magazine, "Mysteries", kept running for 16 issues from August 1955 to May 1958; it included numerous reprints, essentially from "Surprising" and from "Awesome Story Magazine".
