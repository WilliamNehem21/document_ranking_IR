Following the success of "Room", Larson played a leading role in "Free Fire" (2016), an action-comedy about a shootout in a warehouse. She agreed to the project to bring attention to gun violence. Eric Kohn of IndieWire remarked on how different Larson's role was from that of "Room" and added that her "businesslike demeanor once again proves her ability to command a scene with a single glare". Commercially, the film failed to recoup its $7 million investment. She had filmed a part in Todd Solondz's comedy "Wiener-Dog", but it was cut out when Solondz found her character inessential to the story. The following year, Larson starred in the second installment of the MonsterVerse franchise, entitled "", co-starring Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Hiddleston. Filmed in Vietnam, the film featured her as a photojournalist in the 1970s. It marked her first big-budget project, and though she was glad to play a role not defined by her looks, she bemoaned the lack of female co-stars. Ann Hornaday of "The Washington Post" praised the film's visual effects and thought that "Larson manages to hold her own with very little to do". "Kong: Skull Island" was a commercial success, earning over $566 million worldwide.
