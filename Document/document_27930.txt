McVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled twoÂ holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while twoÂ holes were also drilled in the body of the truck. OneÂ green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the of Tovex Blastrite Gel "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13Â filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the twoÂ men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh traveled with the truck to Junction City.
