Different characters came back from the primary year. Performer Jim Beaver showed up as seeker Bobby Singer, an old family companion of the Winchesters. Beaver had expected his first-season visitor appearance in "Villain's Trap" to be a "one-shot arrangement", and was astounded when he was approached to return. Adrianne Palicki repeated her job as Sam's perished sweetheart Jessica in the other reality scene "What Is and What Should Never Be", as did Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. Smith likewise showed up in a flashback in the penultimate scene, "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One". Furthermore, however at first hesitant on account of his job on "Dim's Anatomy", Jeffrey Dean Morgan returned as John Winchester in the season debut and finale. In any case, the character bites the dust in the debut in light of the fact that the authors stressed that having him isolated from his children once moreÃ¢ÂÂSam and Dean spend a great part of the principal season following him downÃ¢ÂÂwould "split the show" by having him away "accomplishing more fascinating things than the young men are doing". As an evil presence, the scoundrel Azazel intermittently switches has, and was first completely depicted by Morgan in the main season finale. The reins go to Fredric Lehne for the second-season debut, and the show's makers making the most of his execution so much they brought him back for the two-section finale.
