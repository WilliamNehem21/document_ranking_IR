On 8 April 1940 eight aircraft of 1./ZGÂ 76, under the command of "StaffelkapitÃ¤n" Werner Hansen, deployed northward from Jever to Westerland on Sylt in preparation for operation "WeserÃ¼bung", the invasion of Norway. The German plan for the attack called for an amphibious assault on the Norwegian capital, Oslo, and six major ports from Kristiansand in the south to Narvik in the north. Simultaneously, Junkers 52 (JuÂ 52) transport aircraft would drop parachute troops to secure Oslo's Fornebu airport. Additional JuÂ 52s were scheduled to arrive at Fornebu twenty minutes after the parachute drop, by which time the airfield had to be in German hands. 1./ZGÂ 76 was to provide air cover and ground-attack support for both waves. Eight BfÂ 110 "ZerstÃ¶rer" of 1./ZGÂ 76 took off at 7:00 in the morning, planning to synchronize their arrival at Fornebu with the parachute drop at 8:45. The distance from Westerland to Fornebu meant that this was a one-way operation; the BfÂ 110s could not hold enough fuel for the return trip. Their fuel was calculated to provide them 20 minutes flying time over Fornebu, and the pilots would have to land at Fornebu once the airfield had been seized.
On the early morning flight to Fornebu, Lent engaged and shot down a Norwegian Gloster Gladiator. While the JuÂ 52s transporting the German paratroops came under heavy fire, Lent's "Rotte" engaged the enemy ground positions. Lent's starboard engine caught fire, forcing him to land immediately. With Kubisch manning the movable machine gun, Lent negotiated the capitulation with the Norwegian ground forces and the airfield was in German hands.
