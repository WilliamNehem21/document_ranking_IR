The Aurigids had a fantastic upheaval in 1994, when many brushing meteorsÃ¢ÂÂthose that have a shallow point of section and appear to ascend from the skylineÃ¢ÂÂwere seen in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved gradually, and left trails at any rate 45ÃÂ° long. Since they had such a shallow point of passage, somewhere in the range of 1994 Aurigids kept going as long as 2 seconds. In spite of the fact that there were just a couple of visual onlookers for part of the upheaval, the 1994 Aurigids top, which kept going under two hours, was later affirmed by Finnish novice radio stargazer Ilkka YrjÃÂ¶lÃÂ¤. The association with Comet Kiess was at long last affirmed in 1994. The 2007 upheaval of the Aurigids was anticipated by Peter Jenniskens and was seen by space experts around the world. In spite of certain forecasts that there would be no Alpha Aurigid upheaval, numerous brilliant meteors were watched all through the shower, which crested on September 1 as anticipated. Much like in the 1994 upheaval, the 2007 Aurigids were exceptionally splendid and regularly hued blue and green. The most extreme zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors for each hour, saw at 4:15ÃÂ am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a group of space experts flying on NASA planes.
