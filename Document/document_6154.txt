The MS&LR changed its name to the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1897 and the Great Central Main Line from London Marylebone to Manchester Central opened for traveler traffic on 15 March 1899. Dealings about the line between the GCR and the Met took quite a long while and in 1906 it was concurred that two tracks from Canfield Place to Harrow would be rented to the GCR for ÃÂ£20,000 every year and the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway was made, renting the line from Harrow to Verney Junction and the Brill branch for ÃÂ£44,000 per year, the GCR ensuring to put at any rate ÃÂ£45,000 of traffic on hold. Aylesbury station, which had been mutually kept running by the GWR and the Met, was set with a joint board of trustees of the Great Western and Great Central and Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Committees, and by and large known as Aylesbury Joint Station. The Met and GC Joint Committee assumed control over the task of the stations and line, however had no moving stock. The Met gave the administration and the GCR the records for the initial five years before the organizations exchanged capacities, at that point substituting like clockwork until 1926. The Met kept up the line south of milepost 28.5 (south of Great Missenden), the GCR toward the north.
