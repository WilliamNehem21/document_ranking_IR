A large portion of "Abundance's" team were picked by Bligh or were prescribed to him by persuasive benefactors. William Peckover the heavy armament specialist and Joseph Coleman the armorer had been with Cook and Bligh on HMS "Goals"; a few others had cruised under Bligh all the more as of late on the "Britannia". Among these was the 23-year-old Fletcher Christian, who originated from a rich Cumberland family slid from Manx nobility. Christian had picked a real existence adrift as opposed to the legitimate profession conceived by his family. He had twice voyaged with Bligh toward the West Indies, and the two had shaped an ace understudy relationship through which Christian had turned into a gifted guide. Christian was happy to serve on "Abundance" without pay as one of the "youthful men of honor"; Bligh gave him one of the salaried ace's mate's billets. One more of the youthful respectable men prescribed to Bligh was 15-year-old Peter Heywood, likewise from a Manx family and a far off connection of Christian's. Heywood had left school at 14 to go through a year on , a harbor-bound preparing vessel at Plymouth. His proposal to Bligh originated from Richard Betham, a Heywood family companion who was Bligh's dad in-law.
