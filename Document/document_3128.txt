In spite of the fact that "Crash 2048" and "Crash HD" have a mutual shader program and did not require retooling for the Vita's design, Roberts said that a "lot" of time and consideration was spent tweaking the diversion's shader impacts for the Vita's GPU. Lovegrove suspected that the technique for taking a shot at a PlayStation 3 and its handheld partner was indistinguishable (an assumption for the most part shared by the group), and Roberts said that the frameworks' similitudes helped the group "get going rapidly". Roberts included that the diversion's lighting framework was indistinguishable to that of "Crash HD"; the two amusements' boats shared picture based lighting, with mixed diffuse and specular features impacts and the vertex-based lighting framework utilized for weaponry. As indicated by Roberts, the primary distinction between the diversions was PlayStation Vita's use of the impacts through the GPU; PlayStation 3 depended on SPUs. The group chose to utilize hostile to associated shading supports for constant shadow rendering, rather than profundity cradles. This gave the diversion more noteworthy straightforwardness impacts, since the memory cost of against associating was 8 bits for each pixel; along these lines, 4x MSAA (multisample hostile to associating) cradles contained a similar measure of memory as a 32-bit profundity support. Another element which Roberts considered an improvement was tone mapping (mostly because of Vita's prevalent help of support groups), which gave "Crash 2048" better introduction control and sprout impacts.
