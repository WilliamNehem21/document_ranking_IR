The melody was named for Best Metal Performance at the 49th yearly Grammy Awards. At the point when requested his considerations on the assignment, King uncovered that he didn't "give it a second thought", and noticed that Slayer fans "don't care at all and that is the most vital thing to me". The questioner communicated his shock at the designation given Slayer's "provocative" verses, to which King answered, "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the poop we expound on." The service was hung on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer going up against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy grant, despite the fact that the band was unfit to go to in light of a clashing North American featuring visit. Araya remarked about the success from a lodging in Columbus, Ohio: "Jeff [Hanneman] and I put a great deal into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're excited that the Grammy voters set aside the effort to hear it out, and afterward vote in favor of it. We're over here out and about and we're all ridiculously glad." King dissented, considering the melody "one of the least fortunate portrayals of us [Slayer] on the record ["Christ Illusion"]". He further said that, whenever given the choice, he would have picked the disputable track "Jihad" to speak to Slayer from their ninth collection "Christ Illusion". Disparaging of the Recording Academy, King stated, "Reasonably, I think individuals on the institute who vote pick the easily recognized name ... Also, that is the thing that we are."
