On the ninth birthday celebration of the seriously sick Tamsin, guardians Graham and Jan battle with a camcorder and explode inflatables. A philanthropy called WishmakerUK has masterminded pop star Frankie J Parsons to visit Tamsin. Frankie arrives, a lot to the energy of Jan, joined by his own associate Si and WishmakerUK delegate Sally. Frankie visits Tamsin in her room, and explodes a purple inflatable for her. He starts to battle for breath and after that falls from an intracranial aneurysm. Afterward, Graham makes tea for Jan and Sally. Jan is disturbed about Frankie's demise. Si says that nobody can contact anything or call a rescue vehicle until Frankie's director arrives. Tamsin, sitting in her wheelchair, holds the inflatable; and Graham and Si understand that it might be profitable. Si takes the inflatable from Tamsin, and Graham ties it. Sally accepts a call from her supervisor, yet does not specify Frankie's passing. She rationalizes to have an associate spread for her on her next task with the goal that she can remain at the house. Graham and Si contend over the inflatable, and Graham offers it to Sally, as he thinks of her as "an impartial". He watches online to work out how much the inflatable and going with film might be value.
