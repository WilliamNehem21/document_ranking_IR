Foliot was well known as a letter writer, and his letters were later collected as a book. The main manuscript for this collection, now held at the Bodleian Library, is supposed to have originated in Foliot's own writing office. About 250 to 300Â examples of Foliot's letters have survived, which together with his surviving charters gives a total of almost 500Â items. The collection was printed in a modern edition edited by Adrian Morey and Christopher N. L. Brooke and published by the Cambridge University Press in 1967, under the title of "The Letters and Charters of Gilbert Foliot". Some of the letters have appeared in volumes five through eight of "Materials for the History of Thomas Becket", from the Rolls Series, published from 1875â1885. Older editions appeared in the "Patres ecclesiae Anglicanae" series from the 1840s, and in Migne's "Patrologica" from 1854. The letters cover most of the period of Foliot's public life, and are one of the main sources for the history of that period. The historian David Knowles said of the collection that "owing to its wealth of personal and local detail [it] is of the greatest value for the church historian". According to Knowles, Foliot's letters paint a picture of an active bishop and ecclesiastical leader who supported the Gregorian church reforms but did not meddle in politics beyond those of the church. His letters are typical of the educated letter writer of his time, refined and polished to an art form.
