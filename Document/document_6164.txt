From that point, Wheeler was welcome to coordinate a Society of Antiquaries unearthing at the Roman settlement of Verulamium, which existed ashore as of late gained by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this job for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, preceding leaving a fifth period of exhuming under the control of the classicist Kathleen Kenyon and the planner A. W. G. Lowther. Wheeler appreciated the chance to uncover at a regular citizen rather than military site, and furthermore enjoyed its nearness to his home in London. He was especially keen on hunting down a pre-Roman Iron Age oppidum at the site, taking note of that the presence of an adjacent Catuvellauni settlement was bore witness to in both established writings and numismatic proof. With Wheeler concentrating on potential Iron Age proof, Tessa focused on unearthing within the city dividers; Wheeler had illicit relationships with something like three partners amid the task. After Tessa composed two break reports, the last unearthing report was at long last distributed in 1936 as "Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities", mutually composed by Wheeler and his significant other. The report brought about the principal major distributed analysis of Wheeler, delivered by the youthful paleontologist Nowell Myres in a survey for "Artifact"; in spite of the fact that expressing that there was a lot to adulate about the work, he studied Wheeler's particular uncovering, questionable dating, and mystery. Wheeler reacted with a piece in which he safeguarded his work and propelled an individual assault on both Myres and Myres' manager, Christ Church, Oxford.
