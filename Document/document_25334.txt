The Yankees returned for another exhibition game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. New York had a four-run lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning, but a five-run rally with two outs propelled the Sounds to a 5â4Â win in front of 13,641Â fans. The tying and winning runs came off the bat of catcher Frank Kneuer who doubled down the left-filed line bringing home Matt Gallegos and Derwin McNealy from second and first. Among the Yankees in attendance for the game were manager Billy Martin, coach Yogi Berra, and players Goose Gossage, Ken Griffey Sr., Dave Winfield, Lou Piniella, Willie Randolph, and former Sound Don Mattingly. After the season's first half, Nashville held a 40â32 record, but that was only good enough for second place. Manager Doug Holmquist, frustrated with the team's disappointing first half, instituted a system of fines for player infractions or poor performance on the field. The program ranged from a $10 fine for a pitcher walking a batter with one on and two outs to a $100 fine for missing curfew. Rebounding, Nashville won the second-half pennant, 48â26, earning the team a shot at the Western Division championship. The Sounds, however, lost the decisive fifth game of the series to the Birmingham Barons, 7â5, ending their season. Nashville finished 30 games over .500, with an 88â58 record. Pitcher Jamie Werly set the franchise career strikeout record (352) when he played for the Sounds in 1980, 1981, and 1983.
