Concede then arranged a quick attack on Fort Donelson, under the order of John B. Floyd, which ruled the Cumberland River. Not at all like Fort Henry, Grant was currently going toward a power equivalent to his. Ignorant of the battalion's quality, Grant's powers were careless. Allow, McClernand, and Smith situated their divisions around the post. The following day McClernand and Smith propelled testing assaults on clear feeble spots in the Confederate line, just to withdraw with substantial misfortunes. On February 14, 1862, Foote's gunboats started assaulting the fortification, just to be repelled by its overwhelming firearms. Foote himself was injured. So far the Confederates were winning, yet soon Union fortifications arrived, giving Grant an absolute power of more than 40,000 men. At the point when Foote recaptured control of the waterway, Grant continued his assault bringing about a standoff. That night, Floyd called a chamber of war, uncertain of his next activity. Concede got a dispatch from Foote, mentioning that they meet. Concede mounted a steed and rode seven miles over solidifying streets and channels, achieving Smith's division, training him to get ready for the following attack, and rode on and got together with McClernand and Wallace. In the wake of trading reports, he got together with Foote. On February 16, Foote continued his assault, which flagged a general assault. Floyd and Pillow fled, leaving the post in direction of Simon Bolivar Buckner, who submitted to Grant's interest for "unlimited and quick surrender".
