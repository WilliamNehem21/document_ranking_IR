In 1990, the Walt Disney Studios gained the movie rights to "Evita", and Glenn Gordon Caron was enlisted to coordinate the film, with Madonna set to show up in the number one spot job. Disney was to create the film under its porno name Hollywood Pictures. In spite of the fact that Disney had burned through $2Ã¢ÂÂ 3 million being developed costs, it dropped the plans in May 1991 when the monetary allowance moved to $30 million. Disney director Jeffrey Katzenberg did not have any desire to spend more than $25.7 million on the movie. In November 1993, Stigwood sold the film rights to Andrew G. Vajna's generation organization Cinergi Pictures. Vajna later enrolled Arnon Milchan of Regency Enterprises as a co-agent, and Stone returned as the movie's chief in the wake of meeting with Dan Halsted, the senior VP of Hollywood Pictures. Generation was set to start at some point in 1995 after Stone and Milchan finished up recording of "Noriega", a film chronicling the life of Panamanian general and despot Manuel Noriega. Stone and Milchan debated over the high creation expenses of "Evita", "Noriega" (which was never shot) and "Nixon" (1995), bringing about Stone leaving the venture in July 1994.
