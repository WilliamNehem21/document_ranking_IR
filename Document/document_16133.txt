Back in MopÃ¡n, AmÃ©squeta had received additional supplies and decided to catch up with his advance party. He left MopÃ¡n on 10 March 1696 with friar AgustÃ­n Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from DÃ­az or AjKÊ¼ixaw. On 20 March AmÃ©squeta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find DÃ­az's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that DÃ­az had left behind. They followed DÃ­az's trail to the shore of Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡ near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes, and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that DÃ­az's party had passed that way, and AmÃ©squeta assumed that they had crossed to NojpetÃ©n. He wrote a letter to DÃ­az, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with AmÃ©squeta. During various attempts at communication to verify DÃ­az's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of AmÃ©squeta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in DÃ­az's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.
