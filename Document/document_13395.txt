Five other "Armillaria" species are found in Australia. Inside the scope of "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina", "A.ÃÂ hinnulea" is confined to chasm territories. "A.ÃÂ fumosa" is a rarer species discovered just in inadequately depleted or occasionally wet areas. "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina" and "A.ÃÂ montagnei" share top highlights and a comparative disagreeable flavor, however the last species has an olive-tinged top, bigger spores (9.5Ã¢ÂÂ 11 by 5.5Ã¢ÂÂ 7ÃÂ ÃÂµm contrasted with 6.5Ã¢ÂÂ 7.5 by 4.5Ã¢ÂÂ 5.5ÃÂ ÃÂµm) and a more prominent annulus than those found in "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina". The morphology of the vegetative structures of "A.ÃÂ limonea" is particularly not quite the same as "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina", and can be utilized to recognize the two species. "A.ÃÂ novae-zelandiae" has a sticky increasingly straightened top and stem underneath the ring and is found in wet backwoods, and "A.ÃÂ pallidula" is a species with cream gills developing to pale pink found in tropical Australia emerging from dead tree stumps or the underlying foundations of dead or living trees. "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina" is the main "Armillaria" species which happens in Western Australia. Recognizing Australian species is monetarily essential, on the grounds that "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina" is more pathogenic than different individuals from the class. An atomic indicative test, created in 2002, can precisely recognize every specie utilizing DNA extricated from its mycelia. Prior to this, species recognizable proof was restricted to times when organic product bodies were in season. This innovation additionally uncovered a variety in the atomic material of "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina" that recommended sexual multiplication.
