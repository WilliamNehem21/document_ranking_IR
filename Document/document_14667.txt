Herbert de Losinga was selected an ecclesiastical legate in 1093 by Pope UrbanÃÂ II to explore the matter of Thomas' calling of submission to Lanfranc. Herbert appears to have done nothing about exploring the issue. Likewise in 1093, King WilliamÃÂ II gave the Archbishops of York the privilege to name the Abbot of Selby Abbey in remuneration for the loss of York's case to the Diocese of Lincoln. While Anselm was in a state of banishment in the wake of quarreling with the King in 1097, Thomas blessed Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester, and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor, an unordinary step on the grounds that these bishoprics were in Canterbury's region, and it was Anselm's entitlement to bless the new diocesans. In 1100 after the abrupt demise of King WilliamÃÂ II and the seizure of intensity by the King's more youthful sibling Henry, Thomas touched base in London past the point where it is possible to crown HenryÃÂ I, as the service had just been performed by Maurice, Bishop of London, without the two diocese supervisors. Anselm as of now was still in a state of banishment. Thomas was at first irate at the slight, until it was disclosed to him that the King had stressed over the opportunity of confusion in the kingdom if there was a postponement. To conciliate him, Thomas was permitted to crown the King openly at a congregation board held not long after the royal celebration.
