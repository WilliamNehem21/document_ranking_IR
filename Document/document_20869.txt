The Beringian wolf was similar in size to the modern Yukon wolf ("C.l.pambasileus"). The largest northern wolves today have a shoulder height not exceeding and a body length not exceeding . The average weight of the Yukon wolf is for males and for females. Individual weights for Yukon wolves can vary from to , with one Yukon wolf weighing . The Beringian wolves were also similar in size to the Late Pleistocene wolves whose remains have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits at Los Angeles, California. These wolves, referred to as Rancho LaBrea wolves ("Canis lupus"), were not physically different from modern gray wolves, the only differences being a broader femur bone and a longer tibial tuberositythe insertion for the quadriceps and hamstring musclesindicating that they had comparatively more powerful leg muscles for a fast take-off before a chase. The Beringian wolf was more robust, and possessed stronger jaws and teeth, than either Rancho LaBrea or modern wolves.
During the Late Pleistocene, the more southerly occurring dire wolf ("Canis dirus") had the same shape and proportions as the Yukon wolf, but the dire wolf subspecies "C.dirusguildayi" is estimated to have weighed on average , and the subspecies "C.dirusdirus" on average , with some specimens being larger. The dire wolf was heavier than the Beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition.
