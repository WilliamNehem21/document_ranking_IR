The Amvets Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of USÂ 2/USÂ 41/Mâ35 between the northern Escanaba city limits and County RoadÂ 426 (CRÂ 426) in Delta County. The American Veterans (AMVETS) organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation, which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959.
Two sections of USÂ 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour (GLCT): the segment from the Wisconsin state line near Ironwood to the Mâ28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour (LSCT), and the segment from the southern Mâ35 junction in Escanaba to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT). These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario. The section of USÂ 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail. This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the "rich history of two industries that built a state and nation: mining and logging." On August 26, 2007, MDOT announced that the section of USÂ 2 that runs concurrently with Mâ35 in Delta County was being included in the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail. The segment between Thompson and St. Ignace along the northern shore of Lake Michigan was designated the Top of the Lake Scenic Byway in the Pure Michigan Byways program on October 9, 2017.
