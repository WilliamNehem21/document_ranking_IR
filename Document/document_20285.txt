The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26Â February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6Â March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25Â March, "Neptune" and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty's battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26Â March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21Â April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. During the night of 22/23Â April, "Neptune" was accidentally rammed by the neutral merchant ship in thick fog, but the battleship was only lightly damaged. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24Â April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2â4Â May, the fleet made another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.
