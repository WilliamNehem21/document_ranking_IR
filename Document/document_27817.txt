Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Nasr (1195Â â 22 January 1273), also known as Ibn al-Aá¸¥mar () and by his epithet al-Ghalib billah ("The Victor by the Grace of God"), was the first ruler of the Emirate of Granada, the last independent Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, and the founder of its ruling Nasrid dynasty. He lived during a time when Iberia's Christian kingdomsâespecially Portugal, Castile and Aragonâwere expanding at the expense of the Islamic territory in Iberia, called Al-Andalus. Muhammad ibn Yusuf took power in his native Arjona in 1232 when he rebelled against the "de facto" leader of Al-Andalus, Ibn Hud. During this rebellion, he was able to take control of CÃ³rdoba and Seville briefly, before he lost both cities to Ibn Hud. Forced to acknowledge Ibn Hud's suzerainty, Muhammad was able to retain Arjona and JaÃ©n. In 1236, he betrayed Ibn Hud by helping Ferdinand III of Castile take CÃ³rdoba. In the years that followed, Muhammad was able to gain control over the southern cities, including Granada (1237), AlmerÃ­a (1238) and MÃ¡laga (1239). In 1244, he lost Arjona to Castile. Two years later, in 1246, he agreed to surrender JaÃ©n and accept Ferdinand's overlordship in exchange for peace.
