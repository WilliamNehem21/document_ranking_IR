Helfeld and Lepidus proceeded with their trip along the south side of Banbury Reservoir. As they crossed a territory of open land, they protected behind a bundle and held off the followers, who numbered around 20 now. The two kept running on until they came to Chingford Road, where they boarded a number 9 cable car; a significant number of the travelers got away, and the driver, who saw the equipped men, kept running up the front stairs of the vehicle and stowed away on the top deck. Lepidus undermined the conductor with a gun and requested him to drive; in spite of the fact that he had never determined a cable car, he figured out how to get the vehicle going. Lepidus remained with his gun prepared on the conductor, while Helfeld shot at the followers behind them. One policeman held a horse and truck; he was equipped and attempted to draw sufficiently near to deal with a pointed shot, yet Helfeld shot the pony and the truck toppled. A cable car on the arrival venture from that of number 9 was seized by a policeman; 40 others boarded it and it turned around down the track in interest. The conductor, needing to dispose of the two men, revealed to them that there was a police headquarters around the following corner. The two offenders hopped off the cable car almost a pony drawn milk skim, shooting the driver and taking his vehicle. They fled toward Epping Forest.
