In 1848 Alkan was sharply frustrated when the leader of the Conservatoire, Daniel Auber, supplanted the resigning Zimmerman with the unremarkable Marmontel as leader of the Conservatoire piano office, a position which Alkan had anxiously foreseen, and for which he had firmly campaigned with the help of Sand, Dumas, and numerous other driving figures. A sickened Alkan portrayed the arrangement in a letter to Sand as "the most unbelievable, the most disgraceful assignment"; and Delacroix noted in his diary: "By his encounter with Auber, [Alkan] has been exceptionally put out and will without a doubt keep on being so." The furious emerging from this episode may represent Alkan's hesitance to perform out in the open in the following time frame. His withdrawal was likewise affected by the passing of Chopin; in 1850 he wrote to Masarnau "I have lost the solidarity to be of any financial or political use", and regretted "the demise of poor Chopin, another blow which I felt profoundly." Chopin, on his deathbed in 1849, had shown his regard for Alkan by handing down him his incomplete work on a piano technique, planning him to finish it, and after Chopin's demise some of his understudies exchanged to Alkan. In the wake of giving two shows in 1853, Alkan pulled back, notwithstanding his acclaim and specialized achievement, into virtual withdrawal for somewhere in the range of twenty years.
