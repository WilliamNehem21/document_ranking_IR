Endeavoring to propel the case for Southern Rhodesian autonomy, especially in case of Federal disintegration, the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead facilitated the 1961 constitution with Britain, which he thought would evacuate every British intensity of reservation over Southern Rhodesian bills and acts, and put the nation on the precarious edge of full sway. In spite of its containing no autonomy ensures, Whitehead, Welensky and different defenders of this constitution displayed it toward the Southern Rhodesian electorate as the "freedom constitution" under which Southern Rhodesia would turn into a domain on a standard with Australia, Canada and New Zealand if the Federation broke down. White dissidents included Ian Smith, MP for Gwanda and Chief Whip for the overseeing United Federal Party (UFP) in the Federal Assembly, who protested the constitution's oversight of an express guarantee of Southern Rhodesian autonomy in case of Federal disintegration, and eventually surrendered his post in challenge. A submission of the generally white electorate endorsed the new constitution by a lion's share of 65% on 26 July 1961. The last form of the constitution incorporated a couple of additional arrangements embedded by the British, one of whichÃ¢ÂÂSection 111Ã¢ÂÂheld full powers to the Crown to alter, add to or renounce certain areas of the Southern Rhodesian constitution by Order in Council in line with the British government. This viably discredited the surrender of British forces portrayed somewhere else in the record, yet the Southern Rhodesians did not at first notice it.
