Starting in October 1942, Nos.ÃÂ 6 and 100 Squadrons were given what the official history of the RAAF in World WarÃÂ II called the "tremendous errand" of keeping open the ocean paths among Australia and New Guinea, while upsetting as well as can be expected Japanese lines of correspondence and supply. The units kept up a rebuffing timetable of every day long-run surveillance and hostile to submarine watches, as per the official history, "for all intents and purposes without route helps, much of the time through downpour tempests and substantial cloud" be that as it may, "upheld by ground staffs as suffering as themselves, the teams kept up a firmly exclusive expectation and made extensive progress". The evening of 4/5ÃÂ October, Balmer took ten of his Beauforts from Milne Bay on a far-extending ambush against Japanese ships in the region of the Shortland Islands, close Bougainville. Two air ship vanished en route in tempests and the rest of isolated into two flights that all things considered figured out how to meet close to the objective. Seven of these propelled their torpedoes against the same number of boats and the groups trusted that four were exact, yet were unfit to affirm any hits in view of decreasing perceivability. The mission was viewed as a disappointment however this was put down to issues with the torpedoes and not the aircrew. Consequent reports recommended that three boats had in certainty been harmed.
