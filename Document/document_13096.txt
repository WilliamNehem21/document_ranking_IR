Most of the sceneÃ¢ÂÂlike the remainder of seasons six, seven, eight and nineÃ¢ÂÂwas taped in Los Angeles, California. The principal scene, highlighting Mulder breaking into an army installation, was shot in a hydroelectric power plant east of Fresno, California. The rooms that were included in the scene were the primary spaces for the power plant that "The X-Files" structure group rearranged; the team later considered the set the "war room". A large portion of the enhancement and inside scene was finished by the special visualization group; the main noticeable part found, in actuality, was a huge sump siphon. Bill Roe, the cinematographer for the scene, went through "four or five days lighting [the] set" for taping. Kim Manners called his work "an extraordinary activity". The scenes that happen in the primary work station room were shot on a twentieth Century Fox sound stage, while the scenes with Mulder being tormented by the military gatekeepers were shot at Fort MacArthur, a previous army installation in San Pedro, California that was decommissioned in 1974, including The Marine Mammal Care Center situated at Fort MacArthur. Taping the court was a standout amongst the "most testing arrangements" Manners had ever done. Carter needed the court to have no onlookers and no jury. This implied Manners needed to shoot every scene with a set number of performing artists and make them look "new". Habits was panicked to film the 40-page long court scene, calling attention to that the show was essentially re-telling a nine-year history of "The X-Files". Corey Kaplan structured the set.
