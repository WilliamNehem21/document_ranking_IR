In spite of the similitudes, there are a few highlights that recognize "Mesopropithecus" skulls from those of living indriids. The skull, including the zygomatic curve, is all the more vigorously fabricated. The worldly lines combine anteriorly into a sagittal peak and there is an unmistakable nuchal edge that joins the back of the zygomatic curve. The skull has an increasingly adjusted braincase, somewhat littler and progressively united circles, increasingly articulated postorbital choking (narrowing of the skull behind the eye attachments), progressively strong postorbital bar (bone that surrounds the eye attachment), a more extreme facial edge, progressively powerful and cranially curved zygomatic bone, and a more extensive, squared nose. The upper incisors and canines are bigger. The more strong mandible (lower jaw) and mandibular symphysis (point where the two parts of the lower jaw meet) propose a more folivorous diet, which requires additional crushing. The circles are as huge (in outright size) as those in littler living indriids, which recommends low visual keenness. "Mesopropithecus" and its nearest sloth lemur relative, "Babakotia", shared a couple of tribal qualities with indriids, in contrast to the biggest sloth lemurs, "Palaeopropithecus" and "Archaeoindris". These incorporate the previously mentioned four-toothed toothcomb, an expanded sound-related bulla (hard structure that encases some portion of the center and internal ear), and an intrabullar ectotympanic ring (hard ring that holds the eardrum).
