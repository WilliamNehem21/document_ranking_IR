In 2005, unearthings of the interstate paving the way to Sahure's pyramid yielded new alleviation parts which demonstrated undeniably that pharaoh Sahure and his partner, ruler Meretnebty, were Neferirkare's folks. In reality, these reliefsÃ¢ÂÂfound by Verner and Tarek El AwadyÃ¢ÂÂdelineate Sahure and Meretnebty together with their two children Ranefer and Netjerirenre. While the two children are given the title of "ruler's oldest child", perhaps demonstrating that they were twins, Ranefer is appeared at Sahure and furthermore given the title of "boss lector-cleric", which may mirror that he was brought into the world first and in this manner given higher positions. Since Ranefer is known to have been the name of Neferirkare before he took the honored position, as demonstrated by reliefs from the funeral home sanctuary of Sahure (see underneath), presumably subsists as to Neferirkare's filiation. Nothing more is known on Netjerirenre, a perception which drove Verner and El-Awady to guess that he could have endeavored to catch the position of royalty at the surprising demise of Neferirkare's child and successor Neferefre, who passed on in his mid twenties following two years on the royal position. In this assumed theory, he would be the vaporous Shepseskare. At long last, a similar help just as another record a further four children of Sahure, Khakare, Horemsaf, Raemsaf and Nebankhre however the personality of their mom is obscure, with the goal that they are in this way in any event relatives to Neferirkare.
