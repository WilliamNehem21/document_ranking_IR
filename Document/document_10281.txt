Secretariat was formally reared by Christopher Chenery's Meadow Stud, yet the reproducing was really masterminded by Penny Chenery (at that point known as Penny Tweedy), who had assumed control over the running of the stable in 1968 when her dad turned out to be sick. Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler and his dam was Somethingroyal, a little girl of Princequillo. Strong Ruler was the main sire in North America from 1963 to 1969 and again in 1973. Claimed by the Phipps family, Bold Ruler had both speed and stamina, having won the Preakness Stakes and Horse of the Year praises in 1957, and American Champion Sprint Horse respects in 1958. Striking Ruler was resigned to stud at Claiborne Farm, yet the Phippses claimed a large portion of the horses to which Bold Ruler was reared, and few of his posterity were sold at open sale. To bring fresh recruits into their reproducing program, the Phippses here and there arranged a foal-imparting consent to other female horse proprietors: Instead of charging a stud expense for Bold Ruler, they would mastermind numerous matings with Bold Ruler, either with two female horses in a single year or one horse over a two-year time frame. Expecting two foals were delivered, the Phipps family would keep one and the horse's proprietor would keep the other, with a coin hurl figuring out who got first pick.
