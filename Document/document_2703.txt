Since contamination concerns are fundamentally along the lower stream, the Willamette by and large scores moderately high on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI), which is incorporated by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). The DEQ considers list scores of under 60 to be poor; different classifications are 60Ã¢ÂÂ 79 (poor); 80Ã¢ÂÂ 84 (reasonable); 85Ã¢ÂÂ 89 (great), and 90Ã¢ÂÂ 100 (superb). The Willamette River's water quality is evaluated amazing close to the source, however it steadily decays to reasonable close to the mouth. Somewhere in the range of 1998 and 2007, the normal score for the upper Willamette at Springfield (RMÃÂ 185, RKÃÂ 298) was 93. At Salem (RMÃÂ 84, RKÃÂ 135), the score was 89, and great scores proceeded with right to the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland (RMÃÂ 13, RKÃÂ 21) at 85. Scores were in the "reasonable" classification further downstream; the least good perusing was at the Swan Island Channel midpoint (RMÃÂ 0.5, RKÃÂ 0.8) at 81. By examination, locales on the Winchuck River, the Clackamas, and the North Santiam all scored 95, and a site at a siphon station on Klamath Strait Drain between Upper Klamath Lake and Lower Klamath Lake recorded the most reduced score in Oregon at 19.
