As indicated by Cuse, the show was deliberately set in 1893, precisely 100 years before the arrangement debuted in 1993. Brisco is intended to know about the fast approaching changes in the public arena and innovation and effectively searches for them. The scholars of the show, and furthermore the character of Brisco, allude to this idea as "The Coming Thing". Expounding on this subject, Campbell stated, "Essentially this show is about the turn of the century, when the Old West met the Industrial Era. Cattle rustlers still bite tobacco and ride the range and states are still regions in any case, into the great beyond, is the beginning of power, the first automobiles and phones. Brisco is amidst a progress from the past to what's to come." The impact of rancher characters with baffling innovation and different time misplacements creates humor all through the arrangement. The journalists made it a point to embed scenes reflecting the popular culture of the twentieth century, from the obvious innovation of the expression "UFO" in the pilot scene to the presence of a sheriff who looks and acts like Elvis Presley. Talking about the amusingness of the show, Campbell stated, "I would state 30 percent of every scene is being played for giggles. Yet, it is anything but a winking at the camera, "Plane"- kind of cleverness. We're clever like "Indiana Jones" is amusing; the chuckles come principally from the wide assortment of crazy, brilliant characters that come all through this arrangement."
