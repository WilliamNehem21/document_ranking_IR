The main shipment of coins, $130,000 into equal parts dollars, touched base by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii was still in a financial subsidence. Various individuals from the business network, including Sanford B. Dole, protested the issue in light of the fact that so a lot silver would expand the money, and went to court to keep the administration from giving Spreckels securities in return for anything with the exception of gold coin, as the law required. The legislature contradicted the activity, which was gotten the islands' preeminent court, in light of the fact that the silver coins were equal to gold. The main equity, A. F. Judd, conceded a transitory writ of mandamus against the administration giving the Dole offended parties what they needed, finding that the coins were not equal to gold, and that the coinage and credit acts had been damaged. On request to the full court, however, Judd was switched, as the court found that Dole and his partners ought to have petitioned for an order. Yet, when they did, the appeal was denied. In the meantime at a gathering led by the lord, the privy chamber had pronounced the new coinage a lawful delicate; when the claim was settled, the legislature paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like measure of bonds.
