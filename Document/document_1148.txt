Not the majority of the ongoing basic response to "Tenebrae" has been certain. Geoff Andrew of "Time Out" suspected that the film was "upsetting even by contemporary repulsiveness benchmarks". John Kenneth Muir, creator of "Blood and guts movies of the 1980s", believes the film to be far second rate compared to "Suspiria", yet recognizes that it was so "unremittingly violent" that it defended its US title of "Unsane". John Wiley Martin, in spite of the fact that assessing the film as an "actually mesmeric" one, felt that specifically it was a "disappointingly retrograde advance" for Argento. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com considered it a "bloody however not especially compelling Argento thriller", while Dennis Schwartz of "Ozus' World Movie Reviews" expelled it as "waste". Gary Johnson, manager of "Pictures", grumbled, "Very little of "Tenebre" bodes well. The plot turns out to be minimal in excess of a reason for Argento to organize the homicide successions. What's more, these are the absolute bloodiest killings of Argento's profession." In 2004, Tim Lucas rethought the film and found that a portion of his prior energy had diminished significantly, taking note of that, ""Tenebre" is starting to experience the ill effects of the shoddy 16 mm-like delicate quality of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its occasionally over-storyboarded brutality (the initial two homicides specifically look stilted), the many dazing slips in logicÃÂ ... what's more, the exaggerated exhibitions of a significant number of its female performers".
