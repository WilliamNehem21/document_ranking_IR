Hutton seldom captained Yorkshire, aside from without the official chief, through a blend of weakness, visit unlucky deficiencies with England and the nearness of the beginner Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley asserted a few times that he would have remained down to support Hutton, however the panel stayed suspicious of expert captaincy and thought Hutton a depressed person who blamed his wellbeing so as not to play. Hutton was a saved man for whom the Yorkshire changing area conflicts of the 1950s held little intrigue. As the side's senior expert, he didn't generally give the direction which more youthful players in the side were looking for. The group was separated and the players as often as possible conflicted with one another; a few commentators trust this was a factor in the district's inability to win the County Championship during the 1950s. Beam Illingworth, a player at the time, trusts that Hutton was the main man who could have changed the negative frame of mind around the group, yet "he didn't take care of business". Illingworth reviewed that he was an "inaccessible saint", saying: "He was an amusing man was LenÃ¢ÂÂsomewhat mocking constantly. He'd hear a contention in the changing area and he'd toss a touch of wood on the flame to prop it up. He took care of himself, he was a significant introvert."
