Every maxilla had space for around 14 or 15 teeth, though "Giraffatitan" had 11 and "Camarasaurus" 8 to 10. The maxillae contained substitution teeth that had rugose finish, like "Camarasaurus", yet did not have the little denticles (serrations) along the edges. Since the maxilla was more extensive than that of "Camarasaurus", "Brachiosaurus" would have had bigger teeth. The substitution teeth in the premaxilla had crinkled lacquer, and the most total of these teeth did not have denticles. Each dentary had space for around 14 teeth. The main very much saved tooth of this skull is extensive, spoon-molded, and might be from the front piece of the left dentary. It varies from those of "Giraffatitan" in that the crown is a lot more extensive than the root, like "Camarasaurus". That the tooth isn't worn infers that it had emitted around the time the creature kicked the bucket. The external and internal sides of the tooth were crenelated (had indented vertical notches); the crenelations of one side met with those of the opposite side at the highest point of the tooth, where they framed denticles. The maxillary tooth columns of "Brachiosaurus" and "Giraffatitan" finished well before the antorbital fenestra (the opening before the circle), though they finished just before and underneath the fenestra in "Camarasaurus" and "Shunosaurus".
