As indicated by the writer Raymond Benson, "Moonraker" is a more profound and more thoughtful book than Fleming's past work, which enables the writer to build up the characters further. All things considered, Bond "progresses toward becoming something more thanÃÂ ... [the] cardboard figure" that he had been in the past two books. The beginning of the book focuses on Bond at home and his every day schedules, which Fleming depicts as "Versatile available time from around ten until six,ÃÂ ... nights spent playing cards in the organization of a couple of dear friends,ÃÂ ... or on the other hand having intercourse, with rather cool energy, to one of three comparatively arranged wedded ladies." This way of life was to a great extent demonstrated alone, which the columnist and essayist Matthew Parker sees as indicating "an acridity" in the writer's character. As indicated by Chancellor, two of Bond's different indecencies were likewise shown in the book: his affection for bettingÃ¢ÂÂunlawful aside from in private individuals clubs in 1955Ã¢ÂÂand over the top beverage and medication taking, neither of which were disapproved of in post-war privileged circles. In anticipation of beating Drax at cards, Bond expends a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka imparted to M, two jugs of champagne and a schnaps; he likewise blends an amount of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. As indicated by "The Times" columnist and antiquarian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the liquor utilization "implied unwinding, custom and unwavering quality". Benzedrine was routinely taken by troops amid the war to stay conscious and alarm, and Fleming was a periodic customer.
