Following Watkin's retirement relations between the Great Central Railway and the Metropolitan Railway disintegrated seriously. The GCR course to London kept running over MR lines from Quainton Road to London, and to decrease dependence on the precarious generosity of the MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt chose to make a connection with the Great Western Railway to make a second course into London. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway started development of another line, regularly known as the Alternative Route, to interface the GWR's current station at Princes Risborough to the new Great Central line. The line kept running from Princes Risborough north to meet the Great Central at Grendon Underwood, about north of Quainton Road. The new line was to cross the Tramway on a scaffold promptly east of Wotton station, albeit no convergence was worked between the lines. In spite of the fact that the lines did not associate, a brief siding was worked from the Tramway onto the bank of the new line, and utilized for the vehicle of development materials and the expulsion of ruin from the works amid the structure of the new line. Albeit formally an autonomous organization, by and by the line was worked as a piece of the Great Central Railway.
