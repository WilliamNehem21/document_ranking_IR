Although the previous season was tame, the 2001â02 season was very active and featured several intense tropical cyclones. During the season, eleven systems were named, which was slightly above the average of nine. However, nine of the systems attained cyclone intensity, the second highest total in 30Â years. In terms of both the number of systems and number of "cyclone days", the season was considered comparable by MFR to the 1993â94 season. In this season, there were 73Â days on which tropical cyclones were active, which was more than twice as much as the previous season and 19Â days above the average. A system of cyclone intensity was active on 35Â days, which was 15Â days above the mean. Additionally, five of the systems attained "intense tropical cyclone" status, including oneÂ â HaryÂ â that attained the "very intense tropical cyclone" stage. Activity was relatively distributed throughout the season and had the earliest start since 1992. Like most seasons within the basin, activity reached a climax in late January. Several systems during the season developed in the eastern portion of the basin, similar to 1993â94; unlike that season, many storms in 2001â02 stayed at sea throughout their lifetime, thus reducing casualties and damage.
