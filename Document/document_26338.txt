HergÃ© wanted to set Tintin's first adventure in the United States in order to involve Native Americansâa people who had fascinated him since boyhoodâin the story. Wallez rejected this idea, which later saw realisation as the series' third instalment, "Tintin in America" (1932). Instead, Wallez wanted HergÃ© to send Tintin to the Soviet Union, founded in 1922 by the MarxistâLeninist Bolshevik Party after seizing power in the Russian Empire during the 1917 October Revolution. The Bolsheviks greatly altered the country's society by nationalising industry and replacing a capitalist economy with a state socialist one. By the late 1920s, the Soviet Union's first leader, Vladimir Lenin, had died and been replaced by Joseph Stalin. Being both Roman Catholic and politically right-wing, Wallez was opposed to the atheist, anti-Christian, and extreme left-wing Soviet government, and wanted Tintin's first adventure to reflect this, to persuade its young readers with anti-Marxist and anti-communist ideas. Later commenting on why he produced a work of propaganda, HergÃ© said that he had been "inspired by the atmosphere of the paper", which taught him that being a Catholic meant being anti-Marxist, and since childhood he had been horrified by the Bolshevik shooting of the Romanov family in July 1918.
