Borah would have liked to be chosen president in 1928, however his solitary possibility was a stopped Republican tradition. He was hesitant to help Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover for president, backing Ohio Senator Frank Willis rather, however after Willis crumbled and passed on at a crusade rally in late March, Borah started to discover Hoover more to his preferring. The Idahoan's help for Hoover turned out to be increasingly strong as the battle formed as a rustic/urban separation. Borah was a solid sponsor of Prohibition, and the way that Hoover was another "dry" affected Borah in his help; the representative hated the Democratic applicant, New York Governor Al Smith, an adversary of Prohibition, thinking of him as an animal of Tammany Hall. In spite of the fact that Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh remarked on "Borah's ongoing change to Hoover", and a few progressives were unsettled, Borah attempted a long crusade visit, cautioning that he saw "the achievement of Tammany in national legislative issues as nothing not exactly a national catastrophe". Hoover was chosen and said thanks to Borah for "the huge impact" of his help. He offered to make Borah Secretary of State, however lamenting the misfortune to the Senate, yet Borah declined.
