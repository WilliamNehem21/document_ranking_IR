The violin was Nielsen's very own instrument and he created four vast scale chamber works for it. The takeoffs from standard techniques in the First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its frequently unexpected tweaks and its concise topical material, perplexed Danish pundits at its first execution. The Second Sonata, Op.ÃÂ 35 of 1912 was composed for the musician Peder MÃÂ¸ller who prior that year had debuted the arranger's Violin Concerto. The work is a case of the writer's dynamic tonality since, despite the fact that it is expressed to be in the key of G minor, the first and only developments end in various keys. The pundit Emilius Bangert composed of the debut (which was given by Axel Gade), "The general impression was of a lovely, whole lineÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a stream of notesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ where specifically an awesome second subject in the initial segment and the unadulterated, high circle of the last part were enthralling". Two different works are for violin solo. The "Prelude, Theme and Variations", Op. 48 (1923) was composed for TelmÃÂ¡nyi, and, similar to Nielsen's "Chaconne" for piano, Op. 32, was roused by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The "Preludio e Presto", Op. 52 (1928) was composed as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday celebration of the arranger Fini Henriques.
