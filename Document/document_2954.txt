Following his gathering with al-Muttaqi, al-Ikhshid came back to Egypt, leaving the field open for the eager Sayf al-Dawla. The Ikhshidid powers abandoned in Syria were moderately frail, and the Hamdanid pioneer, having picked up the help of the Banu Kilab, had little trouble in catching Aleppo on 29 October 944. He at that point started expanding his authority over the regions of northern Syria down to Hims. Al-Ikhshid sent a military under the eunuchs Abu al-Misk Kafur and Fatik against the Hamdanid, yet it was vanquished close Hama and withdrew back to Egypt, forsaking Damascus and Palestine to the Hamdanids. Al-Ikhshid was then compelled to indeed crusade face to face in April 945, and yet he sent agents proposing to Sayf al-Dawla an understanding along the lines of the one with Ibn Ra'iq: the Hamdanid sovereign would get the chance to keep northern Syria, while al-Ikhshid would pay him a yearly tribute for the ownership of Palestine and Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla can't and allegedly even flaunted that he would vanquish Egypt itself, yet al-Ikhshid held the high ground: his specialists figured out how to influence a few Hamdanid pioneers, and he prevailed upon the natives of Damascus, who banned their entryways before the Hamdanid and opened them for al-Ikhshid. The two militaries met close Qinnasrin in May, where the Hamdanids were crushed. Sayf al-Dawla fled to Raqqa, leaving his capital Aleppo to be caught by al-Ikhshid.
