The last serious typhoon, in 1906, had struck the Florida Keys. Numerous homes were built hurriedly and inadequately because of this break in tempests. Be that as it may, on September 18, 1926, a tempest that wound up known as the 1926 Miami Hurricane hit with winds over , and caused gigantic pulverization. The tempest flood was as high as in certain spots. Henry Flagler's lavish Royal Palm Hotel was crushed alongside numerous different lodgings and structures. The vast majority who kicked the bucket did as such when they ran out into the road in dismay while the eye of the tropical storm ignored, not realizing the breeze was rolling in from the other heading. "The respite endured 35ÃÂ minutes, and amid that time the roads of the city wound up swarmed with individuals", composed Richard Gray, the nearby climate boss. "Subsequently, numerous lives were lost amid the second period of the tempest." In Miami alone, 115 individuals were tallied deadÃ¢ÂÂin spite of the fact that the genuine figure may have been as high as 175, in light of the fact that passing aggregates were racially isolated. More than 25,000ÃÂ people were destitute in the city. The town of Moore Haven, flanking Lake Okeechobee, was hardest hit. A levee worked of waste fallen, suffocating very nearly 400 of the town's whole 1,200 occupants. The highest points of Lake Okeechobee levees were just over the lake itself and the designers knew about the peril. Two days before the sea tempest, a specialist anticipated, "[i]f we have a blow, even a hurricane, Moore Haven is going submerged". The architect lost his better half and girl in the flood.
