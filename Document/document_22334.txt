At Drury Lane later in 1800, he starred as an officer in "The Wheel of Fortune" by Richard Cumberland, a Jewish pedlar in "The Indian", as Clown in "Robinson Crusoe", and as the Second Gravedigger in "Hamlet", alongside John Philip Kemble. Grimaldi's wife Maria and his unborn child died during childbirth on 18 October 1800. To cope with his grief, Grimaldi would often perform two shows a night; one at Sadler's Wells and the other at Drury Lane.
With the Christmas season approaching, and the success of "Peter Wilkins" still a topic of conversation within theatrical circles, Kemble decided to stage the first Drury Lane pantomime in three years, "Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona", with Grimaldi as Punch and then as Clown, instead of Dubois. In this production, Harlequin became "romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous", leaving Grimaldi's Clown as the "undisputed agent" of chaos. The pantomime was a great success, running for thirty-three performances and having a second Drury Lane season at Easter 1801; as a result, Grimaldi became recognised as one of London's leading Clowns. Grimaldi originated the catchphrase "Here we are again!", which is still used in pantomime. He also was known for the mischievous catchphrase "Shall I?", which prompted audience members to respond "Yes!"
