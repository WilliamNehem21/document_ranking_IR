The original score for "Secret of Mana" was composed and produced by Hiroki Kikuta. Kenji Ito, who had composed the soundtrack for "Final Fantasy Adventure", was originally slated for the project, but was replaced with Kikuta after he had started on other projects, such as "Romancing SaGa". "Secret of Mana" was Kikuta's first video game score, and he encountered difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the Super NES. Kikuta tried to express in the music two "contrasting styles" to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24Â hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, "immersive" and "three-dimensional". Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta stated in 2001 that he considered the score for "Secret of Mana" his favorite creation.
