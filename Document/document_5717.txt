At the point when Saint-SaÃÂ«ns was taken back to Paris he lived with his mom and her bereaved auntie, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years of age he showed impeccable pitch and delighted in selecting tunes on the piano. His incredible auntie showed him the fundamentals of pianism, and when he was seven he turned into an understudy of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a previous student of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his understudies to play while laying their lower arms on a bar arranged before the console, with the goal that all the musician's capacity originated from the hands and fingers as opposed to the arms, which, Saint-SaÃÂ«ns later composed, was great preparing. ClÃÂ©mence Saint-SaÃÂ«ns, very much aware of her child's bright ability, did not wish him to wind up renowned excessively youthful. The music commentator Harold C. Schonberg composed of Saint-SaÃÂ«ns in 1969, "It isn't commonly understood that he was the most exceptional kid wonder ever, and that incorporates Mozart." The kid gave periodic exhibitions for little gatherings of people from the age of five, however it was not until he was ten that he made his official open presentation, at the Salle Pleyel, in a program that incorporated Mozart's Piano Concerto in B (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's impact, Saint-SaÃÂ«ns was acquainted with the sythesis educator Pierre Maleden and the organ instructor Alexandre Pierre FranÃÂ§ois BoÃÂ«ly. From the last he procured a deep rooted love of the music of Bach, which was then minimal known in France.
