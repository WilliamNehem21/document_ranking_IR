Much of the anger about the film stemmed from its high-profile internationally; that it had been "blessed with the imprimatur of the BBCÂ ... with its connotations of fair and authoritative reporting" only made matters worse. John Burns, writing in "The Sunday Times", restated many of Gunson's arguments, and the BBC received 4,000 e-mails demanding that "Storyville"s commissioning editor, Nick Fraser, be sacked. Toward the end of 2003, the weight of criticism forced the BBC to act. The corporation's complaints unit opened an investigation, and Fraser said the BBC would not show the film again until it had concluded. He wrote to David Power expressing particular concern over an error with the end titles and the use of out-of-chronology footage, saying the latter was "a real problemâparticularlyÂ ... since it has been used in a film dedicated to exposing the frauds of Venezuelan TV". The furor came at a difficult time for the corporation, which was under the spotlight of the Hutton Inquiry, the official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of David Kelly; the BBC had been criticized for reporting that intelligence dossiers had been "sexed up" by the UK government to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
