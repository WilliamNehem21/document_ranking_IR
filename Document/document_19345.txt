During the Han dynasty, the power a government official exercised was determined by his annual salary-rank, measured in grain units known as "dan" (, a unit of volume, approximately ). However, approximately half an official's salary in grain was made in payments of cash coins, the standard of which, after 119 BC, was the "wushu" (äºé) coin measuring 3.2 g (0.11Â oz). The other half of an official's salary consisted of unhusked grain and husked grain measured in "hu" (è§³, approximately 20 L / 676 oz); since one "hu" of unhusked grain was equal to 100 coins and one "hu" of husked grain was equal to 160 coins, the conversion ratio for unhusked grain to husked grain was 10 to 6 (see table below). The most senior officials in central government earned a 10,000-"dan" salary. The officials who oversaw nine specialized ministries each earned the Fully 2,000-"dan" rank, while the magistrate of a county earned a 600-"dan" rank. Occasionally, emperors bestowed luxurious gifts of wine, foodstuffs, and silk clothes upon high officials. These gifts, in some generous cases, could equal as much as half the value of the officials' standard annual salary. Aged officials were often retired from service and given a pension. Below is a table outlining salaries measured in coin cash, unhusked grain, and husked grain for the highest to lowest-paid officials in Han officialdom:
