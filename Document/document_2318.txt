Boyce was perceived with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926, the main year it was granted, for his endeavors in beginning the BSA. He was the third beneficiary, after Baden-Powell and the Unknown Scout. Amid the BSA's 50th commemoration in 1960, 15,000 Scouts and a few of Boyce's relatives assembled in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend. Illinois representative William Stratton conveyed the key location and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive. In 1985, around 2,500 Scouts went to a 75th commemoration journey in Ottawa, gone to by his last enduring kid, Virginia, and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame part. Boyce had been a part from 1891 until he kicked the bucket. On December 6, 1997, a Scouting exhibition hall opened in Ottawa. The W. D. Boyce Council of the BSA is named in his respect. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker situated on Boyce Campus of Community College of Allegheny County in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, perceives his accomplishments to Scouting. Not a long way from the marker is a province park, Boyce Park, that was named for him. An emblem of Boyce is close to the White House as a major aspect of The Extra MileÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Points of Light Volunteer Pathway. In 2005, the BSA presented the William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award, exhibited to the coordinator of any new Scouting unit.
