On 5 October 1936 a chose gathering of 200 set out from Jarrow Town Hall on the 282-mile walk, expecting to achieve London by 30 October for the beginning of the new session of parliament. Wilkinson did not walk the whole distance, yet joined at whatever point her different responsibilities permitted. At that year's Labor Party meeting, held in Edinburgh, she planned to stir excitement yet rather heard herself censured for "sending ravenous and sick clad men the nation over". This negative disposition was reflected by a portion of the nearby gatherings on the course of the walk; in such regions, Wilkinson recorded with incongruity, the Conservatives and Liberals saw to the marchers' needs. On 31 October the marchers achieved London, yet Baldwin wouldn't see them. On 4 November, Wilkinson displayed the town's request to the House of Commons. Marked by 11,000 natives of Jarrow, it finished up: "The town can't be left abandoned, and in this way your Petitioners modestly supplicate that His Majesty's Government and this fair House ought to understand the earnest need that work ought to be accommodated the town immediately." In the concise talk that pursued, Runciman opined that "the joblessness position at Jarrow, while still a long way from agreeable, has improved amid ongoing months". In answer a Labor backbencher remarked that "the Government's smugness is viewed all through the nation as an attack against the national still, small voice".
