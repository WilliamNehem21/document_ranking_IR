Some time after "Modern Cookery" was published, Acton moved from Tonbridge to Hampstead, north west London. She became the cookery correspondent for the weekly magazines "The Ladies' Companion" and "Household Words", and began writing research for a book on nourishment for the ill, "Invalid Cookery". She interrupted her research to write a new edition of "Modern Cookery". This was published in 1855, and renamed as "Modern Cookery for Private Families", the name by which it is best known. This version contains an additional chapter named "Foreign and Jewish Cookery"; the Jewish recipes are from Ashkenazi cuisine. Such was the success of her first editions of the book, it was increasingly copied by other cookery writers. In the preface to the 1855 edition, Acton wrote of "the unscrupulous manner in which large portions of my volume have been appropriated by contemporary authors, without the slightest acknowledgement of the source from which they have been derived". She was in increasingly poor health during the 1850s and wrote in her preface that she was "suffering at present too severe a penalty forÂ ... over-exertion"; this toil, she continued, was "so completely at variance with all the previous habits of my life, andÂ ... so injurious in its effects".
