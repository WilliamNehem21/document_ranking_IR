The subject of Davidson's treatment by the consistory court was first raised by the "Congregation Times" following the preliminary. A main article contended that, in spite of the fact that Davidson's direct had been "absurd and offbeat", his goals in any event toward the beginning of his service had been guided by optimism. Chancellor North was scrutinized both for lacking empathy and for the general lead of the procedures: "No accomplished criminal specialist could possibly have screwed up so gravely and reliably." In 2006 Davidson's granddaughter, Karylin Collier, secretly distributed a concise life story, "The Rector of Stiffkey: His Life and Trial", in which she keeps up the honesty of the considerable number of charges against him. Exhaust contends that "Harold Davidson likely had the right to be discreetly defrocked for his weaknesses as a minister", yet all things considered trusts that he was not a corrupt man. He likewise features the uncouth introduction of Davidson's case by his legitimate group, especially their inability to scrutinize the provenance of the Barbara Harris letter. Exhaust presumes that since the procedures were defective and the proof of corruption wobbly, the Church of England owes it to the Davidson family to rethink the first discoveries.
