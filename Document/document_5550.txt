On 4 March, "Saratoga" withdrew Majuro with an escort of three destroyers to strengthen the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and enable it to assault Japanese-controlled region. She rendezvoused adrift on 27 March with the British power and touched base at Trincomalee, Ceylon, on 31 March. Amid the following two weeks, the bearers led serious preparing and practicing with the armada transporter for an assault on the port city of Sabang (Operation Cockpit) planned for 19 April. For this task, "Saratoga" gathered 27 Hellcats, 24 Dauntlesses and 18 Avengers. The transporter propelled 24 Hellcats, 11 Avengers and 18 Dauntlesses while "Renowned" contributed 17 Fairey Barracuda planes and 13 Vought F4U Corsair warriors. The assault got the Japanese off guard there was no elevated restriction, so the escorts strafed the runway and obliterated 24 air ship on the ground. The port offices and oil stockpiling tanks were intensely harmed and one little tanker was sunk for the loss of one Hellcat to fire. The Japanese endeavored to assault the armada with three G4Ms as it was pulling back, yet the CAP shot down each of the three aircraft. Cruising from Ceylon on 6 May, the team assaulted the oil refinery at Surabaya, Java, on 17 May in the wake of refueling at Exmouth Gulf, Australia. Little harm was exacted on the refinery and just a single little ship was sunk for the loss of one of VT-3's Avengers. "Saratoga" was alleviated from its task with the British the following day and requested back to Pearl.
