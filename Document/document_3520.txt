NEA's operational base camp, a strengthened solid fortification known as BuildingÃÂ 81, was finished in May 1942. Situated on Green Street, Townsville, at the base of Castle Hill, it was finished with a rural house to misdirect adversary flying machine. That month, Eastern Area Command was framed, assuming responsibility for units in New South Wales and southern Queensland from Southern Area and NEA.

The Japanese assaulted Townsville multiple times somewhere in the range of 25 and 31 July; most bombs fell in the ocean or the slopes causing just a single loss, a harmed tyke. NEA's limits were finetuned on 19ÃÂ August: a bit of Queensland inside the Barkly Tableland and the Haslingden and Heywood regions was relegated to the control of North-Western Area. Lukis gave over direction of NEA to Group Captain (later Air Commodore) Harry Cobby on 25ÃÂ August. Before the month's over, the base camp staff numbered 684.
