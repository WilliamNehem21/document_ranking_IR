The remembrance was inevitably divulged on 11 November (Armistice Day) 1926, as a feature of an extensive ecumenical administration, which included 5,000 neighborhood schoolchildren. The group was sufficiently huge that the administration couldn't be obliged in the congregation and was rather held in the market square. At the finish of the administration, the group continued to the new dedication; the procession was driven by veterans from the Battle of Mons and included other military delegates, medical caretakers from Northampton General Hospital, and the town's municipal pioneers. Once in the square, the divulging was performed by General Henry Horne, first Baron Horne and the remembrance was devoted by the Reverend Norman Lang, Suffragan Bishop of Leicester. Horne submitted the remembrance to the consideration of the town's civic chairman and Northamptonshire County Council, and in his discourse alluded to Northampton's job as the province town; he saw that networks crosswise over Northamptonshire would erect their own dedications, however felt that it was "correct and fitting that there should remain in the district town some obvious landmark, some substantial commemoration speaking to the heart through the eye, of the valiance, commitment to obligation, and selflessness of the men of Northamptonshire". The Prince of Wales laid a wreath amid a service on 7 July 1927, the year after the divulging.
