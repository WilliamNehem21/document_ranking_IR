"Sounds" gave "Metal for Muthas" a poor review, but the album was nevertheless a commercial success and may have been instrumental in encouraging major labels to sign a few more bands. AÂ IIÂ Z, Fist, White Spirit and Praying Mantis were dropped after the release of their debut albums, while Tygers of Pan Tang, Samson, More, Demon and Girlschool had more success and lasted longer on major labels' line-ups. The new releases by these bands were better produced and some of them, with the support of intensive tours in the UK and Europe, obtained good chart results. The best chart performances of that period were for Iron Maiden's debut album "Iron Maiden" and for "Wheels of Steel" by Saxon, which reached No.Â 4 and No.Â 5 on the UK Albums Chart respectively, while their singles "Running Free", "Wheels of Steel" and "747 (Strangers in the Night)" entered the UK Singles Chart Top 50. The immediate consequence of that success was increased media coverage for metal bands, which included appearances on the British music TV shows "Top of the Pops" and "The Old Grey Whistle Test". The emergence of many new bands in the period between 1978 and 1980 was another remarkable effect of the promotion of the movement to a relevant national phenomenon.
