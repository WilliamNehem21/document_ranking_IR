The expressway was made during the 1930s from a current arrangement of streets connecting Perth with the Goldfields. In spite of the fact that the name Great Eastern Highway was instituted to depict the course from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (present day Guildford Road), it was really utilized for the street through Belmont, south of the stream. This segment was built in 1867 utilizing convict work, with the street base produced using segments of tree trunks. Throughout the years the street has been overhauled, with the entire thruway fixed by 1953, portions reproduced and broadened, double carriageways made in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and level isolated exchanges worked at real crossing points. Extraordinary Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern rural areas opened in 1988, permitting through traffic to stay away from the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 another detour occupied the thruway around Northam. A future course to supplant Great Eastern Highway's present rising of the Darling Scarp has been recognized. The arranged course is a controlled-get to roadway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and after that crosswise over to Wundowie by means of another arrangement. In spite of the fact that arranging started during the 1970s, , development of this course has not been booked, and it isn't viewed as a need.
