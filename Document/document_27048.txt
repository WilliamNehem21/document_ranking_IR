The 1982 Sounds, led by manager Johnny Oates, ended the first half at 32â38, but won the second half, 45â29. After defeating the Knoxville Blue Jays, 3â1, in the Western Division playoffs, the Sounds advanced to the league championship series against the Jacksonville Suns. With a 2â1 series lead, Nashville entered game four with a chance to win their second Southern League championship in front of a home crowd at Greer. The Sounds took an early lead in the second inning, but the Suns tied things up in the ninth sending the game to extra innings. With two outs in the bottom of the thirteenth inning, outfielder Brian Dayett hit a walk-off home run scoring Buck Showalter and giving the Sounds a 5â3 win. Nashville had won the series, 3â1, and won the franchise's second league pennant. The team's season record was 77â67. Dayett, an All-Star, was selected as the Southern League MVP. Stefan Wever, who was also voted onto the All-Star team and paced the league with 191Â strikeouts and a 2.78Â ERA, was the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher. Wever was the fifth Sounds hurler in five years to win the award. Otis Nixon set the franchise career record for stolen bases (133) during the 1981 and 1982 seasons. The Sounds set the club's and Greer Stadium's all-time single-game attendance record on August 18, 1982, when 22,315Â people watched the Sounds defeat the Columbus Astros, 3â0. Portions of the outfield had to be roped off to accommodate the crowd, which was far in excess of Greer's seating capacity.
