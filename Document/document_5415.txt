Benjamin Harrison kicked the bucket in 1791. William Henry dropped the investigation of drug and utilized Benjamin's associations with the Founding Fathers to get a commission in the Army. The seat of the national government was then in Philadelphia, and President Washington allowed him a commission. Harrison served under Mad Anthony Wayne, battling against Native Americans in what is presently western Ohio. He was elevated to chief and made authority of Fort Washington before coming back to non military personnel life in 1798, hating battalion obligation. He was at that point looking for another situation through his administration associations, and that year was named by President John Adams as secretary of the Northwest Territory. The next year, the regional council barely chosen him the domain's agent to Congress. In 1800, the Indiana Territory was isolated from the Northwest, and Harrison was made regional senator by President Adams, a position he would hold for over 10 years. Preceding getting to work, he purchased a huge tract of land from his dad in-law, along the Ohio River at North Bend. At the point when Harrison bought it, there was a log lodge on the property, yet by 1840 the structure had been retained into the chateau that remained there.
