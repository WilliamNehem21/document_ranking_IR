Four U.S. Naval force ships and the submarine USS "Columbia", positioned in the Arabian Sea, terminated somewhere in the range of 60 and 75 Tomahawk journey rockets into Afghanistan at the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr camp complex in the Khost district, which incorporated a base camp, a help camp, and four preparing camps. Diminish Bergen recognizes the focused on camps, situated in Afghanistan's "Pashtun belt," as al-Badr 1 and 2, al-Farooq, Khalid container Walid, Abu Jindal, and Salman Farsi; different sources distinguish the Muawia, Jihad Wahl, and Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami camps as targets. As indicated by Shelton, the base camp housed "stockpiling, lodging, preparing and organization offices for the complex," while the help camp included weapons-storerooms and dealt with the site's coordinations. Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Algerian Armed Islamic Group likewise utilized the Khost camps, just as Pakistani activist gatherings battling a revolt in Kashmir, for example, Harkat Ansar, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. The simple camps, supposedly kept running by Taliban official Jalaluddin Haqqani, were frequented by Arab, Chechen, and Central Asian activists, just as the ISI. The rockets hit at generally 10:00 PM Khost time (17:30 GMT); as in Sudan, the strikes were propelled during the evening to stay away from inadvertent blow-back. Rather than the assault on Al-Shifa, the strike on the Afghan camps was uncontroversial.
