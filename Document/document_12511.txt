The Song official Yu Yunwen was in order of the military shielding the waterway. The Jurchen armed force was vanquished while assaulting Caishi between November 26 and 27 amid the Battle of Caishi. The oar wheel boats of the Song naval force, furnished with trebuchets that shot explosive bombs, overpowered the light ships of the Jin armada. Jin ships were unfit to contend on the grounds that they were littler and quickly built. The bombs propelled by the Song contained blends of black powder, lime, pieces of iron, and a toxic substance that was likely arsenic. Conventional Chinese records consider this the defining moment of the war, portraying it as a military miracle that verified southern China from the northern intruders. The importance of the fight is said to have equaled a likewise adored triumph at the Battle of Fei River in the fourth century. Contemporaneous Song accounts guaranteed that the 18,000 Song officers told by Yu Yunwen and entrusted with shielding Caishi had the capacity to vanquish the attacking Jurchen armed force of 400,000 troopers. Present day history specialists are increasingly wary and consider the Jurchen numbers a misrepresentation. Tune students of history may have confounded the quantity of Jurchen officers at the Battle of Caishi with the all out number of troopers under the direction of Wanyan Liang. The contention was not the uneven fight that conventional records suggest, and the Song had various favorable circumstances over the Jin. The Song armada was bigger than the Jin's, and the Jin were unfit to utilize their most noteworthy resource, mounted force, in a maritime fight.
