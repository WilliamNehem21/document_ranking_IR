Tucana is one of the twelve groups of stars set up by the Dutch stargazer Petrus Plancius from the perceptions of the southern sky by the Dutch pioneers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had cruised on the main Dutch exchanging endeavor, known as the "Eerste Schipvaart", toward the East Indies. It previously showed up on a heavenly globe distributed in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The main delineation of this star grouping in a heavenly chart book was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer's "Uranometria" of 1603. Both Plancius and Bayer portray it as a toucan. De Houtman included it in his southern star list that year under the Dutch name "Lair Indiaenschen Exster, operation Indies Lang ghenaemt" "the Indian jaybird, named Lang in the Indies", by this importance a specific winged creature with a long mouthÃ¢ÂÂa hornbill, a fledgling local toward the East Indies. A 1603 heavenly globe by Willem Blaeu portrays it with a casque. It was deciphered on Chinese graphs as "Neaou Chuy" "bill winged animal", and in England as "Brasilian Pye", while Johannes Kepler and Giovanni Battista Riccioli named it "Anser Americanus" "American Goose", and Caesius as "Pica Indica". Tucana and the close-by groups of stars Phoenix, Grus and Pavo are on the whole called the "Southern Birds".
