The Thebe gossamer ring is the faintest Jovian ring. It shows up as a black out structure with a rectangular cross area, extending from the Thebean circle at () to about (;). Its inward limit isn't obviously characterized a direct result of the nearness of the a lot more splendid fundamental ring and radiance. The thickness of the ring is around 8400ÃÂ km close to the circle of Thebe and marginally diminishes toward the planet. The Thebe gossamer ring is most splendid close to its top and base edges and step by step winds up more splendid towards JupiterÃ¢ÂÂmuch like the Amalthea ring. The external limit of the ring isn't particularly steep, extending over . There is a scarcely obvious continuation of the ring past the circle of Thebe, reaching out up to () and called the Thebe Extension. In forward-dissipated light the ring has all the earmarks of being around multiple times fainter than the Amalthea gossamer ring. In back-dispersed light it has been recognized just by the Keck telescope. Back-dissipating pictures demonstrate a pinnacle of brilliance simply inside the circle of Thebe. In 2002Ã¢ÂÂ 2003 the residue counter of the Galileo shuttle distinguished residue particles in the size range 0.2Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ÃÂ¼mÃ¢ÂÂlike those in the Amalthea ringÃ¢ÂÂand affirmed the outcomes got from imaging.
