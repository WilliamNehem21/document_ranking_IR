The wartime activities of the ship are unclear. According to a postwar report written for the "Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute", the incomplete vessel was towed to Kiel, where she was used as a barracks ship. The modern naval historian RenÃ© Greger states that the incomplete hull never left Hamburg. Some contemporary observers believed the ship had been completed for service with the German Navy, and British Admiral John Jellicoe, the commander of the Grand Fleet, received intelligence that the ship might have been in service by 1916. Other observers, such as Barnett, pointed to the difficulty the German Navy would have had in rearming the ship with German guns, given the fact that Germany possessed no designs for naval guns of that caliber or mountings suitable for use aboard "Salamis". He regarded the claim that she had been put into service "doubtful". Barnett's assessment was correct; a substantial rebuilding of the ship's barbette structures would have been required to accommodate German guns, and since guns available for naval use were not easily available owing to the needs of the German Army, work was directed toward German vessels under construction like the battlecruiser . The British realized the rumor was false when the ship did not appear at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May â 1 June 1916.
