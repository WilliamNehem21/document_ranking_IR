A 1958 act in Leipzig, and a few additional stagings in Germany, went before the British premiÃÂ¨re of the musical drama at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1963. This was followed in 1982 by the principal completely proficient creation in England. It was performed by Kent Opera with the director, Ivan Fischer, making his introduction with the organization and the ensemble playing on extravagant instruments. Felicity Palmer played the title job. In 1983 the musical drama came back to Venice, for an execution under Christopher Hogwood at the Teatro Malibran. In the United States a show exhibition had been given on 16 February 1972 at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, however the musical show's first completely organized American execution was in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1985. That equivalent year it achieved New York, with a show exhibition at Alice Tully Hall, where the musical drama was portrayed as a "real irregularity". The Fort Worth execution was immediately trailed by further American stagings in Iowa City and Boston. The truly educated execution development enlivened two period instrument creations of "Agrippina" in 1985 and 1991 separately. Both were in Germany, the first was in the Schlosstheater Schwetzingen, the other at the GÃÂ¶ttingen International Handel Festival.
