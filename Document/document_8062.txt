In July 1982 Horne sang the part close by John Alexander's Goffredo and Samuel Ramey's Argante, in a National Arts Center (NAC) creation in Ottawa coordinated by Frank Corsaro. The execution, with Mario Bernardi directing the NAC Orchestra, was commended by "Montreal Gazette" pundit Eric McLean for its fine music making and its presentations of "design and fashion wonder". After eighteen months, on 19 January 1984 Bernardi and Corsaro, with Horne, Ramey and Benita Valente from the Ottawa cast, brought the generation to New York for the work's presentation at the Metropolitan Opera. The creation was lent to the Met for its centennial season by the National Arts Center of Canada "in profound energy about the numerous years amid which Canadians have delighted in musical show from the Met Ã¢ÂÂ on visit, on radio and in New York". Donal Henahan in "The New York Times" lauded every one of the vocalists thusly, with an extraordinary notice for Valente's "mournful and influencing" rendering of the prominent aria "Lascia ch'io pianga". Be that as it may, says Henahan, "the most intense cheers of the night went finally to the choreographer, Eugene Collins, and an unfathomably agile corps of tumbling warriors". After ten exhibitions at the Metropolitan Opera House the creation was taken in May to Washington, D.C., and visited in the US before coming back to New York in June for a few outside exhibitions.
