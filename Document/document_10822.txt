Somewhere around four seismic occasions have happened at Mount Cayley since 1985 and is the main fountain of liquid magma that has recorded seismic action in the field. This proposes the spring of gushing lava still contains a functioning magma framework, showing the likelihood of future eruptive action. In spite of the fact that the accessible information does not permit an unmistakable end, this perception shows that some volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field might be dynamic, with huge potential dangers. This seismic movement connects both with a portion of Canada's most young volcanoes and with enduring volcanoes with a background marked by huge hazardous action, for example, Mount Cayley. Later seismic imaging from Natural Resources Canada representatives bolstered lithoprobe thinks about in the area of Mount Cayley that made an extensive reflector deciphered to be a pool of liquid shake generally beneath the surface. It is assessed to be long and wide with a thickness of not exactly . The reflector is comprehended to be a ledge complex related with the development of Mount Cayley. In any case, the accessible information does not preclude its likelihood being an assortment of liquid shake made by drying out of the subducted Juan de Fuca Plate. It is found just underneath the frail lithosphere like those found under subduction zone volcanoes in Japan.
