St.Â AndrÃ© recanted his views on 9Â December 1726. In 1729, following the death of Samuel Molyneux from poisoning, he married Molyneux's widow, Elizabeth. This did little to impress his peers. Molyneux's cousin accused him of the poisoning, a charge that St.Â AndrÃ© defended by suing for defamation, but the careers of St.Â AndrÃ© and his wife were permanently damaged. Elizabeth lost her attendance on Queen Caroline, and St.Â AndrÃ© was publicly humiliated at court. Living on Elizabeth's considerable wealth, they retired to the country, where St.Â AndrÃ© died in 1776, agedÂ 96. Manningham, desperate to exculpate himself, published a diary of his observations of Mary Toft, together with an account of her confession of the fraud, on 12Â December. In it he suggested that Douglas had been fooled by Toft, and concerned with his image Douglas replied by publishing his own account. Using the pseudonym 'Lover of Truth and Learning', in 1727 Douglas also published "The Sooterkin Dissected". A letter to Maubray, Douglas was scathingly critical of his Sooterkin theory, calling it "a mere fiction of your [Maubray's] brain". The damage done to the medical profession was such that several doctors not connected with the tale felt compelled to print statements that they had not believed Toft's story. On 7Â January 1727 John Howard and Toft appeared before the bench, where Howard was fined Â£800 (Â£ today). He returned to Surrey and continued his practice, and died in 1755.
