These stops filled in as emotional defining moments in the strain discharge structure of the exhibitions, changing their rhythm and enabling the band to switch back and forth between calm sections and exceptional peaks. He additionally contributed the exhibitions with automaton washes from his Yamaha organ, accomplishing a "weird, almost unreasonable nearness" that Mikal Gilmore accepted "characterized the temper" of the music.
