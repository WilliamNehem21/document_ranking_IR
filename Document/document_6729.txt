Tarrare crossed Prussian lines under front of haziness, masked as a German worker. Unfit to communicate in German, he before long pulled in the consideration of neighborhood occupants, who cautioned the Prussian experts, and he was caught outside Landau. A strip look discovered nothing suspicious on his individual, and notwithstanding being whipped by Prussian fighters, he would not sell out his central goal. Brought before the nearby Prussian administrator, General Zoegli, he again wouldn't talk and was detained. Following 24 hours of bondage, Tarrare yielded and disclosed the plan to his captors. He was affixed to a lavatory, and in the end, 30 hours in the wake of being gulped, the wooden box developed. Zoegli was angry when the archives, which Tarrare had said contained fundamental knowledge, unfolded just to be deÃÂ Beauharnais' spurious message, and Tarrare was taken to a hangman's tree and the noose put around his neck. (A few sources express that Zoegli never recovered the crate, as Tarrare had the sound judgment to recoup and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) scarcely in time, Zoegli yielded, and Tarrare was brought down from the platform, given a serious beating, and discharged close to the French lines.
