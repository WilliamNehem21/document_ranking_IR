British naturalist Sir Joseph Banks encountered the red-tailed tropicbird on the Pacific Ocean in March 1769 on James Cook's first voyage, noting that it was a different species to the familiar red-billed tropicbird. He gave it the name "Phaeton erubescens". It was French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon who formally described the species in his "Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux" in 1781, noting it was a native of Isle de France (Mauritius). The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by FranÃ§ois-Nicolas Martinet in the "Planches EnluminÃ©es D'Histoire Naturelle" which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Buffon did not include a scientific name with his description but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name "Phaethon rubricauda" in his catalogue of the "Planche EnluminÃ©es". The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek "phaethon", "sun" while the species epithet comes from the Latin words "ruber" "red" and "cauda" "tail". English ornithologist John Latham wrote about the red-tailed tropicbird in 1785 in his "General Synopsis of Birds", recording it as common in Mauritius and the South Pacific. He also reported a black-billed tropicbird collected from Palmerston Island that ended up in Banks' collection. Latham did not give them binomial names, however. It was left to German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin to describe the species, which he did as "Phaeton phoenicuros" and "P. melanorhynchos" respectively in the 13th edition of "Systema Naturae" in 1788. Latham later described this black-billed specimen as the New Holland tropicbird, giving it the name "Phaethon novae-hollandiae".
