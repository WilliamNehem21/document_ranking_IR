Poppy at first showed up as a visitor character in two scenes, communicate on 11 and 13 January 2011, in "filler" scenes that were substituted for those cut from a questionable infant swap storyline in which Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack's) child James kicks the bucket of abrupt newborn child passing disorder, and she furtively swaps him with Kat Moon's (Jessie Wallace) child, Tommy. A representative for "EastEnders" asserted that albeit a portion of the child swap scenes had been altered because of response from watchers, none had been expelled: "Given the gathering of people reaction to this storyline, we felt on this event that it was proper to react and roll out certain improvements. Most by far of material stays flawless and we don't trust that those trims we have influenced will to debilitate or cheapen the general storyline for watchers". In a meeting with the "Every day Mirror," Bright expressed that her first scene was her most loved all through her residency, as "all [she] could believe was, 'I'm perched on a seat in the Square!'" Babbington, who played Jodie, uncovered in May 2011 that Bright was to repeat her job. Brilliant made her arrival on 30 June 2011.
