After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion walked to the back and started setting up a hold line at Beaucourt. On 18 April, Gellibrand was cleared debilitated and Leane was delegated to go about as unit authority in his place. The next day he was incidentally elevated to the position of colonel. Amid Gellibrand's nonattendance, on 27Ã¢ÂÂ 28 April the twelfth Brigade was conveyed to the line at Villers-Bretonneux, which had quite recently been recovered from the Germans. So as to push the bleeding edge further east of the town, it was important to catch firmly held German positions in Monument Wood, so-named as it was neighboring a dedication to the Franco-Prussian War. This errand was given to the twelfth Brigade, and Leane, realizing that the battling would be troublesome, connected his typical routine with regards to giving the most provoking missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the extreme battling at Dernancourt, the 48th had been strengthened with a critical number of unseasoned newcomers. The assault was made arrangements for 02:00 on 3 May, and so as to accomplish shock, there was to be just discontinuous shelling of the wood amid the day, and only a two-minute torrent with every single accessible weapon at the season of the assault. In the occasion, Leane's first fight as unit leader went gravely, with the mounted guns torrent being extremely feeble and neglecting to cut the wire before the wood, and the supporting tanks neglecting to have any effect. One gathering figured out how to get past the wire and catch 21 Germans in the homestead structures in the focal point of the wood, yet a German counterattack constrained the Australians back to their begin line, with lost 12 officers and 143 different positions, against German setbacks of 10 officers and 136 men.
