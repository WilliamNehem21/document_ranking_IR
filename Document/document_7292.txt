In November 1940, with the help of the pioneer of the "Volksgruppe in RumÃÂ¤nien" (ethnic Germans in Romania), Andreas Schmidt, Phleps kept in touch with the key "Waffen-SS" enlisting officer "SS-BrigadefÃÂ¼hrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS" (Brigadier) Gottlob Berger offering his administrations to the Third Reich. He hence requested authorization to leave Romania so as to join the "Wehrmacht", and this was affirmed by the as of late introduced Romanian "ConducÃÂtor" (tyrant), General Ion Antonescu. Phleps volunteered for the "Waffen-SS" rather, enrolling under his mom's original last name of Stolz. As indicated by the history specialist Hans Bergel, Phleps joined the "Waffen-SS" on the grounds that "Volksdeutsche" were not allowed to join the "Wehrmacht". He was selected a "SS-StandartenfÃÂ¼hrer" (colonel) by "ReichsfÃÂ¼hrer-SS" Heinrich Himmler and joined the SS Motorized Division "Wiking", where he told Dutch, Flemish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish volunteers. At the point when Hilmar WÃÂ¤ckerle, the authority of SS-Regiment "Westland", was murdered in real life close Lvov in late June 1941, Phleps took over direction of that regiment. He separated himself in battling at Kremenchuk and Dnipropetrovsk in the Ukraine, directed his own "Kampfgruppe", turned into a friend of "Generalmajor" (Brigadier General) Hans-Valentin Hube, administrator of the sixteenth Panzer Division, and was along these lines elevated to "SS-OberfÃÂ¼hrer" (senior colonel). In July 1941 he was granted the 1939 catch to his Iron Cross (1914) second Class and afterward the Iron Cross (1939) first Class.
