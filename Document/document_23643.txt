In 1990 Gielgud appeared in the James Scott-directed "Strike It Rich", an adaptation of a Graham Greene novel co-starring Molly Ringwald and Robert Lindsay. That same year he made his last film appearance in a leading role, playing Prospero in "Prospero's Books", Peter Greenaway's adaptation of "The Tempest". Reviews for the film were mixed, but Gielgud's performance in one of his signature roles was much praised. He continued to work on radio, as he had done throughout his career; Croall lists more than fifty BBC radio productions of plays starring Gielgud between 1929 and 1994. To mark his ninetieth birthday he played Lear for the last time; for the BBC Kenneth Branagh gathered a cast that included Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins and Emma Thompson as Lear's daughters, with actors such as Bob Hoskins, Derek Jacobi and Simon Russell Beale in supporting roles. He continued to appear on television until 1994; his last role in the medium was in a BBC production that year of J. B. Priestley's rarely-revived "Summer Day's Dream". Subsequently, he made further cameo appearances in films including Branagh's "Hamlet" (as King Priam, 1996), "Dragonheart" (as the voice of King Arthur, 1996), and "Shine" (as Cecil Parkes, 1996). His last feature film appearance was as Pope Pius V in Shekhar Kapur's "Elizabeth" (1999). In 2000 he had a non-speaking role alongside Pinter in a film of Beckett's short play "Catastrophe" directed by David Mamet.
