In 1559, in the Scottish Reformation, a picture of Mary mother of Jesus was taken from Neilston Parish Church and tossed into a pool of the River Levern. The pool as far back as has been known as the Midge Hole. One of Neilston Parish Church's most commended pastors was Dr Alexander Fleming and his "Life" (1883) contains a lot of enthusiasm identifying with Neilston. In 1826, regardless of augmentation of the congregation, it was too little to even consider accommodating the populace and the Heritors requested installment of seat rents for those going to administrations. Dr Fleming continued to lecture from a tent raised in the memorial park for a time of around eight years, demanding that "the general population of the Parish are qualified for hear the gospel without cash or value." The case went to the House of Lords and despite the fact that it was not fruitful, the parishioners were thusly ready to come back to the congregation and take their places without paying rent and with no further restriction from the Heritors. In 2003, in a noteworthy restoration, six skeletons were found underneath the wood planks of the congregation. At first closed as a wrongdoing scene, archeologists from the University of Glasgow affirmed the skeletons were around 400 years of age. A nearby student of history recommended they could be the bones of previous ministers.
