The film did not initially incorporate bazaar scenes. Vasan chose to include them partially through generation, and the screenplay was changed. For the scene where Veerasimhan is liberated from a cavern by elephants, "hundreds" of carnival elephants were utilized. Kittoo went all through South India and Ceylon (presently Sri Lanka), seeing more than 50 carnivals before he picked the Kamala Circus Company and Parasuram Lion Circus; Vasan utilized Kamala for a month. The carnival scenes were shot by K. Ramnoth. Kittoo thought back about the cinematographer's work:In those days, we had no long range focal points but then Ramnoth did it. One night, while Chandralekha is performing on the flying trapeze, she sees the reprobate's partner in crime in the first column. She is on her roost high up and he is situated in a ringside seat. Stun hits her and to pass on the stun the camera zooms quick from her to the man. Today, with a quick zoom shot it very well may be done in all respects effectively, however there was no such focal point forty years prior. Ramnoth did it utilizing the crane. He arranged it well and practiced the shot for long. He took the shot multiple times and chose the best "take".
