As the Balkans remained a secondary theatre of war, the two Principalities were taken over by a neutral Austrian administration in September 1854 â part of a settlement between the Porte and Russia (the Austrians remained until 1857). Grigore Ghica and Ètirbei were returned to the thrones in the same year, and completed the last series of reforms carried under the terms of the "Regulament". The most far-reaching among these were the ones concerning Roma slavery. In Moldavia, Romas were liberated, without a period of transition, on December 22, 1855; the change was more gradual in Wallachia, where measures to curb trade had been taken earlier, and where the decision to ban the ownership of slaves was taken by Ètirbei on February 20, 1856. Concerned by worsening boyar-peasant relations, Ètirbei, who governed without an Assembly (and had instead appointed his own "Divan"), enacted measures to improve the situation in the countryside, and ultimately enforced contract-based work as the rule on estates (whereby peasants who were not indebted after five years in service could leave the land they were working on).
This was the moment when the call for union of the two Principalities began to be voiced with confidence, and the two monarchs showed more or less approval for the designs of the unionist "Partida NaÈionalÄ" (created by 1848 revolutionaries who had returned from exile).
