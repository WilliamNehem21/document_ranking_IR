In evaluating the initial three scenes, "The New York Times" remarked that "Ben is a distant legend, and Mr. Stahl completes an exceptional activity of silently passing on his character's mind-sets and desires, just as his awkward elegance." "The Boston Globe" respected "Stahl, with his attentive gazes, [as] one of the show's qualities. He has an innocent face, however the horrid appearance of an exhausted senior", and the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" said Stahl "says a lot with his eyes and fatigued grimace, to such an extent that his downplayed depiction nearly conveys the arrangement." In a season 1 DVD audit, DVD Talk imagined that "as the two leads, Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown are out and out splendid. Ben Hawkins is an exceptionally disconnected and calm character, but then he conveys a critical piece of the arrangement on his shoulders. Without the correct performer it could be tragic, however Stahl conveys a dimension of astute feeling to the character to such an extent that a look or a gaze says a lot." DVDverdict felt in a season 2 survey that "both Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown convey impeccable exhibitions. Stahl's continuous acknowledgment of his own capacity, and his resulting battle, are entrancing."
