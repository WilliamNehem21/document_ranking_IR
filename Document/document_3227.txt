The Southern Rhodesian leaders intended to crush the German section by exploiting the provincial topography; the Germans had Lake Rukwa to their back, and the streams Songwe and Saisi on their particular left (eastern) and right flanks, viably fixing them in on the off chance that they were assaulted. The arrangement was that components of 1RNR would hold the Saisi while a contingent of the King's African Rifles (KAR) kept an eye on the Songwe; the remainder of 1RNR would then drive the Germans back towards the lake. Be that as it may, Tomlinson deciphered his requests as requiring prompt activity, and assaulted before the two flanking lines were set up on the streams. The hostile had a few victories at first, despite the fact that Tomlinson was dwarfed, yet the 450 Germans, furnished with three "KÃÂ¶nigsberg" field firearms and 14 automatic rifles, before long pulled back to the higher ground at St Moritz Mission. The Germans counterattacked over the next week. Colonel RÃÂ E Murray, who told a section of BSAP men about away, did not help Tomlinson, and 1RNR took incredible misfortunes while repelling the assault: 58 RNR men were slaughtered, and the Germans caught three Rhodesian automatic rifles. Tomlinson was accused by most for the calamity, however he demanded for a considerable length of time a short time later that he had just been following requests from Murray to hold his ground. He communicated skepticism at Murray's inability to strengthen him. An enquiry into the issue was kept away from when Tomlinson was injured and invalided home not long after the fight.
