A calm, social flying creature, the huia was monogamous, and combines likely matched forever. The fledgling was generally found in rearing sets, albeit once in a while gatherings of at least four were experienced. Walter Buller records that an agreeable pair would dependably hold near one another, continually articulating a "low loving twitter", notwithstanding when in bondage. There are records of this equivalent pair and a further, wild pair "bouncing from branch to branch and fanning their tails, at that point meeting to touch each other with their bills" and expressing these commotions. The male is said to have nourished the female in romance. It is imagined that these practices may have been a sexual showcase. The case that the male nourished the female while she was brooding and on the home "needs proof". At the point when the male of this hostage pair was incidentally killed, the female "showing the most extreme trouble pined for her mate and passed on 10 days a short time later". A MÃÂori man in the nineteenth century reviewed: "I was dependably told by my elderly individuals that a couple of huia lived on most friendly termsÃÂ ... In the event that the male kicked the bucket first, the female passed on not long after of sorrow". The huia had no dread of individuals; females enabled themselves to be taken care of on the home, and fowls could without much of a stretch be caught by hand.
