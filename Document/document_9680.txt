In any case, the degree that Ignition were happy to go to control access to the collection produced more publicity than could typically have been normal, and served to distance individuals from both the print and communicate media, just as most Creation staff individuals. At the point when "D'You Know What I Mean?" was arranged as the main single, Ignition chose a late discharge to radio in order to stay away from an excess of development introduction. Be that as it may, three stations broke the ban, and Ignition froze. As per Greengrass: "we'd been in these bleeding shelter gatherings for a half year or something, and our plot was blown. 'Poop, it's a bad dream'." BBC Radio 1 got a CD containing three tunes ten days before the collection's discharge, on condition that plate racer Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to avoid illicit duplicates being made by audience members. The day after Lamacq reviewed the collection on his show, he got a telephone call from Ignition advising him that he would not have the capacity to see further tracks since he didn't talk enough over the tunes. Lamacq stated, "I needed to go reporting in real time the following night and state, 'Sorry, however we're not getting any more tracks.' It was only "ludicrous."" According to Creation's head of promoting John Andrews, "[The campaign] influenced individuals to detest Oasis inside Creation. You had this Oasis camp that resembled 'I'm grieved, you're not permitted come into the workplace between the next hours. You're not permitted notice the word Oasis.' It resembled an extremist state." One worker reviewed an occurrence "when someone came round to check our telephones since they thought "The Sun" had tapped them."
