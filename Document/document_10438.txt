In the prior months Pius IX's beatification by the Catholic Church in 2000, Jewish pundits and others in the universal media raised the to a great extent overlooked Mortara scene while breaking down the Pope's life and inheritance. As per Dov Levitan, the essential realities of the Mortara case are a long way from extraordinary, yet it is in any case of specific significance in view of its impact on general feeling in Italy, Britain and France, and for instance of "the incredible feeling of Jewish solidarity that rose in the last 50% of the nineteenth century [as] Jews rose to the reason for their brethren in different pieces of the world". The "Collusion IsraÃÂ©lite Universelle", whose development had been somewhat spurred by the Mortara case, developed into a standout amongst the most conspicuous Jewish associations on the planet and suffers into the 21st century. The case is the subject of Francesco Cilluffo's two-demonstration musical drama "Il caso Mortara", which debuted in New York in 2010. The Italian-language distribution by Vittorio Messori in 2005 of Mortara's unpublished Castilian diaries, accessible in English since 2017 under the title "Captured by the Vatican? The Unpublished Memoirs of Edgardo Mortara", reignited the discussion once more.
