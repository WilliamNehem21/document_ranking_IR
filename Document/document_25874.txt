When Etty completed "Sirens" in 1837, it was one of the main attractions at the 1837 Summer Exhibition, the first to be held in the Royal Academy's new building in Trafalgar Square (now part of the National Gallery). The painting, with its juxtaposition of male and female nudity and decaying corpses, immediately divided opinion. Some critics considered it one of the finest artworks ever made, with "The Gentleman's Magazine" particularly taken with the work, describing "Sirens" as "a historical work of the first class" and "by far the best that Mr. Etty ever painted". Other critics were less kind; "The Spectator" considered it "a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridityâglowing in colour and wonderful in execution, but conceived in the worst possible taste".
Possibly because of its size, "The Sirens and Ulysses" failed to sell at the Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who, without having seen the painting, offered Â£250 (about Â£ in today's terms) for "Sirens" and for "Samson and Delilah", also exhibited by Etty that year. Etty, poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio, sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth. Etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which flaked when dry, and as soon as it was complete "Sirens" began to deteriorate. It was shown at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display, and placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In 2006 restoration began on it, and in May 2010 "Sirens" was returned to public display and is now one of the key works in the Manchester Art Gallery.
