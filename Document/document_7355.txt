The ring-followed lemur imparts numerous likenesses to ruffed lemurs (class "Varecia") and genuine lemurs (family "Eulemur"), and its skeleton is about vague from that of the genuine lemurs. Thusly, the three genera were once gathered together in the class "Lemur" and all the more as of late are once in a while alluded to as subfamily Lemurinae (inside family Lemuridae). Be that as it may, ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the variety "Varecia" in 1962, and because of likenesses between the ring-followed lemur and the bamboo lemurs, especially with respect to atomic proof and fragrance organs similitudes, the genuine lemurs were moved to the sort "Eulemur" by Yves Rumpler and Elwyn L. Simons (1988) just as Colin Groves and Robert H. Eaglen (1988). In 1991, Ian Tattersall and Jeffrey H. Schwartz inspected the proof and arrived at an alternate resolution, rather supporting to restore the individuals from "Eulemur" and "Varecia" to the family "Lemur". In any case, this view was not generally acknowledged and the variety "Lemur" stayed monotypic, containing just the ring-followed lemur. Since the distinctions in atomic information are so minute between the ring-followed lemur and the two genera of bamboo lemurs, it has been proposed that every one of the three genera be consolidated.
