To make a trip to the Middle East and buy ponies, Davenport expected to get conciliatory authorization from the legislature of the Ottoman Empire, and explicitly from Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In December 1905, Davenport moved toward President Roosevelt for help, and in January 1906, Roosevelt gave him a letter of help that he had the capacity to present to the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Chikeb Bey, who reached the Sultan. To the shock of both Davenport and the Ambassador, the grant, called an "IradÃÂ©", was without a doubt, permitting the fare of "six or eight" ponies. Davenport and his voyaging partners left the United States on July 5, 1906, venturing out to France by ship and from that point to Constantinople via train. Upon landing, the "IradÃÂ©" was confirmed, and cleared up that Davenport would be permitted to send out the two female horses and stallions. Davenport's achievement was prominent for a few reasons. It was the first run through Arabian steeds authoritatively had been permitted to be sent out from the Ottoman Empire in 35 years. It was likewise eminent that Davenport not exclusively had the capacity to buy stallions, which were regularly accessible available to be purchased to outcasts, yet in addition female horses, which were loved by the Bedouin; the best war female horses for the most part were not available to be purchased at any cost.
