In February 1930 Tippett provided the incidental music for a performance by his theatrical group of James Elroy Flecker's "Don Juan", and in October he directed them in his own adaptation of Stanford's opera "The Travelling Companion". His compositional output was such that on 5 April 1930 he gave a concert in Oxted consisting entirely of his own worksâa Concerto in D for flutes, oboe, horns and strings; settings for tenor of poems by Charlotte Mew; "Psalm in C" for chorus and orchestra, with a text by Christopher Fry; piano variations on the song "Jockey to the Fair"; and a string quartet. Professional soloists and orchestral players were engaged, and the concert was conducted by David Moule-Evans, a friend from the RCM. Despite encouraging comments from "The Times" and the "Daily Telegraph", Tippett was deeply dissatisfied with the works, and decided that he needed further tuition. He withdrew the music, and in September 1930 re-enrolled at the RCM for a special course of study in counterpoint with R. O. Morris, an expert on 16th-century music. This second RCM period, during which he learned to write fugues in the style of Bach and received additional tuition in orchestration from Gordon Jacob, was central to Tippett's eventual discovery of what he termed his "individual voice".
