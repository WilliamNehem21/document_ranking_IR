The court took a gander at the minutes of the arrangement exchanges to decipher the importance of the bargain language "in a similar manner as" as the United States depicted it to the Tribes, holding that the United States proposed for there to be an equivalent sharing of the fish asset between the Tribes and the pioneers.
