For his victory over "L'Insurgente", Truxtun received honors both at home and abroad. When accounts of the action reached London, Truxtun was fÃªted by the merchants there who sent him a piece of silver plate to commemorate his victory. In the United States, morale soared upon hearing of the first American victory over the French. Truxtun was cited by Stoddert for his excellent conduct during the action, and songs and poems such as "Brave Yankee Boys" were later written about the event. In contrast, when Barreaut returned to France he was accused of failing to put up sufficient resistance in the engagement and was given a court-martial. Despite the accusations, he had been praised by Truxtun after the action for his bravery and was acquitted during the court-martial. The French were infuriated upon hearing the results of the action because the two countries were not officially at war; Governor Edme Ãtienne Borne Desfourneaux of Guadeloupe demanded that "Insurgent" be returned to French control. Upon learning of the American refusal to repatriate "Insurgent", Desfourneaux was outraged and ordered all American vessels and property to be seized, while also declaring that a state of war existed between the United States and Guadeloupe. After continuing their cruise for a few weeks, both "Insurgent" and "Constellation" were forced to return to Norfolk by the end of March due to the expiration of the terms of enlistment of their crews. On her next cruise "Constellation" prevailed in another action against "La Vengeance", although her own casualties were heavy this time, and that French frigate escaped "L'Insurgente"s fate.
