The utilization of water as a coolant raised the issue of consumption and oxidation of the aluminum tubing. The Metallurgical Laboratory tried different added substances to the water to decide their impact. It was discovered that erosion was limited when the water was somewhat acidic, so weaken sulfuric corrosive was added to the water to give it a pH of 6.5. Different added substances, for example, sodium silicate, sodium dichromate and oxalic corrosive were likewise acquainted with the water to keep a development of film that could hinder the flow of the cooling water. The fuel slugs were given a coat of aluminum to shield the uranium metal from erosion that would happen on the off chance that it came into contact with the water, and to keep the venting of vaporous radioactive parting items that may be shaped when they were illuminated. Aluminum was picked in light of the fact that the cladding needed to transmit heat however not retain an excessive number of neutrons. The aluminum canning process was given close consideration, as cracked slugs could stick or harm the diverts in the reactor, and the littlest gaps could vent radioactive gases. The Metallurgical Laboratory examined generation and testing routines for the canning procedure.
