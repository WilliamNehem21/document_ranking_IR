In steeply mountainous areas such as parts of Spain, South Africa and the Carpathian Mountains it nests on cliffs, on large boulders, in caves and under overhanging ledges. The black stork's solitary nests are usually at least 1Â km (0.6Â mi) apart, even where the species is numerous. Although newly constructed nests may be significantly smaller, older nests can be in diameter. In southern Africa, the black stork may occupy the nests of other bird species such asÂ hamerkop ("Scopus umbretta")Â or Verreaux's eagle ("Aquila verreauxi") and commonly reuses them in successive years. They are repaired with earth and grass, and lined with leaves, moss, grass, animal fur, paper, clay and rags. In a clutch, there are two to five, or rarely even six large oval grey-white eggs, which become soiled during incubation. They can be long and wide, averaging about in length and in width.Â The eggs are laid with an interval of two days. Hatching is asynchronous, and takes place at the end of May. IncubationÂ takes 32 to 38 days,Â with both sexes sharing duties, which commence after the first or second egg is laid. The young start flying by the end of July. Fledging takes 60 to 71 days, after which the young joins the adults at their feeding grounds. However, for another 2 weeks, the young continue to return to the nest, to be fed and to roost at night.
