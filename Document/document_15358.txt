When captain GarcÃ­a de Paredes unexpectedly returned to Campeche in early May 1695, governor MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa was already preparing reinforcements for his expedition. With GarcÃ­a's arrival, he was immediately allocated the extra soldiers. On 11 May UrsÃºa ordered GarcÃ­a to begin a second expedition southwards and was allotted 100 salaried Maya to accompany him. These workers were to be paid three pesos per month and received a suspension of their obligations to supply "encomienda" work and tribute. GarcÃ­a paid for additional Spanish soldiers from his own funds, as did JosÃ© FernÃ¡ndez de Estenos, a Campeche resident who was to serve as second-in-command. The final force numbered 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers; the final tally was more than 400 people, which was regarded as a considerable army in the impoverished YucatÃ¡n province. UrsÃºa also ordered two companies of Maya musketeers from TekÊ¼ax and OxkÊ¼utzkabÊ¼ to join the expedition at BÊ¼olonchÊ¼en Kawich, some southeast of the city of Campeche. Bonifacio Us was captain of the TekÊ¼ax company; Diego Uk was that of the OxkÊ¼utzkabÊ¼ company. Marcos Pot was overall "cacique captain" of these two Maya companies; all three officers were Maya. A Maya company from SajkabÊ¼chen served as elite musketeers charged with rounding up forest Maya into the "reducciones"; this company was excused from heavy labour duties. Non-Maya soldiers were a mix of Spanish, mestizos (mixed race Spanish and native) and mulattos (mixed race Spanish and black).
