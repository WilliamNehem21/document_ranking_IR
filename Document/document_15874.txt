The acting of the main cast was conflictingly received. Lloyd Miller of the "St. Petersburg Times" said the characters "return to their original roles with a vigor and wit unseen in earlier episodes of the film series". Rob Salem of "The Toronto Star" quipped that though the actors looked silly on occasion, this was a benefit; "as their capacity for action has diminished, their comedic talents have blossomed [...] they have all become masters of self-deprecating self-parody." "The Boston Globe"s Matthew Gilbert called the actors' performances "photocopies" of previous films: "Shatner and Nimoy are respectable, but lack energy. There's nowhere else to go with their roles, and they know it. DeForest Kelley is oddly out of it." Plummer and Warner's portrayals of their Klingon characters were well-received; Maslin commented that "whenever a skilled actor [...] manages to emerge from behind all this [makeup] with his personality intact, it's a notable accomplishment." The other supporting characters received similar praise; H.J. Kirchhoff, writing for "The Globe and Mail", said that the guest stars joined the "family fun" of the film as "zesty, exotic and colorful good guys and bad guys". A "Cinefantastique" retrospective review considered the film to have the finest guest stars ever assembled for a "Star Trek" film.
