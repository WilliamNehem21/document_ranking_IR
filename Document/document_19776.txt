"Coprinellus micaeus" was illustrated in a woodcut by the 16th-century botanist Carolus Clusius in what is arguably the first published monograph on fungi, the 1601 "Rariorum plantarum historia. Fungorum in Pannoniis observatorum brevis historia" (History of rare plants. Brief history of fungi observed in Pannonia [Hungary]). Clusius erroneously believed the species to be poisonous, and classified it as a genus of "Fungi perniciales" (harmful fungi). The species was first described scientifically by French botanist Jean Baptiste FranÃ§ois Pierre Bulliard in 1786 as "Agaricus micaceus" in his work "Herbier de la France". In 1801, Christian Hendrik Persoon grouped together all of the gilled fungi that auto-digested ("deliquesced") during spore discharge into the section "Coprinus" of the genus "Agaricus". Elias Magnus Fries later raised Persoon's section "Coprinus" to genus rank in his "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici", and the species became known as "Coprinus micaceus". It was the type species of subsection "Exannulati" in section "Micacei" of the genus "Coprinus", a grouping of related taxa with veils made of sphaerocysts (round swollen cells usually formed in clusters) exclusively or with thin-filamentous connective hyphae intermixed. Molecular studies published in the 1990s demonstrated that many of the coprinoid ("Coprinus"-like) mushrooms were in fact unrelated to each other. This culminated in a 2001 revision of the genus "Coprinus", which was split into four genera; "C.Â micaeus" was transferred to "Coprinellus".
