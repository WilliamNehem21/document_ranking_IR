A Tulsa-zone administrator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) remarked upon ecological issues relating to the Creek Turnpike in a 19-page letter to the U.S. Armed force Corps of Engineers dated February 9, 1990. USACE was in charge of issuing three fundamental grants (which OTA had connected for on November 6, 1989) that would enable development to proceed, and was required to think about contribution from the administration. In the letter, manager Stephen Forsythe suggested that the licenses be denied and further investigations led into backup ways to go for the expressway and the ecological effect on streets that associated with the freeway. In any case, USACE just had the expert to audit the effects the Creek Turnpike itself made on wetland territories. Senator Bellmon openly reprimanded Forsythe for concentrating on worries past USACE's ward. Bellmon's Transportation Secretary, Neal McCaleb, openly expressed "I think [Forsythe] is out of line[...] and would state so to Mr. Forsythe." Bellmon and McCaleb examined the letter in a private gathering with the Secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan, in spite of the fact that Lujan neither remarked nor focused on any activity in regards to the letter. In light of Bellmon's analysis of the letter, Tulsans Against Turnpikes issued an open proclamation, saying "Running behind shut political entryways like that shows the representative is an ecological poser," standing out his announcements from a letter he composed guaranteeing a constituent in Jenks that the venture would be "the most stylishly satisfying and naturally stable office that can be built".
