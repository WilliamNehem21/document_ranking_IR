The squadron finished its development to Goodenough Island on 26ÃÂ June and started flying air safeguard forays from that point as a major aspect of No.ÃÂ 73 Wing. It didn't capture any Japanese air ship while working from this base, be that as it may. The squadron moved to Kirwina Airfield on Kiriwina somewhere in the range of 9 and 18ÃÂ August, from where it worked close by the P-40 Kittyhawk-prepared No.ÃÂ 76 Squadron. This was the nearest Allied landing strip to the significant Japanese base at Rabaul and was relied upon to be consistently assaulted. No Japanese attacks were made on the landing strip amid the primary long stretches of the squadron's sending there, be that as it may, and its pilots were frustrated to not see battle while directing watches in help of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) assaults on Rabaul. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) started a progression of assaults on Goodenough Island and Kiriwina toward the beginning of October, be that as it may, and the squadron asserted its first triumph in 31ÃÂ October when one of its Spitfires shot down a Kawasaki Ki-61 contender north of Kiriwina (this kind of air ship was marked the "Tony" by the Allies).
