The 1894-S Barber dime is one of the incredible numismatic rarities, with a distributed mintage of 24 proof pieces. Different stories go to the subject of in what way few came to be begat. As per Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for "The Numismatist", the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 expected to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the softening of destroyed coins, sufficiently only to coin 24 dimes. Increasingly ten-penny pieces were relied upon to be struck there later in the year, however this did not happen. Breen, then again, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a gathering of broker companions, offering three to each. He additionally offered three to his young little girl Hallie, advising her to hold them until she was as old as he seemed to be, and she would most likely offer them at a decent cost. As indicated by the story, she burned through one on a dish of frozen yogurt, yet kept the other two until 1954. One of the roughly nine realized dimes was recovered from flow in 1957, and Breen guessed this may have been the dessert example. One sold for $1,552,500 at sale in 2007.
