The Boulonnais was before a prominent workhorse in France, with an expected populace of more than 600,000 in the mid 1900s. World War I and World War II nearly devastated the breed, as its home region saw overwhelming battle in the two wars and the groups of broodmares were dispersed. Between World War II and the 1970s, the breed nearly wound up wiped out, and just a couple of reproducers kept it alive. During the 1970s, it ended up prevalent for steed meat, and customers believed it to be probably the best meat accessible. In any case, by this point, there were less than 1,000 horses remaining. Amid the mid-twentieth century, the stallions FrÃÂ©thun (foaled in 1949), Select (1962), TrÃÂ©sor (1963), AstÃÂ©rix (1966) and Prince (1981) impacted the breed, despite the fact that this added to the issue of inbreeding. FrÃÂ©thun qualities are found in 14 percent of the families of Boulonnais living today. In the mid 1970s, Henry Blanc, the recently named executive of the French National Stud, recommended that nine draft horse breeds, including the Boulonnais, be recategorized from dismantling steeds to meat ponies. Whenever established, this recategorization saved the quality pool of the Boulonnais by empowering rearing, yet it additionally changed its basic role, bringing about an emotional weight increment by the 1980s.
