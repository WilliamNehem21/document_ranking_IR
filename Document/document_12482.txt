The thirteenth Airborne Division was the fifth airborne division to be framed in the United States amid World War II, and was authoritatively initiated on Friday the thirteenth of August 1943 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, under the order of Major General George W. Griner, Jr. Just a couple of months after the actuation of the division, be that as it may, Major General Griner was requested to assume responsibility for the 98th Infantry Division, and was supplanted by Major General Elbridge Chapman, who might proceed to order the division for the remainder of the contention. Chapman was one of the early pioneers of the American airborne idea, directing the test 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion in late 1941 when he was a lieutenant colonel, before proceeding to assume responsibility for the thirteenth Airborne Division. The 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion would be renamed as the 88th Airborne Infantry Regiment, and after that at long last become the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment on 21 September 1942, shaping the center of the thirteenth Airborne Division. When it was initiated, the thirteenth Airborne Division was at first made out of the 515th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment and the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment.
