Teacher Michael Hicks, a Richard III master, has been especially reproachful of the utilization of the mitochondrial DNA to contend that the body is Richard III's, expressing that "any male sharing a maternal ancestress in the immediate female line could qualify". He likewise reprimands the dismissal by the Leicester group of the Y chromosome proof, recommending that it was not worthy to the Leicester group to reason that the skeleton was anybody other than Richard III. He contends that based on the present logical proof "recognizable proof with Richard III is more far-fetched than likely". In any case, Hicks himself attracts regard for the contemporary view held by some that Richard III's granddad, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, was the result of an ill-conceived joining between Cambridge's mom Isabella of Castile (a knave girl of Pedro the Cruel of Castile) and John Holland (brother by marriage of Henry IV of England), as opposed to Edmund of Langley, first Duke of York (Edward III's fourth child). On the off chance that that was the situation, at that point the Y chromosome disparity with the Beaufort line would be clarified however clearly still neglect to demonstrate the personality of the body. Hicks proposes elective applicants plunged from Richard III's maternal ancestress for the body (for example Thomas Percy, first Baron Egremont, and John de la Pole, first Earl of Lincoln) however does not give proof to help his recommendations. Philippa Langley discredits Hicks' contention in light of the fact that he doesn't consider all the proof.
