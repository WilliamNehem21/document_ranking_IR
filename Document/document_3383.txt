The Dan (Ã¦ÂÂ¦) alludes to any female job in Beijing musical show. Dan jobs were initially separated into five subtypes. Elderly people ladies were played by "laodan", military ladies were "wudan", youthful female warriors were "daomadan", temperate and world class ladies were "qingyi", and vivacious and unmarried ladies were "huadan". One of Mei Lanfang's most essential commitments to Beijing musical show was in spearheading a 6th kind of job, the "huashan". This job type consolidates the status of the "qingyi" with the arousing quality of the "huadan". A troupe will have a youthful Dan to assume primary jobs, just as a more seasoned Dan for auxiliary parts. Four instances of well known Dans are Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng. In the early long periods of Beijing musical show, all Dan jobs were played by men. Wei Changsheng, a male Dan entertainer in the Qing court, built up the "cai ciao", or "false foot" procedure, to reenact the bound feet of ladies and the trademark walk that came about because of the training. The restriction on female entertainers likewise prompted a dubious type of whorehouse, known as the "xianggong tangzi", in which men paid to engage in sexual relations with young men dressed as females. Amusingly, the performing aptitudes instructed to the young people utilized in these houses of ill-repute drove a significant number of them to end up proficient Dan further down the road.
