In May 1937 Birkett was delegated Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee for Abortion set up by the Minister of Health and Home Secretary, setting up a report "to ask into the commonness of fetus removal, and the law relating thereto, and to think about what steps can be taken by increasingly powerful implementation of the law", something which involved him for a long time. Amid the late spring of 1937, Birkett was approached to speak to the English Bar at the yearly gathering of the Canadian Bar Association in Toronto, where he was a prominent speaker. In January 1938, he was solicited to go about as a Commissioner from Assize to open the Assize Court in Aylesbury, managing a normal of ten cases every day. After the episode of World War II in 1939, he turned into an individual from a board of trustees prompting the Home Secretary on the detainment of suspected foe operators. The advisory group managed in excess of 1,500 cases in two years. In spite of the fact that the work was unpaid, he was knighted (as a knight lone wolf) on 6 June 1941 as a reward for his work. He likewise conveyed week after week radio communicates after the Friday night news to counter the communicates of William Joyce, known as Lord Haw. The main communicate occurred on 9 February 1940, and they were viewed as a spirit support amid the purported Phony War.
