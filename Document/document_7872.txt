Howarth said essayists run with an unmistakable paradigm while making cleanser musical drama characters. Essayist Jennifer Hayward felt the equivalent, expressing that like nineteenth century acting and serials, cleanser musical shows draw on amazing models. Essayist Dianne L. Creeks expresses that the storyline fits in with a considerable lot of similar traditions of how assault has been exhibited in cleanser musical shows. As per Hayward, the "OLTL" essayists "had a tremendous time outdoors up Todd as the epitome of abhorrence". She said that the scholars who made Todd's first significant storyline, the assault of Marty Saybrooke and its result, treated assault like most cleanser musical dramas had done previously, by utilizing originals, for example, the battle among great and underhanded and the difference between the frail and solid. Creator Gerry Waggett stated, "The nearby ups of the attackers' appearances amid the strike, contorted to catch Marty's terrified and intoxicated point of view, rank among the show's most realistic pictures." An endeavor was made to sensationalize the assault and present it uniquely in contrast to the run of the mill voyeuristic viewpoint, and the scenes were intended to exasperate the gathering of people. Waggett included: "Marty's ensuing mission to convey her attackers to equity ruled the show" all through the mid year of 1993.
