Experiencing childhood in eastern Sydney, Windle was prepared by Frank Guthrie from the age of 12. Windle's first significant swimming challenge was the 1960 Australian Championships. Matured 15, his second-place complete in the 1650ÃÂ yd free-form earned him a spot in the group for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Be that as it may, the Australian mentors just took him along to pick up involvement and he didn't contend. He won his first national title in 1961Ã¢ÂÂthe 1650ÃÂ yd free-formÃ¢ÂÂand guaranteed the 220Ã¢ÂÂ 440Ã¢ÂÂ 1650ÃÂ yd treble in 1962. Windle made his universal introduction at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, winning gold in the 4ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 220ÃÂ yd free-form and silver and bronze in the 1650 and 440ÃÂ yd free-form individually. In 1963, he won four individual national titles, adding the 880ÃÂ yd occasion to the fruitful resistance of his three titles. He won three individual titles in 1964 and continued to the Tokyo Olympics where he was killed in the warms of the 400ÃÂ m free-form in the wake of endeavoring to spare vitality for the last. Accordingly, Windle adopted a forceful strategy in the 1500ÃÂ m and set Olympic records in the warms and last to win gold. He included a bronze in the 4ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 100ÃÂ m free-form transfer.
