Michigan got the ball first, with Mike Massey restoring the Julian Rauch kick to the Michigan 33-yard line. Michigan picked up a first down in the wake of changing over a third and one with a three-yard kept running by Mike Hart. Chad Henne then finished a 18-yard go to Massey, trailed by a 33-yard surge from Hart, pushing Michigan to the four-yard line of Appalachian State. Hart at that point ran the ball in for a touchdown, and the resulting additional point made the score 7Ã¢ÂÂ 0. Appalachian State's CoCo Hillary took the kickoff to the 26-yard line of the Mountaineers. After the Mountaineers opened with a keep running for no addition and a six-yard finishing, Armanti Edwards finished a 68-yard touchdown go to Dexter Jackson. The additional point was changed over, tying the score at 7Ã¢ÂÂ 7. The accompanying two drives brought about three-and-outs for the two groups, yet after a Mountaineer punt left limits at the Michigan 48-yard line, the Wolverines mounted a ten-play, 52-yard drive finishing in a ten-yard touchdown go from Henne to Greg Matthews. The additional point gave Michigan a 14Ã¢ÂÂ 7 lead. Appalachian State began their drive with 3:09 left in the quarter at their own 35-yard line, finishing nine plays and heading to the Michigan 36ÃÂ yard-line before the finish of the quarter.
