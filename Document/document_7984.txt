Subsequent to losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Christian, Randy Orton was allowed a rematch at SummerSlam, where he won a No Holds Barred match to win the title. In the interim, in the storyline, Mark Henry proceeded to pound Kane and Vladimir Kozlov's lower legs with steel seats. He crushed Orton at Night of Champions in September to wind up World Heavyweight Champion out of the blue. Enormous Show came back from damage in October 2011 to quarrel with Henry over his title. Daniel Bryan at first announced that he would just trade out his Money in the Bank contract for a World Heavyweight Championship coordinate at WrestleMania XXVIII. Nonetheless, on the November 25 scene of "SmackDown", Bryan traded out the folder case after Henry had been thumped out by Big Show to turn into the World Heavyweight Champion. The match was voided by General Manager Theodore Long as Henry was not medicinally cleared to contend, and the folder case was come back to Bryan. At WWE's PPV in December 2011, Henry lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Big Show. After the match, Henry attacked Big Show which enabled Bryan to trade out his agreement and stick Big Show to win the title. Bryan clutched his title sufficiently long to have a World Heavyweight Championship coordinate at WrestleMania XXVIII in April 2012, where he lost his title to Sheamus.
