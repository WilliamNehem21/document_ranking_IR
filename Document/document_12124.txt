Throughout the day the pursuit proceeded: at 12:00 the French armada were around removed, and all through the evening the British ships gradually picked up on their rivals, the two sides hampered by significant lots of quiet climate. To guarantee that his armada was in a situation to catch the French whichever tack they took, Bridport split his armada over a wide front, bunched in two trailing gatherings. At 19:00, Bridport motioned for his boats to assault the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to assault French ships as and when they updated them, taking up commonly steady positions. At 22:30 a quiet fell, capturing the two armadas until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was sufficient to enable Bridport's armada to push onwards so that as sunrise rose the French were dead ahead. The primary body of the French armada was cruising in a free group with three or four boats trailing behind and one ship, "Alexandre" under Captain FranÃÂ§ois Charles Guillemet far to the back and just from the British vanguard. "Alexandre" had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been caught in a sharp commitment with a French squadron in which the ship had been severely harmed. The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was intensified by poor taking care of by Guillemet who did not pursue Villaret's requests to frame a line of fight quickly enough.
