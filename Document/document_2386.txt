The definitive year in the war was 917. In April Edward constructed a fortress at Towcester as a protection against the Danes of Northampton, and another at a unidentified spot called Wigingamere. The Danes propelled ineffective assaults on Towcester, Bedford and Wigingamere, while ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d caught Derby, demonstrating the estimation of the English protective measures, which were helped by disunity and an absence of coordination among the Viking armed forces. The Danes had fabricated their own fortification at Tempsford in Bedfordshire, yet toward the finish of the mid year the English raged it and executed the last Danish ruler of East Anglia. The English at that point took Colchester, in spite of the fact that they didn't endeavor to hold it. The Danes struck back by sending a huge armed force to lay attack to Maldon, yet the battalion held out until it was diminished and the withdrawing armed force was intensely crushed. Edward at that point came back to Towcester and fortified its stronghold with a stone divider, and the Danes of adjacent Northampton submitted to him. The armed forces of Cambridge and East Anglia likewise submitted, and before the year's over the main Danish armed forces as yet holding out were those of four of the Five Boroughs, Leicester, Stamford, Nottingham, and Lincoln.
