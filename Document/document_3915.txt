The musical drama starts with a military sounding toccata for trumpets which is rehashed twice. At the point when played on period wind instruments the sound can be surprising to present day groups of onlookers; Redlich calls it "breaking". Such twists were the standard flag for the initiation of exhibitions at the Mantuan court; the opening tune of Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers, likewise made for Gonzaga's court, utilizes a similar show. The toccata went about as a salute to the Duke; as per Donington, on the off chance that it had not been composed, point of reference would have expected it to be ad libbed. As the metal sound of the toccata blurs, it is supplanted by the gentler tone of the strings ritornello which presents La musica's introduction. The ritornello is rehashed in abbreviated structure between every one of the preface's five stanzas, and in full after the last refrain. Its capacity inside the musical show in general is to speak to the "intensity of music"; in that capacity it is heard toward the finish of act 2, and again toward the start of act 5, one of the most punctual instances of an operatic leitmotiv. It is transiently organized as a palindrome and its type of strophic varieties enables Monteverdi to deliberately shape melodic time for expressive and basic purposes with regards to "seconda prattica".
