Fineshriber succeeded Samfield in 1915. Conceived in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1878, his dad had been a Reform rabbi, who kicked the bucket at 37 years old. At the point when Fineshriber was 13, he moved to Cincinnati all alone, where he went to secondary school. In the wake of graduating, he went to the University of Cincinnati and entered HUC's eight-year program. By 1900 he had moved on from both and been appointed. He acknowledged his first lectern that year at Temple Emanuel in Davenport, Iowa, and joined Children of Israel in 1911 as partner rabbi. He was the synagogue's first HUC graduate, and its first American-conceived rabbi. He had a brisk mind, and had the capacity to talk persuasively and on the spur of the moment on practically any subject. Regularly cited in the papers, he was dynamic in the Memphis people group, and was a Rotarian, Shriner, and Freemason. He was additionally an early suffragist, and took up the reason at Children of Israel. At a 1913 ladies' day occasion, including speakers from Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, he was the main male speaker. At a 1914 rally he expressed "Tax imposition without any political benefit is tyrannyÃÂ ... [The] reason for this meetingÃÂ ... is to stun the general population of Memphis into an acknowledgment that the topic of equivalent suffrage isn't no problem."
