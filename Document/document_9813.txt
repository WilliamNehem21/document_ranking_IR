The report was one-sided in structure, portraying just what Lobengula would do to keep any of these conditions being broken. Shippard was questionable about this and the way that none of the "izinDuna" had marked the declaration, and inquired as to whether it is fitting to arrange another bargain. Robinson answered in the negative, thinking that reviving converses with Lobengula so before long would just make him suspicious. England's priests at Whitehall saw the one-sided character of the bargain as profitable for Britain, as it didn't submit Her Majesty's Government to a specific strategy. Ruler Salisbury, the British Prime Minister, decided that Moffat's arrangement bested Grobler's, in spite of being marked sometime in the not too distant future, in light of the fact that the London Convention of 1884 blocked the South African Republic from making bargains with any state separated from the Orange Free State; settlements with "local clans" north of the Limpopo were allowed, however the Prime Minister guaranteed that Matabeleland was excessively strongly sorted out to be viewed as a unimportant clan, and ought to rather be viewed as a country. He closed from this thinking the Grobler arrangement was "ultra vires" and lawfully good for nothing. Whitehall before long gave Robinson consent to confirm the Moffat understanding, which was reported to people in general in Cape Town on 25 April 1888.
