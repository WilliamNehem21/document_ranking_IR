Upon the resumption, Crapp started to quicken, hitting a sixÃ¢ÂÂwhich flew legitimately back over the bowler's head and over the sightscreenÃ¢ÂÂand three driven limits from the off turn of Ian Johnson. This was a glaring difference to Johnson's initial ten overs before lunch, which had yielded just seven runs. Crapp was anxious to utilize his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's conveyances, and therefore managed the turn decently serenely, though a significant number of his countrymen remained in their wrinkle and discovered issues substantially more troublesome. He at that point hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, however the catch was dropped. Notwithstanding, Crapp did not underwrite as Toshack surrendered just eight keeps running in a grouping of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall caught CrappÃ¢ÂÂwho did not offer a shotÃ¢ÂÂleg before wicket for 37; the batsman misconceived the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Tom Dollery came in and took a solitary to get off the imprint however then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This rejection reflected that of Washbrook's in that Dollery neglected to recognize Johnston's variety ball, and subsequently played for swing when there was none. Britain had lost two wickets for one raced to be 97/4. Skipper Norman Yardley came in and played the quick bowling of Lindwall and Johnston without any difficulty, withdrawing onto the back foot to enable himself more opportunity to play his shots. Edrich was struck on the hand and Yardley edged to Keith Miller in the slips cordon on the half-volley.
