In 1966, a second example of "Heterodontosaurus" (SAM-PK-K1332) was found at the Voyizane region, in the Elliot Formation of the Stormberg Group of shake arrangements, above ocean level, on Krommespruit Mountain. This example included both the skull and skeleton, saved in enunciation (for example the bones being saved in their normal position in connection to one another), with little uprooting and contortion of the bones. The postcranial skeleton was quickly portrayed by scientistss Albert Santa Luca, Crompton and Charig in 1976. Its forelimb bones had recently been examined and figured in an article by scientistss Peter Galton and Robert T. Bakker in 1974, as the example was viewed as huge in building up that Dinosauria was a monophyletic common gathering, while most researchers at the time, including the researchers who portrayed "Heterodontosaurus", imagined that the two fundamental requests Saurischia and Ornithischia were not straightforwardly related. The skeleton was completely depicted in 1980. SAM-PK-K1332 is the most total heterodontosaurid skeleton portrayed to date. Despite the fact that an increasingly point by point portrayal of the skull of "Heterodontosaurus" was for quite some time guaranteed, it stayed unpublished upon the passing of Charig in 1997. It was not until 2011 that the skull was completely portrayed by David B. Norman and associates.
