They connected and after that drove off the Danish boats, and afterward helped the "Melpomene" to wellbeing. She had been vigorously harmed and endured setbacks of five executed and twenty-nine injured. "Temeraire"s later Baltic administration included being dispatched to watch the Russian armada at Reval, amid which time she made a study of the island of Nargen.
