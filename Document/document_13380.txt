At the time it was named, the fossils of "Gallimimus" spoke to the most total and best protected ornithomimid material yet found, and the sort stays a standout amongst the best known individuals from the gathering. Ornithomimids were recently known principally from North America, "Archaeornithomimus" being the main earlier known part from Asia (however without a skull). Since the primary disclosures, more examples have been found by further Mongolian-drove global campaigns. Three of the "Gallimimus" skeletons (counting the holotype) later turned out to be a piece of a voyaging display of Mongolian dinosaur fossils, which visited different nations. Fossil poaching has turned into a significant issue in Mongolia in the 21st century, and a few "Gallimimus" examples have been plundered. In 2017, Hang-Jae Lee and partners detailed a fossil trackway found in 2009 related with a held "Gallimimus" foot (example MPC-D100F/17). The remainder of the skeleton seemed to have been expelled already by poachers, alongside a few other "Gallimimus" examples (as shown by void exhuming pits, refuse, and dissipated broken bones in the quarry). It is abnormal to discover tracks intently connected with body fossils; a portion of the tracks are reliable with ornithoimimid feet, while others have a place with various dinosaurs.
