Amid the First Continental Congress, Adams was now and again requested for his perspectives on government. While perceiving its significance, Adams had secretly scrutinized Thomas Paine's 1776 handout "Good judgment", which assaulted all types of government, even protected government of the sort pushed by John Locke. It upheld a unicameral lawmaking body and a feeble official chosen by the governing body. As indicated by Adams, the creator had "a superior hand at pulling down than structure." He trusted that the perspectives communicated in the flyer were "so democratical, with no limitation or even an endeavor at any harmony or counter balance, that it must deliver perplexity and each insidious work." What Paine supported was an extreme vote based system with the perspectives on the larger part neither checked nor counteracted. This was contrary with the arrangement of balanced governance that preservationists like Adams would execute. A few agents encouraged Adams to submit his perspectives to paper. He did as such in discrete letters to these partners. So awed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams' assent, he had the most exhaustive letter printed. Distributed namelessly in April 1776, it was titled "Considerations on Government" and styled as "a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend." Many history specialists concur that none of Adams' different organizations matched the suffering impact of this flyer.
