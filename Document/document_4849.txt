The body divider comprises of a flimsy fingernail skin, an epidermis comprising of a solitary layer of cells, a thick dermis framed of connective tissue and a meager coelomic myoepithelial layer, which gives the longitudinal and roundabout musculature. The dermis contains an endoskeleton of calcium carbonate segments known as ossicles. These are honeycombed structures made out of calcite microcrystals masterminded in a grid. They differ in structure, with some bearing outside granules, tubercles and spines, however most are unthinkable plates that fit perfectly together in a decorated way and structure the fundamental covering of the aboral surface. Some are particular structures, for example, the madreporite (the passageway to the water vascular framework), pedicellariae and paxillae. Pedicellariae are compound ossicles with forceps-like jaws. They expel trash from the body surface and wave around on adaptable stalks in light of physical or concoction upgrades while consistently making gnawing developments. They frequently structure bunches encompassing spines. Paxillae are umbrella-like structures found on starfish that live covered in dregs. The edges of adjoining paxillae meet to frame a bogus fingernail skin with a water cavity underneath in which the madreporite and sensitive gill structures are secured. Every one of the ossicles, including those anticipating remotely, are secured by the epidermal layer.
