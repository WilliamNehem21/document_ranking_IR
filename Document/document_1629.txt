Olivero before long feels burnt out on the main edge, and deserting SiloÃÂn he moves to the second, where he figures out how to cut and clean gems, the most consecrated of items in this underground world. In the end he is permitted to move to the most noteworthy edge of all, "the last phase of life". There he is instructed the "essential standards of the universe", that there is just Order and Disorder. "OrderÃÂ ... [is] the space-filling Mass about themÃÂ ... Confusion is vacant space". Turmoil is brought about by the faculties, which, "being kept to the bodyÃÂ ... make the figment of self-hood". Olivero chooses a cave in which to spend what survives from his life alone, mulling over the "common and outright magnificence" of the gems he acknowledges from the precious stone cutters. Sustenance and water is brought consistently, and he settles to the errand of setting up his body for "the flawlessness of death", which when it comes he meets with a "particular satisfaction". Expelling Olivero's body from the cave the chaperons experience another gathering conveying SiloÃÂn, who kicked the bucket in the meantime as Olivero. The pair are laid together in a petrifying trough, to "become some portion of a similar precious stone concordance", as is standard when any of the Green individuals pass on.
