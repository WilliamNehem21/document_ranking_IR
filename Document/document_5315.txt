OR229 was endorsed by the Operational Requirements Committee on 17 December 1946, and the Ministry of Supply conveyed letters welcoming tenders on 8 January 1947. Three aircraft came about because of OR229: the Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, known as the V planes. The high need agreed to the nuclear bomb program was not shared by the V aircraft program. Vickers was given the primary generation request for 25 Valiants on 9 February 1951, and they were conveyed on 8 February 1955. The Vulcan and Victor pursued, entering administration in 1956 and 1957 separately. Along these lines, when the main Blue Danube nuclear bombs were conveyed to the Bomber Command Armaments School at RAF Wittering on 7 and 11 November 1953, the RAF had no aircraft equipped for conveying them. Penney noticed that "the RAF has taken care of airplane for quite a while and can fly Valiants when they fall off the creation line. Be that as it may, the Royal Air Force has not yet dealt with nuclear weapons, in this way, we should get a few bombs to the RAF at the most punctual conceivable minute, so the taking care of and overhauling can be drilled and completely worked out." For the time being, the United Kingdom stayed subject to the American atomic umbrella.
