Trimmer is maybe most popular now for her judgment of fantasies, for example, the different interpretations of Charles Perrault's "Histoires ou Contes du Temps old fashioned" (1697). She detested fantasies since they embraced a nonsensical perspective on the world and accomplishment without work. Trimmer's perspective on fantasies, albeit regularly scorned by present day faultfinders, was across the board toward the finish of the eighteenth century, to a limited extent in light of the fact that most instructors acknowledged John Locke's hypothesis that the psyche was a "clean slate" and hence especially delicate to impressions right off the bat throughout everyday life. Trimmer was against fantasies that were not grounded in actuality and which would "energize an unregulated reasonableness" in the peruser. Without an appropriate good or an admonishing storyteller, fantasies could lead a peruser off track. Most importantly, she was worried about "unmediated", obscure, and unsupervised sentiments in the tyke peruser. One reason Trimmer trusted fantasies were risky was on the grounds that they drove tyke perusers into a dreamland where grown-ups couldn't pursue and control their introduction to hurtful encounters. She was similarly as astonished by the realistic representations included with some fantasy accumulations, whining that "little kids, whose minds are defenseless of each impression; and who from the vivacity of their creative energies are adept to change over into substances whatever persuasively strikes their extravagant" ought not be permitted to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his better half's head off.
