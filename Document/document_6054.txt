The band utilized the diverse rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on "Leave Music (For a Film)" include characteristic resonation accomplished by chronicle on a stone staircase, and "Let Down" was recorded in an assembly hall at 3 a.m. Disengagement enabled the band to work at an alternate pace, with increasingly adaptable and unconstrained working hours. O'Brien said that "the greatest weight was really finishing [the recording]. We weren't given any due dates and we had total opportunity to do what we needed. We were deferring it since we were somewhat alarmed of really completing stuff." Yorke was happy with the nature of the accounts made at the area, and delighted in working without sound detachment, implying that instruments were not overdubbed independently. O'Brien was comparatively satisfied with the chronicles, assessing that 80 percent of the collection was recorded live, and stated: "I abhor doing overdubs, on the grounds that it simply doesn't feel natural.ÃÂ ... Something uncommon happens when you're playing live; a ton of it is simply taking a gander at each other and knowing there are four other individuals getting it going." Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that in the event that he made different endeavors he would "begin to consider it and it would sound truly weak."
