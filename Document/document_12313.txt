The littlest honeyeater local to Australia, the red myzomela is a particular feathered creature with a smaller body, short tail and moderately long down-bended dark bill and dull darker iris. It is between long, with a normal wingspan of and a weight of . It has generally long wings for its size; when the wings are collapsed, the longest essential quills reach over a large portion of the length of the tail. It displays sexual dimorphism, with the male significantly more splendidly shaded than the female. The grown-up male has a brilliant (red) head, scruff and upper bosom, with a limited dark stripe from bill to eye and a slim bruised eye-ring. The red plumage reaches out as a focal stripe down the back and backside. On its bosom, the red turns out to be increasingly mottled with dim towards the stomach and flanks, which are dark white. The sides of the bosom are darker dark. The mantle and scapulars are dark and the upperwing a dull dark, with white edges to the optional secretive quills. The tail is dark above and dull dim underneath. The underwing is white with a dim dark trailing edge and tip. The female has a dark colored head and neck, darker on top and lighter and greyer on the sides, with a pale dim darker throat and jaw. It once in a while has pinkish or ruddy fixes on the temple, throat and cheeks. The upperparts are dark colored, some of the time with red fixes on the uppertail coverts. The tail is blackish-dark colored with yellow edges to everything except the focal pair of retrices. The wings are blackish-dark colored. The female has a yellowish or tanish base to its dark bill. Shedding happens over spring and summer.
