In 2007, it was uncovered that criminological master Philip Van Praag had investigated an audiotape of the shooting known as the Pruszynski recording in which Van Praag had found acoustic proof that a second weapon had been engaged with the death. Van Praag found that 13ÃÂ shots were discharged despite the fact that Sirhan's weapon held just eight adjusts, its most extreme shot limit, and Sirhan had no chance to reload it. Van Praag states the chronicle likewise uncovers somewhere around two situations where the planning between shots was shorter than physically conceivable from Sirhan's weapon alone. Criminological sound pros Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena inspected Van Praag's discoveries and certified the nearness of in excess of eight discharges on the tape alongside over-lapping shots, the majority of this showing the nearness of a second shooter. Comparable support originated from scientific sound and ballistics master Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen and sound authority Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Other acoustic specialists, notwithstanding, have guaranteed that they could locate close to eight shots recorded on the audiotape. The Pruszynski recording was revealed in 2004 by CNN's Brad Johnson; its reality had been obscure to the overall population already.
