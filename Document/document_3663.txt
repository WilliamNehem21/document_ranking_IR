Early proof of benevolent relations among Charlemagne and Offa is tempered by indications of strain. Charlemagne protected two outcasts from England at his court: Odberht of Kent (most likely Eadberht Praen) and Egbert of Wessex. Eadberht Praen ruled the Kingdom of Kent for a brief timeframe after Offa's passing, yet was dismissed by Coenwulf. Egbert was progressively fruitful, taking and holding the royal position of Wessex in 802. Plainly Mercian and Frankish interests couldn't generally be accommodated and Frankish approach at that point moved towards help for Offa's adversaries. To Charlemagne this essentially implied Northumbria: as per Patrick Wormald, "Charlemagne ... considered England to be on the off chance that it were managed by two lords just: ÃÂthelred administering Northumbria and Offa administering everything toward the south". Frankish help for Northumbria along these lines seems to have been driven by a craving to counter Mercian impact in southern Britain, a region with long-standing connections to Francia. It has likewise been proposed that Charlemagne's enthusiasm for Northumbria was roused by a longing for co-task against Viking marauders, who had first showed up in Northumbria in the mid 790s. On the other hand it might be that Charlemagne's origination of the circle of his power included Britain, which had once been a piece of the Roman Empire.
