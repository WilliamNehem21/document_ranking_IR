In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki thought about contrasts in spore attributes: species in the sort "Cantharellus" were not known to have spores that were subglobose (generally circular) and tuberculate (secured with mole like projections) like "Polyozellus"; in any case, these spore qualities were regular in species in the Thelephoraceae family ("Cantharellus" has a place in an alternate family, the Cantharellaceae). Different qualities connecting the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae incorporated the dull shading, the solid scent (particularly in dried examples), and the nearness of thelephoric corrosive, a mushroom color basic in the family. Taken together, these variables drove Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae. The recommended family-level taxonomical change was not acknowledged by different creators; for instance, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it "Thelephora multiplex". Starting at 2009, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list "Polyozellus" as being inside the Thelephoraceae family, a gathering of mushrooms ordinarily known as the rough earthfans. The family name is gotten from the Greek "poly" signifying "many", and "oz", signifying "branch". The particular appellation "multiplex" signifies "in numerous pieces", alluding to the compound idea of the natural product body. Basic names for this species incorporate the blue chanterelle and the grouped blue chanterelle. In Alaska, where examples ordinarily have dim hued natural product bodies, it is known as the dark chanterelle, in spite of the fact that this name is imparted to some "Craterellus" species.
