The principal half of the arrangement shifts back and forth between the two leads. Madlax is a standout amongst the most effective special forces operators for contract in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret Burton is a languid, awkward amnesiac living in Nafrece, a nation styled after France. At the point when an "image book", probably given to Margaret by her late dad, pulls in the consideration of universal criminal system Enfant, she finds that the birthplaces of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top employable, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down however tips off his bosses off course, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant inconvenience for quite a while. In the interim, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's previous guide whose guardians kicked the bucket as a result of Gazth-Sonikan war, finds that her present business, Bookwald Industries, secretively underpins the war by providing the two sides with guns and begins researching its actual reason. Her examination conveys her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is procured as her guardian, and together, they reveal information that demonstrates that Enfant organized the whole clash. Enfant in the end captures them and they are constrained into covering up. Back in Nafrece, Margaret chooses to support Vanessa and goes to Gazth-Sonika, joined by her committed and now and again overprotective house keeper Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon.
