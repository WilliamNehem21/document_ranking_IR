In the second 50% of the 1950s Gielgud's profession was in the doldrums to the extent new plays were concerned. English auditorium was moving far from the West End charm of Beaumont's preparations to more "" works. Olivier had an extraordinary achievement in John Osborne's "The Entertainer" in 1957, yet Gielgud was not tuned in to the new flood of authors. He stayed sought after as a Shakespearean, yet there were not many new plays appropriate for him. He coordinated and played the lead in Coward's "Naked with Violin" in 1956, which was expelled by the pundits as out-dated, however it kept running for over a year. He showed up, playing an appearance parody scene with Coward as a forthcoming servant in Michael Anderson's "Around the globe in 80 Days" (1956), and as the dad of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Sidney Franklin's 1957 revamp of "The Barretts of Wimpole Street". He didn't consider his execution as the domineering dad persuading, and admitted that he attempted it just for the extensive expense ("it will set me up for two or three years") and to keep him before people in general in America, where he had not performed for more than four years.
