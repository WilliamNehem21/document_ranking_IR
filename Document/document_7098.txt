At the point when white travelers initially entered the zone in the late eighteenth century, maybe a thousand Native American Skagits lived in the recreation center and encompassing territories. Living for the most part toward the west of the recreation center close Puget Sound, the Skagits lived in settlements, winnowing their necessities from the conduits and going by kayak. Skagits framed a free confederation of clans that assembled whenever undermined by outside clans, for example, the Haidas, who lived toward the north. They raised huge houses or cabins that could house different families, each with their very own divided territory and passage. The cabins were long and in width, and the rooftops were shed-styles, with a solitary pitch; structures worked by other Puget Sound clans normally had peak rooftops with more than one pitch. The Skagits were by and large lowlanders, who just wandered into the North Cascades amid the late spring months, and structures in the mountains were progressively unassuming, comprising for the most part of transitory structures raised with shafts and secured with branches. The Skagits raised chain of commands and took part in potlatch services, like the Haidas, however with less unpredictability and indulgence. By 1910, just around 56 Skagits stayed in the locale, yet their numbers have since bounced back to a few hundred.
