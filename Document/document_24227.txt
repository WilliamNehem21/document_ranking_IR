In a series of potto ("Perodicticus potto") skeletons in the collections of the Anthropological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich at Irchel, anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz recognized two specimens with traits he believed distinct from all pottos, and in 1996 he used these two specimens to describe a new genus and species of primate, "Pseudopotto martini". The generic name, "Pseudopotto", combines the element "pseudo-" (Greek for "false") with "potto", referring to superficial similarities between the new form and the potto. The specific name, "martini", honors primatologist Robert D. Martin. The exact provenance of the two specimens is unknown, and one is represented by a complete skeleton (but no skin) and the other by a skull only. Schwartz placed both specimens in a single species, but noted that further study might indicate that the two represent distinct species. He thought the relationships of the new form were unknown and difficult to assess and did not assign it to any family, but provisionally placed it closest to the family Lorisidae, together with the potto, the angwantibos, and the lorises. The discovery, published in the "Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History", was featured in "Scientific American" and "Science"; the "Science" account noted that Schwartz thought "Pseudopotto" may represent a new family of primates.
