Upon "Ninja Gaiden"s North American release, Nintendo of America, whose play-testers liked the game and gave it high ratings, decided to help with its marketing. Nintendo's house organ "Nintendo Power" featured it prominently. According to Criona, it did not take a lot of effort to market the game through the magazine, nor did Tecmo or Nintendo do much else to promote it. "Ninja Gaiden" received strong publicity in "Nintendo Power" in 1989 and 1990. "Ninja Gaiden" received preview coverage in the JanuaryâFebruary 1989 issue of "Nintendo Power" in its "Pak Watch" section. It "got the highest marks of any title ... [the magazine's staff had] seen in a long time". It was expected to be No. 1 on their "Player's Poll" quickly. The preview compared Ryu's ability to climb and spring off walls to the gameplay in "Metroid". It was featured on the cover of the magazine's MarchâApril 1989 issue and was referenced in the following issue in a "Howard and Nester" comic strip. It was one of the featured games in both MarchâApril and MayâJune 1989 issues of the magazine; both issues included a walkthrough up to the fifth Act, a review, and a plot overview. Underlining the game's difficulty, it appeared in several issues in the magazine's "Counselor's Corner" and "Classified Information" help sections.
