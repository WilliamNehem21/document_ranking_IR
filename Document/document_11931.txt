Nirvana needed to do additionally chip away at the recorded tracks, and considered working with maker Scott Litt and remixing a few tracks with Andy Wallace (who had blended "Don't worry about it"). Albini intensely deviated, and asserted he had a concurrence with the band that it would not change the tracks without his association. Albini at first would not give the collection ace tapes to Gold Mountain, yet yielded after a telephone call from Novoselic. The band ruled against working with Wallace and decided to remix and expand the melodies "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993. Moreover, a remix of "Pennyroyal Tea" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) shows up on the blue-penciled Wal-Mart and Kmart variants of "In Utero"; this remix is likewise accessible on the band's 2002 best-of arrangement, "Nirvana", and is a similar blend that showed up on the single. One tune, "I Hate Myself and Want to Die", was overlooked from the last track posting as Cobain felt there were too much "clamor" tunes on the collection. The remainder of the collection was left unaltered beside a remastering which honed the low register guitar sound and expanded the volume of the vocals by around three decibels. Albini was condemning of the collection's last blend; he stated, "The final product, the record in the stores doesn't sound all that much like the record that was made. In spite of the fact that it's still them singing and playing their tunes, and its melodic nature still runs over."
