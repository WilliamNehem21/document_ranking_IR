Witton additionally communicated trust in further examination of thalassodromid motion. He noticed that since their appendage extents were like those of the better-examined azhdarchids, the state of their wings and style of flight may have been comparable. Thalassodromids may likewise have been adjusted for inland flight; their wings were short and expansive (not at all like the long, restricted wings of marine soarers), and were increasingly flexibility and less inclined to catch on hindrances. Their lower bear muscles seem to have been extended, which would have assisted with incredible (or visit) wing downstrokes and departure capacity. Despite the fact that it might have needed to make up for its expansive peak amid flight, its improvement late in development demonstrates that it didn't grow basically for streamlined features. Witton recommended that the relative similitude between the appendages of thalassodromids and azhdarchids additionally shows that their earthbound capacities would have been equivalent. Their appendages would have been able to do long walks, and their short, minimized feet would have made these mechanics proficient. The broadened shoulder muscles may have enabled them to quicken immediately when running, and they may have been as adjusted for development on the ground as has been recommended for azhdarchids; Witton forewarned that more examination of thalassodromids was expected to decide this.
