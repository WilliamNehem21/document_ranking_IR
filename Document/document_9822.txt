Albeit most scientists presently consider "Heterodontosaurus" a bipedal sprinter, some prior investigations proposed an incomplete or completely quadrupedal motion. In 1980, Santa Luca portrayed a few highlights of the forelimb that are likewise present in later quadrupedal creatures and infer a solid arm musculature: These incorporate an expansive olecranon (a hard distinction framing the highest piece of the ulna), amplifying the switch arm of the lower arm. The average epicondyle of the humerus was expanded, giving connection locales to solid flexor muscles of the lower arm. Besides, projections on the hooks may have expanded the forward pushed of the hand amid strolling. As indicated by Santa Luca, "Heterodontosaurus" was quadrupedal while moving gradually however had the capacity to change to an a lot quicker, bipedal run. Clean scientistss Teresa MaryaÃÂska and Halszka OsmÃÂ³lska bolstered Santa Luca's theory in 1985; moreover, they noticed that the dorsal spine was unequivocally flexed downwards in the most totally known example. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul proposed that "Heterodontosaurus" may have been compulsorily quadrupedal, and that these creatures would have jogged for quick headway. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 just as Norman and partners in 2004 contended for only bipedal headway, in view of the morphology of the hooks and shoulder support. The anatomical proof proposed by Santa Luca was distinguished as adjustments for scrounging; the powerful and solid arms may have been utilized for uncovering roots and tearing open bug homes.
