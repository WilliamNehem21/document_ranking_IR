The thrashing off the shoreline of Durazzo, however annihilating to Guiscard's armada, had perpetrated little harm to his military as most of it had landed before the fight in arrangement of the attack of Durazzo. In the coming months, Guiscard would regroup his powers and thrashing a substantial Byzantine armed force driven by Alexios I himself. In 1082, Guiscard took the city of Durazzo, and as the Venetian mariners were constrained out of the city and their boats emptied the harbor of Durazzo, the primary triumph by Venice against the Norman armada seemed only a transitory misfortune for the Normans. Because of the new exchange benefits and the way that for all intents and purposes no harm was exacted on the Venetians amid this attack, Selvo stayed prevalent in Venice. Then, Guiscard progressed quickly over the Balkan Peninsula, yet his walk was ended by a critical dispatch and a call for assistance from his most noteworthy partner, Pope Gregory VII. Guiscard reacted by coming back to Italy and walking on Rome to incidentally remove Henry IV, yet all the while, he lost practically every one of the regions he had picked up in the Balkans. Realizing that Guiscard was gone, in 1083, Selvo sent the Venetian armada to recover both Durazzo and the island of Corfu toward the south.
