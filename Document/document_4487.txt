Phillips helped the group win the 1895Ã¢ÂÂ 96 transitional dimension title of the Manitoba and Northwest Hockey Association. By 1899Ã¢ÂÂ 00 Phillips had joined the senior Thistles group, and would be named skipper the accompanying season, when they won the senior association title. Phillips quickly earned recognition for his continuance: in a period when players played the whole match and would frequently drift to monitor vitality, Phillips could play at a quick pace the whole diversion, with an after death paper report expressing that he "could play for a whole 60 [minutes] at full speed and be as crisp toward the end as he was toward the begin." His expertise was at that point obvious at the time, with the "Rodent Portage Miner" lauding him as one "of the best spread focuses in the west, being a quick shot, a high lifter and an overwhelming check." A forward when he joined the senior Thistles, Phillips played spread point for the 1900Ã¢ÂÂ 01 season, before moving to left wing in 1901Ã¢ÂÂ 02; he to a great extent stayed in that situation for the remainder of his vocation.
