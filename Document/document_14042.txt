The British squadron, of which "Levant" was part, was entrusted with disturbing French exchange through the Caribbean and chasing privateers. Anyway the frigate saw little activity in her initial a half year in the locale; French exchange had for all intents and purposes stopped since the flare-up of war with Britain, while a smallpox episode slaughtered some among "Levant"s team. It was not until mid 1760 that "Levant" crushed her first rival, a 14-weapon French privateer which was sunk with the loss of 120 of her group. From that point battle was increasingly visit. Two little privateers were caught in mid 1760 Ã¢ÂÂ the 8-firearm "Poissan Volante" and the 12-weapon "St Pierre" Ã¢ÂÂ and these vessels and their groups were conveyed into British care on the Leeward Islands. In June "Pickering", a British commercial vessel recently caught by the French, was retaken and cruised to Antigua as "Levant"s prize. A further triumph pursued on 29 June with the catch of French privateer "Le Scipio", after which "Levant" was put into harbor in Antigua for resupply. One contemporary source right now records her as conveying just 20 of her 28 weapons. She came back to ocean before the year's end, catching the privateer "L'Union" on 18 December.
