Nelson mounted a loose blockade of the combined fleet, keeping most of his fleet out of sight, but with a line of frigates and larger ships stationed at intervals between himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the combined fleet was observed to be putting to sea, and the signal was passed down the line of ships. William Pryce Cumby, "Bellerophon"s first lieutenant, was first in the main fleet to spot the signal, flying from the last ship in the communication link, HMS "Mars". The British began to pursue the combined fleet as it made its way towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in sight of it on the morning of 21 October. The officer and sailors of "Bellerophon" prepared for battle, some of the gun crews chalking the words "Victory or Death" on their gun barrels. At 11 am "Bellerophon"s signal midshipman, John Franklin, noted that Nelson had hoisted the signal "England expects that every man will do his duty", and an hour and a half later "Bellerophon" entered the battle as the fifth ship in Collingwood's lee column. She was astern of the 80-gun HMS "Tonnant" and ahead of the 74-gun , with the 74-gun close by her port side.
