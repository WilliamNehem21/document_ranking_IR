During the 1770s, the French naturalist Comte de Buffon expressed that the dodo possessed both Mauritius and RÃÂ©union. It is misty why he included RÃÂ©union, however he additionally consolidated records about the Rodrigues solitaire and a third fowl ("oiseau de Nazareth", presently thought to be a dodo) under a similar area. The English naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland examined the old portrayals of the RÃÂ©union solitaire in his 1848 book "The Dodo and Its Kindred", and finished up it was particular from the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire. The Belgian researcher Edmond de SÃÂ©lys Longchamps authored the logical name "Apterornis solitarius" for the RÃÂ©union solitaire in 1848, evidently making it the sort types of the variety, in which he additionally included two other Mascarene winged creatures just known from contemporary records, the red rail and the RÃÂ©union swamphen. As the name "Apterornis" had just been utilized for an alternate feathered creature by the English scholar Richard Owen, and the other previous names were similarly invalid, Bonaparte authored the new binomial "Ornithaptera borbonica" in 1854 (Bourbon was the first French name for RÃÂ©union). In 1854, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel set the solitaire in indistinguishable variety from the dodo, and named it "Didus apterornis". He reestablished it carefully as indicated by contemporary records, which brought about an ibis or stork-like feathered creature rather than a dodo. As it was viewed as congeneric with the dodo, the RÃÂ©union solitaire was for quite some time accepted to likewise be an individual from the Dididae group of pigeons.
