The maturing Greer Stadium had never been intended to last longer than 30ÃÂ years, and was the subject of numerous remodels in the mid 2000s to fulfill least Triple-A guidelines. In 2003, the Sounds proposed another arena to be worked with a blend of open and private assets at the side of first Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (presently Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the previous site of the city's warm exchange vitality plant, focusing on an opening date in April 2006. Following two years of the Sounds campaigning for the new park and taking steps to leave town (either for suburbia or another city out and out), Mayor Bill Purcell consented to help fundamental designs for the arena on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council endorsed the new arena on February 7, 2006, due to some degree to the Sounds verifying development financing through a consortium of banks, maintaining a strategic distance from citizen cost. The office was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed scene was over and over pushed back, in the end to as late as April 2009. Be that as it may, the Sounds and private engineers Struever Brothers, Eccles, and Rouse were unfit to finish financing and configuration plans for the new arena by the April 15, 2007, due date set by the Metro Council. Thus, the First Tennessee Field development venture was dropped and the Sounds stayed at Greer with a questionable future.
