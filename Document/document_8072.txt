By the mid-1870s the moderate speed of the Aveling and Porter trains and their untrustworthiness and powerlessness to deal with substantial burdens were perceived as serious issues for the Tramway. In 1874 Ferdinand de Rothschild purchased a site close to the Tramway's Waddesdon station to use as a site for his nation chateau of Waddesdon Manor. The Tramway's administration perceived that the development works would prompt a huge increment in the haulage of substantial products, and that the Aveling and Porter motors would be unfit to adapt to the expanded burdens. The recently settled designing firm of W. G. Bagnall kept in touch with the Duke offering to procure a train to him for preliminaries. The offer was acknowledged, and on 18 December 1876 the train was conveyed. The tests were commonly fruitful and a request was put to purchase a train from Bagnall for ÃÂ£640 (about ÃÂ£ in 2019) which was conveyed on 28 December 1877. With trains currently pulled by the Bagnall train (the Kingswood branch by and large remained worked by ponies, and periodically by the Aveling and Porter motors), traffic levels before long rose. Milk traffic ascended from 40,000ÃÂ gallons conveyed in 1875 to 58,000ÃÂ gallons (260,000ÃÂ l; 70,000ÃÂ USÃÂ gal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway conveyed an aggregate of 20,994ÃÂ tons (21,331ÃÂ t) of merchandise. In mid 1877 the Tramway was appeared on "Bradshaw" maps out of the blue, and from May 1882 "Bradshaw" incorporated its timetable.
