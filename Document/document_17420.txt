The highway crosses the Grand River to the south of Paris, then passes over former HighwayÂ 2 as it enters Brantford. As it passes through Brantford, the highway angles southeast and passes beneath the northern leg of HighwayÂ 24 and then the Wayne Gretzky Parkway. The route exits the small city to the east and curves northeast shortly thereafter. It travels between Jerseyville Road and former HighwayÂ 2 to Ancaster, jogging to avoid cutting through Dunmark Lake. As the freeway enters Ancaster, it once again crosses former HighwayÂ 2 and dips through the southern side of the town.
East of Ancaster, the freeway passes through a short greenbelt, with Hamilton Golf and Country Club lying to the north. A divided segment of HighwayÂ 6 meets the freeway and continues concurrently with it through Hamilton; to the south, HighwayÂ 6 travels to John C. Munro International Airport, Caledonia, and Jarvis at HighwayÂ 3. Continuing east, HighwayÂ 403 and HighwayÂ 6 curve north into Hamilton and meet the Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway before abruptly turning to the east and descending the Niagara Escarpment. Scenic views of Hamilton, its harbour, and Lower Princess Falls are along this steep descent. At the bottom of the escarpment the highway travels through a narrow, heavily developed corridor alongside former HighwayÂ 8. It passes beneath multiple bridges in a depressed trench, eventually curving north at a sharp corner and passing beneath more bridges. This section features a reduced speed limit of as opposed to .
The highway returns to ground level alongside the Chedoke Creek, a now-channelized river from which the freeway may take its name.
