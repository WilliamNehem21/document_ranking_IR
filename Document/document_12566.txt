Following multi day of rest, on 7 December Frederick sent a large portion of his mounted force with Zieten, pursuing Charles' withdrawing armed force, presently making a beeline for KÃÂ¶niggrÃÂ¤tz by Schweidnitz; they caught another 2,000 men and things. With the remainder of his military, Frederick walked on Breslau. By pursuing Charles' military into Bohemia, the Prussians ensured the confinement of the Allied army holding Breslau. The Austrian general left in direction of the city, Lieutenant Field Marshal Salman Sprecher von Bernegg, had a consolidated power of French and Austrian men, 17,000 in number. Breslau itself was a very much invigorated city of dividers and channels. The Austrians were resolved to hold Breslau, not just in light of the fact that losing it would cost them control of Silesia and significant decrease of esteem, yet in addition for the massive amounts of stores the city held. The Austrian officer, perceiving his horrid situation, posted bulletins on hangman's tree and shafts all through the city, cautioning that any individual who talked about surrender would be hanged right away. On 7 December, Frederick laid attack to the city and the eventual fate of Austrian control of Breslau and the area looked terrible: without a doubt, Breslau surrendered on 19Ã¢ÂÂ 20 December.
