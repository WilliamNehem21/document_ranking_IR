In 1923, "Braunschweig"s bridge was rebuilt and enlarged. The ship's program followed the same pattern as the previous year, with visits to foreign ports in July; "Braunschweig" stopped in Helsinki, Finland, and Gothenburg, Sweden, during her trip. Joint maneuvers were held again in August and September, after which PÃ¼llen left the ship. On 15 October, "VAdm" Hans Zenker, then the "Oberbefehlshaber der SeestreitkrÃ¤fte" ("O.d.S"âCommander of Naval Forces), reorganized the fleet structure, disbanding the North Sea and Baltic commands and replacing them with organizations based on ship type. "Braunschweig" was now assigned to the "Linienschiffsdivision" (Battleship Division), where she served as Zenker's flagship. The division also included the battleship "Hannover". In February and March 1924, the ship served as an icebreaker in the Baltic. The usual cruise abroad in July 1924 ventured further than in previous years, with a trip into the Atlantic. "Braunschweig" stopped in A CoruÃ±a from 6 to 13 July. Fleet maneuvers followed at the end of August, and at their conclusion, the fleet anchored off Sassnitz for a naval review for "Admiral" Paul Behncke, the retiring "Chef der AdmiralitÃ¤t" (Chief of the Admiralty). Zenker was promoted to replace Behncke, who was in turn replaced by now-"VAdm" Mommsen, who again made "Braunschweig" his flagship. Further exercises were held from 29 September to 5 October.
