To the more extensive open, who knew little of his lawful work, Hand was by then a society saint. Social researcher Marvin Schick has brought up that this mythic status is a Catch 22. Since Hand never served on the Supreme Court, most of his cases were normal and his decisions established in point of reference. On Hand's retirement in 1951, Felix Frankfurter anticipated that his "real choices will be all deader than the Dodo after a short time, as at any rate a significant number of them are as of now". Working for a lower court, be that as it may, spared Hand from the corrupt of political impact that frequently hung over the Supreme Court. Hand's expressiveness as an author had a bigger impact in the spread of his impact than the substance of his choices; and Schick trusts that the Hand fantasy brushes over inconsistencies in his lawful logic. Hand's notoriety for being a libertarian clouds the way that he was wary as a judge. Despite the fact that a liberal, he contended for legal restriction in deciphering the Constitution, and respected the headway of common freedoms as an assignment for the assembly, not the courts. In his 1958 Holmes Lectures, for instance, he voiced questions about the lawfulness of the Warren Court's social liberties decisions. This rationality of legal restriction neglected to impact the choices of the Supreme Court amid Hand's lifetime and a short time later.
