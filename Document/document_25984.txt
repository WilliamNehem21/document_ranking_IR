Despite Ice-T's attempts to differentiate "Body Count" from his work in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song "Cop Killer" as rap to provoke negative criticism. "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word "rap" they can get a lot of people who think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word "rock", people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac â that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." "Body Count" has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] [We] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed."
