The bust of frontiersman Daniel Boone, who lived in Missouri for the last 25 years of his life, shows up on the front-side. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on memorial coins, note theory that the front-side may have been motivated by Albin Polasek's molded bust of Boone in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in New York City. Boone wears a deerskin coat and a coonskin top. The centennial dates, the name of the nation and the coin's division encompass the bust. The turn around portrays Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native AmericanÃ¢ÂÂSwiatek and Breen noticed that the frontiersman seems, by all accounts, to be sending ceaselessly the Indian, who bears a shield and harmony pipe, clearly performing Montgomery's craving to demonstrate the white man overriding the Indian in Missouri; Breen expressed "as if this was something to boast about". The 1921 "Report of the Director of the Mint" portrays the collaboration as "Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, guiding the consideration of an Indian toward the westbound course of the white man". The Missouri Centennial half dollar, which demonstrates Boone on either side, is one of only a handful couple of coins in United States numismatic history to have a similar individual delineated on the two sides; other such portrayals incorporate Boone himself on the 1934Ã¢ÂÂ 1938 Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar, Lafayette on the 1900-dated Lafayette dollar and the frontiersman on the 1936 Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar.
