The day after the fight, Harold's body was recognized, either by his reinforcement or stamps on his body. His own standard was exhibited to William, and later sent to the papacy. The assemblages of the English dead, including a portion of Harold's siblings and housecarls, were left on the front line, albeit some were evacuated by relatives later. The Norman dead were covered in an extensive public grave, which has not been found. Definite loss figures are obscure. Of the Englishmen known to be at the fight, the quantity of dead infers that the passing rate was around 50 percent of those drew in, in spite of the fact that this might be excessively high. Of the named Normans who battled at Hastings, one out of seven is expressed to have kicked the bucket, yet these were all aristocrats, and it is likely that the demise rate among the regular fighters was higher. In spite of the fact that Orderic Vitalis' figures are exceptionally overstated, his proportion of one of every four setbacks might be precise. Marren hypothesizes that maybe 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were murdered at Hastings. Reports expressed that a portion of the English dead were all the while being found on the slope years after the fact. Despite the fact that researchers thought for quite a while that remaining parts would not be recoverable, because of the acidic soil, ongoing finds have changed this view. One skeleton that was found in a medieval graveyard, and initially was believed to be related with the thirteenth century Battle of Lewes now is believed to be related with Hastings.
