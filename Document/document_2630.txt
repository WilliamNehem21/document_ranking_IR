Part of the way through the school year, Ali's family moves to the more tranquil Kurdish district in Northern Iraq yet in the wake of living there for a while, Ali says that he is pining to go home and misses the activity and commotion of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling desolate, "receives" a flying creature with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This presents to him some solace, yet his mom later requests that he dispose of the mouse as she doesn't need "vermin" in the house. Mohammad's family cheer when Saddam Hussein is condemned, and feel that his later execution was advocated, as to do generally would have made the Iraqi individuals look feeble. Then again, Anmar's family is irritated with his execution, as they feel that the general population who came into power were no superior to anything Hussein was. Hyder's mom says that numerous Iraqi individuals were confident about the landing of American powers, and that it isn't right to censure America for the majority of the issues in Iraq. She noticed that the gore still can't seem to stop as the Sunni keeps on murdering the Shiite, and the other way around. As the film proceeds, Hyder's family loses its salary and they begin to pitch their furnishings to gain additional cash.
