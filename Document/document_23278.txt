Elinor Mavor took over as editor in early 1979. She had worked for Bernhard as an illustrator and in the production department of several of his magazines, though not for "Amazing". She had also been an editor at "Bill of Fare", a restaurant trade magazine. Mavor had read a good deal of science fiction but knew nothing about the world of science fiction magazines when she took over. She was not confident that a woman would be accepted as the editor of a science fiction magazine, so she initially used the pseudonym "Omar Gohagen" for both "Amazing" and "Fantastic", dropping it late in 1980. Circulation continued to fall, and Bernhard refused to consider Mavor's request to undertake a subscription drive, which might have helped. Instead, in late 1980, Bernhard decided to merge the two magazines. "Fantastic"'s last independent issue was October 1980; thereafter the combined magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule. At the same time the title was changed to "Amazing Science Fiction Stories". Bernhard cut Mavor's salary after the merger, as she was editing only one magazine. Despite this, she stayed with "Amazing", but was unable to prevent circulation from dropping again, down to only 11,000 newsstand sales in 1982.
