By and large, Andrew caused about $25.3ÃÂ billion in harm in Florida, making it the costliest typhoon to hit the state at the time. A few gauges in Florida put the harm as high as $32ÃÂ billion (1992 USD, $ ÃÂ USD). Practically the majority of the harm in Florida was brought about by solid breezes. Of the 44ÃÂ deaths credited to the tempest, 15ÃÂ were direct fatalities, while 29ÃÂ were by implication brought about by the tempest. It was later noticed that if Andrew had been marginally bigger or had made landfall a couple of miles further north, it would have fundamentally influenced Miami and Fort Lauderdale, which would have brought about a much higher harm and loss of life. An examination by the American Meteorological Society showed that not at all like most typhoons, wind harm from Andrew was for the most part north of the geometric focus and happened principally on the eastern edge of the tempest. A few authorities in Florida considered Andrew the most exceedingly bad tempest in the state since the Labor Day storm in 1935. The tempest flood from Andrew made more than $500ÃÂ million in misfortunes pontoons and structures. At the tallness of the tempest, more than 1.4ÃÂ million individuals lost power and another 150,000ÃÂ were without telephone utility. It is assessed that all through Florida, the tempest harmed 101,241ÃÂ homes and devastated around 63,000ÃÂ others Ã¢ÂÂ most by far in Dade County Ã¢ÂÂ with about 175,000ÃÂ people rendered destitute. Notwithstanding homes, the tempest harmed or crushed 82,000ÃÂ businesses, of farmland, 31ÃÂ public schools, 59ÃÂ health offices/medical clinics, 9,500ÃÂ traffic signs, of electrical cables, and 3,000ÃÂ watermains. Roughly 20ÃÂ million cubic yards (15ÃÂ million m) of trash left by the tempest were discarded.
