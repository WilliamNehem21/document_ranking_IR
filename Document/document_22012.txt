Sustained winds in Savannah reached , though maximum gusts were not ascertained because the recording anemometer malfunctioned at the height of the storm. The hurricane passed in an unusually brief period of two hours, with most of the damage being done over the course of about 45 minutes.

Numerous large ships were driven ashore, though some survived unscathed, and dozens of smaller vessels were wrecked along waterways in the city. Several people, including the captain, drowned when the tugboat "Robert Turner" capsized in the Savannah River. Another craft, the "Island Flower", sank nearby, killing three.
