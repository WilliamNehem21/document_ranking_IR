Robert Brown described 31 species of "Banksia" in his 1810 work "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen", including six taxa ("B.Â marginata" Î± and Î² plus four further species) now attributable to "B.Â marginata". He split the genus into two subgenera, placing these species in subgenus "Banksia verae", the "True Banksias". He described "Banksia australis" R.Br., giving the location of the collection as Port Phillip Bay in Victoria in 1802 (having crossed out Van Diemen's Land 1804). Brown's other collections which were reduced to synonymy with "B.Â marginata" were "Banksia depressa" R.Br., a prostrate shrub from Margate Rivulet in southeastern Tasmania, "Banksia insularis" R.Br., from Flinders and King Island, and "Banksia patula" R.Br., a shrub from the vicinity of Port Lincoln, South Australia. The French naturalist AimÃ© Bonpland in 1816 called it "Banksia marcescens" Bonpl., deemed an "illegitimate name", as by that time the name "Banksia marginata" already had been published. Still more synonyms are "Banksia ferrea" Vent. ex Spreng. and "Banksia gunnii" Meisn.
By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described "Banksia" species. Meissner divided Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into "B.Â marginata" in series "Salicinae".
