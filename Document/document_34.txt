Flame from the local hearth was by no means given out of the house on Christmas Eve, not even to a neighbor whose fire had gone out. The purpose behind this restriction, as indicated by ÃÂajkanoviÃÂ, was the conviction that the Eve is the point at which the familial spirits, watchmen of the family's satisfaction and flourishing, are particularly dynamic in this world. Christmas Eve supper is a dining experience arranged in their respect, and they join the family at it. They assemble on the straw spread over the floor, and on the hearth. These spirits could be expelled from the family if any bit of their flame were removed by an outcast. In individuals' words, flame ought not be given in case the karma be detracted from the house, or for better yields, or as a result of honey bees. Alluding to the last clarification, ÃÂajkanoviÃÂ contends that, in the old religion of the Serbs, the honey bees were viewed as unadulterated and sacrosanct creepy crawlies, in whom genealogical spirits could abide. A similar clarification, "in light of honey bees", is additionally given for the previously mentioned custom of putting a bit of the badnjak's first chip in the mixture for the ÃÂesnica.
