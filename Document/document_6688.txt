The MSP building is associated with the Tower Buildings by method for the Garden Lobby and stands at the western end of the parliamentary complex, abutting Reid's Close. The square contains workplaces for each MSP and two individuals from staff, fitted out with hand crafted furniture. The structure is somewhere in the range of four and six stories in stature, and is clad in stone. MSPs possess 108 of the all out 114 rooms in the structure. Every office is partitioned into two sectionsÃ¢ÂÂone for the MSP, with a story space of 15ÃÂ squareÃÂ metres (160ÃÂ sqÃÂ ft) and another part for their staff, which has a story space of 12ÃÂ squareÃÂ metres (130ÃÂ sqÃÂ ft).
