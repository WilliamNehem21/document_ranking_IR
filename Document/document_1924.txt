On 16 January 1945 the BPF cruised for its essential base in the Pacific Ocean, Sydney, Australia. On the way, the transporters of the first ACS assaulted Palembang on 24 January and 29 January (Operation Meridian). "Illustrious"s air assemble comprised of 32 Corsairs and 21 Avengers at this point and she contributed 12 of her Avengers and 16 Corsairs to the primary assault, which demolished the greater part of the oil stockpiling tanks and cut the refinery's yield significantly for three months. After five days, the BPF assaulted an alternate refinery and the ship propelled 12 Avengers and 12 Corsairs. The assault was fruitful at substantial expense; between the two air activities, her squadrons lost five Corsairs to foe fire or warriors and one because of a mechanical issue on take-off just as three Avengers to foe activity. Her Corsairs asserted four foe airplane shot down as completed one Avenger pilot who guaranteed triumph over a Nakajima Ki-44 "Tojo" warrior. The armada's flame discipline was poor when it was assaulted by seven Japanese planes soon after the strike flying machine started landing. The assailants were altogether shot down, yet two shells discharged by either "Unyielding" or the ship struck "Celebrated", slaughtering 12 and injuring 21 men.
