SS "Wilfred Sykes" loaded opposite "Edmund Fitzgerald" at the Burlington Northern DockÂ #1 and departed at 4:15Â p.m., about two hours after "Edmund Fitzgerald". In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that took advantage of the protection offered by the lake's north shore in order to avoid the worst effects of the storm. The crew of "Wilfred Sykes" followed the radio conversations between "Edmund Fitzgerald" and "Arthur M. Anderson" during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers' Association downbound route. The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00Â p.m., issuing gale warnings for the whole of Lake Superior. "Arthur M. Anderson" and "Edmund Fitzgerald" altered course northward seeking shelter along the Ontario coast where they encountered a winter storm at 1:00Â a.m. on November 10. "Edmund Fitzgerald" reported winds of and waves high. Captain Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" reported that after 1Â a.m., he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship's speed because of the rough conditions. Paquette said he was stunned to later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state that "we're going to try for some lee from Isle Royale. You're walking away from us anywayÂ ... I can't stay with you."
