Fleming manufactures the primary character in "Live and Let Die" to make Bond seem to be more human than in "Gambling club Royale", turning into "an a lot hotter, increasingly affable man from the opening part", as indicated by the American writer Raymond Benson, who somewhere in the range of 1997 and 2002 composed a progression of Bond books and short stories. Savoye sees the acquaintance of a defenseless side with Bond, recognizing the specialist's tears towards the finish of the story as proof of this. So also, through the span of the book, the American character Leiter creates and furthermore develops as an increasingly total and human character and his and Bond's kinship is obvious in the story. Regardless of the relationship, Leiter is again subordinate to Bond. While in "Gambling club Royale" his job was to give specialized help and cash to Bond, in "Live and Let Die" the character is optional to Bond, and the main time he steps up to the plate, he loses far too much, while Bond wins his very own fight with a similar adversary. Despite the fact that Fleming had at first proposed to murder Leiter off in the story, his American artistic operator dissented, and the character was spared.
