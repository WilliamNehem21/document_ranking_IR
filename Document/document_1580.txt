Amid late August and into early September 1961, a strange arrangement of low-level unsettling influences created over Central and West Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these frameworks, that most likely shaped over Central Africa toward the finish of August, turned out to be progressively sorted out as it moved over Nigeria on SeptemberÃÂ 1. As the unsettling influence voyaged consistently westbound, its mid-level flow turned out to be very much characterized, and the going with low-level focus bit by bit stuck to this same pattern. An upper-level anticyclone went with the tempest amid this whole period, giving a positive upper-air routine for fortifying. As indicated by a post-storm ponder in 1962, all the vital ecological fixings were accessible to the unsettling influence while it was over land; the main factor restraining prior improvement was an absence of access to the warm waters. Around 1200ÃÂ UTC on SeptemberÃÂ 5, the low risen off the shore of Senegal as a solid tropical wretchedness or hurricane. At this point, the framework had a focal weight beneath 1006ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 29.71ÃÂ inHg), and supported breezes of 35ÃÂ mph (55ÃÂ km/h) were accounted for in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. As the framework neared Cape Verde, it kept on escalating and by the night of SeptemberÃÂ 6, reports from the adjacent Danish tanker "Charlotte Maersk" demonstrated that the framework was at that point at or close typhoon force.
