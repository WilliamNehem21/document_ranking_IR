"Chesapeake" departed from Hampton Roads on 27 April 1802 and arrived at Gibraltar on 25Â May; she immediately put in for repairs, as her main mast had split during the voyage. Morris remained at Gibraltar while awaiting word on the location of his squadron, as several ships had not reported in. On 22Â July "Adams" arrived with belated orders for Morris, dated 20Â April. Those orders were to "lay the whole squadron before Tripoli" and negotiate peace. "Chesapeake" and "Enterprise" departed Gibraltar on 17Â August bound for Leghorn, while providing protection for a convoy of merchant ships that were bound for intermediate ports. Morris made several stops in various ports before finally arriving at Leghorn on 12Â October, after which he sailed to Malta. "Chesapeake" undertook repairs of a rotted bowsprit. "Chesapeake" was still in port when "John Adams" arrived on 5Â January 1803 with orders dated 23Â October 1802 from Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith. These directed "Chesapeake" and "Constellation" to return to the United States; Morris was to transfer his command to "New York". "Constellation" sailed directly as ordered, but Morris retained "Chesapeake" at Malta, claiming that she was not in any condition to make an Atlantic voyage during the winter months.
