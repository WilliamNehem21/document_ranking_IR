The Royal Navy repaired "Chesapeake" and took her into service as HMSÂ "Chesapeake". She served on the Halifax station under the command of Alexander Dixie through 1814, and under the command of George Burdett she sailed to Plymouth, England, for repairs in October of that year. Afterward she made a voyage to Cape Town, South Africa, until learning of the peace treaty with the United States in May 1815. Later that year a report was made concerning "Chesapeake"s performance in British service. Her captain observed that she was strongly constructed, but criticized the excessive overhang of the stern. He concluded that she was not a suitable ship to serve as a model for copying. Her speed under sail was not particularly impressive: close-hauled and large. In July 1819 the Commissioners of the Royal Navy put her up for sale at Plymouth. A Portsmouth timber merchant purchased her for Â£500; he dismantled the ship and sold her timbers to Joshua Holmes for Â£3,450. Eventually her timbers became part of the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham, Hampshire, England, where one can still view them. In 1996 a timber fragment from the Chesapeake Mill was returned to the United States. It is on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.
