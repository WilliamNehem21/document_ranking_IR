The history specialist Ian Wood has recommended that Mellitus' voyage through Gaul presumably took in the church districts of Vienne, Arles, Lyons, Toulon, Marseilles, Metz, Paris, and Rouen, as confirm by the letters that Gregory routed to those religious administrators requesting their help for Mellitus' gathering. Gregory likewise kept in touch with the Frankish rulers Chlothar II, Theuderic II, Theudebert II, alongside Brunhilda of Austrasia, who was Theudebert and Theuderic's grandma and official. Wood feels this wide intrigue to the Frankish episcopate and eminence was a push to verify more help for the Gregorian mission. While on his voyage to England, Mellitus got a letter from Gregory enabling Augustine to change over agnostic sanctuaries to Christian holy places, and to change over agnostic creature penances into Christian banquets, to facilitate the progress to Christianity. Gregory's letter denoted an ocean change in the evangelist system, and was later incorporated into Bede's "Ministerial History of the English People". Typically known as the "Epistola promotion Mellitum", it clashes with the letter sent to ÃÂthelberht, which the student of history R. A. Markus sees as a defining moment in teacher history, when coercive change offered approach to influence. This conventional view, that the "Epistola" speaks to an inconsistency of the letter to ÃÂthelberht, has been tested by the student of history and scholar George Demacopoulos, who contends that the letter to ÃÂthelberht was mostly intended to empower the King in profound issues, while the "Epistola" was sent to manage absolutely viable issues, and consequently the two don't repudiate one another.
