CUWBC took on Molesey Boat Club on 22 February in a race from the Chiswick Steps to the Start post. A decent begin from the Light Blues saw them right around a length ahead by Chiswick Eyot, and move into an unmistakable water advantage by St Paul's School. A further length's leverage was taken by Hammersmith Bridge which was before long stretched out to two by Harrods and three by the Mile Post. In spite of experiencing a solid headwind, CUWBC kept on pulling far from Molesey and passed the Start line six lengths clear. After six days, OUWBC went up against Molesey in a three-piece set on the Championship Course. Forceful directing from the Dark Blues earned them a few alerts from the umpire amid the primary race, and despite the fact that it was at first close, OUWBC destroyed away to hold a length's lead by the Mile Post before going under Hammersmith Bridge two lengths ahead. The second fragment from the Mile Post to Chiswick Eyot highlighted further conflicts between the groups, yet Oxford ruled, driving by three lengths at St Paul's boat storages and winning by four lengths. In the third race, Molesey took an early lead yet OUWBC recouped before the teams shot Barnes Bridge, completing the piece two lengths ahead.
