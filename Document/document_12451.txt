Shepard was conceived July 25, 1833 in Jamestown in Chautauqua County, New York. He was the second of three children of Fitch Shepard and Delia Maria Dennis; the others were Burritt Hamilton and Augustus Dennis. Fitch Shepard was leader of the National Bank Note Company (later merged with the American and Continental Note Companies), and Elliott's sibling Augustus progressed toward becoming leader of the American Bank Note Company. Shepard's more distant family lived in New England, with starting points in Bedfordshire, England. Fitch, child of Noah Shepard, was a relative of Thomas Shepard (a Puritan priest) and James Fitch (child in-law of William Bradford). Delia Maria Dennis was a relative of Robert Dennis, who emigrated from England in 1635. Elliott was depicted in 1897's "Unmistakable Families of New York" as "conspicuous by birth and heritage, just as for his own characteristics". He went to state funded schools in Jamestown, and moved with his dad and siblings to New York City in 1845. He started going to the school preliminary University Grammar School (at that point situated in the City University of New York constructing), and moved on from the college in 1855. Shepard started perusing law under Edwards Pierrepont, and was admitted to the bar in the city of Brooklyn in 1858.
