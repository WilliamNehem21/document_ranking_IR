Amid Harmar's Campaign, Scott was serving in the state lawmaking body in Richmond, Virginia. He was by and by named to the board of trustees on benefits and race. He likewise served on the council on recommendations and complaints and a few extraordinary advisory groups. On December30, 1790, Virginia Governor Beverley Randolph, perhaps following up on a suggestion from Washington, delegated Scott brigadier general in the Virginia local army and gave him direction of the whole District of Kentucky. His essential obligation was supervising a line of 18 stations along the Ohio River. In January 1791, President Washington acknowledged U.S. Representative John Brown's recommendation to select a Kentucky Board of War, made out of Brown, Scott, Isaac Shelby, Harry Innes, and Benjamin Logan. The council was engaged to get out nearby state army to act related to government troops against the Indians. They prescribed collecting a multitude of volunteers to find and obliterate Indian settlements north of the Ohio River. Soon thereafter, Washington endorsed an arrangement to attack the Indians' countries by means of a strike from Fort Washington (close present-day Cincinnati, Ohio). Most Kentuckians were disappointed with Washington's decision of Arthur St. Clair, by then experiencing gout and unfit to mount his very own pony unassisted, as generally speaking leader of the attack. Scott was picked to serve under St. Clair as officer of the 1,000 minute men who partook in the attack, around 33% of the absolute power.
