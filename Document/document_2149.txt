Seward gave a noteworthy discourse on January 12, 1861. By at that point, he was referred to be Lincoln's decision as Secretary of State, and with Lincoln remaining quiet, it was broadly expected that he would propound the new organization's arrangement to spare the Union. Likewise, he addressed a jam-packed Senate, where even Jefferson Davis went to regardless of Mississippi's severance, and to stuffed displays. He encouraged the conservation of the Union, and upheld a correction, for example, the one he had presented, or a protected tradition, when interests had cooled. He implied that New Mexico Territory may be a slave state, and encouraged the development of two cross-country railways, one northern, one southern. He recommended the section of enactment to bar interstate attacks, for example, that by John Brown. In spite of the fact that Seward's discourse was broadly extolled, it picked up a blended response in the outskirt states to which he had endeavored to advance. Radical Republicans were not willing to make concessions toward the South, and were enraged by the discourse. Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, a radical, cautioned that if Lincoln like Seward overlooked the Republican stage and endeavored to buy harmony through concessions, he would resign, as too old to even consider bearing the long stretches of fighting in the Republican Party that would result.
