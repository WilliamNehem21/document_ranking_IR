In 595, Gregory picked Augustine, earlier of Gregory's own cloister of St Andrew in Rome, to head the mission to Kent. Gregory chose priests to go with Augustine and looked for help from the Frankish lords. The pope kept in touch with various Frankish religious administrators for Augustine's benefit, presenting the mission and asking that Augustine and his allies be made welcome. Duplicates of letters to a portion of these religious administrators make due in Rome. The pope kept in touch with King Theuderic II of Burgundy and to King Theudebert II of Austrasia, just as their grandma Brunhilda of Austrasia, looking for help for the mission. Gregory expressed gratitude toward King Chlothar II of Neustria for helping Augustine. Other than cordiality, the Frankish diocesans and lords gave translators and were approached to enable some Frankish clerics to go with the mission. By requesting assistance from the Frankish lords and religious administrators, Gregory guaranteed a neighborly gathering for Augustine in Kent, as ÃÂthelbert was probably not going to abuse a mission which delighted in the obvious help of his significant other's relatives and individuals. The Franks around then were endeavoring to broaden their impact in Kent, and helping Augustine's main goal promoted that objective. Chlothar, specifically, required a benevolent domain over the Channel to help monitor his kingdom's flanks against his individual Frankish lords.
