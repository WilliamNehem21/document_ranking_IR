Occasional mollusk fossils are found, as well as a variety of other aquatic animals like fish and turtles. Crocodilians included several species of "Shamosuchus", a genus with teeth adapted for crushing shells. Mammal fossils are exceedingly rare in the Nemegt Formation, but many birds have been found, including the enantiornithine "Gurilynia" and the hesperornithiform "Judinornis", as well as "Teviornis", an early representative of the still-existing Anseriformes (waterfowl). Scientists have described many dinosaurs from the Nemegt Formation, including the ankylosaurid "Saichania", and pachycephalosaur "Prenocephale". By far the largest predator known from the formation, adult "Tarbosaurus" most likely preyed upon large hadrosaurs such as "Saurolophus" and "Barsboldia", or sauropods such as "Nemegtosaurus", and "Opisthocoelicaudia". Adults would have received little competition from small theropods such as the small tyrannosaurid "Alioramus", troodontids ("Borogovia", "Tochisaurus", "Zanabazar"), oviraptorosaurs ("Elmisaurus", "Nemegtomaia", "Rinchenia") or "Bagaraatan", sometimes considered a basal tyrannosauroid. Other theropods, like the gigantic "Therizinosaurus", might have been herbivorous, and ornithomimosaurs such as "Anserimimus", "Gallimimus", and gigantic "Deinocheirus" might have been omnivores that only took small prey and were therefore no competition for "Tarbosaurus". However, as in other large tyrannosaurids as well as modern Komodo dragons, juveniles and subadult "Tarbosaurus" would have filled niches between the massive adults and these smaller theropods.
