A proposal from an individual from the open was inspected by the plan sub-advisory group, however in October 1919 the full board of trustees set out to designate Lutyens as modeler and to manufacture the remembrance in Victoria Park, which had been in the responsibility for city gathering since the 1860s and was spread out as an open park in 1883. Lutyens visited on 20 October 1919 and was joined by the duke and other council individuals on an investigation of the picked site. The first arrangement included intersection roads of lime trees to make a tree house of prayer, with a cenotaph (indistinguishable to the one in London) at the western end, and a Stone of Remembrance at the intersection, inside a roundabout walled nook, which would be engraved with the names of the dead. The ways along the arrangement of the house of God would be cleared to complement the motivation behind the structure. This proposition was acknowledged, and a model was made and showed in the city exhibition hall. By March 1922, the task had been downsized because of a deficiency of assets and absence of open energy for the ventureÃ¢ÂÂthe expenses were evaluated at ÃÂ£23,000, of which just around ÃÂ£4,300 had been raised. At an open gathering on 29 March, the board of trustees consented to desert the plan and that "a dedication deserving of the city be raised on the ground close to the fundamental passage entryways".
