Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, "The Combat" was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300Â guineas (about Â£ in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century.
Throughout his life, "The Combat" continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller copy of "The Combat", which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of "A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished", are also in circulation.
