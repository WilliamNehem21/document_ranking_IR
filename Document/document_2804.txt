The book got positive surveys: Veronica Horwell of "The Guardian" composed that Davies was the "Scheherazade of Cardiff Bay" and opined that the book ought to have been double the distributed length; Ian Berriman of sci-fi magazine "SFX" gave the book five stars and remarked that it was the main book about "new Who" that a peruser required; TV faultfinder Charlie Brooker was propelled by the book to commit a whole scene of his BBC Four show "Screenwipe" to meeting TV authors; and visit show couple Richard and Judy chose the book as a prescribed Christmas present in the "Genuine Non-Fiction" class of their book club.
