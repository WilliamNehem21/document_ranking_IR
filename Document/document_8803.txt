U2 built up a style of altering in their past show films that included quick cutting between shots, which Owens needed to hold in "U2 3D". Since quick slicing in 3D would prompt movement disorder or eye strain, the film was altered to consolidate breaks up of something like four casings between shots. Huge numbers of the changes were made by layering a few casings of film over each other into composite pictures. Every one of the layered casings highlighted an alternate profundity of field to upgrade the 3D impacts, and up to five pictures were layered together in a solitary shot. This made "U2 3D" the main 3D film to highlight composite pictures with multiple layers, and the first to be altered explicitly to keep the watcher from encountering movement infection or eye strain. Programming did not exist at an opportunity to layer the 3D pictures, so new programming must be created. Since the venture was caught in top notch video, each edge utilized about 20 megabytes of information on 3ality Digital's servers, and the whole film utilized very nearly a petabyte (10 bytes). The 3D altering procedure took longer than Owens expected, and therefore, the task went over spending plan, costing $15ÃÂ million to create. Video altering took 17ÃÂ months, and the last film was sliced to a length of 85ÃÂ minutesÃ¢ÂÂseven shorter than initially reported.
