Genius Southern representatives, who had left the Charleston tradition in challenge of its inability to receive a government slave code board in its stage, did not take an interest in the Baltimore tradition. The agents from Alabama and Louisiana Ã¢ÂÂ every one of whom had exited at Charleston Ã¢ÂÂ had been supplanted with Douglas supporters from those states, prompting the assignment of Douglas and Herschel Vespasian Johnson for president and VP, individually. The challenging representatives gathered five days after the fact in Baltimore. On the primary vote, Breckinridge got 81 cast a ballot, with 24 going to previous Senator Daniel S. Dickinson of New York. Dickinson supporters step by step changed their help to Breckinridge so as to make his selection consistent, and Joseph Lane of Oregon was picked by acclaim as his running mate. In spite of worries about the separation of the gathering, Breckinridge acknowledged the assignment. In August, Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis endeavored to facilitate a trade off under which Douglas, Breckinridge, and Tennessee's John Bell, the chosen one of the Constitutional Union Party, would all pull back for a trade off competitor. Both Breckinridge and Bell promptly consented to the arrangement, yet Douglas was against trading off with the "Bolters," and his supporters held a serious abhorrence for Breckinridge that made them opposed to Davis' proposition.
