The Prussian position at Kunersdorf was not generously superior to anything it had been a couple of hours sooner, however it was, in any event, solid; the Russian position, then again, was considerably more regrettable. While Frederick's essential power had ambushed the MÃÂ¼hlberge, Johann Jakob von Wunsch, with 4,000 men, had backtracked his means from Reitwein to Frankfurt and had caught the city by early afternoon. The Prussians had successfully hindered the Allies from moving east, west or south, and the landscape blocked them from moving north; in the event that they attempted such an audacious move, Moller's cannons would rake them with enfilade fire. The King's sibling, Prince Henry, and a few different commanders urged Frederick to stop there. The Prussians could protect Frankfurt from their vantage point on the MÃÂ¼hlberge and in the city itself. To dive into the valley, cross the Kuhgrund and rise Spitzberge against terrible flame was reckless, they contended. Moreover, the climate was blisteringly hot and the troops had persevered through constrained walks to achieve the theater and the front line. They were depleted and low on water. The men had not had a hot dinner in a few days, having bivouacked the prior night without flames. Regardless of these contentions, Frederick needed to squeeze his underlying achievement. He had won a large portion of the fight and needed the entire triumph. He chose to proceed with the battle. He exchanged his big guns to the MÃÂ¼hlberge, and requested Finck's contingents to attack the Allied remarkable from the northwest, while his principle strike power would cross the Kuhgrund.
