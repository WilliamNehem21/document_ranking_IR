Faultfinders and fans alike scrutinized the authors' appearing dismissal for the "Lost" timetable. In light of the activities and whereabouts of characters in the third season, fans could derive when parts of Michael's flashbacks happened in connection to occasions on the island. John Kubicek of BuddyTV composed that "This course of events results in some difficult issues fans ought to have with time Ã¢ÂÂ¦ This has neither rhyme nor reason Ã¢ÂÂ¦ Michael left in the vessel, he needed to discover help, come shorewards, by one way or another account for himself, jump on a plane back to New York City, drop off Walt to live with his grandmother, discover a loft, get into an auto crash, recoup, and at exactly that point did he meet Tom. Either the journalists are playing reckless with the idea of time, or Michael had the busiest week ever of world." Using Lostpedia as a source of perspective, Nikki Stafford of "Wizard" called attention to that the order was practically conflicting with the third season, yet in addition with a prior scene of a similar season. Damon Lindelof reacted that "we [the authors and producers] find that the [fan message] sheets can be extremely lethal" and guided explicitly toward the "nitpick[ing]" of the conceivable congruity issues of "Meet Kevin Johnson", saying with regards to the content that "it's TV."
