In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody met with Sean Brennan, at that point head of distributing at Virgin Interactive, and talked about how the Knights Templar would make a perfect subject to put together an amusement with respect to. Afterward, Virgin consented to issue the diversion. In a September 1992 meeting for French magazine "GÃÂ©nÃÂ©ration 4", Charles Cecil expressed that he had started taking a shot at a situation for Revolution's third amusement, after 1992's "Draw of the Temptress" and 1994's then-forthcoming "Underneath a Steel Sky". The diversion would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The next month, Cecil visited Paris to look into the Templars; subsequent to perusing "The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail", he was sure there was sufficient thought about the Templars to make them a decent subject for an amusement. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard started take a shot at the story and plan. Cecil and Cummins went to a film-composing course and their content was perused by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and screenwriter. Transformation craftsman Steve Ince made introductory area outlines for the diversion before chipping away at "Underneath a Steel Sky". He was elevated to maker part of the way through the venture.
