Mercury booked the New York Dolls at The Record Plant in New York City, where they recorded their self-titled presentation collection in April 1973. Rundgren was initially worried that they had taken "the most exceedingly bad sounding studio in the city around then" since it was the just a single accessible to them with the brief timeframe given to record and discharge the collection. He later said that desires for the band and the happy environment of the chronicle sessions turned out to be to a greater degree an issue: "The Dolls were commentators' dears and the press had sort of received them. In addition, there were loads of additional individuals around, mingling, which made it difficult to think." "New York Dolls" was recorded in eight days on a financial plan of $17,000 (proportional to $ in ). With a short measure of studio time and no idea as a top priority for the collection, the band picked which melodies to record dependent on how well they had been gotten at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, "we went into a room and simply recorded. It wasn't care for these individuals who conceptualize things. It was only a report of what was happening at the time."
