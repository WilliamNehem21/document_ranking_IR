In 1654, Oliver Cromwell chose to turn on Spain (which had been the primary state to perceive the Commonwealth of England) and catch the island of Hispaniola to make it a base for English extension in the Caribbean. To do as such, two armadas were fitted out: one set out to America and another toward the western Mediterranean with the apparent goal of battling the Barbary privateers. The armada in the Caribbean neglected to catch Hispaniola yet took over Jamaica rather in May 1655. The armada in the Mediterranean cruised off CÃÂ¡diz attempting to block the Spanish fortune armada with no achievement. With the landing of the winter, the armada returned to England. Be that as it may, Spain did not proclaim war on England until February 1656. Not long after, an armada of 49 English warships kept an eye on by 10,000 mariners and troopers cruised through the Straits and observed Gibraltar. In spite of the fact that they came up short on a practical landing power and made no move, Oliver Cromwell communicated enthusiasm for its catch: "whenever had and made reasonable by us, would it not be both leverage to our exchange, and an inconvenience to the Spaniards, and empower us [to]ÃÂ ... facilitate our own charge?" In 1693, amid the Nine Years' War, in which Spain and England were partners, the remainders of an English-Dutch escort squadron under the direction of Admiral Sir George Rooke took asylum at Gibraltar, sought after by the French, in the wake of losing the Battle of Lagos Bay. After eleven years, Rooke was to come back to Gibraltar to catch it.
