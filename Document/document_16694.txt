Pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in "Troy", and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel "Ocean's Twelve". He spent six months sword training before the filming of "Troy", based on the "Iliad". An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks. Stephen Hunter of "The Washington Times" stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role. "Troy" was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures. "Ocean's Twelve" earned $362Â million worldwide, and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as "the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford." In 2005, Pitt starred in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy "Mr. & Mrs. Smith", in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The "Star Tribune" noted that "while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry". "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" earned $478Â million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.
