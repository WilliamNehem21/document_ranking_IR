While advancing the principal "Occupant Evil" movie in late February 2002, Milla Jovovich and executive Paul W. S. Anderson talked about a potential spin-off. Anderson said he started composing the screenplay for the second film in the wake of finishing the first, and had plans for Alice to get together with Jill Valentine. Jovovich affirmed her character would return in the continuation if the primary film was fruitful. Toward the beginning of March, Eric Mabius, who played Matt Addison in the primary film, expressed a continuation was affirmed, would be set in Raccoon City, and would highlight the Nemesis character. The spin-off was authoritatively greenlit by Sony Pictures in mid-2002 yet Anderson decided not to coordinate because of his duties to "Outsider versus Predator" (2004). He remained on as the film's screenwriter and as one of its makers. Anderson utilized the diversion "" as the premise of the story and wrote in components from his most loved movies, for example, the border divider in "Departure from New York" and the abandoned city in "The Omega Man". Alexander Witt was procured to coordinate the movie, denoting his component movie directorial debut. The content had just been finished when Witt was procured. He made a few proposals to Anderson and individual maker Jeremy Bolt, which brought about some minor content changes.
