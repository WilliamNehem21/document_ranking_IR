Somewhere in the range of 100 and 200 years before the climactic ejection, Llao Rock, a thick square of dull magma with a volume of , was created from a rhyodacite stream emitted from Mazama. It has a round focus and augmentations on the sides, looking like a fowl of prey. The development of Llao Rock was gone before by hazardous emissions of rhyodacite, making pumice and fiery remains that were shot out high into the environment and conveyed for a few hundred miles into northern and eastern Washington state, eastern Oregon, and western Nevada. A vast hole shaped however was filled by resulting magma streams. Without further ado before the real, caldera-framing ejection at Mazama, the Cleetwood stream was delivered. Additionally made out of rhyodacite magma, it started from a vent on the northern side of the complex found eastbound of Llao Rock. It likely just happened weeks or months before the real emission, as Mazama's breakdown framed a retrogressive stream of magma when it slice through the Cleetwood magma, proposing that the Cleetwood magma was as yet sufficiently hot to stream and move. Tephra from the last significant ejection that was emplaced on Cleetwood stores has been modified by warmth and gas from the Cleetwood magma. Both these eruptive periods occurred on the northern flank of the Mazama complex, not a long way from the magma chamber that delivered the climactic emission not long after.
