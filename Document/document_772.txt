Oliphant then met with the Uranium Committee at its gathering in New York on 26 August 1941. Samuel K. Allison, another individual from the Committee, was an exploratory physicist and a protÃÂ©gÃÂ© of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. He reviewed that Oliphant "went to a gathering and said 'bomb' undoubtedly. He disclosed to us we should focus each exertion on the bomb, and said we reserved no option to take a shot at power plants or anything other than the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he stated, and Britain did not have the cash or the labor, so it was up to us." Allison was astonished that Briggs had kept the council in obscurity. Oliphant then ventured out to Berkeley, where he met his companion Lawrence on 23 September, giving him a duplicate of the FrischÃ¢ÂÂ Peierls reminder. Lawrence had Robert Oppenheimer check the figures, carrying him into the undertaking out of the blue. Oliphant found another partner in Oppenheimer, and he not just figured out how to persuade Lawrence and Oppenheimer that a nuclear bomb was plausible, yet enlivened Lawrence to change over his cyclotron into a monster mass spectrometer for electromagnetic isotope division, a procedure Oliphant had spearheaded in 1934. Leo Szilard later stated, "if Congress knew the genuine history of the nuclear vitality venture, I have no uncertainty yet that it would make an exceptional award to be given to intruding outsiders for recognized administrations, and that Dr Oliphant would be the first to get one."
