The most punctual proof of changeless occupation is a progression of trench of eleventh or twelfth century date which are accepted to have shaped a walled in area, the south east corner of which lies beneath the "house of prayer". Proof for any structures inside the walled in area has either been lost to the Glaven or is covered outside the overview territory. Hardly any finds were related with the trench, albeit a few pieces of Roman or prior earthenware and three Henry III pennies were discovered close-by. As somewhere else on the site, there is little proof to connect the old earthenware to its area when found. When of the development of the principle fabricating, some time in the fourteenth century, the trench had loaded up with sand. A little hearth was worked at ground level, without further ado previously or amid the erection of S1. It seems to have had genuinely light use, yet the nearness of slag proposes that it was planned for purifying iron, maybe by a smith. There was proof for various little flames somewhere else in S1 at a comparative date to the hearth, however whether they were identified with the refining is obscure. Right now, hearths couldn't liquefy metallic iron, yet delivered a 'sprout' (a blend of iron and slag) which could be changed over to fashioned iron by continued warming and pounding. Another, much prior, refining hearth is known from West Runton, 17ÃÂ km (10ÃÂ mi) further east on the Norfolk coast. The primary metal around there is the iron-rich neighborhood carrstone.
