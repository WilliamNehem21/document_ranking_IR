Amid Tankersley's residency as distributer of the "Times-Herald", the paper was entangled in two discussions identified with McCarthy, one including assaults proposed to help unseat Democratic Senator Millard E. Tydings in 1950, and the other a claim brought by Drew Pearson in 1951 over what Pearson saw as a "connivance to spread his notoriety". In the Tydings case, a composite photo made by Garvin Tankersley made Tydings have all the earmarks of being meeting with a socialist gathering pioneer and was a factor in Tydings losing his race. It likewise conveyed Bazy and her paper to the consideration of the United States Senate, where the paper's treatment of Tydings was seen by a bipartisan Senate board as an infringement of "straightforward conventionality and genuineness" and "a stunning maltreatment of the soul and purpose of the First Amendment of the Constitution". The claim was a $5.1 million reason recorded by Pearson against different respondents, including McCarthy and the "Times-Herald", Westbrook Pegler and Fulton Lewis, charging they had "contrivedÃÂ ... to hold offended party up to open contempt and derision". Pearson every now and again scrutinized McCarthy, McCarthy condemned Pearson in a discourse on the floor of the Senate, and the two men had even been in a physical squabble in December 1950. The "Times-Herald" ran articles condemning of Pearson and in one case depicted Pearson as "Another Deal socialist", however it was affirmed to have been a typographical blunder that ought to have perused "writer".
