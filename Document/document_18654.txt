Vincent was portrayed by Phillip Jeanmarie from December 26, 2006Â â July 18, 2008; Valerie Davis was played by DaphnÃ©e Duplaix from December 16, 2004Â â May 28, 2008 and temporarily by Siena Goines from January 30, 2007Â â April 3, 2007. The character received mixed reactions from the show's cast and television critics. Jeanmarie described Vincent as representing the way in which "Passions" "pushed the boundaries and limits of what other soap operas didn't dare to do." On the other hand, Tracey Ross said the storyline of Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her "physically nauseous" and she could only complete the delivery scenes after the show's acting coach Maria O'Brien convinced her of "the comedic possibilities." Jamey Giddens of "Daytime Confidential" felt that Jeanmarie deserved an Emmy for making Vincent's outlandish situations believable. Josh Robertson of "Complex" called Duplaix, who had been a "Playboy" Playmate, one of the most successful soap actresses for her performances as Valerie in 34 episodes of "Passions," along with her portrayal of Rachel Gannon in 95 episodes of "One Life to Live". Herndon L. Davis of "Windy City Times" criticized the show's representation of Vincent's sexual relationship with Chad as "a down-low storyline which involved an African-American man but eventually turned it into an outrageous intersex serial killer storyline."
