In 2011, Hathaway voiced Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from Rio de Janeiro, in the energized film "Rio", delivered by twentieth Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios. The film got commonly positive audits from film faultfinders, who commended the visuals, voice acting and music. A business achievement, it netted more than $484 million worldwide against a financial plan of $90 million. Afterward, Hathaway featured nearby Jim Sturgess in Lone Scherfig's "One Day", in view of David Nicholls' 2009 novel of a similar name. The film recounts to the tale of two youngsters who meet twenty years after they shared a one-night stand together. Hathaway was furtively given the content, as "One Day" was set in the UK, and Scherfig was not searching for any American performing artists for the part. After a useless gathering with Scherfig, Hathaway left a rundown of tunes for her, who in the wake of tuning in to them, cast the on-screen character for the part. In a meeting with Peter Travers, Hathaway said she may have accidentally supported misogyny as she didn't trust Scherfig as a chief, which she felt was a result of her sex. Hathaway's Yorkshire complement in the film was considered trashy. Feature writer Suzanne Moore, checking on the film on BBC Radio 4's "First Row", said Hathaway's inflections were "everywhere throughout the shop", including, "Some of the time she's from Scotland, in some cases she's from New York, you can't tell". The film itself got energized surveys from faultfinders, yet turned into a moderate film industry achievement.
