The financing plan involved public and private funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75Â million for the acquisition of the land and construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91Â million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30Â years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group agreed to spend $50Â million on a new, mixed-use and retail development located on a plot abutting the ballpark to the east. This land was sold to Chris and Tim Ward, sons of co-owner Frank Ward, on which a two-story retail center is expected to be completed by April 2019. The construction of a 285-unit multi-family apartment building beyond the left field wall, to be known as The Derby, is tentatively planned for completion in 2020, though, , construction has not begun. North of the site, Embrey Development built a privately funded 306-unit luxury apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75Â million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3Â million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Ward brothers' developments, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.
