Conceived in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix started playing guitar at 15 years old. In 1961, he enrolled in the U.S. Armed force and prepared as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division; he was conceded a respectable release the next year. Before long a while later, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and started playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, winning a spot in the Isley Brothers' supporting band and later with Little Richard, with whom he kept on working through mid-1965. He at that point played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 in the wake of being found by Linda Keith, who thusly intrigued bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in turning into his first chief. Inside months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: "Hello Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary". He accomplished popularity in the U.S. after his execution at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and last studio collection, "Electric Ladyland", achieved number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most economically effective discharge and his solitary number one collection. The world's most generously compensated entertainer, he featured the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, preceding his incidental passing from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at 27 years old.
