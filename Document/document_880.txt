Fixes were at long last finished by September 1915. On 21 September, "Prinz Adalbert" joined a fight to the Gulf of Finland with the war vessels , and the light cruiser . They experienced no Russian powers and came back to port on the 23rd. Another activity pursued on 5 October; this was in organization with "Prinz Heinrich" and "Bremen", and was to cover a minelayer as it laid a field toward the northwest of ÃÂstergarn. The boats finished their main goal the following day and came back to port without occurrence. On 19 October, Hopman exchanged his banner to "Roon" and requested "Prinz Adalbert" to take up a watch among FÃÂ¥rÃÂ¶ and Dagerort. The ship was steaming about 20 miles west of Libau, on the way to her watch territory, in organization with a couple of destroyers on 23 October when she was captured by the submarine . "E8" terminated a spread of torpedoes at a scope of roughly 1,200ÃÂ m (1,300ÃÂ yd), exploding the ship's ammo magazine. The gigantic blast devastated the ship, which sank quickly with the loss of 672 team. There were just three survivors. The sinking was the best single death toll for the German Baltic powers amid the war.
