"Weissenburg" and the remainder of the armada worked under the typical daily practice of individual and unit preparing in the principal half of 1897. The ordinary routine was hindered toward the beginning of August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian magnificent court at Kronstadt; the two divisions of the I Squadron were sent to go with the Kaiser. They came back to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the remainder of the armada went along with them for the yearly harvest time moves. These activities mirrored the strategic reasoning of the new State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (RMAÃ¢ÂÂImperial Navy Office), "Konteradmiral" Alfred von Tirpitz, and the new leader of the I Squadron, "Vizeadmiral" August von Thomsen. These new strategies focused precise gunnery, particularly at longer ranges, however the necessities of the line-ahead arrangement prompted strategic unbending nature. Thomsen's accentuation on shooting made the reason for the incredible German gunnery amid World War I. Amid the terminating works out, "Weissenburg" won the Kaiser's "SchieÃÂpreis" (Shooting Prize) for phenomenal exactness in the I Squadron. The evening of 21Ã¢ÂÂ 22 August, the torpedo vessel incidentally slammed and sank one of "Weissenburg"s freight ships, slaughtering two men. The moves were finished by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. Toward the beginning of December, the I Division directed moves in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, however they were sliced short because of team deficiencies.
