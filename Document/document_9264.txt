Joined with the poached components, both new examples speak to nearly the whole skeleton of "Deinocheirus", as MPC-D 100/127 incorporates all material separated from the center dorsal vertebrae, most caudal vertebrae, and the correct forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in many holes of the other skeleton, with almost all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, an incomplete ischium, and the greater part of the left hindlimb. In 2014, the examples were depicted in the "Nature" diary by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee, Godefroit, EscuilliÃÂ©, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A comparable arrangement of occasions was accounted for before in 2014 with "Spinosaurus", another sail-upheld theropod which had just been known from few stays since 1912. Poached remains were brought together with examples acquired by researchers, and "Spinosaurus" was appeared to have been very not quite the same as different spinosaurids. The two cases demonstrated that the way of life and presence of not entirely realized wiped out creatures can't generally be securely gathered from close relatives. By 2017, the Mongolian government had expanded its push to catch poached fossils from gatherers and repatriate them, yet demonstrating their provenance had turned into a logical and political concern. Along these lines, an examination tried the likelihood of recognizing poached fossils by geochemical techniques, utilizing "Deinocheirus" and other Nemegt dinosaurs as models.
