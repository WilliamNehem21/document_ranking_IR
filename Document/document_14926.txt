Albeit a large portion of Saint-SaÃÂ«ns' musical dramas have stayed disregarded, Crichton rates them as essential ever of musical show, as "a scaffold among Meyerbeer and the genuine French musical shows of the mid 1890s". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-SaÃÂ«ns have, as a rule, the qualities and shortcomings of the remainder of his music Ã¢ÂÂ "clear Mozartian straightforwardness, more noteworthy consideration for structure than for substance... There is a sure enthusiastic dryness; innovation is now and again slight, yet the workmanship is perfect." Stylistically, Saint-SaÃÂ«ns drew on a scope of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the compelling utilization of the melody in the activity of a piece; for "Henry VIII" he included Tudor music he had investigated in London; in "La princesse jaune" he utilized an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he inferred the utilization of leitmotifs, which, similar to Massenet, he utilized sparingly. Huebner sees that Saint-SaÃÂ«ns was more ordinary than Massenet so far as through structure is concerned, all the more frequently supporting discrete arias and groups, with less assortment of rhythm inside individual numbers. In a study of recorded musical drama Alan Blyth composes that Saint-SaÃÂ«ns "positively gained much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of "Aida", and Wagner, however from these incredible models he fashioned his very own style."
