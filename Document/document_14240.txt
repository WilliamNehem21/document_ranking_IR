Prior to "Preliminary by Jury", W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan had worked together on one past musical show, "Thespis; or, The Gods Grown Old", in 1871. Albeit sensibly effective, it was a Christmas amusement, and such works were not expected to persevere. Among "Thespis" and "Preliminary by Jury", Gilbert and Sullivan did not team up on any further musical shows, and each man independently delivered works that further constructed his notoriety in his very own field. Gilbert composed a few short stories, altered the second volume of his comic "Bab Ballads", and made twelve dramatic works, including "Cheerful Arcadia" in 1872; "The Wicked World", "The Happy Land" and "The Realm of Joy" in 1873; "Philanthropy", "Topsyturveydom" and "Sweethearts" in 1874. In the meantime, Sullivan composed different bits of religious music, including the "Celebration Te Deum" (1872) and an oratorio, "The Light of the World" (1873), and altered "Church Hymns, with Tunes" (1874), which included 45 of his own songs and plans. Two of his most celebrated song tunes from this period are settings of "Ahead, Christian Soldiers" and "Closer, my God, to Thee" (both in 1872). He additionally composed a suite of accidental music to "The Merry Wives of Windsor" (1874) and numerous parlor anthems and different tunes, incorporating three in 1874Ã¢ÂÂ 75 with words by Gilbert: "The Distant Shore", "Sweethearts" (enlivened by Gilbert's play) and "The Love that Loves Me Not".
