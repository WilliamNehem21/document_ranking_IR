"The Nobodies" is a mournful, elegiac dirge over a clavecin Ã©lectrique and synthesized-drums. Its title is taken from a quote by Mark David Chapman. The verse "Today I am dirty and I want to be pretty, tomorrow I'll know that I'm just dirt" has an Iggy Pop-style vocal delivery, building to the "adrenaline-fueled" chorus. "CMJ" noted that the song could be interpreted as a tribute to the Columbine shooters, but its point was not to glorify violence; rather, it was to depict a society drenched in its children's blood. "The Death Song" is the turning point for Adam; he no longer cares. Manson described it as sarcastic and nihilistic: "it's like 'We have no future and we don't give a fuck'." "Kerrang!" described it as one of the album's heaviest songs. The bridge of "Lamb of God" paraphrases the chorus of "Across the Universe" (from 1970's "Let It Be"), whose lyric "Nothing's gonna change my world" inspired the song. Manson elaborated that: "Mark David Chapman came along and proved him very wrong. That was always something growing up that was very sad and tragic to me". The song uses the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to criticize media sensationalism, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. The song is keyboard-heavy featuring various instrumentation such as a piano, a minipiano, a leslie speaker, and multiple synthesizers. John 5's rhythm and acoustic guitar work were recorded in an unusual fashion. "Born Again" is the second song in the record to use the synth bass. It is primarily driven by Ramirez and John 5's guitars and is the only other song in the record, apart from "The Nobodies", to use the drum machine. "Burning Flag" is a heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band Ministry.
