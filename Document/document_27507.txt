Bartley and ÃÂ Briain showed the film to ChÃ¡vez in February 2003. They recalled his response as "quite emotional". BSÃ waived Venezuelan licensing fees for the film; on 13Â April, it was screened simultaneously with the television broadcast at a cinema in Caracas, before which ChÃ¡vez made a speech saying, "Watch this film and you will see the face of the coup." Pro-ChÃ¡vez activists also distributed the film unofficially. The Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador screened the film in New York City, where Bolivarian Circle members "accepted donations" for bootleg copies. "El Universal" said the Venezuelan government had 10,000 copies made, and according to "National Review", the Venezuela Information Office (VIO) "encouraged art-house theaters" to screen the film. Government representatives aided the film's distribution officially and unofficially. Venezuelan filmmaker Wolfgang Schalk said the film counted on the worldwide support of Venezuelan embassies and a public relations effort to show the film free at universities and theaters in cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Peace Action New York was given permission for a screening during a fund raiser in the Lincoln Center, where 250 people paid $35 (â¬30) each to see the film and take part in a "question-and-answer session" with guests such as Leonor Granado, the Venezuelan Consul General. The consulate office made DVDs of the film available to "anyone who wanted a copy", as Granado said the film was vital to "building support in [the US] for the Venezuelan government".
