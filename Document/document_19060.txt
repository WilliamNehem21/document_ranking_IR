Howard matriculated to the University of Michigan and joined his fellow freshmen for the 1991â92 Michigan Wolverines in forming a group that became known as the Fab Five. He also joined future NBA personalities Eric Riley and Rob Pelinka. As Michigan celebrated Midnight Madness on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended. (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.) Early in his freshman season, Howard started in some games and came off the bench in others for the highly rated Wolverines. Over time, he won a starting role from Riley. In Michigan's first matchup against Illinois, Howard scored 13Â points and denied Thomas the ball consistently enough to hold him to 8Â shots. His biggest contribution in the game was getting his hand on a loose ball to force a jump ball with 16Â seconds left and Michigan leading by only three points. In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Men's DivisionÂ I Basketball Tournament, Michigan faced a Jimmy Jackson-led Ohio State Buckeyes team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double-digit margins. Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the Wolverines' points.
