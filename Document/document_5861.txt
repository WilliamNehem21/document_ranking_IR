In spite of the fact that units portrayed as "legiones" existed as late as the fifth century in both the fringe and field armed forces, the legionary framework was altogether different from that of the principate and early realm. Since the term army kept on being utilized, it is hazy precisely when the structure and job of the armies changed. In the third or fourth century, be that as it may, the armies' job as first class overwhelming infantry was generously decreased and may have vanished completely. Rather, those "armies" that remained were never again drawn solely (and maybe scarcely by any stretch of the imagination) from Roman residents. Either Diocletian or Constantine rearranged the armies into littler infantry units who, as per a few sources, were more gently defensively covered than their progenitors. Their lighter weapon may have been either in light of the fact that they "would not agree to wear a similar load of body protective layer as the legionaries of old" or, as in something like one recorded occasion, since they were denied from wearing overwhelming covering by their general so as to build their portability. fourth century armies were now and again just a single 6th the extent of early royal armies, and they were furnished with a mix of lances, bows, slings, darts and swords, mirroring a more noteworthy contemporary accentuation on extended battling. The "auxilia" and "numeri" had likewise to a great extent vanished. Constantine further expanded the extent of German troops in the normal armed force; their social effect was great to the point that even legionaries started wearing German dress. Toward the beginning of Diocletian's rule, the Roman armed force numbered around 390,000 men, however before the finish of his rule he effectively expanded the number to 581,000 men.
