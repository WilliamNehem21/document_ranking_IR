The principal atomic reactor in the UK, a little 100ÃÂ kW research reactor known as GLEEP, went basic at Harwell on 15 August 1947. It was fuelled by of uranium metal and of uranium dioxide, and utilized of atomic graphite as a neutron mediator. This was fine for some test work, yet the creation of radioactive isotopes required an all the more dominant 6,000ÃÂ kW reactor with a higher neutron transition. English staff at the Montreal Laboratory had planned BEPO in 1945 and 1946; Risley took care of the designing and development. The key decisions in reactor configuration are the choice of the fuel, the neutron arbitrator, and the coolant. Since improved uranium was inaccessible, the main accessible fuel was characteristic uranium. So also, while the Montreal Laboratory had involvement with planning and building the ZEEP substantial water reactor in Canada, no overwhelming water was accessible in the UK, so graphite was the main decision for a neutron arbitrator. That left cooling, and for an exploratory reactor, air cooling was the undeniable decision. The subsequent reactor was along these lines very like the American X-10 Graphite Reactor. BEPO, which went basic on 5 July 1948, utilized of metallic uranium and of graphite, encased in of steel and of cement.
