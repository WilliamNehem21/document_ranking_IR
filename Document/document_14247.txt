Regarding profound sky objects, Leo Minor contains numerous cosmic systems visible in novice telescopes. Found 3ÃÂ degrees southeast of 38 Leonis Minoris, NGC 3432 is seen about edge on. Known as the weaving needle universe, it is of evident magnitudeÃÂ 11.7 and measures 6.8 by 1.4 arcminutes. Found 42ÃÂ million light-years away, it is moving far from the Solar System at a rate of 616ÃÂ km every second. In 2000, a star inside the world lit up to size 17.4, and has since been resolved to be an iridescent blue variable and supernova impostor. NGCÃÂ 3003, a SBbc banished winding system with an obvious greatness of 12.3 and a rakish size of 5.8ÃÂ arcminutes, is seen nearly edge-on. NGC 3344, 25ÃÂ million light-years removed, is face-on towards Earth. Estimating 7.1 by 6.5ÃÂ arcminutes in size, it has an evident extent of 10.45. NGCÃÂ 3504 is a starburst banned winding universe of clear magnitudeÃÂ 11.67 and estimating 2.1ÃÂ by 2.7ÃÂ arcminutes. It has facilitated supernovae in 1998 and 2001. It and the winding world NGCÃÂ 3486 are likewise nearly face-on towards Earth; the last is of magnitudeÃÂ 11.05 and measures 7.1ÃÂ by 5.2ÃÂ arcminutes. NGCÃÂ 2859 is a SB0-type lenticular system.
