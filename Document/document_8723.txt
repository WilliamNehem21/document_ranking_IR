Harrison utilized Campbell's picture channel hypothesis, which was the most developed channel hypothesis accessible at the time. In this hypothesis, channel configuration is seen basically as an impedance coordinating issue. Further developed channel hypothesis was presented as a powerful influence for this issue by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs. Norton pursued a similar general methodology however he later depicted to Darlington the channel he planned as being "maximally level". Norton's mechanical plan originates before the paper by Butterworth who is typically attributed as the first to portray the electronic maximally level channel. The conditions Norton gives for his channel relate to an independently ended Butterworth channel, that is, one driven by a perfect voltage source with no impedance, while the structure all the more typically given in writings is for the doubly ended channel with resistors at the two finishes, making it difficult to perceive the plan for what it is. Another uncommon element of Norton's channel configuration emerges from the arrangement capacitor, which speaks to the firmness of the stomach. This is the main arrangement capacitor in Norton's portrayal, and without it, the channel could be broke down as a low-pass model. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the channel to the contribution to the detriment of bringing a transformer into the proportional circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has utilized here the "turning round the L" impedance change to accomplish this.
