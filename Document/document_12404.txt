Sunlight enabled helicopter activities to start. On 21 May, helicopters conveyed 288 burdens, moving 520 work force and of stores from 11 boats to 21 destinations. STUFT were emptied at a rate of every hour, and the LSLs could be emptied at every hour, the exercise being that STUFT were a poor substitute for reason fabricated land and/or water capable vessels. Need was given to moving the six L118 light firearms of 79 Commando Battery, 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, shorewards. Moving a battery with 500 rounds for every weapon required 85 Sea King forays. The following need was to position the Rapiers of T battery, yet attributable to the deferrals in the finding, the Rapier destinations were not verified until around noontime. For the most part situated on peaks where there were no streets or tracks, the Rapiers must be sited by helicopter. On the off chance that they must be moved, regardless of whether yards or miles, another helicopter fight was called for. Nobody knew for certain what the impact of seven weeks' ocean voyage would be on the gear, however the requirement for air protection was self-evident, as the Argentine aviation based armed forces made rehashed assaults on boats in Falkland Sound. Two Gazelle helicopters were lost.
