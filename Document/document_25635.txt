At dawn, civilians began massing outside the palace gates, verbally encouraging the rebels and waving banners advocating regime change. Saigon Radio announced that a "Revolutionary Council" was in charge of South Vietnam's government. Diá»m appeared lost, while many Saigon-based ARVN troops rallied to the insurgents. According to Nguyá»n ThÃ¡i BÃ¬nh, an exiled political rival, "Diá»m was lost. Any other than he would have capitulated." However, the rebels hesitated as they decided their next move. There was debate on what Diá»m's role would be in future. ÄÃ´ng felt that the rebels should take the opportunity of storming the palace and capturing Diá»m. Thi on the other hand, was worried that Diá»m could be killed in an attack. Thi felt that despite Diá»m's shortcomings, the president was South Vietnam's best available leader, believing that enforced reform would yield the best outcome. The rebels wanted Nhu and his wife out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to kill or deport the couple.
Thi demanded that Diá»m appoint an officer as prime minister and that Diá»m remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorised by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diá»m was being removed because he was corrupt and suppressed liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diá»m sent his private secretary Vo Van Hai to negotiate with the coup leaders. In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep abreast of their demands, which they reiterated. The rebels' negotiators were ÄÃ´ng and Major Nguyen Huy Loi. They wanted officers and opposition figures to be appointed to a new government to keep Diá»m in check.
