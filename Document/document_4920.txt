The 21st crossed the Rappahannock on December 12 by means of the barge connects that had been built by the Union armed force and went through the night along the west bank of the stream. On the morning of the thirteenth, the regiment was requested toward the west piece of the city, close to the base of the statures. Here they evacuated the dark jackets that had been issued to them inspired by a paranoid fear of being confused with Confederates. From this position, the 21st watched a strike by a segment of the II Corps over the open plain prompting statures and were stunned by the gore that came about because of the fizzled assault. Soon after this ambush, Ferrero's unit was requested to assault the statures and the 21st shaped a line of fight on the open ground somewhat evening. The 21st progressed, as indicated by Walcott, "under the best coordinated mounted guns shoot we had ever endured or seen." Color bearers were over and again shot down. One, Sgt. Thomas Plunkett, was hit by a gunnery shell that removed his correct arm and left hand. Regardless of his injuries, he figured out how to shield the hues from falling. The banner is today in the accumulation at the Massachusetts State House and still bears the stains from Plunkett's injuries. Plunkett was granted the Medal of Honor for his dauntlessness at Fredericksburg.
