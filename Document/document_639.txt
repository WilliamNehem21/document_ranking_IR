The Ridge Route crosses the West Branch California Aqueduct with SR 138, part toward the northwest on Gorman Post Road. It rejoins the way of I-5 at Gorman, and, from Gorman as far as possible at Grapevine, the greater part of the old street has been secured over by the Ridge Route Alternate or I-5. The way of the Ridge Route is currently named Peace Valley Road and Lebec Road, disregarding Tejon Pass and past Lebec and Fort Tejon. Past Fort Tejon, the course slips through Grapevine Canyon to Grapevine (named for grapevines in the region). The best-known bend out and about, Deadman's Curve or Death Curve, is unmistakable from Digier Road on the west side of I-5. The following piece of the old street that still exists is close to the base of the level, where various bends conveyed the street down to Grapevine. The first arrangement was to assemble the street closer to the focal point of the gully, yet a March 1914 flood obliterated the work, and the reviewing was revamped higher up. Deadman's Curve and the Grapevine circles were both skirted by the Ridge Route Alternate, which was fabricated legitimately over the greater part of the old street around there. At Grapevine, the land all of a sudden straightens out, and the street north of Grapevine was the longest straight segment of street in the stateÃ¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ in 1926. A large portion of this street lies under I-5 and SR 99, however the southernmost piece in Grapevine was skirted by the Alternate, and is presently in the middle of I-5.
