Albeit Victorian painting styles left design not long after Watts' demise, "Expectation" has remained incredibly powerful. Imprint Bills, caretaker of the Watts Gallery, depicted "Expectation" as "the most celebrated and compelling" of every one of Watts' works of art and "a gem of the late nineteenth-century Symbolist development". In 1889 communist instigator John Burns visited Samuel and Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel, and saw a photo of "Expectation" among their assets. After Henrietta disclosed its centrality to him, endeavors were made by the alliance of specialists' gatherings which were to turn into the Labor Party to enroll Watts. Albeit resolved to remain outside of governmental issues, Watts wrote in help of striking busmen in 1891, and in 1895 gave a chalk proliferation of "Expectation" to the Missions to Seamen in Poplar in help of London dock specialists. (This is accepted to be the red chalk adaptation of "Expectation" presently in the Watts Gallery.) The latency of Watts' portrayal of Hope drew analysis from some inside the communist development, who considered her to be typifying a reluctance to resolve to activity. The unmistakable workmanship faultfinder Charles Lewis Hind additionally detested this lack of involvement, writing in 1902 that "It's anything but a work that the vigorous appreciate, however the lone and the pitiful discover comfort in it. It mirrors the quite, pitiable, sad any desire for the individuals who are reviled with a low imperativeness, and poor physical wellbeing".
