The magazine was every other month until the March 1954 issue, which was trailed by April 1954, initiating a month to month time span that kept running until June 1955. This was trailed by August 1955, continuing an every other month plan that kept running until July 1964, with just a single abnormality, when the February 1959 issue was trailed by July 1959. After July 1964, "If" ran a month to month plan until April 1970, with three exclusions: there were no issues dated September 1964, June 1969, or August 1969. From MayÃ¢ÂÂ June 1970, the issues were every other month and bore the names of two months. This every other month grouping went through the last issue toward the finish of 1974. The date the magazine imprinted on the spread returned to a solitary month with the June 1971 issue, however the substance page still utilized two months to recognize the issue. The volume numbering started with six issues to a volume: there were three mistakes on the magazine substance page, with volume 8 number 1 inaccurately printed as volume 7 number 6; volume 9 number 3 printed as volume 8 number 6; and volume 10 number 1 printed as volume 10 number 6. Volume 14, which started in March 1964, went through the year's end, with seven numbers; the rest of the volumes had 12 numbers each aside from volume 19 which had 10 and volume 22 which had 8.
