In the DVD critique for the scene, Shearsmith and Pemberton communicated an expectation that Pemberton's crossword could be distributed before the scene's airing, with the goal that watchers would almost certainly watch the scene having accidentally officially finished the crossword around which it spins. Pemberton's crossword was distributed in "The Guardian" around the same time that the scene circulated, credited to "Sphinx"; for one commentator, this clarified and advocated the appropriate response "MYSTERYGUEST". The coordinated effort between "Inside No. 9" and "The Guardian" drew motivation from the coordinated effort between "The Simpsons" and "The New York Times" for "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" in 2008. Pemberton devoted the crossword, which was his first in print, to the late Kenny Ireland. Both of them had finished the "Gatekeeper" crossword day by day while recording together for the TV satire "Benidorm". Permitting an erratic commitment from a non-ordinary setter was profoundly strange for "The Guardian", whose crosswords are typically created by one of around 25 customary setters. Pemberton, again composing as "Sphinx", proceeded to distribute a further obscure crossword in "The Guardian" in 2018, amid the airing of the fourth arrangement of "Inside No. 9". The riddle worked freely of any references to "Inside No. 9", however included "an additional layer for ["Inside No. 9"] watchers".
