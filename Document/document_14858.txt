Because of the idea of the shooting plan, the scene was generally modest to film and generation moved at a speedy pace. At first, the on-screen characters battled with the new cinÃÂ©ma vÃÂ©ritÃÂ© style of the scene, and a few takes were required for scenes amid the initial couple of days, yet these issues retreated as shooting advanced.
