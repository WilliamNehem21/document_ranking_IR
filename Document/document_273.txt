Alan Simpson, the co-essayist of "Hancock", delighted recorded as a hard copy for Jacques, and imagined that she was "practically like a fella regarding playing satire; you didn't compose for her reasoning she's a lady so we must compose the ladylike perspective. That made it simpler for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a "finished disclosure", including "in spite of the fact that she was a huge woman (substantial, indeed), her developments were dainty, light and smooth, and she had a method for playing satire that place me as a primary concern of the incomparable Beatrice LillieÃÂ ... an unobtrusive, advanced on-screen character". Her companion Bob Monkhouse felt that her vocation was dominated by her size: "She was such an incredible comedienneÃÂ ... everybody needed her yet the movers and shakers of excitement didn't see her as something besides a fat woman". Fellow Pearce, writing in the "Every day Express", noticed that "she generally played ladies in interesting circumstances, instead of allude legitimately to her weight. She focused on the content and its understanding as opposed to winning simple chuckles by playing 'the fattie'." The methodology of journalists varied by they way they managed the characters they requested that Jacques depict. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been "blandly given a role as the 'chunky individual'" in "ITMA", while in "Sykes", her weight was once in a while alluded toÃ¢ÂÂand Jacques said that Sykes "barely ever constructed jokes about my size which was an invigorating change". Dim thinks about that "albeit frequently cast in expansive satire, she never played it extensively, yet with a tastefulness of voice and body that gave a false representation of all the platitudes about ladies and weight".
