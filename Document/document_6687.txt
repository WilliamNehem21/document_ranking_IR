The competition created a benefit of ÃÂ£10 and the horse roller remained being used. At the point when the competition was done, Henry Jones accumulated all the score cards to examine the outcomes and found that, of the 601 diversions played amid the competition, 376 were won by the server ("striker-in") and 225 by the recipient ("striker-out"). When the administration was either made underarm or, normally, at shoulder tallness, this was viewed as a serving predominance and brought about an adjustment of the guidelines for the 1878 Championship. To diminish the objective region for the server, the length of the administration court was decreased from 26 to 22ÃÂ ft (7.92 to 6.71ÃÂ m) and to make passing shots simpler against volleyers the tallness of the net was decreased to 4ÃÂ ft 9 in (1.45ÃÂ m) at the posts and 3 feet (0.91ÃÂ m) at the inside. These standards were distributed together by the AEC and LTC and the MCC, giving the AEC and LTC an official guideline making expert and essentially retroactively authorizing its 1877 tenets. It denoted the minute when the AEC and LTC successfully usurped the standard making activity from the MCC in spite of the fact that the last would even now endorse rule changes until 1882. In acknowledgment of the significance and ubiquity of garden tennis, the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).
