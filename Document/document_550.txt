At the point when Joseph left Girton, the First World War was at a basic express; the Battle of the Somme had started on 1 July 1916. Joseph needed to help the war exertion, and in the wake of thinking about work on the land or in a weapons processing plant, occupied low maintenance welfare work in Islington. In the fall of 1916 she started instructing at Eothen, a little tuition based school for young ladies in Caterham, established and kept running by the Misses Catharine and Winifred Pye. In 1917 Holst's ten-year-old girl Imogen began at the school; soon, under Joseph's direction the youthful student was making her own music. Joseph broadened her own melodic exercises by joining the ensemble at Morley College, where Holst was the executive of music and where her sibling Edwin had played the cello before the war. At first she played the twofold bass, however later took French horn exercises, perhaps from Adolph Borsdorf; even later, at short notice, she showed herself the timpani part for a late spring show. By 1918 she was an individual from the Morley board of trustees that on 9 March sorted out and created a musical drama vaudeville, "English Opera as She is Wrote", in which English, Italian, German, French and Russian musical show styles were mocked in progressive scenes. The execution was an extraordinary achievement and was rehashed at a few settings. It might have propelled Holst to utilize spoof in his own musical show, "The Perfect Fool", which he started forming in 1918. In her extra time Joseph established and ran a choir for Kensington babysitters, which partook in nearby singing challenges as the "Linden Singers".
