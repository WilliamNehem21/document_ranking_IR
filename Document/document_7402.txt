The first osteoderms behind the second cervical half-ring would have been comparable fit as a fiddle to those in the half-ring, and the osteoderms on the back most likely diminished in breadth hindwards. The biggest osteoderms were likely masterminded in transverse and longitudinal columns crosswise over the greater part of the body, with four or five transverse lines isolated by wrinkles in the skin. The osteoderms on the flanks would most likely have had a more square blueprint than those on the back. There may have been four longitudinal lines of osteoderms on the flanks. Not at all like some basal ankylosaurs and numerous nodosaurs, ankylosaurids don't seem to have had co-hardened pelvic shields over their hips. Some osteoderms without keels may have been set over the hip area of "Ankylosaurus", as in "Euoplocephalus". "Ankylosaurus" may have had three or four transverse lines of roundabout osteoderms over the pelvic district, which were littler than those on the remainder of the body, as in "Scolosaurus". Littler, triangular osteoderms may have been available on the sides of the pelvis. Smoothed, pointed plates look like those on the sides of the tail of "Saichania". Osteoderms with oval keels could have been put on the upper side of the tail or the side of the appendages. Compacted, triangular osteoderms found with "Ankylosaurus" examples may have been set on the sides of the pelvis or the tail. Ovoid, keeled, and tear formed osteoderms are known from "Ankylosaurus", and may have been put on the forelimbs, similar to those known from "Pinacosaurus", however it is obscure whether the hindlimbs bore osteoderms.
