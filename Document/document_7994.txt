The club was established on 16 October 1878 as a beginner side known as Ipswich A.F.C., under the administration of nearby MP Thomas Cobbold who had played football at Charterhouse School. George S Sherrington and J. M. Franks were chosen joint Captains. Ipswich A.F.C's. first match was a 6Ã¢ÂÂ 1 home triumph over Stoke Wanderers at the Broom Hill ground on 2 November 1878. This was trailed by a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 0 triumph over Harwich in the club's first away match. Losing just a single diversion in 17 in its second season, the club had the capacity to fabricate enough enthusiasm to enlist players for a second group. Ipswich recorded their greatest ever triumph amid the 1880Ã¢ÂÂ 81 season, a 15Ã¢ÂÂ 0 thrashing of East Stamford with one player, John Knights, enlisting a treble cap trap; the two accomplishments remain club records. The group moved to Portman Road, the present ground, in 1884, and would share, until 1936, the offices with the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The Cobbold family inclusion proceeded with when, in 1885, Nathanael Fromanteel Cobbold was chosen as a VP of the club. Following his unexpected demise the next year, the position was then held by his nephew John Dupuis Cobbold.
