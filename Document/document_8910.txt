In spite of his freshly discovered top prospect status Houtteman stayed in Buffalo toward the start of the 1947 season before being reviewed to the Tigers in July. He was consigned to the warm up area for a period, and saw little activity. Be that as it may, after Hal Newhouser, Fred Hutchinson and Dizzy Trout were utilized in two days, Tiger supervisor Steve O'Neill chose to begin Houtteman against the Washington Senators for just the second beginning of his vocation. He hurled a five-hit shutout and Tiger general chief Billy Evans stated, "In 40ÃÂ years I've never observed a superior pitching work by a first-year pitcher. We presently realize that Houtteman is extremely a major leaguer". He pursued this with another five-hit triumph against the Boston Red Sox, at that point contributed a three-hit shutout September against the St. Louis Browns. He completed the season at 7Ã¢ÂÂ 2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete diversions and two shutouts. His execution in 1947 grabbed the eye of New York Yankees star and future Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who said of Houtteman and Bob Lemon, "They have more stuff and more pitching sense than some other youthful colleagues I've seen come up in a drawn-out period of time".
