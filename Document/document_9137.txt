In 2012, Hathaway's book recording of L. Forthcoming Baum's "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" was discharged at Audible.com and collected her a selection for an Audie Award for Best Solo Narration ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Female. Later in 2012, Hathaway played guileful, ethically equivocal feline criminal Selina Kyle in "The Dark Knight Rises", Christopher Nolan's last portion in "The Dark Knight" set of three. Hathaway tried out not realizing what job she was being considered for, conceding that she had one character as a main priority, yet just taken in her job in the wake of conversing with Nolan for 60 minutes. She depicted the job as the most physically requesting she had ever played, as she needed to try harder in the rec center to stay aware of the necessities of the job. Hathaway prepared broadly in combative techniques for the job, and looked to Hedy Lamarr in building up her job as Catwoman. "The Dark Knight Rises" got a positive basic reaction and earned more than $1.085 billion around the world, turning into the third-most astounding netting film of 2012. An audit distributed in IGN composed of her "attractive nearness", including, "Hathaway pervades her [character] with an injured soul and a survivor's edge that makes her vibe authentic and thoughtful". Hathaway won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her execution.
