A few variables clarify the withdrawal of the RAAF's Vengeances from battle. Odgers made a decision about that a key purpose for the choice was the poor execution of the Vengeance contrasted with other accessible flying machine in the district. USAAF units furnished with prevalent kinds were touching base in New Guinea amid mid 1944, and Kenney needed to free up rare space at forward runways so he could dispatch assaults on the critical Japanese bases at Wewak and Hollandia; these objectives were past the scope of the Vengeance. Specifically, No. 77 Wing was required to empty Nadzab with the goal that its runways could oblige a gathering of since quite a while ago extended Lockheed P-38 Lightning warriors. Odgers likewise contended that the Vengeances had ended up being precisely temperamental, and experienced issues taking off while conveying a full bomb load: practically speaking it was discovered that they could convey just a similar bomb load as Kittyhawk warriors. The Kittyhawks were likewise unrivaled at strafing targets and did not should be escorted. A 2008 paper composed by staff of the RAAF's Air Power Development Center questioned Odgers' perspectives on the dependability of the flying machine, expressing that No. 77 Wing had a decent functionality rate. This paper rather contended that troubles in providing the wing may have been a progressively imperative factor.
