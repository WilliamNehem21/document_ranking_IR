On 2 August 1990, third Battalion was finishing a sending at Camp Hansen on Okinawa when they were told to be set up to quickly redeploy to Saudi Arabia as a reaction to the Iraqi intrusion of Kuwait. No sooner had the contingent come back to Hawaii then it was sent out again to Saudi Arabia as a feature of the first Marine Expeditionary Brigade. India Company conveyed first on 15 August to Singapore to give locally available security to Maritime Prepositioning ships destined for the port of Al Jubayl. On 1 September, the remainder of the legion touched base in Dahran. As one of the main Marine units in nation, third Battalion ended up guarding a key position at Cement Ridge, about 90ÃÂ kilometers far from the Kuwaiti outskirt. With requests to hold against any Iraqi assault, third Battalion went through a large portion of the long periods of August and September burrowing guarded positions. In October, third Battalion and second Battalion, third Marines were assigned "Team Taro" and moved to the extraordinary right flank of the Marine division, circumscribing the King Abdul Aziz Brigade of the Saudi Arabian National Guard. On account of their closeness, Taro was requested to start broadly educating with the Saudi powers. This broadly educating proceeded through January, when third Battalion was pushed ahead to guard Al Mish'ab along the Saudi coast and turned into the northernmost Marine battle drive in Saudi Arabia. Grievously amid this time the unit lost two Marines, James Cunningham and Anthony Stewart, who were incidentally killed by careless releases.
