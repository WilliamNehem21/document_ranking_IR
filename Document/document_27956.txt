After learning to program BASIC on a Tandy 1000 and becoming interested in computer and video games, he applied for a job as a game tester at Westwood studios. He submitted his demo tapeâdescribed as "an acoustic guitar song with electric guitar leads and keyboard strings, and raining sound effects"âto the company's audio director. The growing company enlisted him as a composer for the NES port of "DragonStrike" and the computer game "Eye of the Beholder II". He later composed with MIDI sequencing for several other "Dungeons & Dragons" games. In 1992, he helmed the audio of "Dune II", attempting to complement the music of the original "Dune". He later noted that he pushed the sequencing program on his Amiga to the limit while scoring the game. While working on "Disney's The Lion King" in 1994, he and the Westwood team were shown sketches of the unfinished feature film. Film composer Hans Zimmer later praised Klepacki for reworking his scores. After finishing the third entry into "The Legend of Kyrandia" series; "Malcolm's Revenge", Frank Klepacki met with Westwood leaders to discuss the upcoming game "Command & Conquer"âthe first in a series which would bring him wider fame and critical acclaim.
