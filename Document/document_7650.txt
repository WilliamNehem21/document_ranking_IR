The British diplomat to Brazil was against the arranged maritime development, despite the fact that the requests went to a British organization, for its extensive expense and its negative impacts on relations among Brazil and Argentina. He considered it to be "an epitome of national vanity, joined with individual thought processes of a financial character." The American represetative to Brazil was frightened, and sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, cautioning them of the destabilization that would happen if the circumstance lapsed into a full maritime weapons contest. In the meantime, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt took a stab at utilizing conciliatory intends to pressure the Brazilians into dropping their boats, however the endeavors were expelled, with the Baron of Rio Branco commenting that giving in to the American requests would render Brazil as weak as Cuba, whose new constitution enabled the American government to intercede in Cuban issues. The new President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, upheld the maritime acquisitions in a location to the National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as he would see it the boats were important to supplant "AquidabÃÂ£", which startlingly exploded that year, and the out of date vessels creating the present naval force.
