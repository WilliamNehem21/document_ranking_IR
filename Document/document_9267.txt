Parkinson characterizes stories as "...non-memorial, non-utilitarian, anecdotal accounts" that typically utilize the watchword "describe" ("sdd"). He portrays it as the most open-finished classification, since the stories regularly join components of other scholarly types. For instance, Morenz depicts the opening area of the outside experience story "Sinuhe" as a "...funerary self-introduction" that spoofs the ordinary collection of memoirs found on memorial funerary . The personal history is for a dispatch whose administration started under Amenemhat I. Simpson expresses that the passing of Amenemhat I in the report given by his child, coregent, and successor Senusret I (r. 1971Ã¢ÂÂ 1926 BC) to the military in the start of "Sinuhe" is "...excellent purposeful publicity". Morenz portrays "The wrecked mariner" as an expeditionary report and a movement story fantasy. Simpson takes note of the abstract gadget of the story inside a story in "The wrecked mariner" may give "...the soonest instances of an account quarrying report". With the setting of a mysterious desert island, and a character who is a talking snake, "The wrecked mariner" may likewise be named a fantasy. While stories like "Sinuhe", "Taking of Joppa", and the "Bound ruler" contain anecdotal depictions of Egyptians abroad, the "Report of Wenamun" is no doubt dependent on a genuine record of an Egyptian who made a trip to Byblos in Phoenicia to get cedar for shipbuilding amid the rule of Ramesses XI.
