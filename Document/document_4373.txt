Hathaway featured close by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ang Lee's show "Brokeback Mountain" (2005). The film portrays the enthusiastic and sexual connection between two wedded men, Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal); Hathaway played Jack's significant other. She was initially sent the content with the job of Alma, Ennis' significant other, however chose to try out for Lureen once she read the screenplay. Amid her tryout, Hathaway misled Lee about her insight into pony riding so he would cast her, however she did in this manner take horse riding exercises. The film got positive audits from faultfinders and a few Academy Award assignments. Diminish Travers of "Moving Stone" trusted that Hathaway "exceeds expectations at demonstrating Lureen's adventure from cutie-pie to hard case", and Todd McCarthy of "Assortment" opined she "gives an engaging complexity in wifely disillusionment". Hathaway later expressed that the substance of the film could really compare to its honor tally and that creation it made her increasingly mindful of the sort of stories she needed to tell as a performing artist. By then, she understood that she needed to assume jobs to move her groups of onlookers or generally engage them so much that they disregard their own lives.
