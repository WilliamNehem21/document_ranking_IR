As the first season of "Homicide" progressed, NBC officials complained to the show's producers about the large number of subplots, but the producers resisted the pressure to scale them back until the . Despite intense advance promotion of the "Homicide" premiere due to a planned Super Bowl lead-in, Attanasio deliberately sought to introduce the show with little fanfare, avoiding sensational gimmicks in favor of character-driven plot, quirky dialogue and morbid dark humor. "Homicide" was noted for its deliberate lack of gun-play and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. The writers also wanted the dialogue to reflect the kinds of things detectives would talk about when not discussing murders or cases, which led to the inclusion of several scenes in which detectives talk casually among themselves during lunch or around the office.

Fontana, who compared the scenes to Levinson's 1982 film "Diner", said, "That really made the show different from other shows, because we had the room to have conversations that seemingly didn't [storywise] connect anything, but they did reveal a lot about the characters."
