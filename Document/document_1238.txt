"Marquee Moon" was a standout amongst the most persuasive records from the 1970s and has been refered to by faultfinders as a foundation of elective shake. It vigorously impacted the outside the box shake development of the 1980s, while post-punk acts appropriated the collection's uncluttered creation, contemplative tone, and carefully performed instrumentation. Seeker Felt from "PopMatters" credited "Marquee Moon"s effect on post-punk and new wave acts to the definitely syncopated beat area of Fred Smith and Billy Ficca. He suggested 2003's "conclusive" reissue of the collection to audience members of carport shake restoration groups, who he said had displayed themselves after Verlaine's Romantic verse enlivened verses and the "fatigued yet some way or another ardent criticism" of his vocals. As indicated by Sputnikmusic's Adam Downer, Television presented a phenomenal style of shake and move on "Marquee Moon" that initiated post-punk music, while "The Guardian" said it scaled "stunning new statures of refinement and power" as an "exquisite, ringing signal of post-punk" in spite of being discharged a while before the Sex Pistols' "Don't bother the Bollocks" (1977). AllMusic manager Stephen Thomas Erlewine trusted the record was imaginative for forsaking past New York punk collections' swing and depression sensibilities for a mentally animating degree that Television accomplished instrumentally instead of melodiously. He guaranteed "it's difficult to envision post-punk soundscapes" without "Marquee Moon". Fletcher contended that the tunes' absence of pressure, score, and additional impacts gave "an outline for a type of chromatic, instead of cadenced, music that would later come to be called rakish".
