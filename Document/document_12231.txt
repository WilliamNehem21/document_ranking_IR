The historical backdrop of Nuffield College dates from 16 November 1937, when the college entered a Deed of Covenant and Trust with Lord Nuffield. Nuffield, known as William Morris before he was raised to the peerage, was an industrialist and the author of Morris Motors, which was situated in Cowley, east Oxford. For the production of Nuffield College and for his different gifts (which included financing a seat of Spanish investigations and giving ÃÂ£2ÃÂ million in 1936 for a school of medicinal research), he was depicted in 1949 by a publication in "The Times" as "the best promoter of the University since the Middle Ages". He gave arrive on New Road, toward the west of the downtown area close to the hill of Oxford Castle, on the site of the generally neglected bowl of the Oxford Canal. In 1937, "The Times" depicted the half-mile between the railroad station and the city (a region including the site of the proposed school) as "something between a deny store and a ghetto"; Nuffield had initially purchased the channel bowl to improve that piece of the city before he had building a school to achieve this. Just as the land, Nuffield offered ÃÂ£900,000 to construct the school and to furnish it with an enrichment subsidize.
