The air leader on board "Ark Royal"Ã¢ÂÂ mindful that the enduring Dorniers would report the area of the British boatsÃ¢ÂÂrequested the air ship to be verified and the counter flying machine weapons prepared. Four Junkers Ju 88 planes of the "Luftwaffe" plane wing KG 30 before long showed up: three were headed out by hostile to air ship fire, however the fourth propelled a bomb at the transporter. "Ark Royal" swung hard to starboard, behaving over and staying away from the bomb, which arrived in the sea off her starboard bow and sent a gush of water over the ship. The German pilots did not check whether the transporter had been hit, and an observation flight later found the two warships, yet not "Ark Royal". In view of this data, the Germans inaccurately asserted that "Ark Royal" had sunk. To refute the German publicity before it negatively affected Britain's partners, Winston Churchill actually consoled United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the bearer was whole and welcomed the US maritime attachÃÂ© to see "Ark Royal" in dock. The British maritime attachÃÂ© in Rome was told to guarantee Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini that the ship was still in administration. This was a humiliation for Goebbels and Nazi promulgation.
