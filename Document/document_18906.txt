Philip Day of "The Sunday Times" noted "How wincingly well Mr Fleming writes", while the reviewer for "The Times", thought that "[t]his is an ingenious affair, full of recondite knowledge and horrific spills and thrills â of slightly sadistic excitements also â though without the simple and bold design of its predecessor". Elizabeth L Sturch, writing in "The Times Literary Supplement", observed that Fleming was "without doubt the most interesting recent recruit among thriller-writers" and that "Live and Let Die" "fully maintains the promise ofÂ ... "Casino Royale"." Tempering her praise of the book, Sturch thought that "Mr Fleming works often on the edge of flippancy, rather in the spirit of a highbrow", although overall she felt that the novel "contains passages which for sheer excitement have not been surpassed by any modern writer of this kind". The reviewer for "The Daily Telegraph" felt that "the book is continually exciting, whether it takes us into the heart of Harlem or describes an underwater swim in shark-infested waters; and it is more entertaining because Mr Fleming does not take it all too seriously himself". George Malcolm Thompson, writing in "The Evening Standard", believed "Live and Let Die" to be "tense; ice-cold, sophisticated; Peter Cheyney for the carriage trade".
