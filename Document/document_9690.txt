A portion of the coinage which had disappeared from dissemination amid the Civil War and had been sent out to South America kept on being utilized in Chilean exchange as nationals found their nearby coinage esteemed ineffectively with the American pieces. In 1866, the Chilean government educated its delegate in Washington to approach the U.S. State Department for authorization to have their coinage passes on made in America. The Andrew Johnson organization was glad to oblige; Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch gave the Chileans a letter of prologue to Longacre in Philadelphia. Longacre was locked in by the Chileans to overhaul five silver and four gold coins, and he concurred, inasmuch as consent from McCulloch was acquired for him to acknowledge an outside charge. McCulloch was at first pleasing, yet Mint Director Pollock raised protest on the ground that administration property ought not be utilized to empower private addition.

Paquet, one of his previous collaborators. Obstruction at the Mint broke up with Pollock's acquiescence over President Johnson's Reconstruction strategies, and the bites the dust and center points (from which more passes on could be made) were made start in November 1866, likely in-house at the Philadelphia Mint. Longacre's structures for Chile were utilized until new ones were embraced during the 1890s.
