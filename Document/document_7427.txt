In the mid-to late-1940s, the Menominee clan was considered by an administration study to distinguish clans for end, a procedure in which government acknowledgment of the clan would be pulled back and the clan would never again be subject to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to help them. The Menominee were believed to be a clan that could be ended in light of the fact that they were one of the most extravagant clans in the country. The government believed that end would enable the innate individuals to be absorbed into standard American culture, ending up dedicated, charge paying, beneficial natives. In 1954, Congress ended the governmentally perceived status of the clan with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. As per the terms of the Termination Act, the governmentally perceived status was to finish in 1958. The clan and the territory of Wisconsin effectively campaigned for a postponement in the usage of end until 1961. The clan was against end for various reasons; their worries incorporated the loss of ancestral culture, the loss of land because of assessment liens, the likelihood of chapter 11 and loss of the innate timber industry, and the absence of inborn individuals who were prepared to run a region government. The province of Wisconsin was worried that with no industry for the clan to assess, the state would be in charge of the substantial budgetary cost that would be required to keep up legislative activities for the previous reservation.
