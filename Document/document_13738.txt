Multnomah and Clackamas regions were named after gatherings of Native Americans who lived in the territory before settlement by European Americans in the 19thÃÂ century. Proof recommends that individuals lived in the northern Oregon Cascades as ahead of schedule as 10,000ÃÂ years prior. By 2,000 to 3,000ÃÂ years prior, the Clackamas River bowl, about upriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek and on the east side of the Willamette, was home to the Clackamas clan. They were a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived close to the Columbia River from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands incorporated the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what moved toward becoming Oregon City to its conversion with the Columbia River. Whenever Lewis and Clark visited the region in 1806, the Clackamas clan comprised of about 1,800ÃÂ people living in 11ÃÂ villages. Pestilences of smallpox, intestinal sickness, and measles decreased this populace to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the clan marked a settlement surrendering its territories. Another gathering of Chinookans, the Multnomahs, lived on Sauvie Island, about downriver from the mouth of Tryon Creek. Lewis and Clark evaluated that 800ÃÂ Multnomahs occupied 5ÃÂ villages on the island in 1806, however malady decreased them later in the century to close termination.
