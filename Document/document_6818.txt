Eric Stokes passed on out of the blue in 1962, an encounter which left Constance deprived; a long-term companion said that she never truly recouped. Looked with a generous home loan to support, Stokes came back to work: painting. After two years, she opened her initial one-lady appear in more than thirty years. It contained 43 works, with the 27 artistic creations evaluated beyond all doubt, at upwards of 150 guineas. The presentation was a triumph both monetarily and fundamentally: Stokes earned more than 4000 guineas, and the show pulled in commendation from craftsmanship student of history and pundit Bernard William Smith. All through the 1960s, 1980s, she painted and held shows; this later period of her work depended on a more grounded, if lighter, shading palette and mirrored the impact of the craft of Henri Matisse, whom Stokes respected. There was additionally an adjustment in her topic, from "traditionally considered" still lifes, gatherings of figures and nudes, to increasingly brightening subjects. Feeds' works kept on being generally welcomed, having been incorporated into the 1975 presentation "Australian ladies craftsmen" at the University of Melbourne, and the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria's 1977 visiting show "The courageous long periods of Australian painting, 1940Ã¢ÂÂ 1965". Feeds' last painting was "Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole", painted around 1989; she kicked the bucket in Melbourne in 1991.
