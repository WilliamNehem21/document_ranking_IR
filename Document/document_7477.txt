In 1992, Rivera was elevated to the Class An Advanced dimension Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League (FSL). He began 10ÃÂ games for Fort Lauderdale, incorporating a 5Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ winÃ¢ÂÂ misfortune record and a 2.28ÃÂ ERA. He endeavored to improve the development on his slider pitch by snapping his wrist amid his tossing movement, yet he incidentally made harm the ulnar insurance tendon (UCL) in his correct elbow. Rivera experienced medical procedure in August 1992 to fix the harm, finishing his season and intruding on his small time profession. In opposition to mainstream thinking, he didn't have Tommy John medical procedure; his specialist, Dr. Candid Jobe, established that tendon substitution was a bit much and rather fixed the frayed UCL. Rivera's restoration agreed with MLB's 1992 extension draft to fill the programs for two development groups, the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies. Rivera was left unprotected by the Yankees yet was not drafted. He effectively restored his arm in mid 1993 and continued pitching that year. He initially joined the Rookie level Yankees to make two curtailed begins, before coming back to the Class A dimension Hornets to begin ten additional amusements. Seeing him restore, the Hornets' authentic scorer Ogi Overman was not idealistic about Rivera's future, saying, "I thought [he] was on a single direction outing to no place."
