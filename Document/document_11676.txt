Adams took another "furious lady" part in Paul Thomas Anderson's mental show "The Master" (2012). She played Peggy Dodd, the merciless and manipulative spouse of the pioneer of a religion (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). It denoted her third and last coordinated effort with Hoffman, whom she profoundly appreciated, before his demise two years after the fact. The association delineated in the film was regarded by writers to be founded on Scientology; Adams believed the correlation with misdirect yet was happy for the consideration it conveyed to the movie. In spite of the fact that not a strategy performing artist, Adams trusted that the exceptional job had abandoned her tense in her own life. Contrasting her character with Lady Macbeth, the commentator Justin Chang composed that Adams' "sprightliness has once in a while appeared to be so noxious", and Donald Clarke of "The Irish Times" lauded her for filling the role with "discrete hazard". John Patterson of "The Guardian" noticed that a scene in which she chastens Hoffman's character while angrily stroking off him was a standout amongst the most critical successions in the film. By and by, Adams got Academy, Golden Globe, and BAFTA designations for her supporting part.
