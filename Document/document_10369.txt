After the new examples were declared, it was reputed that a plundered skull had discovered its way to an European gallery through the underground market. The poached components were seen in a private European accumulation by the French fossil broker FranÃÂ§ois EscuillÃÂ©, who told Belgian scientist Pascal Godefroit about them in 2011. They speculated the remaining parts had a place with "Deinocheirus", and reached the Korean-Mongolian group. EscuillÃÂ© along these lines gained the fossils and gave them to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The recouped material comprised of a skull, a left hand, and feet, which had been gathered in Mongolia, sold to a Japanese purchaser, and exchanged to a German gathering. The group inferred that these components had a place with example MPC-D 100/127, as the single remaining toe bone fit splendidly into the ill-equipped grid of a poached foot, the bone and network coordinated in shading, and on the grounds that the components had a place with a person of a similar size, with no cover in skeletal components. On May 1, 2014, the fossils were repatriated to Mongolia by a designation from the Belgian Museum, amid a service held at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. The rejoined skeleton was saved at the Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs in Ulaanbaatar, alongside a "Tarbosaurus" skeleton which had additionally been brought back in the wake of being stolen. American scientist Thomas R. Holtz expressed in a meeting that the new "Deinocheirus" remains resembled the "result of a mystery relationship between a hadrosaur and "Gallimimus"".
