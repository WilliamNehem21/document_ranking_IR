Keats understood that he would never have Love, couldn't satisfy his Ambition, and couldn't invest his energy with Poesy. The finish of "Tribute to Indolence" is a rejection of both the pictures and his verse as assumes that would just delude him. Indeed, even sluggishness itself appears to be unattainable; Andrew Motion composes that the figures drive Keats to view lethargy as "the benefit of the leisured class to which he didn't have a place." If the ballad is perused as the last lyric in the 1819 tribute arrangement, "Tribute on Indolence" recommends that Keats is surrendered to surrendering his profession as a writer since verse can't give him the everlasting status he needed from it. Amusingly, the lyric gave Keats such everlasting status. Other than the true to life segment, the sonnet likewise portrays Keats' conviction that his works should catch the excellence of craftsmanship while recognizing the brutality of life. Along these lines, the ballads as a gathering catch Keats' rationality of negative ability, the idea of living with unreconciled opposing perspectives, by endeavoring to accommodate Keats' craving to compose verse and his powerlessness to do as such by deserting verse through and through and tolerating life for what it's worth.
