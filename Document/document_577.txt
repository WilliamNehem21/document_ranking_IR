The book was for a considerable length of time known as the "Vienna Hours of Charles the Bold", and thought to have been expected to stamp Charles' demise at the Battle of Nancy on 5 January 1477, and in this way as a book of grieving, planned for either his better half, Margaret of York, or Mary. As the main girl of the couple, Mary wound up both the wealthiest beneficiary in Europe and the remainder of her inherited line. The possibility that it was initially a book of grieving is strengthened by the sorrowful appearance of the opening 34 pages, where the gold and silver lettering is put on material that has been recolored dark, in a system related with the purported dark books of hours. Just seven of these Illuminated original copies endure today, all delivered in the mid to late fifteenth century. Given their novel visual intrigue, and the utilization of gold and silver leaf, they were more costly and profoundly prized than increasingly traditional books of hours, and created for high-positioning individuals from the court of Philip the Good and Charles the Bold. The Burgundian court had an inclination for dim, solemn colourisation and the surviving works in this style were for the most part authorized for them. Just the affluent honorability could have managed such books, and the desire for sad hues Ã¢ÂÂ frequently reflected in their dress style Ã¢ÂÂ was reflected operating at a profit, gold and silver of these original copies.
