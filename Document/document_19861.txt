On 20 October 1941, JevÄeviÄ and TrifunoviÄ-BirÄanin met and agreed to collaborate with the head of the information division of the Italian VI Corps. In late January 1942, JevÄeviÄ offered to assist the Italians if they occupied Bosnia, and to organise Chetnik detachments to work alongside Italian units in their fight against the communist-led Partisans. These contacts involved General Renzo Dalmazzo, commander of the Italian VI Corps, and Chetnik leaders Stevo RaÄenoviÄ, TrifunoviÄ-BirÄanin, DangiÄ and JevÄeviÄ. In February, JevÄeviÄ consulted with one of DangiÄ's supporters, BoÅ¡ko TodoroviÄ, who instructed him to negotiate with the new commander of the Italian Second Army, Mario Roatta, to arrange the withdrawal of NDH and German troops from eastern Bosnia, to be replaced by an exclusively Italian administration. Both JevÄeviÄ and TodoroviÄ impressed Dalmazzo with the influence they were able to exert over the eastern Bosnian Chetniks, but TodoroviÄ was killed by the Partisans in Herzegovina in late February. The influence JevÄeviÄ had was demonstrated when Serb nationalist armed groups in the GoraÅ¾de and FoÄa districts swung over to an anti-Partisan and pro-Italian attitude when they were informed of JevÄeviÄ and TrifunoviÄ-BirÄanin's ties with VI Corps headquarters. The plans for Italian expansion into eastern Bosnia were later discussed between JevÄeviÄ and NDH State Secretary Vjekoslav VranÄiÄ.
