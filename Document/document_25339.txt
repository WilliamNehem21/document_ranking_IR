Satin's book "Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now", published by Westview Press and Basic Books in 2004, attempts to present radical centrism as a political ideology. It is considered one of the two or three "most persuasive" or most representative books on the subject, and it received the "Best Book Award" for 2003 and 2004 from the Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics of the American Political Science Association. It also generatedÂ â like all of Satin's worksÂ â criticism and controversy.
Satin presents "Radical Middle" as a revised and evolved version of his "New Age Politics" book, rather than as a rejection of it. Some observers had always seen him as a radical centrist. As early as 1980, author Marilyn Ferguson identified him as part of what she called the "Radical Center". In 1987, culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a "New Center". But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial. Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in "New Age Politics", he defines radical middle politics as "idealism without illusions"Â â more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face "the hard facts on the ground". Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he says most Americans are already radical middleÂ â "we're very practical folks, and we're very idealistic and visionary as well."
