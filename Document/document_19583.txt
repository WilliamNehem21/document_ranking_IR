The 1st Training Wing was formed at Minchinhampton, England on 1 September 1917. It commanded No.Â 5, No.Â 6, No. 7 and No.Â 8 Squadrons of the AFC. The wing's role was to train replacement pilots for the four operational AFC squadrons in Palestine and France. Each of the training squadrons provided replacements to a specific operational squadron; No.Â 5 trained pilots for No.1Â Squadron, No.Â 6 supported No.Â 2 Squadron, No.Â 7 was aligned with No.Â 3 Squadron and No.Â 8 supported No.Â 4 Squadron. By the time Lieutenant-Colonel Oswald Watt was appointed to command the wing in February 1918, its headquarters had moved to Tetbury. In keeping with their varied responsibilities, the 1st Training Wing's squadrons operated a wide variety of aircraft and most were split between several bases. From the spring of 1918 No.Â 5 and No.Â 6 Squadrons were stationed at Minchinhampton Airfield while No.Â 7 and No.Â 8 Squadrons were at Leighterton Airfield. Both facilities had been purpose-built for the AFC over the autumn and winter of 1917/1918. As of April 1918 the wing's units were manned by approximately 1000 personnel, making it the largest single body of Australian airmen anywhere in the world at that time. Watt proposed moving the 1st Training Wing to France, but this did not eventuate.
