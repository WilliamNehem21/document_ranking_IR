To fix Zulf's harm to the Bastion, the Kid begins gathering Shards, a lesser type of Cores. As he gets the penultimate shard required, the Ura assault the Bastion, harming it and snatching Zia. In the following seven days, The Kid takes part in sporadic conflicts in Ura domain. When he at last impacts through a Ura station and meets Zia, she reveals to him that she had left with the Ura willfully to discover their goals; Rucks had recently disclosed to Zia that the Bastion had the capacity to by one way or another fix the Calamity. The Kid goes to the once-underground Ura country to recover the last shard. There, he finds Zulf being assaulted by his own kin: the fight with the Kid has crushed the Ura powers, and they fault Zulf for conveying the Kid to their home. The Kid can drop his weapon to help Zulf or abandon him. In the event that he abandons Zulf, the Kid pulverizes the leftovers of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. On the off chance that he conveys Zulf, Ura bowmen at first open flame on them at the end of the day truce and watch quietly as the Kid and Zulf return the skyway to the Bastion.
