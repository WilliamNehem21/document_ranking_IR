The normally acknowledged variant of occasions is that Dyrrhachium opposed with progress, and as his setbacks mounted Peter was compelled to raise the attack and begin his walk towards Thessalonica. The walk demonstrated troublesome, because of both the cruel territory and the open threatening vibe of the nearby populaceÃ¢ÂÂthe Western sources (the "Annales Ceccanenses", Richard of San Germano, Philippe Mouskes, and the continuator of Robert of Auxerre) likewise stress the dependability of the neighborhood Albanian populace to Theodore. Following a couple of days, Theodore with his military went up against Peter. Theodore mentioned chats with the ecclesiastical legate, Giovanni Colonna, whom he guaranteed of his altruism and backing. Western sources guarantee that Theodore offered to perceive the supremacy of the Catholic Church and the suzerainty of the Latin EmpireÃ¢ÂÂjust as to help Peter in his arranged cooperation in the Fifth CrusadeÃ¢ÂÂand offered the Latins sustenance and aides through the mountains. Diminish was happy to get this sudden help, and an understanding between the two was closed. When the Latins let their watchman down, Theodore fell upon them. Dwindle of Courtenay, Colonna, the Latin Bishop of Salona, Count William I of Sancerre, and numerous Latin nobles were kidnapped, while Peter's military dissipated into little wandering groups endeavoring to endure. Akropolites, the recorder Ephraim, and some Western sources then again guarantee that Dyrrhachium was caught, and are trailed by some cutting edge researchers, including the Greek I. D. Romanos and the French Alain Ducellier. As indicated by this view, Theodore offered to recognize Peter's suzerainty after the city's fall, just to misleadingly trap and thrashing him. As the student of history John Van Antwerp Fine comments, "it isn't imperative which variant is right"; the result was the equivalent, and whenever lost, Dyrrhachium was immediately retaken after Peter's catch.
