Before, numismatic journalists have depicted the Association and its exercises cruelly. Thickets expresses that the Oregon Trail coins "are delightful, yet conditions encompassing their issuance come up short". Slabaugh noticed that "Creatively, this is my most loved dedicatory coin. However, from a moral viewpoint, it isn't." Swiatek and Breen composed that the Association's "exercises in misusing currency authorities and the overall population in the long run prompted the disagreeability of commemoratives in Congress and at last to resolved Treasury Department resistance to any further dedicatory issues, regardless of how commendable the reason to be memorialized, regardless of who spoke to the supporting commissions". As per Bowers, "supposedly, the monetary advantages which gave the motivation to issuing the half dollars, 'to save the different vital focuses along the old trail from obscurity,' to erect 'reasonable landmarks, dedication and something else,' and so on., never happened, in any event not from cash given by the clearance of the coins." These, in any case, did not have the advantage of analyzing OTMA records. Following the opening of Driggs' papers for research at Southern Utah University, an October 2013 article in "The Numismatist" reasoned that however numerous reports, for example, the game plans with Scott's, are absent from his records, what there is "appears to be predictable with Driggs needing to utilize the coins to back the stamping of the Oregon Trail, not to line his very own pockets".
