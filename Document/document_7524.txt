Not at all like most "Banksia" species, "B.ÃÂ integrifolia" does not require bushfire to trigger the arrival of its seed. Or maybe, seed is discharged precipitously on achieving development in pre-fall. The species' non-dependence ablaze for seed dispersal recommends that the prohibition of flame would not influence plant populaces, however various investigations have observed the inverse to be valid: in zones where fire has been rejected for a long time, populaces have declined considerably. An examination concerning the defoliation and unexpected passing of trees on the Yanakie Isthmus in south Victoria achieved the provisional end that the nonattendance of flame had made undesirable surface soil conditions. On the Mornington Peninsula, reviews of a region that had not been singed since the 1890s found that "B.ÃÂ integrifolia" densities fell by 77% somewhere in the range of 1977 and 2000. A resulting study found the decay to have been brought about by amazingly high seedling death rates, because of touching by herbivores and extreme challenge for soil dampness amid summer. Notwithstanding recognizing that "the job of flame in these frameworks stays hazy", it presumed that "creating fire and additionally brushing administration routines will be important to moderate the basic respectability of these beach front biological systems."
