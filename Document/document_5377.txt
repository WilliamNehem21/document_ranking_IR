The squadron again turned out to be a piece of No.ÃÂ 86 Wing in June 1988, however its entrusting kept on being constrained by the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, and the Minister for Defense. Beginning in September 1989, the twinjet Mysteres and BAC 1-11s were supplanted by five trijet Dassault Falcon 900s rented from Hawker Pacific, the first run through the RAAF had rented air ship from a business organization. The two HSÃÂ 748s were exchanged to the recently shaped No.ÃÂ 32 Squadron at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. Obligation regarding adjusting the Falcon 900s was shared by No.ÃÂ 34 Squadron and Hawker Pacific, the last performing overwhelming support. In an irregular activity for the squadron, one of the Falcons was dispatched to Jordan in September 1990 to clear thirteen Australian residents who had been held prisoner in Iraq. On 21ÃÂ December 1992, a FalconÃÂ 900 turned into the first RAAF airplane to partake in United Nations peacekeeping endeavors in Somalia, when it left RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with a group of Australian Army faculty to survey the performance center of tasks. The unit got a tribute from the Chief of the Defense Force, General Peter Gration, without further ado before his retirement in 1993. In January 1998, No.ÃÂ 84 Wing was sorted out as an uncommon transport wing under Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). The expression "unique transport" alluded to exercises not legitimately identified with armed force support, for example, conveying VIPs. Headquartered at Richmond, No.ÃÂ 84 Wing assumed responsibility for Nos.ÃÂ 32, 33 and 34ÃÂ Squadrons. A trip by one of No.ÃÂ 34 Squadron's Falcons went before INTERFET activities in East Timor in 1999, conveying senior Australian military and conciliatory staff to Dili on a generosity mission.
