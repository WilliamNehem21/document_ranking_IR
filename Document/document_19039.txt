The immediate legacy of "Temeraire" was the use of the timber taken from her as she was broken up. A gong stand made from "Temeraire" timber was a wedding present to the future King George V on the occasion of his marriage to Mary of Teck, and is held at Balmoral Castle. A barometer, gavel, and some miscellaneous timber are in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, and chairs made from "Temeraire" oak are in the possession of the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth, Lloyd's Register, London and the Whanganui Regional Museum, Whanganui. An altar, communion rail and two bishop's chairs survive in St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. A ship model of "Temeraire" made by prisoners of war uses a stand made from wood taken from her, and is currently in the Watermen's Hall in London. Other relics of "Temeraire" known to exist or have existed are a tea caddy made for her signal midshipman at Trafalgar, James Eaton, and sold at auction in 2000, the frame for an oil painting by Sir Edwin Landseer titled "Neptune", and a mantelpiece made for Beatson's office, supported by figures of Atlas supposedly taken from "Temeraire"s stern gallery. The mantelpiece can no longer be traced, nor can a plaque once fixed to "Temeraire"s deck commemorating Nelson's signal at Trafalgar, nor a wooden leg made for a Trafalgar veteran from "Temeraire"s wood. John Ruskin foreshadowed the fate of "Temeraire"s wood in an essay which claimed that "Perhaps, where the low gate opens to some cottage garden, the tired traveller may ask, idly, why the moss grows so green on its rugged wood, and even the sailor's child may not answer nor know that the night dew lies deep in the war rents of the wood of the old "Temeraire"."
