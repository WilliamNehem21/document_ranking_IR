Pembleton and Lange develop nearer; Lange encounters more torment over the long haul, and switches among regret, outrage, and easygoing casual conversation amid their discussions. Afterward, Pembleton holds Lange's hand to comfort him and trusts about his ongoing stroke. Bayliss develops suspicious when Biedron says that he can't review his last work environment or when he moved to Baltimore. Biedron in the end concedes that he had been criminally charged and put into a mental ward for pushing a man before a Chicago tram train for reasons unknown. Biedron is captured, and Bayliss affirms to Pembleton that Lange was pushed; Pembleton chooses not to tell Lange since he doesn't believe that it will comfort him, yet Lange makes sense of it for himself by watching their discussion. Lange encounters more noteworthy torment and begins to lose cognizance. In the wake of saying "I'm OK" to Pembleton, Lange falls oblivious and the EMTs drive the train with the airbags. Lange bites the dust following he is evacuated. A stunned and confused Pembleton leaves the tram and, in the wake of gazing at Biedron in the back of a police squad vehicle, strolls to his vehicle while reviewing a line about how sugar maple leaves carry on when it rains (a line that Lange said as he was biting the dust). He at that point heads out with Bayliss. The scene closes with Flannigan running past the metro station.
