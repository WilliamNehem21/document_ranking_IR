In the mid year of 1942, the American scientist Charles L. Camp drove a field party from the University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) looking for fossil vertebrates in Navajo County in northern Arizona. Expression of this was spread among the Native Americans there, and the Navajo Jesse Williams conveyed three individuals from the campaign to some fossil bones he had found in 1940. The zone was a piece of the Kayenta Formation, about north of Cameron close Tuba City in the Navajo Indian Reservation. Three dinosaur skeletons were found in purplish shale, orchestrated in a triangle, about long at one side. The first was about finished, lacking just the front of the skull, portions of the pelvis, and a few vertebrae. The second was extremely dissolved, incorporated the front of the skull, lower jaws, a few vertebrae, appendage bones, and an enunciated hand. The third was eroded to the point that it comprised just of vertebra parts. The primary great skeleton was encased in a square of mortar following ten days of work and stacked onto a truck, the second skeleton was effectively gathered as it was predominantly endured out of the ground, yet the third skeleton was nearly gone.
