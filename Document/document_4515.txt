On 25 July, the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-FLAG), a LGBT rights association, issued an open proclamation communicating their "profound concern" with respect to the case, and offering their sympathies to Jones' loved ones. They urged nearby individuals to help the police in finding the culprits of the assault, which they affirmed was an attack against Jamaica's majority rules system. J-FLAG's executive Dane Lewis later remarked that in spite of an expansion in homophobic brutality, Jamaican culture was ending up progressively tolerant toward LGBT individuals; he ascribed this to the activities of people like Jones, who have improved the open perceivability of LGBT individuals in Jamaican culture. Another LGBT rights association, Quality of Citizenship Jamaica, issued an official statement requiring the administration and houses of worship to draw in with LGBT associations to set up shared view which could be undergirded by the standard of "genuine regard for all," found in the country's National Anthem. Human rights association Jamaicans for Justice approached Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and religious pioneers to censure the homicide, likewise remarking on what they saw as an absence of media inclusion and open shock about the episode, including that "we should inquire as to ourselves as a people."
