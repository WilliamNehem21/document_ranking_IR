"Opportunity From Want" had recently been less laced in the standard progressivism theories of the western world than the other three opportunities (discourse, dread, and religion); this opportunity included financial freedom as a societal goal. In his article, Bulosan regards negative freedoms as positive freedoms by proposing that Americans be "given equivalent chance to serve themselves and each other as per their requirements and capacities", a reverberation of Karl Marx's "from each as per his capacities, to each as per his needs". In the last section of the article, the expression "The America we plan to see isn't only a physical yet in addition a profound and scholarly world" portrays a populist America. In a voice compared to Steinbeck's in works, for example, "The Grapes of Wrath", Bulosan's paper talked up for the individuals who attempted to get by in the industrialist majority rules system and was viewed as "frightful and sharp" against the scenery of Rockwell's blowout of bounty. It suggested that while residents had commitments to the express, the state had a commitment to give an essential dimension of subsistence. In contrast to Roosevelt, Bulosan exhibited the case that the New Deal had not effectively conceded opportunity from need as it didn't ensure Americans the basics of life.
