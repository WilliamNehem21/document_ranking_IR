The landmarks at QuiriguÃÂ¡ incorporate abnormally substantial stelae intricately cut from single squares of red sandstone, brought from quarries away. The qualities of this hard shake enabled the nearby stone carvers to create low-help figures upgraded by three-dimensional countenances, interestingly with the contemporary two-dimensional model of the PetÃÂ©n area. After the thrashing and execution of the lord of CopÃÂ¡n in 738, the sculptural style of QuiriguÃÂ¡ intently looked like that of its previous overlord. The tremendous stelae at QuirigÃÂ¡ initially would have been noticeable from the Motagua River, which once streamed past the west side of the Great Plaza, declaring the freshly discovered intensity of the city to passing brokers. The landmarks incorporate long boards of glyphic content that are considered among the most perplexing and wonderful of all Maya stone engravings. A normal for these writings is the utilization of full-figure glyphs in which the typical bar and dab number glyphs of Maya content are supplanted with perfectly cut portrayals of the gods. In any case, by the last piece of the eighth century QuiriguÃÂ¡ had built up a unique style with the creation of stones intricately etched into the types of composite legendary creatures bearing components of frogs, panthers, crocodiles, and flying creatures of prey; these models are alluded to as "zoomorphs" and were finished by two later lords after the demise of K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 785.
