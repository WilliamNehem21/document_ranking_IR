A second pregnancy prompted the introduction of a child, Kim, "who came romping and chuckling into the world in October 1956, a fool before his assigned time", as indicated by Le Mesurier. In June 1956 Jacques showed up in a scene of "The Tony Hancock Show" on ITV; this prompted the job of Hancock's secretary, Griselda Pugh, in the BBC radio arrangement "Hancock's Half Hour". She showed up in 16 scenes from November 1956 to February 1957, close by Hancock and regulars Sidney James, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams. Jacques' entry on "Hancock" "gave an extra lift to the arrangement", as per TV student of history Richard Webber. She showed up again in five further scenes of "Hancock's Half Hour" among April and June 1957, and again for a further 20 scenes among January and June 1958, preceding an exceptional release on Christmas Day 1958. She spent quite a bit of 1958 at the London Palladium, undertaking 380 exhibitions of the revue "Plain as the nose on anyone's face", close by Terry-Thomas, Eric Sykes and Harry Secombe. She showed up in the portrayals "Concerto for Three Buffoons" with Secombe and Sykes, "The Good Old Days", and the two full organization numbers that shut every one of the two parts of the show.
