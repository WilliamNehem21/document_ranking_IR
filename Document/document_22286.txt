In the early 1960s, Thomas Burnett Swann became strongly associated with "Science Fantasy". He had published a couple of genre short stories before beginning to sell to Carnell with "The Dryad-Tree" in the August 1960 issue. Swann's speciality was historical fantasy, and "Where Is the Bird of Fire?", his retelling of the Romulus and Remus myth, which was serialised in "Science Fantasy" in 1962, "received more praise than any other [novelette] in recent years", according to Carnell. Swann was one of the three mainstays of "Science Fantasy" in the early 1960s: the others were Michael Moorcock and J.G. Ballard. Ballard's first story in "Science Fantasy" was "Prima Belladona", which appeared in the December 1956 issue; his work over the next few years was ideally suited to "Science Fantasy" and he became a regular contributor. He published some conventional stories in the British magazines, but over the next few years Ballard's more traditional science fiction material appeared mostly in the American market, with "Science Fantasy" and "New Worlds" reserved for more experimental material that was a harbinger of New Wave science fiction. Moorcock's Elric of MelnibonÃ© series, about a sword and sorcery anti-hero, began with "The Dreaming City" in the June 1961 "Science Fantasy", and Moorcock appeared frequently thereafter: he had either a story or an essay (and sometimes both) in all but four of the remaining issues edited by Carnell. Terry Pratchett's first story, "The Hades Business", appeared in the August 1963 issue. Ashley regards the early 1960s as one of the high points of the magazine; it was nominated for the Hugo Award for each of the last three years in which Carnell edited it, from 1962 to 1964, but it never won.
