On 9 August 1345 Derby touched base in Bordeaux with 500 men-at-arms, 1,500 English and Welsh bowmen, 500 of them mounted on horses to expand their portability, and auxiliary and bolster troops, for example, a group of 24 excavators. A high extent of the toxophilite and a portion of the men-at-arms were sentenced criminals guaranteed pardons in the event that they served for the length of the battle, however the larger part, including a large number of the criminals, were veterans of different crusades. Following two weeks of further selecting and sorting out Derby walked his military to Langon, rendezvoused with Stafford and took order of the consolidated power. While Stafford had to this point sought after a careful procedure, Derby's goal was very unique. Instead of proceed with a war of attacks he was resolved to strike legitimately at the French before they could focus their powers. The French powers in the locale were under Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain, since the Duke of Bourbon had not yet arrived. Knowing about Derby's landing, he chose to fall back to the correspondences focus and deliberately critical town of Bergerac, east of Bordeaux, where there was a vital extension over the Dordogne River. This was a helpful spot to focus French powers and acclimatize fortifications.
