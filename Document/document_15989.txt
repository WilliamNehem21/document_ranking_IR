Depicting the eyepiece of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, whichâat magnitude ofÂ 4.68âis the brightest star in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 223 Â± 8 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 400 Â± 30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5Â times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5Â cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 166 Â± 5 light-years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta and Theta Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.
