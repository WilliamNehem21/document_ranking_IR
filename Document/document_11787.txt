The second Battalion came back from Tianjin in November 1914 and arrived in France the following month as a major aspect of the 81st Brigade in the 27th Division. Its first huge activity came in May 1915 amid the Second Battle of YpresÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the main German hostile on the Western Front that yearÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ in which the unit held its ground, however at the expense of 505 setbacks. Toward the finish of 1915, the 27th Division was exchanged to XVI Corps of the British Salonika Army on the Macedonian Front, and the second Battalion involved positions west of Lake Beshik (current Lake Volvi, Greece). In July 1916, XVI Corps assumed control over the line of the River Struma, and for the following two years the force was engaged with activities along the Struma valley, from November 1916 as a feature of the 82nd Brigade. It was a generally peaceful segment, and despite the fact that the brigade was engaged with assaults over the Struma in September, October and December 1916ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the last costing the force 114 casualtiesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and directed various strikes in 1917, infection was to a greater degree a risk than foe activity. In July 1918, the 27th Division was exchanged to XII Corps south-west of Dojran, and the catch of the Roche Noire remarkable on 1ÃÂ September, at an expense of 89 losses, was the last activity of the second Battalion in the war.
