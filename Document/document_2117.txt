As a major aspect of the RAAF's revamping following the flare-up of World WarÃÂ II in September 1939, No.ÃÂ 2 Group was framed in Sydney on 20ÃÂ November, with Cole in order. The gathering controlled Air Force units in New South Wales. Cole was raised to impermanent air commodore in December, and assumed responsibility for Central Area Command, which displaced No.ÃÂ 2 Group, when it was built up in the new year. In September 1941, he was sent to North Africa as Officer Commanding No.ÃÂ 235 Wing RAF of the Desert Air Force, where he built up another enemy of submarine fighting unit, No.ÃÂ 459 Squadron RAAF. Presented on England with Headquarters No.ÃÂ 11 Group in May 1942, he filled in as Forward Air Controller of the Dieppe Raid on 19ÃÂ August, in charge of co-ordinating Allied air spread off the French coast on board HMS "Calpe". In doing as such, he was truly injured in the jaw and chest area when German contenders strafed the ship; he required plastic medical procedure and went through half a month recovering. His bravery amid the activity earned him the Distinguished Service Order, the declaration being distributed in an enhancement to the "London Gazette" on 2ÃÂ October 1942. That month, he was made Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Northern Ireland, with the acting position of air bad habit marshal, however the order was depicted in the official history of Australia in the war as a "backwater".
