Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and partners, then again, keep up that the dentary is referable to "Ferugliotherium" and that the p4s of "Argentodites" and MACN Pv-RN 975 are fundamentally the same as. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors ascribed to "Ferugliotherium" in size and the cutting edge like premolar is of the size expected for a creature with molariforms the span of "Ferugliotherium" teeth. On the off chance that the dentary and premolars (whose distinguishing proof has been also dubious; see beneath) don't have a place with "Ferugliotherium", at that point, Gurovich and Beck contend, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two vertebrates ("Ferugliotherium" and a multituberculate) comparative in size and morphology, and subsequently probably possessing comparable biological specialtiesÃ¢ÂÂand one of those future spoke to just by molariforms and incisors and the other just by premolars and a jaw section among the accessible fossils. Besides, they noticed that the progress from cutting edge like to molariform premolars had really been seen in the fossil record of the wiped out sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in "Sudamerica" and "Gondwanatherium" is along the side packed, proposing that it might have gotten from a sharp edge like tooth. Gurovich and Beck credited the distinction fit as a fiddle between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and "Argentodites" p4s to the broad wear of the previous, and proposed that the two are comparative enough that they likely speak to at any rate firmly related species.
