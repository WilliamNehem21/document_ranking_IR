Numerous other different types of parental consideration are found in frogs. The little male "Colostethus subpunctatus" stands protect over his egg bunch, laid under a stone or log. At the point when the eggs bring forth, he transports the tadpoles on his back to an impermanent pool, where he incompletely submerges himself in the water and at least one tadpoles drop off. He at that point proceeds onward to another pool. The male normal birthing assistant frog ("Alytes obstetricans") bears the eggs with him appended to his rear legs. He keeps them moist in dry climate by inundating himself in a lake, and keeps them from getting excessively wet in wet vegetation by raising his rump. Following three to about a month and a half, he goes to a lake and the eggs bring forth into tadpoles. The tungara frog ("Physalaemus pustulosus") fabricates a coasting home from froth to shield its eggs from predation. The froth is produced using proteins and lectins, and appears to have antimicrobial properties. A few sets of frogs may shape a provincial home on a recently fabricated pontoon. The eggs are laid in the inside, trailed by exchange layers of froth and eggs, completing with a froth topping.
