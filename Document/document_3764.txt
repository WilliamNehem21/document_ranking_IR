Edward the Elder had vanquished the Danish domains in Mercia and East Anglia with the help of ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d and her significant other, however when Edward kicked the bucket the Danish lord Sihtric still controlled the Viking Kingdom of York (once in the past the southern Northumbrian kingdom of Deira). In January 926, ÃÂthelstan organized one of his sisters to wed Sihtric. The two rulers made a deal to avoid attacking each other's regions or to help each other's adversaries. The next year Sihtric passed on, and ÃÂthelstan caught the opportunity to attack. Guthfrith, a cousin of Sihtric, drove an armada from Dublin to attempt to take the honored position, however ÃÂthelstan effectively won. He caught York and got the accommodation of the Danish individuals. As per a southern writer, he "prevailing to the kingdom of the Northumbrians", and it is questionable whether he needed to battle Guthfrith. Southern lords had never managed the north, and his usurpation was met with shock by the Northumbrians, who had dependably opposed southern control. Be that as it may, at Eamont, close Penrith, on 12 July 927, King Constantine of Scotland, King Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, Ealdred of Bamburgh, and King Owain of Strathclyde (or Morgan ap Owain of Gwent) acknowledged ÃÂthelstan's overlordship. His triumph prompted seven years of harmony in the north.
