Again from South America, Waugh confronted allegations of profanity and irreverence from the Catholic diary "The Tablet", which protested sections in "Dark Mischief". He protected himself in an open letter to the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Francis Bourne, which stayed unpublished until 1980. In the mid year of 1934, he went on a campaign to Spitsbergen in the Arctic, an encounter he didn't appreciate and of which he made insignificant artistic use. On his arrival, resolved to compose a noteworthy Catholic history, he chose the Jesuit saint Edmund Campion as his subject. The book, distributed in 1935, caused discussion by its direct expert Catholic, against Protestant position however brought its author the Hawthornden Prize. He came back to Abyssinia in August 1935 to report the opening phases of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War for the "Every day Mail". Waugh, based on his prior visit, considered Abyssinia "a savage spot which Mussolini was doing admirably to tame" as indicated by his kindred correspondent, William Deedes. Waugh saw little activity and was not completely genuine in his job as a war reporter. Deedes comments on the more established essayist's self importance: "None of us very estimated up to the organization he jumped at the chance to hold back at home". Be that as it may, despite inescapable Italian air assaults, Deedes discovered Waugh's bravery "profoundly consoling". Waugh reviewed his Abyssinian encounters in a book, "Waugh in Abyssinia" (1936), which Rose Macaulay expelled as a "fundamentalist tract" by virtue of its professional Italian tone. A superior realized record is his novel "Scoop" (1938) in which the hero, William Boot, is approximately founded on Deedes.
