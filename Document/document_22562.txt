In 119 BC, the government issued the bronze "wushu" (äºé) coin weighing ; the coin remained the standard currency in China until the Tang dynasty (618â907 AD). During the brief interruptive Xin dynasty (9â23 AD) of Wang Mang (45 BCÂ â 23 AD), the government introduced several new denominations in 7, 9, 10, and 14 AD. These new units (including bronze knife money, gold, silver, tortoise, and cowry shell currencies) often had a market price unequal to their weight and debased the value of coin currency. Once the widespread civil wars following Wang's overthrow abated, the "wushu" coin was reintroduced by Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25â57 AD) in 40 AD at the instigation of Ma Yuan (14 BCÂ â 49 AD). Since commandery-issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight, the central government closed all commandery mints in 113 BC and granted the central government's Superintendent of Waterways and Parks the exclusive right to mint coins. Although the issue of central government coinage was transferred to the office of the Minister of Finance (one of Nine Ministers of the central government) by the beginning of Eastern Han, the central government's monopoly over the issue of coinage persisted.
