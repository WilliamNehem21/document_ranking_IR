On lap 25, Gordon passed Edwards between the third and fourth swings to move into second spot and a second alert was issued in no time subsequently. After the alert, every one of the groups made a ten-minute pit stop before the restart. McMurray drove Gordon, Edwards, Johnson, and Biffle in the principal lap of the moving begin before Gordon led the pack; one lap later, Edwards passed Kyle Busch to move into second spot. On lap 28, Biffle, helped by colleague Edwards, passed Gordon to lead the pack. Bowyer experienced oversteer on lap 29, however recovered control of his vehicle. Two laps later, Bowyer spun sideways after he was hit by partner Truex leaving the tri-oval; a third alert was issued, amid which a large portion of the pioneers, including Biffle, made pit stops for fuel and tires. Earnhardt directed the field back up to speed at the restart. McMurray recovered the lead on lap 38; Earnhardt attempted to go underneath McMurray going into the third turn two laps later, yet McMurray kept the position. Truex passed McMurray on lap 44, with assistance from Earnhardt. By the 47th lap, Harvick had moved into the lead position; Kyle Busch crashed into the divider, getting away with minor harm to the front of his vehicle. He passed McMurray to recover the lead one lap later, with Gordon assuming control over the lead position by the beginning of lap 50. One lap later McMurray, helped by partner Harvick, recaptured the lead.
