It wound up hard to proceed with movement from the 51st Fighter Group runway at Zemun because of air assaults, so on 8 April the remaining IK-3s and Bf 109Es traveled to an assistant landing strip at Veliki Radinci, north-west of Belgrade, where the enduring air ship of the sixth Fighter Regiment were concentrated. Poor climate made activities outlandish until 11 April, when Semiz shot down a Bf 110 that had strafed the runway. Soon thereafter, GogiÃÂ and another IK-3 pilot guaranteed one Ju 87 each amid a watch. That night, German troops drew closer inside of the landing strip at Veliki Radinci and the next day all residual air ship of the sixth Fighter Regiment, including the remaining IK-3s, were singed by their teams. As per flying scholars Dragan SaviÃÂ and Boris CigliÃÂ, one workable IK-3 was caught by the Germans in April 1941 and it was joined by another before the finish of June. Both airplane were situated at Zemun, alongside 23 other previous VVKJ flying machine in working condition that were bound for administration with the aviation based armed forces of the Axis manikin express, the Independent State of Croatia. The Germans had utilized a fence to isolate the useful air ship from other air ship that had been reserved for rejecting. In late June, while the German gatekeepers were diverted tuning in to updates on the intrusion of the Soviet Union, neighborhood socialists, including previous VVKJ mechanics, moved the fence. Therefore, all the workable flying machine were rejected, including the two IK-3s.
