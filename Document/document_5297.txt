McKinley had taken a stand in opposition to lynching while senator, and most African Americans who could cast a ballot bolstered him in 1896. McKinley's need, be that as it may, was in completion sectionalism, and they were disillusioned by his strategies and arrangements. In spite of the fact that McKinley made a few arrangements of African Americans to low-level government posts, and got some recognition for that, the arrangements were short of what they had gotten under past Republican organizations. Blanche K. Bruce, an African American who amid Reconstruction had filled in as congressperson from Mississippi, got the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was customarily given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley named a few dark postmasters; nonetheless, when Democrats dissented the arrangement of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta, Georgia, McKinley requested that Lyons pull back (he was in this manner given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's passing in 1898). The President appointed George B. Jackson, a previous slave, to the post of traditions gatherer in Presidio, Texas. Be that as it may, African Americans in northern states felt that their commitments to McKinley's triumph were disregarded; few were designated to office.
