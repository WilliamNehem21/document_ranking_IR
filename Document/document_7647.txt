"Banksia aemula" is commonly a twisted bush or little tree to , albeit typically littler. Then again, individual wallum banksias have been estimated at high, with a most extreme measurement at bosom stature of in woods on North Stradbroke Island. The storage compartment has thick orange-dark colored wrinkled and warty bark, and the new development is shaggy however winds up smooth as it ages. New shoot development is in spring and summer. The sparkly green leaves are obovate to oval fit as a fiddle and measure long, and in width. The leaf closes are truncate and the edges level and serrated. Blossoming is in harvest time, from March to June; the green-yellow bloom spikes, known as inflorescences, are terminal, found on the finishes of branches and rising up out of the foliage. Estimating in stature and in width, they are different shades of pale and greenish yellow. Somewhere in the range of 800 to 1700 individual little blooms emerge from a focal woody spike (or rachis). At first tipped with white cone shaped dust moderators, the blooms open consecutively from the base to the highest point of the blossom spike more than one to about fourteen days, in a procedure known as successive anthesis. Each blossom produces nectar for around seven days subsequent to opening. The blossom spikes turn dim as they age and up to 25 finely furred dim follicles show up, which can be extensive, estimating long, high, and wide. They split open either after bushfire or suddenly, and discharge oval seeds long, made out of a wedge-molded body long and wide, and bended wing wide. "Banksia aemula" resprouts from its woody lignotuber after flame.
