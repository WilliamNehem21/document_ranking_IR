The main single from "No one's Daughter" was "Thin Little Bitch", discharged to advance the collection in March 2010. The collection got blended audits. Robert Sheffield of "Moving Stone" gave the collection three out of five, saying Love "buckled down on these melodies, rather than simply chattering a cluster of druggy horse crap and expecting individuals would get it, the manner in which she did on her 2004 failure, "America's Sweetheart"". Sal Cinquemani of "Inclination Magazine" likewise gave the collection three out of five: "It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-desolated voice that strikes a chord regularly while tuning in to tunes like 'Nectar' and 'For Once in Your Life'. The last track is, indeed, a standout amongst Love's most crude and helpless vocal exhibitions to dateÃÂ ... the melody offers an uncommon look into the psyche of a lady who, throughout the previous 15 years, has been as renowned for being a hero as she's been for being an injured individual." Love and the band visited universally from 2010 into late 2012 advancing the record, with their pre-discharge appears in London and at South by Southwest accepting basic approval. In 2011, Love took part in "Hit So Hard", a narrative chronicling bandmate Schemel's time in Hole.
