Decreased streams have prompted increments in the convergence of specific substances in the lower waterway that have affected water quality. Saltiness is one of the serious issues and furthermore prompts the consumption of pipelines in horticultural and urban territories. The lower Colorado's salt substance was around 50 sections for every million (ppm) in its normal state, yet by the 1960s, it had expanded to well more than 2000 ppm. By the mid 1970s, there was additionally genuine worry about saltiness brought about by salts filtered from neighborhood soils by water system seepage water, which were evaluated to add of abundance salt to the waterway every year. The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act was passed in 1974, ordering protection works on including the decrease of saline seepage. The program diminished the yearly burden by about , however saltiness remains a continuous issue. In 1997, the USBR evaluated that saline water system water caused crop harms surpassing $500ÃÂ million in the U.S. what's more, $100ÃÂ million in Mexico. Further endeavors have been made to battle the salt issue in the lower Colorado, including the development of a desalination plant at Yuma. In 2011, the seven U.S. states settled upon a "Plan of Implementation", which expects to lessen saltiness by every year by 2030. In 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation assessed that around $32 million was gone through every year to anticipate around 1.2 million tons of salt from entering and harming the Colorado River.
