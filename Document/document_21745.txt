Once the site of a castle had been selectedÂ â whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of powerÂ â the building material had to be selected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well-recorded, and most surviving records relate to royal castles. A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an unskilled workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, digging, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle would not have been a drain on a client's funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motteÂ â high and wide at the summitÂ â would have taken 50Â people about 40Â working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for Â£20. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.
