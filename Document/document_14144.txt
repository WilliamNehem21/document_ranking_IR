Chris Turner composed emphatically of the Canyonero parody piece in "Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation", calling it "a splendid farce of a SUV advertisement". In an article in the diary "Natural Politics" Steve Vanderheiden remarked that the Canyonero mirrored a "hostile to SUV" position by "The Simpsons". Vanderheiden expressed: "Even the famous energized TV arrangement 'The Simpsons' joined the counter SUV brawl in 1998, including a mammoth vehicle called the 'Canyonero' (promoted with the jingle: 'Twelve yards in length, two paths wide/Sixty-five tons of American pride!'), which guaranteed to enable the family to rise above its unremarkable station-wagon presence however rather brought just wretchedness." The expression "Canyonero" has since been utilized in the news media to allude fundamentally to extensive trucks and SUVs. In an article in the "San Francisco Chronicle" about SUV proprietors, Vicki Haddock expressed "SUV proprietors have progressed toward becoming something of a climax, briefly caught in a "Simpsons" spoof touting the spurious Canyonero". In a 2006 article, Seth Jayson of "The Motley Fool" thought about the wording in a Ford ad "myFord Owner Magazine" to this scene, stating: "the unholiest of unholies is the composition, which is so thick with crazy adspeak, you'd think it was composed by the group at "The Onion" or "The Simpsons"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ particularly that scene where Krusty begins peddling for the Canyonero." In a 2004 article in the "Chicago Tribune", Jim Mateja noticed that individuals have brought up a similitude between the GMC Canyon and the Canyonero. Whenever reached, GMC reacted that the GMC is a pickup truck, while the Canyonero is a satire of a SUV.
