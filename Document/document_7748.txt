On 14 January 1952, Hardman was named Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), succeeding Air Marshal George Jones, who had served ten years in the position. The choice by Australia's Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, to choose a RAF officer caused hatred in the RAAF. This was intensified when Menzies expressed his reason as being that there might have been "no RAAF officer of adequate age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff", which seemed to overlook the wartime records of such figures as John McCauley and Frederick Scherger. "The Daily Mirror" in Sydney was one of a few news sources to voice a "stern dissent" over the issue. Menzies additionally felt that he could legitimize the arrangement of a pariah in light of the fact that the RAAF's geologically based order and-control framework required revamping along utilitarian lines, a framework with which a senior RAF part would be recognizable. England's CAS, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor, was, to some degree reluctantly, in charge of satisfying the Australian Government's solicitation for a reasonable officer. In advancing Hardman as the "exceptional applicant" for the Australian post, Slessor endeavored to maintain a strategic distance from what he called "the indiscretions of certain years prior", alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett's questionable residency as CAS on secondment from the RAF right off the bat in World WarÃÂ II.
