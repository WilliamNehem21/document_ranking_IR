In 1934 entomologist John S. Clark published a formal description of "Nothomyrmecia macrops" as a new species and within a completely new genus and tribe (Nothomyrmecii) of the Ponerinae. He did so because the two specimens (which then became the syntypes) bore no resemblance to any ant species he knew of, but they did share similar morphological characteristics with the extinct genus "Prionomyrmex". Clark notes that the head and mandibles of "Nothomyrmecia" and "Prionomyrmex" are somewhat similar, but the two can be distinguished by the appearance of the node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster). In 1951, Clark proposed the new ant subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae for his "Nothomyrmecia", based on morphological differences with other ponerine ants. This proposal was rejected by American entomologist William Brown Jr., who placed it in the subfamily Myrmeciinae with "Myrmecia" and "Prionomyrmex", under the tribe Nothomyrmeciini. Its distant relationship with extant ants was confirmed after its rediscovery, and its placement within the Formicidae was accepted by most scientists until the late 1980s. The single waist node led scientists to believe that "Nothomyrmecia" should be separate from "Myrmecia" and retained Clark's original proposal. This proposal would place the ant into its own subfamily, despite many familiar morphological characteristics between the two genera. This separation from "Myrmecia" was retained until 2000.
In 2000, entomologist Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new Baltic fossil "Prionomyrmex" species ("P. janzeni"). After examining specimens of "Nothomyrmecia", Baroni Urbani stated that his new species and "N. macrops" were so morphologically similar that they belonged to the same genus. He proposed that the name "Prionomyrmex" should replace the name "Nothomyrmecia" (which would then be just a synonym), and also that the subfamily Nothomyrmeciinae should be called Prionomyrmeciinae.
