On 28ÃÂ January 1393, Isabeau held a disguise at the HÃÂ´tel Saint-Pol to commend the third marriage of her woman in-pausing, Catherine de Fastaverin. Tuchman clarifies that a widow's remarriage was generally an event for joke and clowning around, regularly celebrated with a "charivari" described by "a wide range of permit, masks, issue, and boisterous booming of grating music and clanking of cymbals". On the proposal of Huguet de Guisay, whom Tuchman portrays also known for his "crazy plans" and remorselessness, six high-positioning knights played out a move in ensemble as wood savages. The ensembles, which were sewn onto the men, were made of cloth drenched with tar to which flax was joined "so they seemed shaggy and bushy from head to foot". Covers made of similar materials secured the artists' appearances and concealed their characters from the group of onlookers. A few narratives report that the artists were bound together by chains. The vast majority of the group of onlookers were uninformed that Charles was among the artists. Severe requests precluded the lighting of corridor burns and restricted anybody from entering the lobby with a light amid the execution, to limit the danger of the profoundly combustible ensembles bursting into flames.
