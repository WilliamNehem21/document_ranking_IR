The request report neglected to distinguish a clear reason, in spite of the fact that it was viewed as that the in all likelihood cause was a sparkle from the flagging apparatus. It would have touched off the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust noticeable all around. The report was disparaging of numerous parts of the administration's practices, and thought of it as had broken the mining guidelines in regard of estimating and keeping up the air quality in the activities, and in the expulsion of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report called attention to that on the grounds that the administration had not actualized the progressions expected to the ventilation fans as requested by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unfit to turn around the heading of the wind current, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, in spite of the fact that Redmayne and his associates held varying suppositions on the suitability of switching or halting the wind current. The antiquarian John H Brown, in his examination of the fiasco, expresses that had the wind current been switched, firedamp or afterdamp could have been separated from certain areas into the burst, causing another blast.
