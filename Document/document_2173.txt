Norman was conceived in Ulverston, Lancashire (presently part of the regulatory region of Cumbria), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his significant other Agnes, who kicked the bucket in 1884 of tuberculosis. He went to the Wesleyan grade school in Ulverston until 1894, when he moved to Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Albeit savvy, Birkett was not noted as an especially scholarly understudy and invested as much energy in handy jokes as he did on his investigations. He left school in 1898, beginning work as an understudy in one of the draper's shops possessed by his dad and starting to lecture. He was a well known neighborhood evangelist on the nearby Methodist circuit, and, on concluding that he was probably not going to be a decent draper, his dad enabled him to leave the business in 1904 to turn into a pastor under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale proposed Birkett ought to go to Cambridge University to consider history and religious philosophy. Birkett enjoyed the thought, having recently speaked with A. C. Benson, the Master of Magdalene College, and connected to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The school offered him a spot, with the condition that he would need to pass a selection test and complete the responsions to be acknowledged into the college overall. He went through three months learning Latin and Greek and was acknowledged into the college in October 1907.
