The unit's Tomahawks had at this point been supplanted by Kittyhawks, and Gibbes decorated his with an animation delineating a kangaroo kicking a dachshund in the back. He guaranteed a BfÃÂ 109 (conceivably a misidentified Macchi C.202) amid the Siege of Tobruk on 7ÃÂ May. On 26ÃÂ May, he was shot down while driving an assault on an intensely escorted power of "Luftwaffe" aircraft close El Adem. In the wake of terminating at and most likely crushing a BfÃÂ 109, Gibbes was hit by flame from a JuÃÂ 88 and needed to safeguard. Some portion of his parachute ended up trapped with the tailplane of his stricken air ship and he attempted to get away. He broke his lower leg in the arrival yet inside about a month and a half was flying once more, his leg still in a cast. Because of his implemented nonappearance, individual expert Nicky Barr was given direction of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron until he himself was shot down and taken prisoner on 26ÃÂ June, so, all things considered Gibbes again assumed responsibility for the unit. Barr later said that in spite of the fact that Gibbes was not a splendid shot, he had the quickest visual perception of any pilot he knew when it came to finding adversary flying machine and cautioning his colleagues for the assault. Another No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron pilot, Tom Russell, additionally reviewed that Gibbes was especially proficient at discovering targets, and that "on the off chance that we got dispersed in a dogfight he had the uncanny capacity to get us over into arrangement in an extremely short space of time".
