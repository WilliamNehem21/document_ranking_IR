Garfield and the Ohio appointment wanted a New York Stalwart as Garfield's bad habit presidential running mate, mostly to pacify Conkling, and somewhat to adjust the ticket topographically. Levi P. Morton declined in the wake of counseling with Conkling, who was as yet troubled over Grant's misfortune and exhorted Morton not to acknowledge. The assignment was then offered (clandestinely, and without counseling Garfield) to Chester A. Arthur, who had close Stalwart connections to Conkling, yet who had inspired representatives with his work to handle the trade off on the determination of a tradition executive. Conkling attempted to convince Arthur not to acknowledge, asking him to "drop it as you would an intensely hot shoe from the produce," yet Arthur demanded that he would, calling the Vice Presidency "a more noteworthy respect than I at any point longed for accomplishing." Arthur won the selection after he got 468 votes, alongside the 193 for Elihu Washburne, and 44 for the third real applicant, Marshall Jewell. Previous Governor Edmund J. Davis of Texas and a few others were additionally assigned, yet gotten little help. After tradition director Hoar slammed his hammer at 7:25 P.M. on June 8, the longest ever Republican National Convention was dismissed.
