Amid Operation Crusader, it was arranged that the New Zealand Division would cross the Egyptian outskirt north of and parallel to XXX Corps and would then propel northwards. The hostile was to start on 17 November. Preceding the start of the hostile, the regiment screened the Egyptian outskirt south of Trigh el Abd to identify any German development in that segment. Toward the beginning of November, Div Cav left Baggush to start its pre-hostile mission and took the primary street to Mersa (Matruh). It at that point took the Siwa street past Matruh, moving south for an hour prior to swinging west into the desert. The regiment bivouacked at sunset and proceeded in stages the next day. Lieutenant Colonel Nicoll visited the fourth Indian Division central command on 9 November. Regimental Headquarters, B and C Squadrons were brought under order of the fourth Indian Division, progressing to Alam el Seneini the following day. AÃÂ Squadron proceeded and was taken under the order of the fourth South African Armored Car Regiment, with the HQ Squadron behind alongside the B Echelon of the South Africans. A troop of the 65th Anti-Tank Regiment and a troop of the 57th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (57th LAA) were put under Div Cav. The 57th LAA shot down an Italian air ship at El Rabta on 14 November.
