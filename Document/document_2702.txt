The Vienna example is today an examination skin with its legs outstretched (not a taxidermy mount), yet van Grouw and Hume proposed that Stone's 1790 representation demonstrated its unique mounted posture. It is in great condition; despite the fact that the legs are blurred to a light orange-darker, they were likely ruddy in the living flying creature. It has no yellowish or purple plumes, repudiating Rothschild's perception. Forbes proposed that the Liverpool example was "changed" and mounted after Stone's representation, however its present posture is different. Keuleman's representation of the mount demonstrates the present posture, so Forbes was either wrong or another posture depended on Keuleman's picture. The Liverpool example is in great condition, in spite of the fact that it has lost a few plumes from its head and neck. The bill is broken, and its rhamphotheca (the keratinous covering of the bill) is feeling the loss of; the basic bone was painted red to recreate a flawless bill, which has caused some perplexity. The legs have likewise been painted red, and there is no sign of their unique colouration. The reason just white examples are realized today might gather predisposition; surprisingly shaded examples are bound to be gathered than ordinarily hued ones.
