Students of history oftentimes remark on ÃÂthelstan's stupendous and lavish titles. On his coins and contracts he is portrayed as "Rex totius Britanniae", or "Lord of the entire of Britain". A gospel book he gave to Christ Church, Canterbury is recorded "ÃÂthelstan, lord of the English and leader of the entire of Britain with a faithful personality gave this book to the primatial see of Canterbury, to the congregation committed to Christ". In sanctions from 931 he is "lord of the English, raised by the correct hand of the all-powerful to the royal position of the entire kingdom of Britain", and in one composition commitment he is even styled "basileus et curagulus", the titles of Byzantine sovereigns. A few students of history are not inspired. "Unmistakably", remarks Alex Woolf, "Lord ÃÂthelstan was a man who had demands," while in the perspective on Simon Keynes, "ÃÂthelstan A" declared his lord ruler of Britain "by pie in the sky augmentation". In any case, as indicated by George Molyneaux "this is to apply a chronologically misguided standard: tenth-century lords had a free yet genuine authority all through the island, and their titles possibly seem swelled in the event that one expect that majesty should include mastery of a power like that seen inside the English kingdom of the eleventh and later hundreds of years."
