The 2004â05 season was a disappointment in the league as Liverpool finished in fifth place outside the UEFA Champions League qualification places. They were eliminated from the FA Cup third round by Burnley. The club reached the final of the League Cup, but lost 3â2 to Chelsea. Liverpool also reached the final of the UEFA Champions League and it appeared the club would lose their second final of the season when they were 3â0 down to Italian team Milan at half-time, but three goals in six minutes allowed Liverpool to draw level at 3â3. No goals in extra time meant the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which they won 3â2. A fifth-place finish in the Premier League meant Liverpool were not guaranteed entry into the Champions League and faced the prospect of not being able to defend their European title. UEFA eventually ruled that they would be allowed to do so, but would be required to start in the first qualifying round. They were eliminated in the first knockout round by Portuguese team Benfica. In the 2005â06 season they finished in third place. They also reached the 2006 FA Cup Final where they faced West Ham United. Liverpool won 3â1 in a penalty shoot-out after the match finished 3â3.
