Marking the release of Steven Spielberg's "" film in 2011, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) commissioned a documentary devoted to "Tintin in the Land of the Soviets" in which journalist Frank Gardnerâwho considered Tintin to be his boyhood heroâvisited Russia, investigating and defending the accuracy of HergÃ©'s account of Soviet human rights abuses. In an article for conservative newspaper the "Daily Mail", Gardner discussed his experience, stating that upon first reading the comic, he thought the drawings crude and the plot improbable. However, during his trip to Russia, he learned from a Muscovite historian that the spirit of HergÃ©'s story was in keeping with what was going on in Russia at the time. The historian confirmed that one of the great tragedies of the 20th century was the wholesale persecution of the Kulak farmers by the Bolsheviks, where "literally thousands perished." First airing on Sunday 30 October 2011 on BBC Two, it was produced by Graham Strong, with Luned Tonderai as producer and Tim Green as executive producer. David Butcher reviewed the documentary for the "Radio Times", opining that Gardner's trip was dull compared to the comic's adventure, but praising a few "great moments", such as the scene in which Gardner tested an open-topped 1929 Amilcar, just as Tintin did in the adventure.
