The white-looked at stream martin might be transitory, and if the reproducing living space takes after that of the African waterway martin, it is probably going to be the forested valleys of substantial waterways; these can give sandbars and islands to settling, and forest over which the flying creatures can get creepy crawly prey. The reproducing grounds and living space are obscure, in spite of the fact that stream valleys in northern Thailand or southwestern China are potential outcomes. An asserted portrayal of this species in a Chinese parchment painting at first seemed to help the likelihood of the martin rearing in China. The winged creature in the work of art had a correspondingly molded head and bill, a white eye and a long tail, despite the fact that it did not have the white backside, did not demonstrate the right bill shading, and extended the external, as opposed to focal, tail quills. Painted before 1970, it pre-dated the production of photos of the Thai flying creature, so it more likely than not been painted from life. It is currently thought more probable that the parchment indicates Oriental pratincoles ("Glareola maldivarum"). Cambodia and Burma have additionally been recommended as conceivable asylums for the martin, however there has likewise been hypothesis on whether it is transient by any means.
