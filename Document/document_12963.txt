After the Spring 1953 issue Nova Publications chose to switch printers, so as to cut expenses and bring the spread cost down from 2/ - (10 p) to 1/6 (7.5 p). The new printers, The Carlton Press, neglected to keep to the concurred printing plan, and created low quality work; there were likewise printers' strikes, and this interruption caused broadened delays in the presence of the seventh issue. While the question with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a writer colleague of Carnell's, set up together a little gathering of surely understood sci-fi writers, including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham. Goldsmith secured the gathering for "Showed", a week after week magazine, and the article grabbed the eye of Maclaren and Sons Ltd, a specialized exchange distributer keen on propelling another sf magazine. Carnell turned down the offer in view of his reliability to Nova Publications, yet ensuing dialogs at last prompted Maclaren assuming responsibility for Nova Publications, with a pledge to create "New Worlds" on a month to month premise and "Science Fantasy" on an every other month plan. Maclaren's lawful division was useful in settling the debate with The Carlton Press, and the seventh issue of "Science Fantasy" at long last showed up with a spread date of March 1954.
