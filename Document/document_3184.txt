Khan had needed to cast Sabu Dastagir, a Hollywood star of Indian source, as Birju. Dastagir made a trip to India from Los Angeles, remained in an inn in Mumbai (at that point known as Bombay) and got a retainer. Be that as it may, postponements and hindrances in starting shooting and getting a work grant for Dastagir prompted his rejection from the undertaking. Dilip Kumar, a set up on-screen character in the Hindi film industry, had initially communicated an enthusiasm for playing Birju, which Khan found pleasing; Dilip Kumar consented to play Shamu too. Notwithstanding, Nargis questioned that the open would not acknowledge their giving a role as mother and child since she had completed a few sentimental movies close by him. Sunil DuttÃ¢ÂÂwith the experience of only one filmÃ¢ÂÂwas at long last cast, after Mukri, an entertainer in the film, acquainted him with Khan. Sajid Khan, the performing artist who depicted the youthful Birju, was obscure at the time, and was from a poor family from the Mumbai ghettos. Sajid's compensation in the film was 750. He was later received by Mehboob Khan. In this way, Raaj Kumar was given a role as Shamu and Rajendra Kumar as Ramu. "Mother India" was the main fruitful film and a defining moment in the professions of Dutt, Raaj Kumar and Rajendra Kumar.
