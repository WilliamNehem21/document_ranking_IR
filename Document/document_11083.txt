Cranmer was informed that he would almost certainly make a last recantation however this time in broad daylight amid an administration at the University Church. He composed and presented the discourse ahead of time and it was distributed after his demise. At the platform upon the arrival of his execution, he opened with a petition and an admonishment to comply with the ruler and ruler, yet he finished his message absolutely surprisingly, going astray from the readied content. He revoked the recantations that he had composed or marked with his very own hand since his debasement and thusly he expressed his hand would be rebuffed by being scorched first. He at that point stated, "And concerning the pope, I reject him, as Christ's foe, and Antichrist with all his bogus tenet." He was pulled from the platform and taken to where Latimer and Ridley had been scorched a half year prior. As the flares drew around him, he satisfied his guarantee by setting his correct hand into the core of the flame while saying "that dishonorable hand". His diminishing words were, "Master Jesus, get my soul ...; I see the sky open and Jesus remaining at the correct hand of God."
