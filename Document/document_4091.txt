Just 35% of the Watten fortification had been finished at this point. It was plainly no longer conceivable to utilize it as a dispatch site, yet the Germans still required LOX generation offices to supply V-2 destinations somewhere else. Subsequent to reviewing the site in September and October 1943, Organization Todt engineers discovered that the northern piece of the office was hopelessly harmed yet chosen to concentrate on finishing the southern part to fill in as a LOX processing plant. One of the OT's architects, Werner Flos, thought of a plan to shield the fortification from assault by structure it up from the rooftop first. This was finished by at first developing a solid plate, level on the ground, which was thick and weighed 37,000 tons. It was gradually raised by pressure driven jacks and afterward upheld by dividers which were worked underneath it as it was raised, turning into the rooftop. The subsequent solid sinkhole was planned to be utilized by the Germans as a bombproof fluid oxygen industrial facility. The thickness of the rooftop was picked on the supposition that Allied bombs were unequipped for entering such a profundity of cement; the Germans, in any case, were ignorant of the British advancement of seismic tremor bombs.
