The ship got a last refit somewhere in the range of 1934 and 1936, when her deck defensive layer was expanded to 5ÃÂ inches (12.7ÃÂ cm) over the magazines and to 3.5ÃÂ inches (8.9ÃÂ cm) over the motor rooms. Notwithstanding a general modernisation of the ship's frameworks, her enemy of air ship resistances were reinforced by supplanting the single mounts of the AA firearms with twin mounts for the QF 4-inch Mark XVI weapon and including a couple of octuple mounts for two-pounder Mk VIII "pom-pom" weapons to sponsons side by side the channel. Two positions for "pom-pom" against air ship chiefs were included new stages side by side and beneath the flame control executive in the spotting top. A HACS Mk III executive supplanted the Mk I in the spotting top and another supplanted the torpedo chief toward the back. A couple of fourfold mounts for Vickers .50 automatic weapons were included side by side the conning tower. The mainmast was recreated as a tripod to help the heaviness of a radio-bearing discovering office and a second High-Angle Control Station. The forward pair of submerged torpedo tubes were expelled and four test 21-inch torpedo tubes were included above water forward of 'A' turret.
