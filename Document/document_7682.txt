In 674, the Arab armada cruised from its bases in the eastern Aegean and entered the Sea of Marmara. As indicated by the record of Theophanes, they arrived on the Thracian shore close Hebdomon in April, and until September were occupied with consistent conflicts with the Byzantine troops. As the Byzantine writer reports, "Each day there was a military commitment from morning until night, between the outworks of the Golden Gate and the Kyklobion, with push and counter-push". At that point the Arabs left and made for Cyzicus, which they caught and changed over into a braced camp to spend the winter. This set the example that proceeded all through the attack: each spring, the Arabs crossed the Marmara and ambushed Constantinople, pulling back to Cyzicus for the winter. Actually, the "attack" of Constantinople was a progression of commitment around the city, which may even be extended to incorporate Yazid's 669 assault. Both Byzantine and Arab writers record the attack as going on for a long time rather than five. This can be accommodated either by including the opening efforts of 672Ã¢ÂÂ 673, or by tallying the years until the last withdrawal of the Arab troops from their forward bases, in 680.
