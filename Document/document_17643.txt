James M. Redfield, a classics professor at the University of Chicago, in his article "An Aristotelian Analysis of "Miss Moppet"" finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle's "Poetics", with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes the outcome of the plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twiceâto allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape herâand uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to read aloud to a child ("This is the mouseÂ ..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the storyâdangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the catâPotter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing "us that teasing is a kind of loving when it is a kind of teaching. The poet plays with us, and by taking us through an unreal experience, teaches us what it is to live in the real world."
