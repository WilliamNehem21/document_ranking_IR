Another of Todd's comedic pairings is his companionship with a parrot he names Moose. Todd is nearer to Moose than he is to generally people. He confesses to the fledgling his private contemplations and insider facts, which causes struggle and hostility among Moose and his better half at the time, TÃÂ©a. Florencia Lozano, TÃÂ©a's portrayer, expressed, "My characterÃÂ ... has a very antagonistic association with the birdÃÂ ... It's kind of desirous of me, I'm envious of the feathered creature. We're both endeavoring to draw near to Todd." The feathered creature was depicted by two South American blue and gold macaws named Flash and Lucky, and an Animal Planet narrative expressed that they had built up a "great list of references" when they showed up on "OLTL." They were prepared by Ed Richman, who had worked with the winged creatures for a long time in TV shows, for example, "Magnum, P.I." and "Jake and the Fatman. "Richman expressed that Howarth got on "genuine speedy" in regards to his connection with Flash and Lucky and said that he was the best performing artist he had worked with in the business. The parrots were utilized for various purposes: for threatening scenes where it looked like Moose "was going to execute someone", Richman utilized Flash, and Lucky was utilized for the "cherishing, extremely minding, physically close" depiction of Moose. Like different performing artists, the parrots had the capacity to interface, in character, with their kindred castmembers and accomplish comedic timing with them. Voice on-screen character Ron Gallop was employed to convey Moose's lines, which were made to help exhibit Todd's line of reasoning, meant Todd and Moose's nearby bond, and comprised of amusing or offending comments went for anybody causing issues for Todd.
