Hotspots for William's activities somewhere in the range of 1082 and 1084 are small. As indicated by the student of history David Bates, this most likely implies that little occurred of note, and that in light of the fact that William was on the mainland, there was nothing for the "Old English Saxon Chronicle" to record. In 1082 William requested the capture of his stepbrother Odo. The definite reasons are hazy, as no contemporary creator recorded what caused the squabble between the relatives. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had desires to move toward becoming pope. Orderic additionally related that Odo had endeavored to convince a portion of William's vassals to join Odo on an attack of southern Italy. This would have been viewed as messing with the ruler's position over his vassals, which William would not have endured. Despite the fact that Odo stayed in repression for the remainder of William's rule, his properties were not reallocated. More challenges struck in 1083, when William's oldest child Robert revolted afresh with help from the French ruler. A further blow was the passing of Matilda, William's significant other, on 2 November 1083. William was constantly portrayed as near his significant other, and her demise would have added to his issues.
