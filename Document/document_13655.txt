In December 1913, Crawford kept in touch with the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) requesting a six-month time away and an ensured reestablishment of his agreement. The SACA depicted his letter as "egotistical" before in the end allowing his solicitation and offering him a three-year contract worth around ÃÂ£300 every year, including instructing expenses. As a result, he needed to twofold his pay or leave to look for a situation in New Zealand. Portraying these occasions, Hart remarks: "Crawford's money related dealings with the SACA uncover him both as hired soldier and as a clumsy 'cuss'. The last part of his identity should be considered in case he be considered simply a foundation unfortunate casualty in his separating with Surrey". On the field, Crawford was fruitful in 1913Ã¢ÂÂ 14. He took 34 wickets, and against New South Wales he hit 91 out of 89 minutes before taking 10 wickets; against Victoria he took eleven wickets. This last match was his keep going for South Australia. Later in 1914, Crawford visited New Zealand with an Australian groupÃ¢ÂÂcollected without the endorsement of the Australian Board of ControlÃ¢ÂÂwhich contained many driving players, under the captaincy of the previous Canterbury batsman Arthur Sims. In top notch diversions on this visit Crawford took 21 wickets and scored a century, yet his most striking innings arrived in a minor match. Against the "XV of South Canterbury", he scored 354 of every five-and-a-quarter hours, striking 14 sixes and 45 fours. He and Victor Trumper shared an association of 298 out of 69 minutes, and Monty Noble helped him to score 50 keeps running in 9 minutes as the Australian group scored 922 for nine.
