The absence of conclusive activity on the Virginia Peninsula impelled President Abraham Lincoln to arrange McClellan's military to move into positions near Richmond. By May30, McClellan had started moving troops over the Chickahominy River, the main significant regular obstruction that isolated his military from Richmond. Be that as it may, overwhelming downpours and tempests the evening of May30 caused the water level to swell, washing endlessly two extensions and part the Federal armed force in two over the Chickahominy. In the consequent Battle of Seven Pines, Confederate general-in-boss Joseph E. Johnston looked to benefit from the bifurcation of McClellan's military, assaulting the half of the Union Army that was stuck south of the waterway. Johnston's arrangement went into disrepair, and McClellan lost no ground. Late in the fight, Johnston was hit in the correct shoulder by a slug and in the chest by a shell part; his direction went to Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith. Smith's residency as officer of the Army of Northern Virginia was short. On June1, after a fruitless assault on Union powers, Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, named Robert E. Lee, his very own military guide, to supplant Smith as the president of the Confederate militaries.
