At 3ÃÂ pm, the Cabildo started its standard work, yet was hindered by 600ÃÂ armed men named the Infernal Legion, who involved the Plaza de la Victoria and uproariously requested the assembling of an open cabildo and the abdication of Viceroy Cisneros. They conveyed a representation of FerdinandÃÂ VII and the lapels of their coats bore a white lace that symbolized criolloÃ¢ÂÂ Spanish solidarity. Domingo French, the mail bearer of the city, and Antonio Beruti, a representative of the treasury, drove the agitators. It was reputed that Cisneros had been slaughtered, and that Saavedra would assume responsibility for the legislature. Saavedra was at the sleeping shelter right then and there, worried about the showing. He figured the savagery ought to be ceased and that extreme estimates, for example, the death of Cisneros ought to be forestalled, yet he additionally felt that the troops would rebellion if the showings were smothered. The general population in the Plaza did not trust that Cisneros would permit the open cabildo the following day. Leiva left the Cabildo, and Belgrano, who was speaking to the group, mentioned a conclusive duty. Leiva clarified that everything would proceed as arranged, however the Cabildo required time to get ready. He asked Belgrano to assist the Cabildo with the work, as his intercession would be seen by the group as an assurance that their requests would not be overlooked. The group left the principle lobby yet remained in the Plaza. Belgrano challenged about the list of attendees, which comprised of the wealthiest residents, and felt that if the needy individuals were left outside there would be further turmoil. The individuals from the Cabildo endeavored to persuade him to give his help, however he left.
