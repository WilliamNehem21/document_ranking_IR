To empower overwhelming four-motor planes to fly long-run missions, longer all-climate landing strips were required. Casey assigned two destinations for improvement: the crisis airstrip at Wards, and another site at Seventeen Mile. The work at Wards was appointed to No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, which had been chipping away at Wards since 17 August, surfacing it with rock. It got its requests to develop another runway west of the former one on 11 September. The runway was given a compacted rock surface to hold the heaviness of overwhelming planes. As the squadron likewise needed to develop a water pipeline from the Waigani Swamp, the timetable slipped. Following a visit on 3 November by Colonel Leif Sverdrup from GHQ and Matthews, presently the head of development at COSC, extra assets were distributed. B Company of the 2/first Pioneer Battalion touched base on 13 November to help with laying the Marston Mat and the water channels. The 46th Engineer General Service Regiment helped with the dispersal regions and revetments. The first runway was then moved up to all-climate standard as well. The other site assigned for substantial aircraft was Seventeen Mile. The 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared and grubbed the region, and spread out the runway. This was surfaced with of dirt bound shale, and fixed with tar to make an all-climate surface. This did not demonstrate tasteful, and Marston Mat must be set down.
