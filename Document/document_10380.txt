Not at all like the elective site close Duntroon, Point Cook was level, near the coast and not, in Petre's own words, "separated in the shrub". He and Harrison set up the CFS over the next year with four mechanics, three other staff, and five airplane including two Deperdussin monoplanes, two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 biplanes, and a Bristol Boxkite for introductory preparing. Harrison made the unit's first trip in the Boxkite on Sunday, 1ÃÂ March 1914. After eight days Petre enrolled Australia's first military flying mishap when he slammed a Deperdussin while endeavoring to stay away from phone wires amid landing; he got away with wounding yet the plane was destroyed. Petre was best man at Harrison's wedding in June. Its cadre of work force at this point being alluded to as the Australian Flying Corps, the CFS initiated its first flying seminar on 17ÃÂ August 1914, two weeks after the episode of World WarÃÂ I. The four understudies included Captain Thomas White and Lieutenants Richard Williams, George Merz, and David Manwell; Harrison was in charge of beginning preparing and Petre for cutting edge guidance. Petre was elevated to skipper, with the goal that his rank was equivalent to White's. In October, Petre led the principal meeting of the Australian Aero Club, held at Point Cook.
