The Bohr display functioned admirably for hydrogen, yet couldn't clarify increasingly complex components. By 1919, Bohr was moving far from the possibility that electrons circled the core and created heuristics to depict them. The uncommon earth components represented a specific characterization issue for scientific experts, since they were so artificially comparative. An imperative advancement came in 1924 with Wolfgang Pauli's disclosure of the Pauli avoidance guideline, which put Bohr's models on a firm hypothetical balance. Bohr was then ready to proclaim that the up 'til now unfamiliar component 72 was not an uncommon earth component, yet a component with substance properties like those of zirconium. He was quickly tested by the French scientific expert Georges Urbain, who professed to have found an uncommon earth component 72, which he called "celtium". At the Institute in Copenhagen, Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy responded to the call of refuting Bohr right and Urbain. Beginning with a reasonable thought of the substance properties of the obscure component incredibly rearranged the pursuit procedure. They experienced examples from Copenhagen's Museum of Mineralogy searching for a zirconium-like component and before long discovered it. The component, which they named hafnium ("Hafnia" being the Latin name for Copenhagen) ended up being more typical than gold.
