"Californication" got ideal surveys as opposed to its less well known ancestor, "One Hot Minute", and it was a more prominent achievement around the world. "Moving Stone" credited Kiedis for his definitely improved vocals: "[his] vocal strings have clearly been down to certain intersection and over the recovery, and came back with to this point unbelievable range, body, pitch, depth, and melodic reasonableness." Songs, for example, "Otherside" and "Porcelain" were designated "Pumpkins-esque", while the collection in general might have been "epiphanal" and the "RHCP furthermuckers are currently advancing toward funk's genuine Holy Grail: that salty marriage of exclusive folklore and voracious musicality that rescues spirits, ties networks and recuperates the debilitated." Other commentators attributed the collection's prosperity to the arrival of Frusciante. AllMusic's Greg Prato said that the "conspicuous purpose behind [the band's] resurrection is the return of guitarist John Frusciante", believing him to be the "quintessential RHCP guitarist". The collection overall might have been "a "true blue" Chili Peppers exemplary". "Stimulation Weekly" additionally acknowledges Frusciante for changing the band's sound into an "increasingly loose, less grinding, and, in their own specific manner, more thoughtful collection than any other time in recent memory". Imprint Woodlief of "Beam Gun" remarked that "'This Velvet Glove' strikes a many-sided balance between a rich acoustic guitar establishment and anthemic shake," Woodlief proceeded "the disco introduction to 'Parallel Universe' offers path to a burning Western jazzed up theme in the melody, and Frusciante's Hendrix-like journeys at the tune's nearby."
