Team 16 came back toward the South Pacific in October 1942, without a moment to spare to make part in the definitive move of the crusade, the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, when the Japanese Army and Navy attempted to recover the landing strip of Guadalcanal. Notwithstanding "Endeavor", Kinkaid's power incorporated the ship "South Dakota", overwhelming cruiser "Portland", against flying machine cruiser "San Juan", and eight destroyers. Luckily, both "Venture" and "South Dakota" had been fitted with the new Bofors 40 mm enemy of flying machine firearms. In the three early transporter fights, Kinkaid had been a subordinate leader. This time he was in generally direction, accountable for Task Force 61, which included the two his own Task Force 16 and Rear Admiral George D. Murray's Task Force 17, worked around the plane carrying warship . The fight unfurled gravely. "Hornet" was sunk, and "Endeavor", "South Dakota" and "San Juan" were seriously harmed. Pilots like Murray and John H. Towers accused Kinkaid, as a non-pilot, for the loss of "Hornet". It turned into a dark imprint on Kinkaid's record. The Japanese had won another strategic triumph, however Kinkaid's bearers had picked up the Americans valuable time to get ready and fortify.
