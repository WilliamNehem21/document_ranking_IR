The North Eastern Railway War Memorial was at long last developed once the antiquated Monuments Board endorsed Lutyens' adjusted plan; it was divulged by Field Marshal Herbert Plumer, first Baron Plumer (later first Viscount Plumer) at a function on 14 June 1924, and committed by the Archbishop of York Cosmo Gordon Lang. A horde of five to six thousand individuals assembled for the service, among them numerous city authorities and officers of the LNER and previous NER, including Sir Ralph Wedgwood, boss officer of the LNER; the Sheriff of York; and the master civic chairmen of Bradford, Hull, and York. Guards from the Durham Light Infantry remained at the four corners of the Stone of Remembrance. Among those to give addresses was Edward Gray, first Viscount Gray of Fallodon, an individual from the NER's board and the previous remote secretary celebrated for his comment "the lights are going out". Dark talked about the misfortunes brought about by the war: "the old North Eastern board and its general supervisor numbered around twenty people. Out of those twenty, four lost children in the war; three lost just children. There is no motivation to assume that extent is uncommon". At the finish of the administration, the "Last Post" was sounded and the group watched two minutes' quiet. The city's war dedication was disclosed a year later.
