In spite of the fact that sci-fi (sf) had been distributed before the 1920s, it didn't start to blend into an independently advertised kind until the appearance in 1926 of "Stunning Stories", a mash magazine distributed by Hugo Gernsback. Before the finish of the 1930s the field was blasting, and a few new sf magazines were propelled in 1939. Frederik Pohl, a sci-fi fan and yearning author, visited Robert Erisman, the editorial manager of "Wonder Science Stories" and "Dynamic Science Stories", to request a vocation. Erisman did not have an opening for him, however revealed to Pohl that Popular Publications, a main mash distributer, was beginning another line of low-paying magazines and may be keen on including a sci-fi title. On October 25, 1939, Pohl visited Rogers Terrill at Popular, and was enlisted quickly, at nineteen years old, on a pay of ten dollars for each week. Pohl was given two magazines to alter: "Super Science Stories" and "Amazing Stories". "Super Science Stories" was proposed to convey longer pieces, and "Astounding" concentrated on shorter fiction; "Super Science Stories" was retitled "Super Science Novels Magazine" in March 1941, mirroring this approach, yet after just three issues the title was changed back to "Super Science Stories".
