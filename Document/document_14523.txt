At the time Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska overall, and Interior Alaska specifically, was scantily settled. The 1960 United States Census recorded only 226,127 individuals as occupants of Alaska, making it the least-populated state in the United States around then. Inside Alaska contained around 28,000 occupants, and advertisers recommended that the dam's advantages would immeasurably exceed the expenses to the couple of inhabitants who might be dislodged. An anonymous Gruening staff member once said the zone to be overwhelmed by the dam was useless, containing "not in excess of ten flush toilets. Hunt the entire world and it is hard to locate a proportionate zone with so little to be lost through flooding." In a 1963 letter reacting to a "Sports Illustrated" article about the dam, Gruening composed, As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they couldn't yet be in an ideal situation than they are presently. Their towns are overwhelmed discontinuously by the Yukon. Their homes are hopeless and their work an uncovered subsistence enhanced by help. Development of the Rampart Dam will give them plentiful productive work, and in their new areas, picked by them on the lake's fringes, they will have better homes, better network offices and a changeless salary from now nonexistent exercises, created by the lake.
