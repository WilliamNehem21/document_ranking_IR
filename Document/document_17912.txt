That starting field position proved a boon for the Virginia Tech defense, which only allowed 200Â total yards in the game. Tech linebacker Vince Hall led the Hokies and all defensive players with 13Â tackles in the game. Tech recorded one interception during the game, courtesy of Brenden Hill, who also made threeÂ tackles. Georgia's offensive line, despite starting only six scholarship offensive linemen, allowed just twoÂ sacks to the Virginia Tech defense. Chris Ellis and Noland Burchette each earned a single sack, accounting for a loss of 15Â totalÂ yards.
The win over #14Â Virginia Tech enabled the Bulldogs to break into the TopÂ 25 rankings in the final college football poll of the season. Georgia was rankedÂ #23 in the country thanks to its win over the Hokies, who dropped to #19Â nationally following the loss. The loss snapped a six-game winning streak by Virginia Tech and ended the Hokies' bid at becoming just the fourth team in school history to win 11 games in a season. The 2006 Georgia Bulldogs, consequently, became the first team in school history to defeat three consecutive ranked teams. No.Â 5 Auburn, No.Â 16 Georgia Tech, and No.Â 14 Virginia Tech all fell to Georgia in November or December. The game and the tens of thousands of fans it attracted injected an estimated $35Â million into the Atlanta area economy, mostly as a result of food, hotel, and other expenses incurred by visiting fans.
