The NWOBHM in the long run discovered space in papers and music magazines other than "Sounds", as columnists made up for lost time with the "following huge thing" occurring in the UK. "Tune Maker" even distributed a week after week overwhelming metal graph dependent on record shop deals. "Sounds" distributer abused his help of the development to dispatch the principal issue of "Kerrang!", a shading magazine coordinated by Geoff Barton gave only to hard shake and substantial metal, in June 1981. "Kerrang!" was an unforeseen achievement and before long turned into the reference magazine for metalheads around the world, pursued in a matter of seconds by the American "Carnival" and "Hit Parader", the German "Metal Hammer" and the British "Metal Forces". The consideration of global media implied more record deals and increasingly world visits for NWOBHM groups, whose collections entered numerous remote graphs. Their endeavors to climb the British diagrams finished in Iron Maiden's "The Number of the Beast" besting the UK Albums Chart on 10 April 1982 and remaining at number 1 for about fourteen days. The collection diagrammed at number 33 in the US, where the band procured a notoriety for being Devil-admirers because of the collection spread's portrayal of a ghastly scene.
