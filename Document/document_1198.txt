Borah was resolved to see that the Republican presidential hopeful in 1920 was not master League. He bolstered his individual Irreconcilable, California Senator Hiram Johnson, who had been Roosevelt's running mate in 1912. Borah claimed pay off with respect to the main contender for the Republican assignment, General Leonard Wood, and was scorned when he requested to realize the League perspectives on Wood's primary opponent, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden. At the point when the 1920 Republican National Convention met in Chicago in June, delegates confronted a stop both concerning who should head the ticket, and with regards to the substance of the League board of the gathering stage. The League battle was chosen, with Borah's underwriting, by utilizing language proposed by previous Secretary of State Elihu Root supporting "a" class, as opposed to "the" League. The presidential stalemate was more enthusiastically to determine. A hater both of political interest and of tobacco, Borah had no impact in the smoke-filled room talks as the Republicans endeavored to break the stop. He was at first apathetic about the possible chosen one, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, his partner on the Foreign Relations Committee, as he was disillusioned at the disappointment of Johnson's application and loathed Harding's dubious position on the League. By and by, Borah emphatically supported Harding and his running mate, Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, who were successful. Borah later expressed he would have left the Senate had Harding lost.
