Birkett attempted to sit as routinely in the House of Lords as could reasonably be expected, and made his lady discourse on 8 April 1959 regarding the matter of wrongdoing in the United Kingdom. In May, he moved the principal perusing of the Obscene Publications Bill, which go with help from the two sides of the house. Secretly, Birkett trusted that "there will never be a tasteful law in England about indecency. Our 1959 Act is the best we have yet done." In 1961, he was again welcomed by the BBC to give a progression of chats on the BBC Home Service, this time titled "Six Great Advocates". He picked Edward Marshall-Hall, Patrick Hastings, Edward Clarke, Rufus Isaacs, Charles Russell and Thomas Erskine. He sat once and for all in the House of Lords on 8 February 1962, where he gave a discourse scrutinizing a component of the Manchester Corporation Bill which would have water depleted from Ullswater to address the issues of the developing populace in Manchester. His discourse was "profoundly felt and expressive", and when the votes were reported, Birkett and his supporters had won by 70 votes to 36. The Ullswater Yacht Club presently holds a yearly Lord Birkett Memorial Trophy Race on the lake.
