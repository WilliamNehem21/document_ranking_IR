Pine rocklands (likewise called pinelands) are found on uneven limestone substrates that contain apexes and arrangement gaps. There are three essential areas of pine rocklands: the Miami Ridge, which keeps running from Miami into Long Pine Key close to the fundamental passageway of Everglades National Park; the lower Florida Keys; and the Big Cypress Swamp. The most huge element of the pine rockland biological system is the South Florida cut pine ("Pinus elliotti" var "densa"; additionally called Dade County pine) that achieves a stature of . Pine rockland networks require fire for support; they have adjusted to advance and oppose fire in the meantime. These people group are situated in the most noteworthy piece of the Everglades with next to zero hydroperiod, albeit a few stories may have overwhelmed arrangement openings or puddles for a couple of months on end. The sandy floor of the pine rocklands is secured with dry pine needles that are very combustible. South Florida cut pines are protected by their bark to shield them from warmth. Flame disposes of contending vegetation on the timberland floor, and opens pine cones to grow seeds. A period without huge flame can transform pineland into hardwood lounger as bigger trees surpass the cut pines. The understory bushes in pine rocklands incorporate heat proof species like saw palmetto ("Serenoa repens"), cabbage palm ("Sabal palmetto"), and West Indian lilac ("Tetrazygia bicolor"). The most differing gathering of plants in the pine network are herbs, of which two dozen species exist. These plants contain tubers and different instruments considering brisk sprouts in the wake of singing.
