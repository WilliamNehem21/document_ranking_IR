The ending of Boydâs presidency in 1872 did not see the end of him as a member of the Institution; he continued as a member of the council until 1882. In 1875, he joined forces with his son Robert Fenwick Boyd to produce a paper on "The Coal- Measures and Oil Produce of the United States of America".<ref>Boyd, E.F. Remarks on the coal measures and oil produce of the United States of America, collected during a visit to that country in the autumn of 1875.ââTransactions - North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineersââ âââ25âââ, 1875â76, 145-175</> This venture took them to the United States of America to gather information on the origins and production of the mineral oil. This paper was the last of Edward Fenwick Boydâs work to be read and disputed before the members of the Mining Institute before turning his focus and the remainder of his life to serving as a magistrate for the county. He devoted the rest of his time and health to the law and to county business. However, as his physical health began to deteriorate in 1883 he was forced to retire back to Moor House ending all activity in both the court room and the Institute and he was put under the care of his daughter until his death on 31 August 1889.
