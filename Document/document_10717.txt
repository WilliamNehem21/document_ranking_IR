Illinois Representative Chauncey Reed had presented the Elgin coin enactment at Rovelstad's command, and both the stone carver and Hoffecker worked with him to propel the bill through Congress. In February 1936, Hoffecker, who had been named by ANA President T. James Clarke to lead a council against maltreatment in the issuance of memorial coins, went to Washington, going through Chicago on his approach to visit Rovelstad. The two men had planned to hold the mintage to 10,000, to have the capacity to sell the coins at a more expensive rate. Congress, nonetheless, was not disapproved to make a low-mintage memorial, as there had been a few issues which had been struck in little numbers just to sell at high costs, and the bill was revised to accommodate 25,000 half dollars. Hoffecker would have liked to bring down the number, encouraging the stone worker to campaign for a decline. Hoffecker noted it would be significantly more work to sell 25,000, and they couldn't direction as high a cost. There were countless coin charges in Congress in 1936, and the seller expected that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would begin vetoing them. Hoffecker visited Washington twice more in May, when meeting Rovelstad there, where they campaigned individuals from Congress.
