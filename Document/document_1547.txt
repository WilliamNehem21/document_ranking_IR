Vinson, who watched live hoopoe starlings when he lived on RÃÂ©union, depicted the peak as adaptable, divided and forward-twisted thorns of different lengths, most noteworthy in the inside, and ready to be raised voluntarily. He contrasted the fledgling's peak with that of a cockatoo and to the tail quills of a fowl of-heaven. Most mounted examples have an erect peak, demonstrating its regular position. The main outline of the hoopoe starling presently thought to have been produced using life was drawn by French craftsman Paul Philippe Sauguin de Jossigny amid the mid 1770s. Jossigny taught etchers under the illustration that for precision, they ought to portray the peak calculated forward from the head (not straight up). Hume trusts that Martinet did this when he made the sort representation, and it was subordinate of Jossigny's picture instead of an actual existence drawing. Jossigny additionally made the main realized life drawing of the now-wiped out Newton's parakeet ("Psittacula exsul") after an example sent to him from Rodrigues to Mauritius, so this is maybe likewise where he drew the hoopoe starling. Murie recommended that just the outlines by Martinet and Jacques Barraband were "unique", since he was ignorant of Jossigny's illustration, yet noticed a roughness and firmness in them which influenced neither to seem similar.
