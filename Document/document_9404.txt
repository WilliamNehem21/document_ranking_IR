For a long time QuÃÂ©let's name and portrayal were treated as substantial on the grounds that Bulliard's name predated Persoon's. Be that as it may, in 1950, an adjustment in the "Universal Code of Botanical Nomenclature" (named the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused just names on organisms distributed after 1801 or 1821 (contingent upon their sort) to be legitimate. This implied abruptly Bulliard's name was never again a substantial name, and now it was Persoon's name that had need. In any case it was an outstanding name, and the effectively clamorous circumstance brought about by a change to a well known Latin name was additionally confounded by another of QuÃÂ©let's recommendations.

These two way to deal with class situation, utilizing either "Rhodophyllus" or "Entoloma", existed together for a long time, with mycologists and manuals following either; Henri Romagnesi, who examined the family for more than forty years, favored "Rhodophyllus", as at first did Rolf Singer. Nonetheless, most different experts have would in general support "Entoloma", and Singer yielded the name was unquestionably more broadly utilized and received it for his "Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy" message in 1986.
