Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer throughout pre-production of the action thriller "Reindeer Games" (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've been doing this for a long time and he's really one of the nicest." He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" enjoying the unexpected casting choice: "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of "Reindeer Games"." He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama "Boiler Room" (2000). A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" felt Affleck had "traced over" Alec Baldwin's performance in "Glengarry Glen Ross", while Peter Rainer of "New York Magazine" said he "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated "". In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama "Bounce". Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" praised the "understated intensity and exquisite detail" of his performance: "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive."
