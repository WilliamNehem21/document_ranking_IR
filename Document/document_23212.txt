"Banksia aemula" is generally a gnarled shrub or small tree to , although usually smaller. Conversely, individual wallum banksias have been measured at high, with a maximum diameter at breast height of in forest on North Stradbroke Island. The trunk has thick orange-brown wrinkled and warty bark, and the new growth is hairy but becomes smooth as it ages. New shoot growth is in spring and summer. The shiny green leaves are obovate to oblong in shape and measure in length, and in width. The leaf ends are truncate and the margins flat and serrated. Flowering is in autumn, from March to June; the green-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are terminal, found on the ends of branches and emerging from the foliage. Measuring in height and in width, they are various shades of pale and greenish yellow. Anywhere from 800 to 1700 individual small flowers arise from a central woody spike (or rachis). Initially tipped with white conical pollen presenters, the flowers open sequentially from the bottom to the top of the flower spike over one to two weeks, in a process known as sequential anthesis. Each flower produces nectar for around seven days after opening. The flower spikes turn grey as they age and up to 25 finely furred grey follicles appear, which can be very large, measuring long, high, and wide. They split open either after bushfire or spontaneously, and release oval seeds in length, composed of a wedge-shaped body long and wide, and curved wing wide. "Banksia aemula" resprouts from its woody lignotuber after fire.
