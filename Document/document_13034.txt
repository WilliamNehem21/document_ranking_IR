Petrie had built up associations with the Egyptological wing of Manchester Museum in Manchester, and it was there that a large number of his finds had been housed. Murray hence frequently headed out to the historical center to inventory these ancient rarities, and amid the 1906Ã¢ÂÂ 07 school year normally addressed there. In 1907, Petrie exhumed the Tomb of the Two Brothers, a Middle Kingdom entombment of two Egyptian clerics, Nakht-ankh and Khnum-nakht, and it was chosen that Murray would complete the open unwrapping of the last's preserved body. Occurring at the exhibition hall in May 1908, it spoke to the first occasion when that a lady had driven an open mummy unwrapping and was gone to by more than 500 spectators, drawing in press consideration. Murray was especially quick to underscore the significance that the unwrapping would have for the insightful comprehension of the Middle Kingdom and its internment rehearses, and lashed out against individuals from the open who considered it to be corrupt; she pronounced that "each remnant of antiquated stays must be painstakingly examined and recorded without nostalgia and without dread of the objection of the insensible". She in this way distributed a book about her investigation of the two bodies, "The Tomb of the Two Brothers", which remained a key production on Middle Kingdom embalmment rehearses into the 21st century.
