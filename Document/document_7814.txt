The diversion's craft executive was Yusuke Naora, who had filled in as a creator for "Definite Fantasy VI". With the switch into 3D, Naora understood that he expected to relearn drawing, as 3D visuals require an altogether different methodology than 2D. With the enormous scale and extent of the venture, Naora was conceded a group dedicated completely to the amusement's visual plan. The division's obligations included outline, demonstrating of 3D characters, finishing, the formation of conditions, special visualizations, and activity. Naora later characterized the craftsmanship style of "Conclusive Fantasy VII" as "dull" and "peculiar". The Shinra logo, which fused a kanji image, was drawn by Naora by and by. Special craftsmanship, notwithstanding the logo work of art, was made by Yoshitaka Amano, a craftsman whose relationship with the arrangement returned to its origin. While he had played an unmistakable job in prior sections, Amano was unfit to do as such for "Definite Fantasy VII", because of duties at abroad presentations. His logo work of art depended on Meteor: when he saw pictures of Meteor, he didn't know how to transform it into appropriate craftsmanship. At last, he made various varieties of the picture and requested that staff pick which they favored. The green shading speaks to the dominating lighting in Midgar and the shade of the Lifestream, while the blue mirrored the environmental subjects present in the story. Its shading straightforwardly affected the general shading of the diversion's surroundings.
