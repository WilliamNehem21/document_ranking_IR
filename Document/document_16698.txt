That year, Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work opposite Abhishek Bachchan in "Bunty Aur Babli", a comedy film which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films. She played the title character of Vimmi "Babli" Saluja, a con woman. The film was the second highest-grossing film of 2005 and Mukerji's third major success in two consecutive years. Film critic Namrata Joshi wrote that "Rani plays to the gallery with ease" and Taran Adarsh wrote that she "sinks her teeth into the role and comes out with flying colours". She followed it with Amol Palekar's fantasy film "Paheli", reuniting her with Shah Rukh Khan. The film was a box office flop in India but was given a strong international release; it was screened at the Sundance Film Festival and was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. Raja Sen of Rediff.com was impressed by the film as well as Mukerji's performance which he called "another perfectly played part". Mukerji's fourth and final release of the year was the highly anticipated period film "". Director Ketan Mehta initially approached her for a cameo appearance, which was developed into an "important part" after she gave her consent to star in the film. Her role was that of Heera, a prostitute who forms the love interest of the title character (played by Aamir Khan). Derek Elley of "Variety" mentioned that Mukerji made "the most of her feisty nautch-girl," despite having "a small role for a star of her caliber."
