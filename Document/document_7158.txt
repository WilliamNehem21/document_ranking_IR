In the wake of bypassing Daedra, Mythic Dawn individuals and snags, the player stands up to Camoran and slaughters him. The player restores the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they along these lines travel to the Imperial City with the Blades to relight the Dragonfires and end the Daedric attack. They discover the city enduring an onslaught by Daedra and a gigantic symbol of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin battle their way to the Temple of the One. There, Martin regrets that they are feeble against Dagon's symbol and clarifies that they can just annihilation him one way. He says goodbye to the player and breaks the Amulet of Kings, combining himself with the soul of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, therefore turning into Akatosh's symbol. After a fight, Akatosh throws Dagon over into Oblivion and lets out a powerful thunder before swinging to stone. Martin, whose spirit was devoured by the ornament, enters life following death to join his ancestors. In a clairvoyant monolog to the player, he reveals an idealistic insight, clarifying that while the Amulet of Kings is demolished and the position of authority again lies unfilled, the doors of Oblivion are currently closed always and the eventual fate of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor earnestly thanks the player for their administration amid the emergency and announces them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.
