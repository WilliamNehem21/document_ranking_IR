Dunstan broke new ground in Australian legislative issues with his approaches on local title for Aborigines. The North West Aboriginal Reserve (NWAR) secured over 7% of the state's territory, and was possessed by the Pitjantjatjara individuals. In 1977, when the NWAR was going to be exchanged to the Aboriginal Lands Trust, an inborn designation requested the grounds to be given to the customary proprietors. Dunstan consented to an examination, and along these lines presented the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill. This bill proposed for an innate body, the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku, to assume responsibility for the NWAR and further terrains after the cases were cleared by a free court. It likewise proposed to enable the body to choose mining recommendations on the land and get sovereignties. This stirred discontent among mining interests, however a bipartisan parliamentary board of trustees supported the bill and it was postponed. In any case, Labor lost power before the bill was passed and despite the fact that the new Liberal government said they would expel the mining confinements, mass open arouses constrained them to yield, and a bill like Dunstan's was passed. The enactment, the bedrock of which was laid by Dunstan, was the most reformist in Australia, and during the 1980s, over 20% of the land was come back to its conventional proprietors.
