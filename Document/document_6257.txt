Joshua Walsh was in charge of making "Genuine Detective" fine art. His work for the show comprises of more than 100 individual "fiend's homes"Ã¢ÂÂ twig figures made by the executionerÃ¢ÂÂalongside divider artistic creations and small scale models of men made of brew jars, among others. As per DiGerlando, Walsh's interests in chasing and taxidermy made him "the ideal man for the activity". An outline for the villain's homes was not entrenched in the content, other than particulars that the structures have the capacity to remain without anyone else and include a winding theme. DiGerlando and Walsh ran with a tripod structure that demonstrated a winding when seen from the base, and contained stepping stool like intersection components that symbolized the executioner's craving to rise to a dull profound plane. Each plan had inconspicuous contrasts from each other. DiGerlando refered to crafted by Henry Darger and James Charles Castle as solid elaborate impacts and looked for a crude search for the figures, one that uncovered the functions of a man with "some profound internal inclination to convey what needs be". To mirror this, Walsh constructed fiend's homes utilizing mud, used youngsters' dress, reeds, roots, and different materials he felt the executioner would utilize.
