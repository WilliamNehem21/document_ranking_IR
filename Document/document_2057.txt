Hugh McCulloch, the Treasury Secretary under Lincoln and Johnson, trusted the notes were a crisis measure just and figured they ought to be continuously pulled back. McCulloch proposed a bill, the Contraction Act, to change over a portion of the greenbacks from notes redeemable in bonds to enthusiasm bearing notes redeemable in coin. Most Senate Finance Committee individuals had no complaint, and Sherman got himself alone contrary to it, trusting that pulling back greenbacks from dissemination would get the cash supply and mischief the economy. Sherman rather supported leaving the current notes available for use and giving the development access populace make up for lost time to the development in cash supply. He recommended an alteration that would rather simply enable the Treasury to reclaim the notes for lower-premium bonds, since the administration's obtaining costs had diminished. Sherman's correction was voted against, and the Contraction Act passed; greenbacks would be step by step pulled back, yet those as yet circling would be redeemable for the high-intrigue bonds as previously. In his diaries, Sherman called this law "the most damaging and costly budgetary measure at any point instituted by Congress," as the proceeded with high-intrigue installments it required "included completely $300,000,000 of enthusiasm" to the national obligation.
