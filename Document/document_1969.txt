FaurÃÂ© was not extraordinarily inspired by arrangement, and every so often asked his previous understudies, for example, Jean Roger-Ducasse and Charles Koechlin to coordinate his show and theater works. In Nectoux's words, FaurÃÂ©'s commonly calm instrumental style mirrors "an unequivocal tasteful attitudeÃÂ ... The possibility of timbre was not a deciding one in FaurÃÂ©'s melodic reasoning". He was not pulled in by showy blends of tone-hues, which he thought either liberal or a camouflage for absence of genuine melodic innovation. He told his understudies that it should be conceivable to create a coordination without falling back on glockenspiels, celestas, xylophones, ringers or electrical instruments. Debussy respected the spareness of FaurÃÂ©'s organization, finding in it the straightforwardness he made progress toward in his own 1913 expressive dance "Jeux"; Poulenc, on the other hand, portrayed FaurÃÂ©'s coordination as "a heavy overcoatÃÂ ... instrumental mud". FaurÃÂ©'s best-realized symphonic works are the suites "Masques et bergamasques" (in light of music for an emotional stimulation, or "divertissement comique"), which he coordinated himself, "Dolly", arranged by Henri Rabaud, and "PellÃÂ©as et MÃÂ©lisande" which draws on coincidental music for Maeterlinck's play; the stage variant was organized by Koechlin, yet FaurÃÂ© himself improved the organization for the distributed suite.
