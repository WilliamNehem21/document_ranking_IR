In spite of the fact that the Sunday "Post" was finished as a result of money related misfortunes, the McNeery segments were moved to the Saturday version in view of their notoriety. This nearby notoriety accompanied some disturbance to McNeery's genuine simple, McGarry, who ended up called McNeery, and even gazed at by a Swedish migrant, a nationality held by Chicago Irish in abhor. One evening, when Dunne was in McGarry's bar, the columnist discovered him uncommunicative, until his unexpected blast, "You can't put printer's ink on me without any potential repercussions," declaring that he expected to see Dunne's distributer, John R. Walsh. As indicated by Grace Eckley in her volume on Dunne's works, the political positions McNeery was made to embrace were in opposition to those of a portion of McGarry's clients, putting him in an awkward position. The next day, Walsh asked Dunne to change the name, however the author chose this would not be sufficient if the anecdotal cantina was kept as may be; rather a humbler foundation (and barkeep) in some remoter piece of Chicago appeared called for. McKenna, not at all like McGarry, was getting a charge out of the consideration, and, knowing about the issue, took Dunne to his vigorously Irish neighborhood of Bridgeport, acquainting him with local people there. Moving the scene to Bridgeport had preferences. A "shanty Irish" barkeeper could be allowed more noteworthy opportunity of articulation than McNeery, for to progressively urbane Chicagoans, Bridgeporters were unsophisticated, amusing hicks. As Dunne later put it, "while it may be hazardous to consider a representative a criminal in English nobody could sue if a comic Irishman reproved the statesman as a hoodlum". McGarry's overwhelming brogue included in McNeery's discourse, and was held in the move to Bridgeport.
