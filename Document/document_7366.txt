Skelton's agreement required MGM's endorsement preceding his radio shows and different appearances. When he renegotiated his long haul contract with MGM, he needed a proviso that allowed him to stay working in radio and to have the capacity to take a shot at TV, which was then to a great extent trial. At the time, the significant work in the medium was focused in New York; Skelton had worked there for quite a while and had the capacity to verify that he would discover accomplishment with his physical satire through the medium. By 1947, Skelton's work advantages were centered not around movies, however on radio and TV. His MGM contract was sufficiently inflexible to require the studio's composed assent for his week after week radio shows, just as any advantage or comparative appearances he made; radio offered less limitations, progressively imaginative control and a higher pay. Skelton requested a discharge from MGM in the wake of learning he couldn't raise the $750,000 expected to purchase out the rest of his agreement. He additionally voiced dissatisfaction with the film contents he was offered while on the arrangement of "The Fuller Brush Man", saying, "Motion pictures are not my field. Radio and TV are." He didn't get the ideal TV condition nor a discharge from his MGM contract. In 1948, feature writer Sheilah Graham printed that Skelton's desires were to make just a single film a year, investing the remainder of the energy venturing to every part of the U.S. with his radio show.
