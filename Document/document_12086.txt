The Chandlers' shop at Union Street, as portrayed in a contemporary paper delineation, involved the corner premises of a structure of three stories. The family lived over the shop, with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler dozing in one room with their six-year-old child Henry, and Ayres sharing a room on the second floor with her nieces, five-year-old Edith, four-year-old Ellen and three-year-old Elizabeth. The evening of 1885, fire broke out in the oil and paint shop, catching the family upstairs. Explosive and containers of oil were put away in the lower floors of the structure, making the blazes spread quickly. Despite the fact that the shop was close to the central command of the London Fire Brigade and the crisis administrations were rapidly on scene, when the flame motor arrived serious flares were originating from the lower windows, making it incomprehensible for the flame detachment to position stepping stools. In the interim, Ayres, wearing just a nightdress, had endeavored to contact her sister yet was unfit to get to her through the smoke. The group that had accumulated outside the structure were yelling to Ayres to hop. Rather she came back to the room she imparted to the three young ladies and tossed a sleeping pad out of the window, cautiously dropping Edith onto it. Notwithstanding further calls from underneath to bounce and spare herself, she left the window and returned conveying Ellen. Ellen clung to Ayres and would not be dropped, however Ayres tossed her out of the structure, and the kid was gotten by an individual from the group. Ayres returned into the smoke a third time and returned conveying seriously harmed Elizabeth, whom she dropped securely onto the sleeping cushion.
