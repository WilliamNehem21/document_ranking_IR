Not long after Fromental HalÃÂ©vy's demise in 1862, Bizet had been drawn closer for the benefit of Mme. HalÃÂ©vy about finishing his old mentor's incomplete musical drama "NoÃÂ©". Albeit no move was made around then, Bizet stayed on inviting terms with the HalÃÂ©vy family. Fromental had left two girls; the senior, Esther, kicked the bucket in 1864, an occasion which so damaged Mme. HalÃÂ©vy that she couldn't endure the organization of her more youthful little girl GeneviÃÂ¨ve, who from the age of 15 lived with other relatives. It is hazy when GeneviÃÂ¨ve and Bizet turned out to be candidly connected, yet in October 1867, he educated Galabert: "I have met a cute young lady whom I adore! In two years she will be my better half!" The pair wound up connected, in spite of the fact that the HalÃÂ©vy family at first denied the match. As indicated by Bizet they thought about him an unacceptable catch: "poverty stricken, left-wing, hostile to religious and Bohemian", which Dean watches are odd grounds of protest from "a family bristling with craftsmen and erraticisms". By summer 1869, their protests had been survived, and the wedding occurred on 3 June 1869. Ludovic HalÃÂ©vy wrote in his diary: "Bizet has soul and ability. He "should" succeed".
