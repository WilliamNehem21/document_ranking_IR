Starting in 1867, the new Mint Director, Henry Linderman, (Pollock had surrendered) started to advocate for Congress to approve reclamation of surplus copper and bronze coinage. Despite the fact that the nickel could be reclaimed in parcels (consent conceded in its approving demonstration), there was no arrangement for the administration to repurchase the littler coins, and with all the more being issued consistently, there were such a large number of little esteem coins. Treasury authorities demanded the legislature couldn't acknowledge the pieces past their lawful delicate points of confinement, regardless of whether what was being done was trading them for other cash. Under Linderman, the Mint, with no lawful specialist, acquired $360,000 in bronze coins utilizing three-penny pieces and nickels. All things considered, a large number of two-penny pieces collected in the hands of paper and travel organizations, postmasters, and other people who took little installments from the general population, and there were protests to Congress. With the approach of the Grant organization, Pollock came back to office and restricted the recovery recommendations. In spite of the fact that he incorporated Pollock's suppositions as a component of his yearly report, Treasury Secretary George S. Boutwell requested that Congress pass a reclamation demonstration, and it did as such on MarchÃÂ 3, 1871, taking into consideration the recovery of minor coinage in bunches of at the very least $20. It likewise enabled the Treasury Secretary to stop the coinage of any piece recovered in expansive numbers. Compliant with the new law, the Mint in 1871 and 1872 recovered more than 37,000,000 little coins, including two-penny pieces.
