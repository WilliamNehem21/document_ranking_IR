St Francis lived severely, in impersonation of Christ. He grasped the characteristic world, and took promises of neediness, philanthropy and virtue. In 1224 at La Verna, he encountered the enchanted vision which van Eyck depicts. Thomas of Celano, creator of Francis' hagiography, depicts the vision and disparagement: "Francis had a dream in which he saw a man like a seraph: he had six wings and was remaining above him with his hands outstretched and his feet bound together, and was fixed to a cross. Two wings were lifted over his head, and two were spread prepared for flight, and two secured his entire body. At the point when Francis saw this he was totally stunned. He couldn't understand what this vision may mean." As he pondered, "characteristics of nails started to show up staring him in the face and feetÃÂ ... His hands and feet appeared to be pierced by nails showing up within his hands and the upper side of his feetÃÂ ... His correct side was scarred as though it had been pierced by a lance, and it frequently leaked blood." To the medieval eyewitness, the presence of the stigmata means Francis' finished retention in the vision of the seraph.
