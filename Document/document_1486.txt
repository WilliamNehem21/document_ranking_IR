NediÃÂ's powerlessness to pound the Partisans and Chetniks provoked the Military Commander in Serbia to demand German fortifications from different pieces of the mainland. In mid-September, they exchanged the 125th Infantry Regiment from Greece and the 342nd Infantry Division from France to help put down the uprising in Serbia. On 16ÃÂ September, Hitler issued Directive No.ÃÂ 312 to "Generalfeldmarschall" (Field Marshal) Wilhelm List, the "Wehrmacht" administrator in Southeast Europe, requesting him to stifle all obstruction in that piece of the mainland. That equivalent day, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces ("Oberkommando der Wehrmacht"; OKW) issued Hitler's organization on the concealment of "Socialist Armed Resistance Movements in the Occupied Areas", marked by "Generalfeldmarschall" Wilhelm Keitel. This announcement indicated that all assaults against the Germans on the Eastern Front were to be "viewed as being of socialist root", and that 100ÃÂ hostages were to be shot for each German fighter executed and 50ÃÂ were to be shot for each German trooper injured. It was proposed to apply to all of Eastern Europe, however an indistinguishable approach had just been actualized in Serbia as ahead of schedule as 28ÃÂ April 1941, went for preventing guerrilla assaults. Assaults against the Germans expanded in the main portion of the year and Serbia indeed turned into a warzone. German troops fanned through the farmland consuming towns, taking prisoners and building up death camps. The principal mass executions of prisoners started in July.
