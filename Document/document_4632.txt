Mazama was secured with radiant pumice. The extraordinary load of eruptive material started to push down on the spring of gushing lava's summit, like a cylinder. In the long run, the highest point of Mazama's magma load died down, and concentric openings framed by the summit, creating littler vents encompassing the primary eruptive cone. Pumice launched out from these new breaks made fast pyroclastic streams that coursed down every one of the sides of Mazama, going over tall edges and summits of subfeatures and expanding many miles from their vents. These streams modified the surfaces encompassing Mazama, expelling ashfall and afterward keeping their substance in adjacent valleys. A portion of the streams voyaged more than from their source, obliterating timber in their ways, while others kept their stone into waterway valleys toward the north and west of Mazama, leaving layers of pumice between in thickness. Cinder mists likewise ascended from the pyroclastic streams. Pyroclastic streams likewise moved toward the east, achieving more than from the base of Mazama. These stores have distances across between , however they are punctuated by pumice obstructs with breadths of that reach out similarly as from Mazama's summit. Streams containing pumice coursed into the Annie Creek and Sun Creek gorge southward of Mazama, keeping of material, which have still not been completely disintegrated after very nearly 8,000 years. Toward the southeast, pyroclastic streams coursed into Sand Creek and expanded more than toward that path, some achieving Klamath Marsh, the Williamson River, and the Klamath Lakes.
