As the galactic plane goes through it, Serpens Cauda contains numerous enormous OB stars. A few of these are noticeable to the bare eye, for example, NW Serpentis, an early Be star that has been observed to be to some degree variable. The changeability is intriguing; as indicated by one investigation, it could be one of the principal found half and halves between Beta Cephei factors and gradually throbbing B stars. Despite the fact that not unmistakable to the bare eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple framework comprising of three exceptionally hot O-type stars. An individual from the group NGC 6604, the two overshadowing stars are both blue monsters, with one being of the all around early unearthly sort O7.5III. The rest of the star is either a blue goliath or supergiant of a late O or early B ghastly sort. Additionally an obscuring paired, the HD 166734 framework comprises of two O-type blue supergiants in circle around one another. Less outrageous as far as mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic twofold comprising of a B-type essential and an Ap auxiliary, in spite of the fact that it is the main realized spectroscopic paired to comprise of a star with overabundance of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.
