Stanford Memorial Church, since its commencement, has been served by pastors who have been compelling among the Stanford University understudy body and network on the loose. R. Heber Newton, "recognized essayist" and previous minister at All Souls Church in New York, was handpicked by Jane Stanford to fill in as the congregation's first minister; he surrendered following four months in 1903 "in light of the fact that he couldn't help contradicting Mrs. Stanford on certain parts of chapel the executives". As per Stanford biographer Robert W. P. Cutler, "Newton's residency had been a failure to Mrs. Stanford". David Charles Gardner, who supplanted Newton, served the congregation from 1902 to his retirement in 1936. Stanford additionally handpicked Gardner as Newton's partner since she was inspired with his "area work" in Palo Alto. Gardner proceeded to show courses in Biblical history and writing at Stanford. Powerful English teacher and Stanford student of history Edith R. Mirrielees called Gardner "a minister of just impassive capacity", however thought of him as "a solidarity to the entire college". Mirrieless considered Gardner the prime mover behind the formation of the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children, set up in 1919, which in the end turned into the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
