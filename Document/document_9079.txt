The Whig Party was all the while looking to construct its state associations, and seeing minimal possibility of winning the administration in 1836, ran territorial contender for president. The arrangement was that a presidential competitor who was prominent locally, regardless of whether he didn't win, may support the Whig vote in favor of state workplaces. Some trusted the gathering of competitors may deny Jackson's picked successor, Vice President Martin Van Buren a greater part in the Electoral College. Harrison was referred to by then more as a war legend than as a lawmaker, as recollections of his time in Congress had blurred. As state Whig parties picked their presidential applicants by tradition or assembly, the other real Whig presidential hopeful from the North, Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster was crushed by Harrison in many states, in the end getting the chance to run just in his home state. Harrison made an outing from Ohio to Virginia, apparently to visit relatives, bringing about a long arrangement of gatherings and suppers. Harrison gave talks, yet as these were ostensibly in a debt of gratitude is in order for his appreciated, they didn't disregard the custom at the time that the workplace should look for the man, and that presidential applicants ought not enjoy electioneering. Harrison was the main Whig hopeful in the 1836 decision, taking 7 states and 73 appointive votes, however he and the other two mainstream vote competitors (Webster and Hugh Lawson White of Tennessee) couldn't prevent Van Buren from winning a greater part in the Electoral College.
