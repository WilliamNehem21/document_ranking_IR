The amusement's swipe-put together swordplay was based with respect to Donald Mustard's craving for a remarkable ongoing interaction dependent on nuanced sword battling and repelling. He portrayed the diversion's persuasions as the battle of "Karateka" and "Sovereign of Persia" joined with the "desolate epicness" of "Shadow of the Colossus". Seat looked to build up an encounter that could be gotten and played for a moment (a solitary fight) or for 30 minutes (a bloodline). They felt that numerous different designers familiar with consoles weren't right to make iOS recreations that required long playing encounters to feel important, thus Chair built up the bloodline idea as a characteristic breakpoint. They likewise felt that portable recreations like "Unendingness Blade" with consistent activity components went excessively long without giving the player time to unwind and brought about player weariness, thus Chair kept their individual fights short with brief true to life stops in longer fights. Seat demonstrated their playable demo at the Apple meeting on September 1, 2010, following quite a while of practice, and pulled in a great deal of consideration regarding the amusement. It was discharged on December 9, 2010. While Chair itself spent little on showcasing, Apple utilized the amusement widely in ads for its gadgets.
