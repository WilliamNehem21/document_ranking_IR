For Nigel Strudwick, the changes of Djedkare were embraced as a response to the quick development of the focal organization in the initial segment of the Fifth Dynasty which, Baer includes, had amassed an excess of political or financial power according to the ruler. Joyce Tyldesley sees the rule of Djedkare as the absolute starting point of a decrease in the significance of the lord, related to the steady ascent of the power used by the high and common organization. Simultaneous with this pattern is a procedure of decentralization, with neighborhood loyalties gradually overriding devotion to the focal state. Since workplaces and the vizierate specifically could be acquired, the changes of Djedkare made a "virtual medieval framework" as Nicolas Grimal composes, with much power in the hands of a couple of puissant authorities. This is best seen by the extensive, heavenly mastaba tombs that Djedkare's viziers assembled. In this specific situation, Djedkare's changes of the positioning framework may have been an endeavor at keeping up a rambling organization leveled out, yet at last fizzled. For certain Egyptologists, for example, Naguib Kanawati, this disappointment contributed in no little part to the fall of the Old Kingdom, yet others, including Strudwick, trust the reasons of the breakdown must be looked for somewhere else as the intensity of an organization official never moved toward that of the lord.
