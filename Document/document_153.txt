By May, the Brazilian government requested that Armstrong stop chip away at the new warship and to submit new structures which took in the latest development in maritime innovation, super-battleships. Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt filled in as Armstrong's contact to Brazil. The 1911 "EncyclopÃÂ¦dia Britannica" determines this structure as a long by and large, dispatch mounting twelve 14-inch weapons and costing close ÃÂ£3,000,000. The numerous solicitations made by the Brazilian Navy for minor changes deferred the agreement marking until 10 October 1910, and the war vessel's bottom laying was postponed further by a work question with the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, which prompted a lockout. Amid these deferrals, another Minister of the Navy, Admiral Marques LeÃÂ£o, was named to supplant de AlencarÃ¢ÂÂan imperative advancement, as the agreement stipulated that the plan could just continue with the endorsement of the new Minister. Once more, be that as it may, the Brazilian Navy ended up torn between two schools of thought: LeÃÂ£o and others in the naval force supported an inversion to the 12-inch weapon, however others, driven by the active Minister of the Navy (de Alencar) and the leader of the Brazilian maritime commission in the United Kingdom (Rear Admiral ), were unequivocally for getting the ship with the biggest deadly implementÃ¢ÂÂfor this situation, a plan drawn up by Bacellar, conveying eight 16-inch firearms, six 9.4-inch weapons, and fourteen 6-inch weapons.
