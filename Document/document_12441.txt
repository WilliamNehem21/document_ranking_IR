The pubis (pubic bone) was long and slim, finishing in a pubic boot which extended to the front and back, a general component of ornithomimosaurs. The rear appendages contrasted little from those of different ornithomimids, and were relatively longer than in different theropods. The femur was about straight, long and thin, with a sideways straightened shaft. The tibia was straight, long, with two very much created condyles (adjusted end of a bone) on the upper end and a smoothed lower end. The fibula of the lower leg was level, dainty and wide at the upper end narrowing towards the lower end. The lower half of the third metatarsal was wide when seen end on, halfway covering the abutting two metatarsals to each side, yet limited unexpectedly at mid-length, wedging between those bones and vanishing (an arctometatarsalian foot structure). The third toe was relatively shorter in connection to the appendage than in different ornithomimids. As in different ornithomimids, the foot had no hallux (or dewclaw, the principal toe of most different theropods). The unguals of the toes were level on their lower sides; the external two declined marginally outwards from their digits. The relative length of the bones in the rear appendages changed next to no with development.
