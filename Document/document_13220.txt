The PanzerÃÂ I was overhauled so as to build its lethality. On 8ÃÂ August 1937, Major General GarcÃÂ­a Pallasar got a note from GeneralÃÂ­simo Francisco Franco that communicated the requirement for a PanzerÃÂ I (or "negrillo", as their Spanish teams called them) with a 20-millimeter weapon. At last, the piece picked was the Breda Model 1935, because of the effortlessness of the structure over contenders, for example, the German Flak 30. Moreover, the 20ÃÂ mm Breda was fit for puncturing 40ÃÂ millimeters of protective layer at 250ÃÂ meters (1.57ÃÂ in at 275ÃÂ yd), which was more than adequate to infiltrate the frontal covering of the T-26. Albeit initially 40 Italian CV.35 light tanks were requested with the Breda instead of their unique weapon, this request was consequently dropped after it was imagined that the adjustment of a similar firearm to the PanzerÃÂ I would yield better outcomes. Models were prepared by SeptemberÃÂ 1937 and a request was set after victories. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the first turret to be opened at the top and afterward stretched out by a vertical enhancement. Four of these tanks were done at the Armament Factory of Seville, yet further creation was dropped as it was chosen adequate quantities of Republican T-26 tanks had been caught to satisfy the Nationalist authority's solicitation for progressively deadly tanks. The Breda adjustment was not especially loved by German teams, as the unprotected hole in the turret, intended to enable the tank's administrator to point, was observed to be an unsafe powerless point.
