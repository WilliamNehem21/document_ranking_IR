In the House, as the session started at 4:30 pm, the Whig MP Henry Brougham, a main adversary of the Orders, attracted consideration regarding the Prime Minister's nonattendance and commented that he should be there. A delivery person was sent to get Perceval from Downing Street, yet met him in Parliament Street (Perceval having chosen to walk and forgo his typical carriage) on his way to the House, where he landed at about 5:15. As Perceval entered the hall, he was stood up to by Bellingham who, drawing a gun, shot the Prime Minister in the chest. Perceval lurched forward a couple of steps and shouted "I am killed!" before falling face down at the feet of William Smith, the MP for Norwich. (It was likewise differently announced Perceval had said "Murder" or "Gracious my God".) Smith possibly understood that the unfortunate casualty was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards. When he had been conveyed into a bordering room and propped up on a table with his feet on two seats, he was silly, in spite of the fact that there was as yet a black out heartbeat. At the point when a specialist arrived a couple of minutes after the fact, the beat had ceased, and Perceval was announced dead.
