During a test-play, Kamiya discovered that enemies could be kept in the air by slashing them repeatedly, which led to the inclusion of juggles by gunfire and sword strikes in "Devil May Cry". According to the director, "Devil May Cry" was designed from the ground up around Dante's acrobatics and combat abilities. The decision was made late in the development process to change the game to a more mission-based advancement, instead of the more open-ended structure of the "Resident Evil" games. "Devil May Cry"s difficulty was intentional, according to Kamiya, who called it his "challenge to those who played light, casual games".
