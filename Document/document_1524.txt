Houston couldn't extra the quantity of men important to mount a fruitful barrier. Rather, he sent Colonel James Bowie with 30 men to expel the ordnance from the Alamo and annihilate the complex. Bowie was unfit to transport the mounted guns since the Alamo army did not have the important draft creatures. Neill before long influenced Bowie that the area held key significance. In a letter to Governor Henry Smith, Bowie contended that "the salvation of Texas depends in extraordinary measure on keeping BÃÂ©xar out of the hands of the adversary. It fills in as the boondocks picquet monitor, and on the off chance that it were in the ownership of Santa Anna, there is no fortification from which to repulse him in his walk towards the Sabine." The letter to Smith finished, "Colonel Neill and myself have gone to the serious goals that we will preferably kick the bucket in these trench over surrender it to the adversary." Bowie likewise kept in touch with the temporary government, requesting "men, cash, rifles, and gun powder". Hardly any fortifications were approved; rangers officer William B. Travis touched base in BÃÂ©xar with 30 men on February 3. After five days, a little gathering of volunteers arrived, including the renowned frontiersman and previous U.S. Congressman David Crockett of Tennessee.
