As the freeway passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver metropolitan area, part of a larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, USÂ 40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary eastâwest artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, USÂ 6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join InterstateÂ 76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets InterstateÂ 25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 servesâtogether with those two Interstatesâas part of an inner beltway around Denver.
I-70 has one official branch in Colorado, InterstateÂ 270, which connects the interstate with the DenverâBoulder Turnpike. Where these two freeways merge is the busiest portion of I-70 in the state, with an annual average daily traffic of 183,000 vehicles per day. While State HighwayÂ 470 and E-470 are not officially branches of I-70, they are remnants of plans for an I-470 outer beltway around Denver that were cancelled when the allocated funds were spent elsewhere.
