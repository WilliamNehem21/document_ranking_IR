Story related interactivity in "Conclusive Fantasy XI" comprises of two noteworthy segments: missions, through which the principle storyline of the amusement is told, and journeys, which don't propel the fundamental storyline, yet round out the diversion's dreamland. Finishing missions enables a player to progress in rank, which awards access to new territories, a few benefits, and different storylines. At initial, a player may just total missions for his home country, however they can change devotions later on, enabling access to other countries' storylines. Journeys might be attempted for their different prizes, or to obtain "notoriety," which enables a character to turn out to be notable and regarded by NPCs; a higher popularity rating will open up new communications and missions with NPCs. At discharge, more than one hundred journeys were accessible to play and every development pack has included its own arrangement of missions and journeys. Players get in-amusement cash known as gil by finishing missions, journeys and vanquishing Beastmen, however not at all like past "Conclusive Fantasy" recreations, these beasts drop just little sums. Gil would then be able to be traded among players for products through the Auction House, or be utilized to buy things and prizes from NPCs.
