The development railroad pursued the course of the previous River Irwell. To acquire development materials, the development railroad had an association with the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) east of Irlam rail route station. Consistently this permitted in excess of 10,000 tons of coal and 8,000 tons of bond to be conveyed to destinations along the channel removal. All current railroad organizations with lines along the course had been pulled out that their lines needed to either be relinquished by a given date or raised to give at least leeway with all deviation development expenses to be paid by the MSC. The CLC Glazebrook to Woodley mainline disregarded the River Mersey at Cadishead thus they chose to construct a deviation. Development of the Cadishead Viaduct started in 1892, drew nearer through earth banks, with two block curves getting to a multi-cross section iron support focus range of long. It opened to cargo on 27 February 1893 and to traveler traffic on 29 May 1893. Following the withdrawal of traveler benefits in 1964, the line progressed toward becoming cargo as it were. At the point when costly fixes to the viaduct were required in the mid 1980s British Rail picked to close it, together with the line to Glazebrook.
