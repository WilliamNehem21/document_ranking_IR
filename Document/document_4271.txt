ABC publicized another arrangement including the Hardy Boys, "The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries", from 1977 to 1979. The prime time arrangement featured Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy as Frank and Joe Hardy; Pamela Sue Martin and later Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew. Amid the principal season, the arrangement shifted back and forth between scenes highlighting the Hardy Boys multi week and Nancy Drew the following. The Hardy Boys were given a role as youthful grown-ups (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen separately amid the taping of the main scenes). The arrangement highlighted unique plots just as ones dependent on "Solid Boys" books, among them "The Clue of the Screeching Owl", "The Disappearing Floor" and "The Flickering Torch Mystery". The arrangement got an Emmy selection and highlighted various visitor stars, including Kim Cattrall, Ray Milland, Howard Duff, and Ricky Nelson. Amid the second season, the arrangement group changed to concentrate more on the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew showing up for the most part in hybrid scenes with the siblings; halfway through generation of the second season, Martin quit and was supplanted by Johnson. The arrangement returned for a third season, dropping the Nancy Drew character totally and shortening its title to "The Hardy Boys".
