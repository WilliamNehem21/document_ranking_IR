Philip Gibbs, an individual war journalist, noticed that he and his associates "distinguished totally with the Armies in the fieldÃÂ ... There was no need of oversight in our despatches. We were our own blue pencils." The journalistic help for the reason was valued by military officers, for example, Douglas Haig, who saw the purposeful publicity produced by the reporters as an essential piece of the Allies' endeavors. Haig in the long run ventured to such an extreme as to ask Gibbs and Beach Thomas to deliver his very own week by week news-sheet. General sentiment at home may have been placated, even elevated, by the endeavors of the reporters however the troops were not, in spite of the intense interest among them for papers from home. One fighter, Albert Rochester, was court martialled for endeavoring to send to the "Every day Mail" a letter that expressed the substances as he saw them and was reproachful of Beach Thomas' work, taking note of the "crazy reports with respect to the affection and association existing among officers and men". Shoreline Thomas himself later lamented his wartime reports of the Somme, saying, "I was altogether and profoundly embarrassed about what I had composed for the valid justification that it was untrueÃÂ ... the obscenity of huge features and the immensity of one's own name did not reduce the disgrace."
