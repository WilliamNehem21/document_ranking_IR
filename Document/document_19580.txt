Gediminas' daughter Elzbieta married WacÅaw of PÅock, one of the dukes of Masovia in modern-day eastern Poland. Her second name is recorded in writings by Maciej Stryjkowski as "Danmila" and Teodor Narbutt as "Damila". It has been suggested these names are misread versions of "DanutÄ", a name derived from "Daniel". Another interpretation is that historians confused DanutÄ of Lithuania, daughter of KÄstutis, with Elzbieta. As an alliance, the marriage was significant because passages to and from western Europe had to pass through Masovia; it can be seen as an attempt to revive Grand Duke Traidenis' and his daughter Gaudemunda's link with Masovia in the 1270s. The marriage's importance is attested by Elzbieta's dowry: 720 KrakÃ³w silver marks and nine marks of gold â three times more than an ordinary recorded dowry of the time. This marriage probably took place about 1316, when Gediminas supported WacÅaw during a civil war in the divided Duchy of Masovia. After WacÅaw's death in 1336, Elzbieta managed her own wealth. She is mentioned for the last time in 1361, when her brother KÄstutis escaped from Marienburg and sought refuge at his sister's house; historians put her date of death at around 1364. In 1337 Elzbieta's daughter Anna, first mentioned in late 1323, married Henry of Å»agaÅ, in modern-day western Poland. Her son BolesÅaw III or Bolko died without a male heir in 1351 and his land was divided among other dukes.
