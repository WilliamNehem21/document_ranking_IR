Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on the other hand, maintain that the dentary is referable to "Ferugliotherium" and that the p4s of "Argentodites" and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to "Ferugliotherium" in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of "Ferugliotherium" teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) do not belong to "Ferugliotherium", then, Gurovich and Beck argue, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals ("Ferugliotherium" and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar ecological nichesâand one of those would be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted that the transition from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in "Sudamerica" and "Gondwanatherium" is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and "Argentodites" p4s to the extensive wear of the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.
