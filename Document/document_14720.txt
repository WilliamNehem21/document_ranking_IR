In the mean time, hounded by poor organization and lacking bookkeeping, the Victory Bonds Club was sliding into disorder. Open unease developed, and soon many endorsers were requesting their cash backÃ¢ÂÂslipshod record-keeping implied that some were reimbursed a few times over. Bottomley's position intensified when he dropped out with Bigland, in the wake of declining to back his previous partner's plan for transforming water into petroleum. The two had squabbled amid the war, when Bigland had assaulted Bottomley in print. They had later accommodated, yet after their second question Bigland turned wrathful. In September 1921 he distributed a handout depicting the War Bond Club as Bottomley's "best in class cheat". Against the counsel of his legal counselors, Bottomley sued for criminal slander, and brought different charges against Bigland of coercion and blackmail. The starter hearing, at Bow Street Magistrates' Court in October 1921, at which Bottomley's techniques were uncovered, demonstrated appalling to his believability. By and by, Bigland was submitted for preliminary at the Old Bailey on the criticism charge, and to Shropshire Assizes on charges of endeavored blackmail. The criticism preliminary started on 23 January 1922; to anticipate further harming exposures in court, Bottomley's legal advisors offered no proof, and Bigland was released. The coercion case proceeded in Shrewsbury on 18 February 1922, toward the finish of which it took the jury just three minutes to discover Bigland not liable. Bottomley, himself now under police examination, was requested to pay the expenses of the preliminary. A couple of days a while later, he was gathered to show up at Bow Street, on charges of fake transformation of Victory Bond Club reserves. After a short hearing he was submitted for preliminary at the Old Bailey.
