Lloyd and Dillon came back to England in June 1914. Lloyd began a commonplace voyage through Liverpool, Aldershot, Southend, Birmingham and Margate, and completed the mid year season at the London Hippodrome. She sang "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris" and "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?", the last of which had been gotten especially well with her American crowds. Inside a fortnight, Britain was at war, which tossed the music-lobby world into chaos. The environment in London's music corridors had turned energetic, and theater owners frequently held philanthropy occasions and advantages to help the war exertion. Lloyd had her impact and every now and again visited clinics, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in Belfast, where she cooperated with injured servicemen. She likewise visited weapons processing plants to help support open assurance, yet got no official acknowledgment for her work. Amid 1914, she scored a hit with "A Little of What you Fancy", which pundits thought caught her life superbly up until that point. The tune is about a moderately aged lady who urges the more youthful age to have fun, instead of enjoying life's fervor herself. Amid the version, Lloyd delineates a youthful couple who snuggle and kiss on a railroad carriage, while she kicks back and reviews recollections of her doing likewise in years passed by.
