The Calusa were alluded to as "Carlos" by the Spanish, which may have seemed like "Calos", a variety of the Muskogean word "kalo" signifying "dark" or "incredible". Quite a bit of what is thought about the Calusa was given by Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda. Fontaneda was a 13-year-old kid who was the main overcomer of a wreck off the bank of Florida in 1545. For a long time he lived with the Calusa until voyager Pedro MenÃÂ©ndez de AvilÃÂ©s discovered him in 1566. MenÃÂ©ndez took Fontaneda to Spain where he expounded on his encounters. MenÃÂ©ndez moved toward the Calusa with the aim of building up relations without hardly lifting a finger the settlement of things to come Spanish province. The boss, or "cacique", was named Carlos by the Spanish. Places of significance in Calusa society were given the received names Carlos and Philip, transliterated from Spanish imperial convention. Be that as it may, the "cacique" Carlos depicted by Fontaneda was the most dominant head amid Spanish colonization. MenÃÂ©ndez wedded his sister so as to encourage relations between the Spanish and the Calusa. This course of action was regular in social orders in South Florida individuals. Polygamy was a strategy for understanding question or settling understandings between opponent towns. MenÃÂ©ndez, in any case, was at that point hitched and communicated inconvenience with the association. Unfit to maintain a strategic distance from the marriage, he took Carlos' sister to Havana where she was instructed, and where one record detailed that she passed on years after the fact, the marriage never culminated.
