Luongo recorded a 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1 success against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he scored his first shutout with the Canucks, halting 32 shots in a 5Ã¢ÂÂ 0 success over the Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was casted a ballot in as a beginning goaltender without precedent for his vocation for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the declaration, he was hospitalized in the wake of taking a puck to the throat by and by. He went through the night in the emergency unit fears his windpipe would swell and end up blocked. Released from the clinic on amusement day, Luongo recorded a shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. Amid the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12Ã¢ÂÂ 9 prevail upon the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his establishment record-setting 39th win in a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1 extra time triumph on March 9. He outperformed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991Ã¢ÂÂ 92. He proceeded to complete with a profession high 47 wins, one short of class pioneer Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, notwithstanding, to have been given favorable position to Parent with the introduction of the shootout that season by the NHL, enabling more recreations to be chosen with wins, instead of ties.
