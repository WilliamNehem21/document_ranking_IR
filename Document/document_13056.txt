Schmittou landed at terms in July 1984 to buy the Triple-An Evansville Triplets of the American Association for $780,000, with designs to move the establishment from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. To demonstrate to the group's Nashville banks, which would back the buy, that the move was monetarily practical, Schmittou dispatched an overview to assess the potential turnout for a Triple-A group versus a Double-A group. In spite of the fact that the examination demonstrated to group proprietors that the move was a reasonable choice, the banks were not awed. Accordingly, the group exchanged banks and proceeded with the buy and movement. The Southern League needed Schmittou to surrender his establishment to the alliance, however he had plans to migrate the group. He needed to send Nashville's current Southern League establishment to Evansville to proceed as the Triplets at Double-A. Nonetheless, a mix of the class' objection to the move and the City of Evansville being reluctant to overhaul Bosse Field brought about a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the group turned into the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the historical backdrop of the Double-A group that went before it. The Triplets' inheritance was resigned, and the Stars were built up as a completely new establishment.
