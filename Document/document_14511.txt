The social matchless quality of the Jains consistently reduced from the twelfth century; the decrease started in the tenth century after the victory of the overwhelmingly Jain Rashtrakutas by the Western Chalukya Empire, and the annihilation of the Ganga kingdom by the Cholas of Tanjore. While Veerashaivism prospered in northern Karnataka from the season of Basavanna, Sri Vaishnavism (a part of Vaishnavism) flourished in the South because of the impact of Ramanujacharya. The Hoysala ruler Vishnuvardhana and his relatives took to Vaishnavism. In spite of the fact that tolerant everything being equal, the organizers of the Vijayanagara Empire and the succeeding lords of the Sangama administration were Shaivas by confidence (fans of Shiva) while the later Tuluva tradition rulers were Sri Vaishnavas (adherents of Sri Vaishnavism). The Jain populace seems to have started its decrease from this period; in any case, accessible records incorporate a pronouncement by King Bukka RayaÃÂ I giving Jains opportunity of love, following their grumbling of oppression. In spite of the fact that the impact of Jainism and its writing was on the melt away, the beach front regions of present day Karnataka, where critical Jain landmarks and stone monuments were built, remained a fortification. As in prior hundreds of years, Jain creators expounded on tirthankars, sovereigns and different personages imperative to the Jain religion. Most celebrated among Jain artists from the beach front Karnataka district were Ratnakaravarni, Abhinava Vadi Vidyananda, Salva and Nemanna.
