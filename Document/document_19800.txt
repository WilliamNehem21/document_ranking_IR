In 1990, Waters hired manager Mark Fenwick and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, "Amused to Death", in 1992. The record is heavily influenced by the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the Gulf War, and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" by Neil Postman. Patrick Leonard, who worked on "A Momentary Lapse of Reason", co-produced the album. Jeff Beck played lead guitar on many of the album's tracks, which were recorded with a cast of musicians at ten different recording studios. It is Waters' most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering comparison to his work with Pink Floyd. Waters described the record as, a "stunning piece of work", ranking the album with "Dark Side of the Moon" and "The Wall" as one of the best of his career. The album had one hit, the song "What God Wants, Pt. 1", which reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on "Billboard"s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US. "Amused to Death" was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry. Sales of "Amused to Death" topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his In the Flesh tour. In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK Rock and Roll Halls of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd.
