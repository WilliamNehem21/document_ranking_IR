As the booked finish of the expressway neared, Mayor Tom Hamilton of Chula Vista communicated concerns in regards to the anticipated improvement of the I-805 passageway, and the choices that the City Council would need to make with respect to such arrangements. The part south of Otay Valley Road cost $15ÃÂ million (comparable to $ in ), and the bit between Telegraph Canyon Road and Sweetwater Road costÃÂ $12 million (proportional to $ in ). The segment from that point to Imperial Avenue was anticipated to cost $10.2ÃÂ million (comparable to $ in ). The devotion of the expressway occurred on July 23, 1975, despite the fact that the turnpike was not by any stretch of the imagination completed, because of the longing to hold the service amid the late spring. I-805 from Plaza Boulevard to Telegraph Canyon Road opened to traffic on July 28, leaving the expressway complete with the exception of the bit between Plaza Boulevard and SRÃÂ 94. While segments of the turnpike were almost prepared for traffic, there were reports of drivers driving on the shut down interstate, which the California Highway Patrol cautioned was illicit. On September 3, Dekema reported that the sum of the turnpike would open the following day as he made a last review of the unopened part; the absolute expense of the development was $145ÃÂ million (equal to $ in ). In any case, Dekema declared that there was no more state financing accessible to build further streets for the present moment.
