In April 1893, Mamie Baxter, a fourteen-year-old young lady in Denmark, Barnwell County, claimed that an African American obscure to her had endeavored to assault her. Around twenty dark men were confined and marched before her; she expressed that Henry Williams looked something like the man she had seen. Put on what go for a preliminary by the crowd that took him from the correctional facility, Williams delivered a few regarded white men to help his justification. A larger part of the crowd casted a ballot against murdering him, and Williams was come back to imprison. More scans were made for Baxter's assailant. A suspect for the situation, John Peterson, spoke to Tillman for insurance, dreading he would be lynched whenever taken to Denmark, and expressing he could demonstrate his honesty. Tillman sent Peterson to Denmark with a solitary gatekeeper. He was taken by the crowd, put on "preliminary", and after the horde discovered him liable, was killed. There was broad shock among the two races the nation over, both at the activities of the lynchers and at what Tillman had done. The senator stated, accordingly, that he had accepted that, as the horde had been persuaded by Williams' barrier, it would permit Peterson to demonstrate his honesty too. He from that point overlooked the issue of the Denmark lynching.
