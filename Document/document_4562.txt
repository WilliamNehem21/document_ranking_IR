"Naattiya Kuthirai", not initially part of the film, was included amid conclusive generation. Sundari Bai went through over a month practicing the melody. M. D. Parthasarathy was the sole vocalist of "Aathoram Kodikkalam" and co-artist of "Naattiya Kuthirai". J.ÃÂ Cooling Rajaiah played accordion and piano in the film's vagabond melody. The carnival ensemble was adjusted from "The Donkey Serenade" in Robert Z. Leonard's 1937 film, "The Firefly". Vasan offered the vast majority of the tunes on the Hindi soundtrack to Uma Devi, who later turned out to be prevalently known as Tun. She at first faltered, feeling that "[they] were past her capacities", yet was bolstered by Rajeswara Rao (who "buckled down on her"). "Sanjh Ki Bela", from the Hindi soundtrack, is inexactly founded on "Sanjh Ki Bela Panchhi Akela" from "Jwar Bhata" (1944). "Chandralekha" music helped make it a standout amongst the best Indian melodic movies of the 1940s, and it "made an air for various music executives affected by Western music" in Tamil film. The film was an achievement for Uma Devi, in spite of rupturing her agreement with maker Abdur Rashid Kardar (who ended her agreement in striking back). Be that as it may, this and the "diminishing fortunes" of the film business after India's autonomy from the British Raj in the long run finished her vocation in playback singing.
