Johnson's first challenge as captain was the Ashes series against England in 1954â55. In his first match as captainâthe First Test at the Gabba in Brisbaneâhe led his team to victory, defeating England by an innings and 154Â runs. It was to be the only Australian victory in the series. Injured, Johnson was unable to play in the Second Test in Sydney. With Miller also injured, Arthur Morris was asked to lead the Australian team against an English fast bowling attack including Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson, who took ten wickets in the match, was instrumental in England winning the Test by 38Â runs. Johnson and Miller returned for the Third Test in Melbourne but were unable to prevent another English victory, this time by 128Â runs. The Test was marred by controversy; Melbourne newspaper, "The Age", alleged that the pitch had been watered during the course of the match, in contravention of the laws of cricket. Following an enquiry, the Victorian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a statement denying any watering of the playing area during the match; however "Wisden" reported that "large cracks were evident on Saturday yet on Monday these had closed and for a time the surface behaved more kindly to batsmen". Certainly, Johnson felt the pitch had been changed to his disadvantage: "It was like losing the toss twice over". Johnson and Test debutant Len Maddocks shared a partnership of 54Â runs to help Australia fight back in their first innings. Tyson ended the Australian resistance, taking 7/27 in the Australian second inningsâEngland won the match by 128Â runs. England won the Fourth Test at Adelaide by five wickets and therefore retained the Ashes. With the Fifth and final Test ending in a draw, England won the series 3â1.
