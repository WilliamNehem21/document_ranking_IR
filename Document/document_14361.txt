The biogeography and early transformative history of pachycephalosaurs is inadequately comprehended, and must be cleared up by new disclosures. Pachycephalosaurs show up suddenly in the fossil record, and are available in both North America and Asia, so it is obscure when they originally begun, and from which bearing they scattered. The most seasoned known individuals from the gathering, (for example, "Acrotholus") are "completely domed" and known from the Santonian phase of the Late Cretaceous time frame (around 84 million years back). This is before the apparently increasingly crude "Stegoceras" from the Middle Campanian (77 million years prior) and "Homalocephale" from the Early Maastrichtian (70 million years back), so the doming of the skull might be a homoplastic characteristic (a type of merged development). The late event of pachycephalosaurs contrasted with the related ceratopsians shows a long apparition heredity (deduced, however missing from the fossil record) spreading over 66 million years, from the Late Jurassic to the Cretaceous. Since pachycephalosaurs were primarily little, this might be expected to taphonomic inclination; littler creatures are less inclined to be saved through fossilization. Progressively sensitive bones are likewise less inclined to be protected, which is the reason pachycephalosaurs are fundamentally known from their hearty skulls.
