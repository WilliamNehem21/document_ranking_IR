Williams increased more extensive acknowledgment later in 2005 when she showed up in Ang Lee's "Brokeback Mountain", about the sentiment between two men, Ennis and Jack (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, separately). Awed with her execution in "The Station Agent", the throwing chief Avy Kaufman prescribed Williams to Lee. He found a powerlessness in her and give her a role as Alma, the spouse of Ennis, who finds her significant other's homosexuality and treachery. Williams was candidly influenced by the story, and regardless of her constrained screen time, was attracted to playing a lady choked by the social mores of the time. Marking Williams as the champion among the cast, Ed Gonzalez of "Inclination Magazine" credited her for "fascinatingly spiking her implicit disdain for her trick of a marriage with a trace of sympathy for Ennis' mystery enduring". "Brokeback Mountain" ended up being her most generally observed film to that point, procuring $178ÃÂ million against its $14ÃÂ million spending plan. It won three Academy Awards and she picked up a Best Supporting Actress designation. Williams started dating Ledger while taking a shot at the film. The couple lived together in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, New York, and in 2005, she brought forth their little girl.
