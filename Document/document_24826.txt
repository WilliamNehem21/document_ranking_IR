The Gallagher brothers hold differing opinions about the album. As early as July 1997, Noel was "talking down" "Be Here Now" in the music press, describing the production as "bland", and remarking that some of the tracks were "fucking shit". Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good. Look at Phil Collins." In "Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop", he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother "thinks it fucking rocks." In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that "at that time we thought it was fucking great, and I still think it's great. It just wasn't "Morning Glory"." In 2006, Liam said of Noel, "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first placeÂ ... I don't know what's up with him but it's a top record, man, and I'm proud of itâit's just a little bit long." Noel Gallagher has observed that many Oasis fans still hold the album in high regard, as well as some prominent musicians such as Marilyn Manson.
