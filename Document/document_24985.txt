Water spread to the centreline boiler room, which started to flood from below, and power was lost shipwide when the boiler uptakes became choked; "Ark Royal" had no backup diesel generators. About half an hour after the explosion, the carrier appeared to stabilise. Admiral Somerville, determined to save "Ark Royal", ordered damage control parties back to the carrier before taking the battleship "Malaya" to Gibraltar to organise salvage efforts. The damage control parties re-lit a boiler, restoring power to the bilge pumps. The destroyer came alongside to provide power and additional pumps, while Swordfish aircraft from Gibraltar flew overhead to supplement anti-submarine patrols. The tug "Thames" arrived from Gibraltar at 20:00 and attached a tow line to "Ark Royal", but the flooding had caused the ship to list more severely. Rising water reached the boiler room fan flat, an uninterrupted compartment running the width of the ship. This forced the shutdown of the restored boiler.
The list reached 20Â° between 02:05 and 02:30, and when 'abandon ship' was declared again at 04:00, had reached 27Â°. "Ark Royal"s complement had been evacuated to "Legion" by 04:30; with the exception of Mitchell, there were no fatalities. The 1,487 officers and crew were transported to Gibraltar. The list reached 45Â° before "Ark Royal" capsized and sank at 06:19 on 14 November. Witnesses reported the carrier rolling to 90Â°, where she remained for three minutes before inverting. "Ark Royal" then broke in two, the aft sinking within a couple of minutes, followed by the bow.
