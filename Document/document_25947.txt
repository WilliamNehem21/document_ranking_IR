A Mughal province, which comprised the Carnatic region south of the Tungabhadra river, and which was to exist for seventy years, was established in 1687 with its capital at Sira (in Tumkur District). (See .) Known as the "Province of Sira" (also "Carnatic-Balaghat"), it was composed of seven parganas (districts): Basavapatna, Budihal, Sira, Penukonda, Dod-Ballapur, Hoskote, and Kolar; in addition, Harpanahalli, Kondarpi, Anegundi, Bednur, Chitaldroog, and Mysore were considered by the Mughals to be tributary states of the province. Qasim Khan (also, Khasim Khan or Kasim Khan) was appointed the first "Subahdar" (governor) and "Faujdar" (military governor) of the province in 1689. Having displayed "energy and success" both in controlling and in developing the province, he died in 1694, either killed by Maratha raiders from the northwest, or killing himself in disgrace after these raiders seized a treasure under his care. Most "Subhahdars" who governed after him were to be replaced in a year or two by a successor. The instability would continue until Dilavar Khan was appointed governor in 1726, his term lasting until 1756. In 1757, Sira was overrun by the Marathas, only to be restored to the Mughals in 1759. In 1761 future ruler Haidar Ali, whose own father had been the Mughal military governor (or "Faujdar") of Kolar district in the province, captured Sira, and soon conferred on himself the title of "Nawab of Sira". However, the defection of his brother five years later caused the province to be lost again to the Marathas, who retained it until Haidar's son, Tipu Sultan, recaptured it for his father in 1774.
