The three known "Ankylosaurus" skulls contrast in different subtleties; this is believed to be the consequence of taphonomy (changes occurring amid rot and fossilization of the remaining parts) and individual variety. The skull was low and triangular fit as a fiddle, and more extensive than it was long; the back of the skull was wide and low. The skull had an expansive snout on the premaxillae. The circles (eye attachments) were practically round to somewhat oval and did not confront straightforwardly sideways in light of the fact that the skull decreased towards the front. The braincase was short and powerful, as in different ankylosaurines. Peaks over the circles converged into the upper squamosal horns (their shape has been depicted as "pyramidal"), which directed in reverse toward the sides from the back of the skull. The peak and horn were likely discrete components initially, as found in the related "Pinacosaurus" and "Euoplocephalus". Underneath the upper horns, jugal horns were available, which pointed in reverse and down. The horns may have initially been osteoderms (defensive layer plates) that combined to the skull. The scale-like example on the skull surface (called "caputegulae" in ankylosaurs) was simply the aftereffect of redesigning of the skull itself. This pulverized the sutures between skull components, which is basic for grown-up ankylosaurs. The scale example of the skull was variable between examples, however a few subtleties are shared. "Ankylosaurus" had a precious stone formed (or hexagonal) internarial scale at the front of the nose between the nostrils, two squamosal osteoderms over the circle, and an edge of scales at the back of the skull.
