The different writings of the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" give distinctive renditions of the revolt. Hart expresses: "The most seasoned and increasingly definitive is safeguarded in the 'B' content of the "Old English Saxon Chronicle" (upheld in its fundamentals by the Latin East Anglian "Annal"); the official form in the 'A' content is plainly a late amendment, planned to legitimize King Edward's position and to fortify his power." 'B' portrays ÃÂthelwold as a ÃÂ¦theling, showing the authenticity of his case for the sovereignty, a depiction precluded in 'A'. 'A' says that he claimed Wimborne and Twinham without the authorization of the lord and his councilors', 'B' without wanting to. 'B' says that ÃÂthelwold "rode away by night" from Wimborne; 'A' peruses "stole away". As indicated by 'B', the Northumbrian Danes acknowledged ÃÂthelwold as their lord, and offered faithfulness to him, however this is excluded in 'A'. Nonetheless, none of the writings portray him as a ÃÂ¦theling after his trip to Northumbria, demonstrating that his activities were never again thought to have a case to authenticity. In the perspective on Scott Thompson Smith, the debate was over property just as sovereignty, and the "Narrative" presents Edward as the fruitful defender of family property against outside interests.
