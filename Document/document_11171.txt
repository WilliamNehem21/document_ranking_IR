The satire "The Careless Husband" (1704), for the most part viewed as Cibber's best play, is another case of the recovery of a straying spouse by methods for extraordinary wifely affability, this time in an increasingly local and proper register. The nice Sir Charles Easy is constantly unfaithful to his significant other, tempting the two women of value and his own female hirelings with insouciant appeal. The defining moment of the activity, known as "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his significant other discovers him and a maidservant snoozing together in a seat, "as close a guess to real infidelity as could be introduced on the eighteenth century organize". His periwig has tumbled off, an undeniable proposal of closeness and relinquish, and an opening for Lady Easy's consideration. Soliloquizing to herself about how tragic it would be on the off chance that he came down with bug, she "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it delicately on his Head" (V.i.21). (A "steinkirk" was a freely tied ribbon neckline or scarf, named after the manner in which the officers wore their cravats at the Battle of Steenkirk in 1692.) She takes away, Sir Charles wakes, sees the steinkirk on his head, wonders that his significant other did not wake him and make a scene, and acknowledges how magnificent she is. The Easys proceed to have a compromise scene which is substantially more low-keyed and classy than that in "Adoration's Last Shift", without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy contracting with female delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had introduced without flickering. Paul Parnell has broke down the manipulative idea of Lady Easy's lines in this trade, demonstrating how they are coordinated towards the sentimentalist's objective of "elated self-endorsement".
