In May 1951, ABC executive Edward J. Respectable and United Paramount Theaters president Leonard Goldenson declared a proposed merger between their organizations. The arrangement was to consolidate ABC and its five TV channels with United Paramount Theaters, an organization as of late spun off from Paramount Pictures. UPT likewise claimed the system's Chicago station, WBKB; that station would need to be sold all together for the consolidated organization to remain under the five-station top. Since the proposed merger included the closeout of a TV channel, it required the endorsement of the FCC, which opened a meeting on the issue that August. The proposed arrangement was perplexing, and would influence numerous gatherings engaged with TV broadcasting, including Paramount, DuMont, and (CBS officials needed to buy WBKB). Amid the conference, Allen DuMont requested that the FCC compel Paramount to sell a lot of the DuMont Network. He expressed that Paramount in actuality possessed two telecom companies, the PTN and DuMont; the FCC had comparably constrained NBC to auction one of its two radio systems eight years sooner because of worries about multi-organize proprietorship. Foremost administrators, be that as it may, denied consistently having worked a telecom company. Proof exhibited against Paramount included system alliance contracts and ads for the Paramount Television Network from 1951. In spite of Paramount officials' declaration, ads for the Paramount Television Network kept running as late as 1952.
