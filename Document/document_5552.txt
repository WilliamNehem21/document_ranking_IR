In November 1960, areas of expressway opened from Indian River north toward the southern Mackinac Bridge approaches in Mackinaw City and from St. Ignace to Evergreen Shores, and by December, the area of turnpike running between Evergreen Shores and MÃ¢ÂÂ123 was booked to open. The following year the first Zilwaukee Bridge, a bascule connect over the Saginaw River was opened alongside an area of expressway north to Kawkawlin. That September, the area among Gaylord and Vanderbilt was finished, and in October 1961, the principal fragment of I-75 close Grayling opened, associating M-18 with the city. Before the year's over, the road was finished among Kinross and Dafter in the UP, and the previous section of USÃÂ 27 among Grayling and Gaylord was swung back to neighborhood control. After this individual portion of interstate was finished, it left a hole among Gaylord and Indian River that was assigned "TO I-75" on maps for the previous section of USÃÂ 27, and USÃÂ 27 was truncated to about south of Grayling. The segment of I-75 was opened among Gaylord and Waters in July 1962. Another transitory "TO I-75" assignment was connected along USÃÂ 10 and USÃÂ 27 from Bay City to Grayling. In 1961, the MSHD had suggested that the segment of I-75 south of Detroit to Toledo be worked as an electronic parkway under an offer through General Motors; the testing for such a roadway was eventually done at Ohio State University.
