Lody was also the subject of literary and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, "Lody â Ein Weg um Ehre" ("Lody â One Way to Honour"), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called "Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers" ("Lody: the life and death of a German officer"), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues behind him as he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion when he calls for German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters in the pockets of suits which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: "I shall see Germany once more âÂ from the stars." The Dundee "Evening Telegraph" described the storyline as "quaint".
