Diverse speculations have been proposed to clarify the plans of Indian and Pakistani pioneers in this period. Rajmohan Gandhi proposes that a perfect arrangement working in the brain of Patel was that if Muhammad Ali Jinnah let India have Junagadh and Hyderabad, Patel would not article to Kashmir consenting to Pakistan. In his book "Patel: A Life", Gandhi attests that Jinnah looked to connect with the inquiries of Junagadh and Hyderabad in a similar fight. It is recommended that he needed India to request a plebiscite in Junagadh and Hyderabad, knowing hence that the standard at that point would need to be connected to Kashmir, where the Muslim-dominant part would, he trusted, vote in favor of Pakistan. A discourse by Patel at the Bahauddin College in Junagadh following the last's assume control over, where he said that "we would consent to Kashmir on the off chance that they consented to Hyderabad", recommends that he may have been amiable to this thought. In spite of the fact that Patel's conclusions were not India's strategy, nor were they shared by Nehru, the two heads were infuriated at Jinnah's seeking the rulers of Jodhpur, Bhopal and Indore, driving them to take a harder position on a conceivable arrangement with Pakistan.
