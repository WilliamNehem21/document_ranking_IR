Richmond had been made the capital since it was accepted to be less presented to assault than Williamsburg, however in January 1781, British powers under the maverick previous American general, Benedict Arnold, cruised up the James River and caught Richmond with little resistance as Henry joined different lawmakers and Governor Jefferson in escaping to Charlottesville. In spite of the fact that Arnold before long pulled back to Portsmouth, in February, troops under Lord Cornwallis entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had generally been battled out of state, would have a large number of its last moves played in Virginia. With Washington's military close New York, Henry looked to enroll troopers to protect the state, and in March helped draft a furious opposition from the House of Delegates to Congress, requesting help. All things considered, in May, British powers under Colonel Banastre Tarleton attacked Charlottesville, about catching the Virginia government, which fled to Staunton. There is a story that Henry fled with other noticeable pioneers, and looked for asylum at the home of a lady who at first spurned them as defeatists for escaping Charlottesville. Be that as it may, on learning Henry was with the gathering, she chose it must be OK, and offered them the best she had.
