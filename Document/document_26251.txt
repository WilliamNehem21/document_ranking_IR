Street & Smith was a well-established pulp publisher, with an excellent distribution network, and the revived "Astounding" was quickly competitive. It was edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, with assistance from Desmond Hall; both had come to Street & Smith from the wreckage of Clayton. Tremaine was an experienced pulp editor, and Street & Smith gave him a budget of one cent per word, which was better than the competing magazines could pay. In December 1933 Tremaine wrote an editorial calling for "thought variant" stories that contained original ideas and did not simply reproduce adventure themes in a science-fiction context. The early stories identified by Tremaine as "thought variants" were not always particularly original, but it soon became apparent that Tremaine was willing to take risks by publishing stories that would have fallen foul of editorial taboos at other magazines. By the end of 1934, "Astounding" was the leading sf magazine; important stories published that year include Murray Leinster's "Sidewise in Time", the first genre sf story to use the idea of alternate history; "The Legion of Space", by Jack Williamson; and "Twilight", by John W. Campbell, writing as Don A. Stuart. Within a year "Astounding"'s circulation was estimated at 50,000, about twice that of the competition.
