Toward the start of the 1920s, with vehicle numbers drained by wartime administration in France and Belgium, the Underground Group's transport activities started to encounter a flood in rivalry from an expansive number of new free transport administrators. These little administrators were unregulated and gone after the gathering's most beneficial courses removing an extensive number of its travelers and a lot of its pay. Albert Stanley (recognized as Lord Ashfield in 1920) and Pick battled back by approaching parliament to control transport activities in the capital. The London Traffic Act 1924 allowed their solicitation by setting up the London Traffic Area to manage street traveler traffic inside London and the encompassing regions. All through the 1920s, Pick drove the Underground Group's endeavors to arrange its administrations with the city cable car administrators, the Metropolitan Railway and the rural mainline rail administrations. The point was to accomplish a pooling of salary between the majority of the administrators and expel inefficient challenge. Toward the finish of 1930, an answer was declared in a bill for the arrangement of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), an open partnership which was to assume responsibility for the Underground Group, the Metropolitan Railway and most of the transport and cable car administrators inside a region assigned as the London Passenger Transport Area covering the County of London and Middlesex and parts of Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, Surrey and Sussex.
