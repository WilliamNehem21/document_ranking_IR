Richardson turned down the role of Estragon in Peter Hall's premiere of the English language version of Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" in 1955 and later reproached himself for missing the chance to be in "the greatest play of my generation". He had consulted Gielgud, who dismissed the piece as rubbish, and even after discussing the play with the author, Richardson could not understand the play or the character. Richardson's "Timon of Athens" in his 1956 return to the Old Vic was well received, as was his Broadway appearance in "The Waltz of the Toreadors" for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 1957. He concluded the 1950s with two contrasting West End successes, Robert Bolt's "Flowering Cherry", and Graham Greene's "The Complaisant Lover". The former, a sad piece about a failed and deluded insurance manager, ran for 435 performances in 1957â58; Richardson co-starred with three leading ladies in succession: Celia Johnson, Wendy Hiller and his wife. Greene's comedy was a surprise hit, running for 402 performances from June 1959. Throughout rehearsals the cast treated the love-triangle theme as one of despair, and were astonished to find themselves playing to continual laughter. During the run, Richardson worked by day on another Greene work, the film "Our Man in Havana". Alec Guinness, who played the main role, noted "the object-lesson in upstaging in the last scene between Richardson and NoÃ«l Coward", faithfully captured by the director, Carol Reed.
