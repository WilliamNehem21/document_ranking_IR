Reviewing the Western Australian Art Society's exhibition in 1906, the critic for Perth's "Western Mail" considered Fuller's works to be the finest on show, and that "the occasion provides another triumph for Miss Fuller". In 1914, it was reported that Fuller was represented in four public galleriesâthree in Australia and one in South Africaâa record for an Australian woman painter at that time. Yet although she experienced considerable success during her early life, Fuller subsequently became almost invisible. No obituaries appeared in the newspapers in 1946. She is not mentioned at all in Janine Burke's "Australian Women Artists 1840â1940", Max Germaine's "Dictionary of Women Artists in Australia", nor Caroline Ambrus's "Australian Women Artists". However her work toured with the Completing the picture: women artists and the Heidelberg era exhibition in 1992-1993 and also was discussed in detail and illustrated in Janda Gooding's "Western Australian art and artists, 1900-1950" exhibition and publication. In 2013, Ann Gray described Fuller as "an important Australian woman artist and arguably Western Australia's most significant artist from the Federation period". Works by Fuller are held by the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the City of Perth, the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia's National Portrait Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the State Library of Victoria. Internationally, her work is held by the Newport Museum and Art Gallery in South Wales.
