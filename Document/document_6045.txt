In 2007, the Australian government chose to resign the F-111s by 2010, and gain 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as a break substitution, pending the entry of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning at that point being created. The F-111 armada was viewed as in danger because of weakness, and too costly to even consider operating as every airplane required 180 hours of support for each hour of flying time. No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron stopped working the F-111 in January 2009, in anticipation of changing over to the Super Hornet. Previous F-111 aircrew, acquainted with one next to the other seating and an alternate act envelope, discovered change more testing than pilots experienced in the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet warriors, which imparted numerous qualities to the more current model. No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron re-prepared between 26ÃÂ March 2010 and 21ÃÂ October 2011, making it the primary Australian unit, and the principal squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It wound up operational with its new flying machine on 8ÃÂ December 2011. The multi-job Super Hornet permitted No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron to expand its past hostile hit job with an aerial battle work. The RAAF achieved full operational ability with the Super Hornet in December 2012.
