The board of trustees' favored framework was a 3,000ÃÂ volt, three-stage rotating flow framework proposed by Hungarian electrical building organization Ganz. The framework conveyed flow by overhead conduit wires and was less expensive than choices utilizing power rails and required less electrical sub-stations. An exploratory line had been built by Ganz in Budapest, despite the fact that the framework had not yet been embraced for the full-scale task of a railroad. Before the arrangement of Ganz could be settled, Yerkes assumed responsibility for the DR. He and his architects favored the low voltage direct current conductor rail framework they had worked with in the United States and were aiming to use on the cylinder lines when they were developed; they dismissed the Ganz framework putting the DR and the MDETC into debate with the MR which needed to continue with the Ganz framework. After some rancorous discussion between the two organizations, some of which was helped out in broad daylight through the letters pages of "The Times" paper, the debate went to mediation at the Board of Trade. The choice was made in December 1901 to utilize the four-rail framework, in spite of the fact that the judge, Alfred Lyttelton, was reproachful of the DR's one-sided choice.
