At the time of the Allied landing, the Arawe area was defended by only a small force, though reinforcements were en route. The Japanese force at Arawe comprised 120 soldiers and sailors organized in two temporary companies drawn from the 51stÂ Division. The reinforcing units were elements of the 17thÂ Division, which had been shipped from China to Rabaul during October 1943 to reinforce western New Britain ahead of the expected Allied invasion. The convoys carrying the division were attacked by U.S.Â Navy submarines and USAAF bombers and suffered 1,173 casualties. The 1st Battalion, 81stÂ Infantry Regiment was assigned to defend Cape Merkus. However, it did not depart Rabaul until December as it needed to be reorganized after suffering casualties when the ship transporting it from China was sunk. In addition, two of its rifle companies, most of its heavy machine guns and all its howitzers were retained by the 8thÂ Area Army at Rabaul, leaving the battalion with just its headquarters, two rifle companies and a machine gun platoon. This battalionâwhich came under the command of Major Masamitsu Komoriâwas a four-day march from Arawe when the Allies landed. A company of soldiers from the 54thÂ Infantry Regiment, some engineers and detachments from other units were also assigned to the Arawe area. The ground forces at Arawe came under the overall command of General Matsuda, whose headquarters were located near Cape Gloucester. The Japanese air units at Rabaul had been greatly weakened in the months prior to the landing at Arawe by prolonged Allied attacks and the transfer of the 7thÂ Air Division to western New Guinea. Nevertheless, the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN) 11thÂ Air Fleet had 100 fighters and 50 bombers based at Rabaul at the time of the landing at Arawe.
