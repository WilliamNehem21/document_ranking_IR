The mid twentieth century student of history W. H. Stevenson saw that: "Couple of things in our initial history have prompted such a great amount of talk" as ÃÂthelwulf's Decimation Charters; a hundred years after the fact the contract master Susan Kelly portrayed them as "a standout amongst the most disputable gatherings of Anglo-Saxon certificates". Both Asser and the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" say that ÃÂthelwulf gave a pulverization, in 855, quickly before leaving on journey to Rome. As indicated by the "Annal" "Ruler ÃÂthelwulf passed on by contract the tenth piece of his territory all through the entirety of his kingdom to the recognition of God and to his own interminable salvation". Nonetheless, Asser states that "ÃÂthelwulf, the regarded ruler, liberated the tenth piece of his entire kingdom from regal administration and tribute, and as an everlasting legacy he made it over on the cross of Christ to the triune God, for the recovery of his spirit and those of his forerunners." According to Keynes, Asser's rendition may simply be a "free interpretation" of the "Annal", and his suggestion that ÃÂthelwulf discharged a tenth of all land from mainstream troubles was presumably not expected. All land could be viewed as the ruler's territory, so the "Narrative" reference to "his territory" does not really allude to regal property, and since the booking of landÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ passing on it by charterÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ was constantly viewed as a devout demonstration, Asser's explanation that he made it over to God does not really imply that the sanctions were agreeable to the congregation.
