The passing decision against Kesselring released a tempest of dissent in the United Kingdom. Previous British Prime Minister Winston Churchill quickly marked it as excessively brutal and interceded for Kesselring. Field Marshal Alexander, presently Governor General of Canada, sent a message to Prime Minister Clement Attlee in which he communicated his expectation that Kesselring's sentence would be driven. "As his old rival on the front line", he expressed, "I have no bad things to say against him. Kesselring and his troopers battled against us hard yet perfect." Alexander had communicated his deference for Kesselring as a military leader as right on time as 1943. In his 1961 diaries Alexander paid tribute to Kesselring as an officer who "indicated incredible aptitude in removing himself from the edgy circumstances into which his broken knowledge had driven him". Alexander's suppositions were reverberated by Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese, who had instructed the British Eighth Army in the Italian crusade. In a May 1947 meeting, Leese said he was "pitiful" to know about what he considered "English victor's equity" being forced on Kesselring, an "incredibly chivalrous officer who had battled his fights decently and solidly". Ruler de L'Isle, who had been granted the Victoria Cross for valor at Anzio, brought the issue up in the House of Lords.
