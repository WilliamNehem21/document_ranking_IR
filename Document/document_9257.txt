Three coinage chargesÃ¢ÂÂMaine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim TercentenaryÃ¢ÂÂwere considered in a specific order by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. After Peters tended to the House for the Maine charge, Connecticut's John Q. Tilson asked if the proposed coin would supplant the current structure (the Walking Liberty half dollar) for the remainder of the year; Peters clarified that it would not, and that just 100,000 coins would bear the dedicatory plan. John Franklin Miller of Washington state solicited who might bear the costs from the coinage passes on, and Peters reacted that the territory of Maine would. Virginia's Andrew Jackson Montague inquired as to whether the Treasury Department had embraced the bill, and Peters educated him that both Houston and Baker had. Vestal asked that the bill be passed, however Ohio's Warren Gard had inquiries regarding what might happen to the coins once they entered flow; Peters expressed that they would, once issued, be treated as normal half dollars. In light of inquiries by Gard, Peters clarified that in spite of the fact that Maine would pay for the bites the dust, they would wind up national government property. Dwindles included that however there would be no statewide festival in Maine for the centennial, there would be nearby observances. Gard had no further inquiries regarding the Maine charge (he would likewise test the supporters of the Alabama and Pilgrim bills), and on Vestal's movement it go without recorded contradiction.
