The next of RouteÂ 22 traverse Washington County, the longest portion of the highway in a single county. Almost immediately after the joined roads cross the line, NYÂ 67 splits off to the west, crossing the Hoosick back into Rensselaer County, while NYÂ 22 straightens out again to go due north. After , it reaches Cambridge, where NYÂ 313 forks off to the east. In the middle of town, NYÂ 372, a local connector to Greenwich, ends.
North of Cambridge, the highway continues through a rolling landscape of fields and farms, the low transitional country between the Appalachians and the Adirondacks. Beyond NYÂ 29's eastern terminus at Greenwich Junction, RouteÂ 22 heads eastward again through of countryside until, just before reaching Granville, it comes within of the state line, the closest it has come to that boundary since Austerlitz. At the village's south end, NYÂ 22 intersects NYÂ 149 and the two routes overlap for until RouteÂ 149 begins its short journey to Vermont. Just north of Granville, the first of NYÂ 22's two suffixed routes, NYÂ 22A, begins its route running closely parallel to the state line and then into Vermont, where it becomes Vermont RouteÂ 22A (VTÂ 22A), paralleling the parent route for some distance on the other side of the state line.
