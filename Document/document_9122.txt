The evening of his dad's passing, Edward VIII summarily requested that the tickers at Sandringham be come back to Greenwich Mean Time, finishing the convention of Sandringham Time started by his granddad more than 50 years sooner. Edward had once in a while made the most of his visits to Sandringham, either in his dad's time or that of his granddad. He depicted a run of the mill supper at the house in a letter to his then escort Freda Dudley Ward, dated 26 December 1919; "it's excessively dull and exhausting for words. Christ how any individuals can ever have themselves into this vainglorious segregated and repetitive furrow I can't envision". In another letter, nights at the "huge house" Ã¢ÂÂ Edward remained at York Cottage with his dad Ã¢ÂÂ were recorded as "shamefully dull and exhausting". His aversion to the house was probably not going to have been decreased by his late dad's will, which was perused to the family in the cantina at the house. His siblings were each left ÃÂ£750,000 while Edward was gave no financial resources past the incomes from the Duchy of Cornwall. An addition likewise kept him from selling the late King's own belongings; Lascelles depicted the legacy as "the Kingship without the money".
