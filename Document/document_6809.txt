"Creative energy" was digest estimate (7.5ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 5.5ÃÂ inches or 19.1ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 14.0ÃÂ cm) for its initial 17 issues, and after that shrank somewhat to a short summary size (7.25ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 5.5ÃÂ inches or 18.4ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 14.0ÃÂ cm) for the remainder of its run, a further 46 issues. The volume number rose by one toward the beginning of each timetable year, paying little heed to the quantity of issues. Volume 1, 1950, contained just two issues; ensuing volumes contained five to twelve issues, contingent upon recurrence of distribution. The general issue number was imprinted on the spine (a surprising practice) alongside the volume number. The primary issue had a production date of October 1950, and the calendar was every other month through the September 1952 issue aside from that June 1951 was trailed by September 1951. The following four issues were dated October 1952, December 1952, January 1953 and February 1953, and after that a month to month run started with April 1953 that kept going without a break until the July 1955 issue. The following issue was October 1955, which introduced another every other month time frame that kept running with ideal normality until the last issue, October 1958. The cost stayed at 35ÃÂ cents all through.
