Various boards are in poor condition, owing differently to obscuring of the hues, gathered earth, and poor choices amid early rebuilding efforts. The altarpiece remained in the house of prayer from the season of its establishment until the Reign of Terror amid the French Revolution, when it was covered up in the storage room for quite a long time. When it was drawn out, the naked spirits Ã¢ÂÂ thought to be hostile Ã¢ÂÂ were painted over with dress and flares; it was moved to an alternate room, swung starting from the earliest stage, partitions were whitewashed. In 1836, the Commission of Antiquities recovered it and started plans to have it reestablished. After four decades it experienced major restorationÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ somewhere in the range of 1875 and 1878 Ã¢ÂÂ when a large number of these increases were expelled, yet not without huge harm to the first paintwork, for example, the loss of color to the inside decorations in the giver boards, which were initially red and gold. When all is said in done, the focal inside boards are preferred safeguarded over the inside and outside wings. De Salins' board is harmed; its hues have obscured with age; initially the specialty was a light blue (today it is light green) and the shield held by the blessed messenger was painted in blue.
