The main three finishers showed up in Prince Albert II of Monaco's Royal box to gather their trophies. In the ensuing public interview Hamilton said that conditions right off the bat in the race made driving troublesome: "When the climate is this way, when it begins to rain and we had a thought it was going to begin to dry, the vital thing is to keep it on the track yet I can't clarify how troublesome it was for us all. You were aquaplaning constantly and you were tiptoeing nearly." Hamilton likewise said that his accident at Tabac had been the consequence of a flood of water running over the track, making his vehicle oversteer and bringing about a cut to his correct back tire. By and by, he lauded his group and procedure for helping him take the triumph. Kubica said that tire issues in his center stretch implied he was unfit to overwhelm Massa, who was driving a heavier vehicle. Seeing Glock's prosperity on dry tires, Kubica requested that his group roll out a comparable improvement, bringing about his pass on Massa. Amid the post-race talk with Massa said that in spite of the fact that he was fuelled as far as possible of the race after his first pit stop, the drying track constrained him to pit again for new tires: "It was a disgrace that we committed a little error on the procedure yet it is a great idea to be on the platform."
