A hostage discharge previously happened in November 1997, when five high contrast ruffed lemurs ("Varecia variegata") conceived in the United States were come back to Madagascar for discharge in the Betampona Strict Nature Reserve in eastern Madagascar. Prevalently known as the "Carolina Five", these people had experienced their whole lives in the Natural Habitat Enclosures at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). From that point forward, two additional gatherings totaling 13 hostage conceived ruffed lemurs have been reintroduced into a similar hold, once in November 1998 and again in January 2001. These last two gatherings additionally got "training camp preparing" in the DLC forested unfenced nooks preceding discharge. Up until this point, the outcomes have demonstrated some achievement, with 10 enduring longer than one year, 3 people coordinating into wild gatherings, and 4 posterity have been destined to or sired by discharged lemurs, which were all parent-raised. Saraph, a male discharged with the main gathering, was accounted for to do well seven years post-discharge, living in a social gathering with a wild female and their posterity. Research has been progressing since the underlying discharge, as delineated in the 1998 BBC narrative "In the Wild: Operation Lemur with John Cleese". The exploration has given valuable data about their adjustment to life in nature.
