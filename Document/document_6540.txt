The loss of life could have been more terrible had it not been for the benevolence of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher, Patrick Vincent (Vince) Coleman, working at the railyard about from Pier 6, where the blast happened. He and his collaborator, William Lovett, educated of the risky payload on board the consuming "Mont-Blanc" from a mariner and started to escape. Coleman recollected that an approaching traveler train from Saint John, New Brunswick, was expected to touch base at the railyard inside minutes. He came back to his post alone and kept on conveying critical broadcast messages to stop the train. A few varieties of the message have been accounted for, among them this from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic: "Hold up the train. Ammo send burning in harbor making for Pier 6 and will detonate. Speculation this will be my last message. Farewell young men." Coleman's message was in charge of conveying every single approaching train around Halifax to an end. It was heard by different stations up and down the Intercolonial Railway, assisting railroad authorities with responding right away. Traveler Train No. 10, the medium-term train from Saint John, is accepted to have noticed the notice and prevented a sheltered separation from the impact at Rockingham, sparing the lives of around 300 railroad travelers. Coleman was slaughtered at his post as the blast tore through the city. He was regarded with a Heritage Minute during the 1990s, drafted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004, and another Halifax-Dartmouth Ferry was named for him in 2018.
