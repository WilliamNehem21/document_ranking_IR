"Aiphanes horrida" is the most widely distributed species. It ranges from Trinidad to Bolivia but is absent from Ecuador and northern Peru. Other species have narrower ranges with one centre of diversity in western Colombia and Ecuador and another minor one in northeastern Peru. The 2006 IUCN Red List includes three species which are endangered by habitat destructionâ"A.Â grandis", "A.Â leiostachys" and "AÂ verrucosa"âand three others considered vulnerable to the same threatâ"A.Â chiribogensis", "A.Â duquei" and "A.Â lindeniana". Rodrigo Bernal and Gloria Galeano expanded this list in a 2005 review of the status of Colombian palms. They listed two species as critically endangeredâ"A.Â graminifolia", a species that was first described in 2002, and "A.Â leiostachys" (which was classified as endangered in the IUCN Red List). They classified two species as endangeredâ"A.Â acaulis" and "A.Â parvifolia"âand two species as vulnerableâ"A.Â gelatinosa" and "A.Â pilaris". They also classified six species as near threatenedâ"A.Â erinacea", "A.Â hirsuta", "A.Â lindeniana" (vulnerable according to the IUCN Red List), "A.Â linearis", "A.Â macroloba" and "A.Â simplex". The threats to these species were not listed, but Jens-Christian Svenning reported that "A.Â erinacea" was threatened by logging given its limited distribution and poor ability to regenerate in disturbed forests. In addition to these, "A.Â deltoidea", which is widely distributed across the western Amazon Rainforest, is present at such low densities that it was classified as a rare species by Francis Kahn and Farana Moussa in 1994.
