In April 1951 the Labor government was hit by the renunciations of three priestsÃ¢ÂÂAneurin Bevan, the future leader Harold Wilson, and John FreemanÃ¢ÂÂover the burden of solution charges to pay for an expanded deadly implements program. Driberg was thoughtful to the renegades, however he endeavored to discover a reason for trade off that would stay away from renunciations. The previous priests fortified the little Labor assemble known as "Keep Left", in which Driberg was noticeable; the gathering would from this time forward be known as "Bevanites". In the October 1951 General Election the Labor Party was crushed, and Churchill continued office; Driberg clutched his Maldon situate by 704 votes. During that time of Labor government he had neither gotten nor looked for office, having what history specialist Kenneth O. Morgan called a "backbench attitude". Despite everything he delighted in parts of his parliamentary life, for example, in 1953 when he demonstrated the American singing sensation Johnnie Ray round the House of Commons; his endeavors to entice the artist were pleasantly stood up to. Notwithstanding, he expected to win more cash, and in the spring of 1952 reacted to a proposal that he ought to compose a history of Beaverbrook. The press ruler was managable, and work started in the mid year of 1953. The undertaking stretched out more than quite a while, by which time Driberg was no longer in parliament; he had reported in March 1954 that he was remaining down from Maldon, which at the General Election of May 1955 fell, as he had expected, to the Conservatives.
