Workmanship students of history are uncertain with respect to whether the boards were intended to be a diptych or a triptych. They may have shaped the external wings of a triptych, with a since-lost board speaking to the Adoration of the Magi at the inside, or, as the German workmanship antiquarian J.D. Passavant theorized in 1841, the lost focus board may have been a Nativity. It is presently thought far-fetched that a lost board could be the hypothesized unique friend to the external wings; such a coupling would have been odd to painters of the 1430s. It has additionally been recommended that a focal piece was included later, or as Albert ChÃÂ¢telet composes, the focal board may have been stolen. Craftsmanship history specialist Erwin Panofsky trusted the "Execution" and "Last Judgment" boards were expected as a diptych. He contended that it would have been strange for insignificant external wings to have been given the "lavish treatment" managed these two boards. This methodology is reminiscent of the medieval reliquaries. Others have seen that triptychs were normally a lot bigger works expected for open showcase, and they tended towards overlaid and vigorously engraved edges; regularly just the focal board would have been as luxuriously enhanced as these boards. Contemporary diptychs, interestingly, were generally created for private commitment and were regularly ungilded. There is no narrative proof for a unique focal board, be that as it may, and specialized examination proposes the two works were planned as wings of a diptych, at that point a rising configuration. PÃÂ¤cht accepts there isn't sufficient proof to decide if a third board existed.
