She supported individuals from her OMS course to come and meet with her, and created fellowships with various them, obscuring the qualification among educator and student. Gatherings of OMS individuals were casual, and seldom for custom, with most of the association's rituals requiring single work. As indicated by later individuals from her Order, Montalban's premise was in Hermeticism, despite the fact that she was vigorously affected by Medieval and Early Modern grimoires like the "Picatrix", "Corpus Hermeticum", "The Heptameron" of Pietro d'Abano, "The Key of Solomon", "The Book of Abramelin", and Cornelius Agrippa's "Three Books of Occult Philosophy". In contrast to the originators of a few more seasoned stately enchantment associations, for example, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn or the Fraternity of the Inner Light, she didn't guarantee any specialist from higher otherworldly creatures, for example, the Ascended experts or Secret Chiefs. She trusted that the Luciferian religion had its source among the Chaldean individuals of old Babylon in the Middle East, and trusted that in a previous life, the OMS's individuals had been "starts of the Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian ministry" from where they had initially known one another. She viewed herself as the resurrection of King Richard III, and was an individual from the Richard III Society; on one event, she visited the site of Richard's passing at the Battle of Bosworth with individual OMS individuals, wearing a suit of reinforcement. In March 1964, Montalban parted from her association with Heron, and moved back to London.
