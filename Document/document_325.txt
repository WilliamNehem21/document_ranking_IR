One of Greenway's best works, St James' is recorded on the (presently outdated) Register of the National Estate. It has been called an "engineering pearl" and was included by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC TV arrangement "Around the globe in 80 Treasures." From 1966 to 1993 the tower of St James' showed up on the Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway structures. In 1973, the congregation showed up on a 50 penny postage stamp, one of four of every an arrangement outlining Australian engineering issued to recognize the opening of the Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court building, likewise structured by Greenway with rotations by others, situated by the congregation is of a similar date. Over the square is Greenway's "showstopper", the UNESCO World Heritage recorded Hyde Park Barracks, intended to line up with the congregation. Close to the military enclosure stands Sydney's most established open structure, some portion of the General Hospital worked in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Isolated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the focal area is a further piece of the early medical clinic, and is currently home to the New South Wales State Parliament.
