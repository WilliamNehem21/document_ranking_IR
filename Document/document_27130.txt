We can also estimate the amount of land needed to produce this amount of grain, thanks to Wolfram Eberhard who "estimates the average yield as being 1.0 to 1.5 "shih" per mu," though Hsu notes that, "Very high yields could reach as much as 6.4 "hu" per "mu"." Swann gives 1 shi ç³ (which she translates as "picul" with a weight of "64 lbs. 8.8 oz.") as between 1 and 2 "hu", depending on the type of grain. Based only on Eberhardâs yields and Swannâs range of conversion between "shi" and "hu", a farmer would need between about 85 and 254 "mu" (between about 9.7 and 29 acres) in order to produce the 127 "hu" of grain Eberhard deems necessary to the subsistence of a family of five. Other scholars give other numbers, however. Hsu claims that 50 "mu" (about 5.7 acres) was in fact "the acreage needed for subsistence living," while Wang Zhongshu calculates that "there was on the average 24.6 mou per family, or less than 6 mou per person (with each mou equivalent to 456 square m)." Both Li Kui and Chao Cuo claimed that 100 "mu" was the amount of land required to support a family, though it should be noted that the amount of land denoted by the word "mu" had changed between Li Kui's time and Chao Cuo's.
