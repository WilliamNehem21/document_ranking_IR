Two gatherings of scientists (first Kuczaj, Winship, and Eskelinen, and afterward Eskelinen, Winship, and Jones) adjusted the agreeable pulling worldview for hostage bottlenose dolphins ("Tursiops truncatus"). As contraption they utilized a holder which must be opened toward one side if two dolphins each pulled a rope on either end. That is, the dolphins would need to confront one another and pull in inverse ways. They previously appended the holder to a stationary dock so a solitary dolphin could figure out how to open it and get the sustenance compensate. At that point they ran preliminaries in which the compartment was free drifting in an extensive test region with six dolphins. In Kuczaj, Winship, and Eskelinen's investigation, just two dolphins associated with the compartment. In eight of the twelve preliminaries they pulled all the while and acquired sustenance. Once, they additionally figured out how to open the holder through nonconcurrent pulling, and once a solitary male dolphin figured out how to open it without anyone else's input. Kuczaj, Winship, and Eskelinen conceded that this conduct may have all the earmarks of being collaboration however could be rivalry. They yielded it is conceivable that the dolphins did not comprehend the job of the other dolphin, however rather basically endured it pulling on the opposite side. Ruler, Allen, Connor, and Jaakkola later contended that this plan makes for an aggressive 'pull of-war', not collaboration, and any ends with respect to participation ought to subsequently be invalid.
