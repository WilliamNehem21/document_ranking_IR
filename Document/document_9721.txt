Dark colored's paper was endorsed for imprinting in May 1809, yet did not show up in print until March the next year. Meanwhile, Joseph Knight distributed "On the development of the plants having a place with the regular request of Proteeae", which seemed to draw vigorously on Brown's unpublished material, without consent, and by and large without attribution. It contained the main distribution of Brown's "Josephia", for which two species were recorded. The first, "Josephia sessilis", depended on one of Menzies' examples: "This species, found by Mr. A. Menzies on the West bank of New Holland, isn't not normal for certain assortments of "Ilex Aquifolium", and now in his Majesty's accumulation at Kew." The historical underpinnings of the particular designation was not expressly expressed, however it is all around acknowledged that it originates from the Latin "sessilis" (sessile, stalkless), in reference to the sessile leaves of this species. Fault for the supposed counterfeiting generally fell on Richard Salisbury, who had been available at Brown's readings and is thought to have given a significant part of the material to Knight's book. Salisbury was shunned by the natural network, which embraced to disregard his work however much as could be expected. When Brown's monograph showed up in print, Brown had traded the conventional name "Josephia" for "Dryandra", giving the name "Dryandra floribunda" to Knight's "Josephia sessilis". As there were then no firm standards relating to need of distribution, Brown's name was acknowledged, and remained the present name for over a century.
