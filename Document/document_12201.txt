The British Cleveland Bay Horse Society was shaped in 1883, and the main stud book was distributed in 1884. The nineteenth century saw the fare of numerous Cleveland Bays abroad, to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, India, Russia and the European mainland. In the mid nineteenth century, Cleveland Bays were first imported to Maryland, Virginia and Massachusetts in the United States, and in 1884 the Upperville Colt and Horse Show was made in Virginia by Colonel Richard Henry Dulany to grandstand his imported Cleveland Bay stallion and the posterity of the stallion. The Cleveland Bay Society of America was framed in 1885, and the stud book started distribution in 1889, despite the fact that ponies were enlisted who had lived as far back as 1860. Based on the depictions of the most punctual enrolled steeds, it is conceivable that huge numbers of the "Cleveland Bays" enlisted were really Yorkshire Coach Horses; in any case, all were enrolled as Clevelands, and that is the thing that they are known as today. Over 2,000ÃÂ horses were enlisted with the relationship by 1907. The steeds were important to Buffalo Bill Cody, who drove four Cleveland Bay stallions in his Wild West Show.
