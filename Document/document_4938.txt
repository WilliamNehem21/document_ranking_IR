Io's biggest tufts, Pele-type crest, are made when sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas exsolve from emitting magma at volcanic vents or magma lakes, conveying silicate pyroclastic material with them. The few Pele-type crest that have been watched are normally connected with blast ruled emissions, and are fleeting. The special case to this is Pele, which is related with an enduring dynamic magma lake ejection, however the crest is believed to be irregular. The higher vent temperatures and weights related with these tufts create emission paces of up to , enabling them to achieve statures of between . Pele-type crest structure red (from short-chain sulfur) and dark (from silicate pyroclastics) surface stores, including huge - wide red rings, as observed at Pele. The ejected sulfurous segments of Pele-type crest are believed to be the aftereffect of an abundance measure of sulfur in Io's outside layer and a diminishing in sulfur dissolvability at more noteworthy profundities in Io's lithosphere. They are for the most part fainter than Prometheus-type crest because of the low residue content, making some be called stealth crest. These tufts are now and then just found in pictures gained while Io is in the shadow of Jupiter or those taken in bright. The little residue that is obvious in sunlit pictures is produced when sulfur and sulfur dioxide consolidate as the gases achieve the highest point of their ballistic directions. That is the reason these crest come up short on the thick focal section found in Prometheus-type tufts, in which dust is produced at the crest source. Instances of Pele-type tufts have been seen at Pele, Tvashtar, and Grian.
