Numerous lemurs that eat leaves will in general do as such amid times of organic product shortage, here and there enduring weight reduction accordingly. Most lemur species, including the greater part of the littlest lemurs and barring a portion of the indriids, prevalently eat organic product (frugivory) when accessible. By and large, lemurs have been archived expending natural product from in any event 86ÃÂ native plant families and 15ÃÂ alien plant families. Likewise with most tropical organic product eaters, the lemur diet is commanded by natural product from "Ficus" (fig) species. In numerous humanoid primates, organic product is an essential wellspring of nutrient C, yet not at all like humanoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can integrate their very own nutrient C. Generally, hostage lemur eats less high in nutrient C-rich organic products have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a kind of iron over-burden issue, since nutrient C expands iron ingestion. In spite of the fact that lemurs in bondage have been appeared to be inclined to hemosiderosis, the recurrence of the malady differs crosswise over foundations and may rely upon the eating regimen, farming conventions, and hereditary stock. Presumptions about the issue should be tried independently for every specie. The ring-followed lemur, for example, is by all accounts less inclined to the turmoil than other lemur species.
