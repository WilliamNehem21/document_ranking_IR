The Hamilton-Brantford and Mississauga sections of HighwayÂ 403 were initially planned to be linked up along the corridor now occupied by HighwayÂ 407. However, the Bob Rae government altered these plans in 1995 due to budgetary constraints.
It was also announced the Mississauga section of HighwayÂ 403 would be renumbered as HighwayÂ 410.
Ultimately, this never came to pass.
Consequently, HighwayÂ 403 was signed concurrently along the Queen Elizabeth Way in 2002, remedying the discontinuity.
In early 2001, high-mast lighting was scheduled to be added to the unlighted Mississauga section between HighwayÂ 407 and Eastgate Parkway.
In 2003, the right shoulders between Erin Mills Parkway and Mavis Road were widened for GO Transit and Mississauga Transit to run express bus services.
These projects preceded the widening of HighwayÂ 403 between HighwayÂ 407 and HighwayÂ 401/410, through which a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane was added in each direction; the project started in summer of 2004 and these opened on DecemberÂ 13, 2005.
The HOV lanes and the dividing Ontario Tall Wall concrete barrier were constructed using the existing right-of-way provided by the grass median.
HighwayÂ 403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on AprilÂ 27, 2016.
