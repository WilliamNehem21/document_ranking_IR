Starting with the "Outside Broadcast" leg, cuts from the visit's "video confession booth stall" were shown on the set's screens between the principle set and the reprise. Concertgoers were urged to visit the stall before the show and state anything they desired. These "admissions" shifted from a lady blazing her bosoms to a man uncovering he had executed his companion in an auto collision. When the reprise started, Bono would return as an alternate change self imageÃ¢ÂÂMirror Ball Man in 1992, and MacPhisto in 1993. Exhibitions of "Want" were joined by pictures of Richard Nixon, Margaret Thatcher, Paul Gascoigne, and Jimmy Swaggart, and were implied as an analysis of ravenousness; money rained the stage and Bono depicted Mirror Ball Man as an elucidation of the avaricious evangelist portrayed in the tune's verses. Bono frequently made a wrench call from the phase as his persona of the time. Such calls included dialing a telephone sex line, flagging down a taxi, requesting 10,000 pizzas (the Detroit pizza parlor conveyed 100 pizzas amid the show), or calling a neighborhood legislator. Bono consistently called the White House trying to contact President Bush. In spite of the fact that Bono never achieved the President, Bush acknowledged the calls amid a question and answer session.
