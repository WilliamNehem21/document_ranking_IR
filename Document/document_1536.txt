The principal Soviet nuclear bomb test in August 1949 was humiliating to the British (who had not anticipated a Soviet nuclear weapon until 1954) for having been beaten, yet it was for the Americans another purpose behind collaboration. The concurrence on crude materials was expected to terminate toward the year's end. The Americans offered to make bombs in the United States accessible for Britain to utilize if the British consented to end their nuclear bomb program. This offer was dismissed in light of the fact that it was not "good with our status as a top of the line capacity to rely upon others for weapons of this incomparable significance." Instead, the British proposed that there would be a full trade of nuclear data, and as an end-result of closure the creation of nuclear bombs in Britain, American bombs would be put away in Britain under British control. This would have given Britain atomic weapons much sooner than its very own deadline generally 1952. The resistance of a few key authorities, including the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Lewis Strauss, and Senators Bourke B. Hickenlooper and Arthur Vandenberg, combined with security concerns stirred by the 2 February 1950 capture of Fuchs, who was working at Harwell, as a Soviet covert agent, made the proposition be rejected.
