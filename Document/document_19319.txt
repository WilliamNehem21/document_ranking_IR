In 2004, Witherspoon starred in "Vanity Fair", adapted from the 19th-century classic novel "Vanity Fair" and directed by Mira Nair. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming she was pregnant with her second child. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosomâit gave me much more to play with", she said. The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote, "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness." At the same time, "The Charlotte Observer" called her work "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" and the "Los Angeles Times" concluded that Becky is "a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play". However, "LA Weekly" wrote "[Witherspoon] ends up conveying so little of what's at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair" and states that it may have to do with Witherspoon's vanity, "with an Oscar-less young star's need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the "real" Becky Sharp.". Others have stated she was miscast.
