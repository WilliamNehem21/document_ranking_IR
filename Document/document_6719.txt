The evening of 8/9 February 1904, the Imperial Japanese Navy propelled an unexpected assault on the Russian armada at Port Arthur. "Petropavlovsk" was not hit and sortied the next morning when the Japanese Combined Fleet, instructed by Vice Admiral TÃÂgÃÂ HeihachirÃÂ, assaulted. TÃÂgÃÂ had expected the night assault by his boats to be significantly more fruitful than it was, and foreseen that the Russians would be gravely confused and debilitated, however they had recouped from their amazement and were prepared for his assault. The Japanese boats were spotted by the ensured cruiser , which was watching seaward and alarmed the Russian resistances. TÃÂgÃÂ assaulted the Russian beach front protections with his primary combat hardware and connect with the boats with his optional firearms. Part his shoot turned out to be a poor choice as the Japanese 8-and 6-inch weapons delivered little harm on the Russian boats, which focused all their discharge on the Japanese boats with some impact. "Petropavlovsk" was daintily harmed in the commitment by one 6-inch and two 12-inch shells, murdering two and injuring five. Consequently she shot twenty 12-inch and sixty-eight 6-inch shells at the Japanese war vessels, yet none hit. Disappointed by the poor execution of the First Pacific Squadron, the Naval Ministry supplanted Stark with the dynamic and forceful Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov, viewed as the naval force's most skillful naval commander, on 7 March. Because of the harm brought about in the assault by the more intensely defensively covered and the ensuing protracted fix time, Makarov was constrained to hold "Petropavlovsk" as his lead against his better judgment.
