He searched abroad for extra ponies, especially from the Crabbet Arabian Stud, and imported Arabian steeds from England, France and Egypt. At its pinnacle, Maynesboro was the biggest Arabian steed rearing task in the United States. In 1929, he expressed "The Horse of the Desert," still thought about a definitive work on the Arabian breed. He filled in as President of the Arabian Horse Club of America from 1918 until 1939. Dark colored was a remount operator and had an uncommon enthusiasm for advancing the utilization of Arabian steeds by the U.S. Armed force Remount Service. To demonstrate the capacities of Arabians, he sorted out and took an interest in various continuance races of up to , which his steeds won multiple times, resigning the U.S. Mounted Service Cup. This achievement happened despite the fact that The Jockey Club gave $50,000 to the U.S. Armed force to purchase Thoroughbreds that attempted yet neglected to beat the Arabians.
