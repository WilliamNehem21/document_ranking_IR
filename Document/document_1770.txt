Licciardello expressed that they didn't realize they had entered the red zone, and "we had the counsel of our legal counselors ring in our ears; 'Don't go into the red zone. You can go into the green zone on the off chance that they let you, however DO NOT go into the red zone.'ÃÂ " He said that they "were certain beyond a shadow of a doubt we could never move beyond the principal checkpoint. It was alarm stations when we understood", including that it was a "dumb muffle that exploded backward". Morrow said that the motivation behind the trick was "an endeavor to mock sillily the exceptionally overwhelming security and the turn encompassing that security, it was a trial of the familiar proverb that in the event that you need to get in some place the most ideal way is directly through the front entryway. I didn't need the trick to occur in a way that brought about individuals getting captured. In the event that we've committed an error and crossed into the green zone, I'm remorseful about that." He said the main reason they mimicked container Laden was on the grounds that they required a joke to escape the trick that they constantly expected could never have passed security.
