Makers picked young men who were understudies of Tariq receptacle Ziad High School. The school was clutching the thought of a unified Iraq, even as the nation was ending up progressively racially and religiously isolated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter realized that the Baghdad locale Karrada was blended and incorporated with high quantities of Shiites and Christians. She asked her previous driver and interpreter, who had gone to the school, in the event that he would contact the main. At first the school was suspicious of their goals, yet chose to confide in the judgment of Winter's interpreter. Central Ra'ad Jawad chose eight young men to participate in the narrative since he realized they could be cautious about making the narrative, would not get exhausted, and would stay focused on recording their lives for a year. The makers needed their cast to incorporate young ladies, and had discovered a school and families willing to partake in the narrative, however the then-Minister of Education would not give them a chance to participate. Jawad went to London to meet the makers and he was prepared to work the camcorders that the young men were to utilize. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq through the BBC News division, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi partner makers prepared the young men how to utilize the cameras. Two months into taping, four of the young men dropped out of the task, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the young men while the narrative was being delivered in light of the fact that it was such a high-chance task.
