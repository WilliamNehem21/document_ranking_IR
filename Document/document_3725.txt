At the point when France proclaimed war on Austria-Hungary on 12 August, BouÃÂ© de LapeyrÃÂ¨re settled on a fight into the Adriatic planned to constrain the Austro-Hungarian armada to give fight. In the wake of rendezvousing with a little British power on the fifteenth, he requested his powers to part with the ships set out toward Otranto, Italy, while the shielded cruisers watched off the Albanian coast. Before the two gatherings got much of anywhere separated, a few Austro-Hungarian boats were spotted on 16 August and the Allied armada was fruitful in cutting off and sinking the ensured cruiser "Zenta" off Antivari, despite the fact that the torpedo vessel figured out how to get away. The next day, BouÃÂ© de LapeyrÃÂ¨re exchanged his banner to "Jean Bart". On 1 September the first Naval Army quickly assaulted Austro-Hungarian seaside strongholds guarding the Bay of Cattaro to release the unfired shells staying in the weapons in the wake of sinking "Zenta". Beside a few uneventful forays into the Adriatic, the French capital boats invested the greater part of their energy cruising between the Greek and Italian coasts to keep the Austro-Hungarian armada from endeavoring to break out of the Adriatic. The torpedoing of "Jean Bart" on 21 December by the Austro-Hungarian submarine demonstrated that the war vessels were excessively powerless against this risk and they were pulled back to spend the remainder of the month further south at a mooring in Navarino Bay.
