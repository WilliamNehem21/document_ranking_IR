The kingdom was at times undermined by migrants; a letter sent to Yasmah-Adad advises him that 2000 Suteans led an assault against Qatna. Relations with Yamhad declined amid IÃÂ¡Ã¡Â¸Â«i-Addu's rule and the contention advanced into fringe fighting; Qatna involved the city of Parga in the district of Hamath for some time before Sumu-Epuh retook it. In the south, IÃÂ¡Ã¡Â¸Â«i-Addu confronted a general defiance; the coalition with Assyria was solidified by the marriage of IÃÂ¡Ã¡Â¸Â«i-Addu's little girl to Yasmah-Adad in . The next year, after petitions by Qatna, Shamshi-Adad sent a military to help IÃÂ¡Ã¡Â¸Â«i-Addu manage the defiance. The Assyrian troops abstained from drawing in Yamhad and did not take an interest in its war with Qatna, while IÃÂ¡Ã¡Â¸Â«i-Addu moved to QadeÃÂ¡ to direct the concealment of the insubordination, which evidently was bolstered by Yamhad. Following four years in the administration of Qatna, Shamshi-Adad requested his troops to restore; this may have been associated with a harmony arrangement among Assyria and Yarim-Lim I, child of Sumu-Epuh. IÃÂ¡Ã¡Â¸Â«i-Addu, who in the past had proclaimed that "regardless of whether Shamshi-Adad would finish up harmony with Sumu-epuh, I will never make harmony with Sumu-epuh, as long as I live!", was conveyed an overwhelming blow, however Mari's sources are quiet on how the lord managed the circumstance, and when they continued referencing Qatna in , IÃÂ¡Ã¡Â¸Â«i-Addu was dead and prevailing by his child Amut-piÃÂ¾el II.
