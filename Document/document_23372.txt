The nectar of "B.Â sessilis" is an important component of the diet of a number of species of honeyeater. In one study, "B.Â sessilis" was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied, namely the tawny-crowned honeyeater ("Gliciphila melanops"), white-cheeked honeyeater ("Phylidonyris niger"), western spinebill ("Acanthorhynchus superciliosus"), brown honeyeater ("Lichmera indistincta"), brown-headed honeyeater ("Melithreptus brevirostris"), and black honeyeater ("Certhionyx niger"). Moreover, "B.Â sessilis" played an important role in their distributions, with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where "B.Â sessilis" occurs, and remaining for longest at sites where "B.Â sessilis" is most abundant. Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on "B.Â sessilis" include the red wattlebird ("Anthochaera carunculata"), western wattlebird ("A.Â lunulata"), and New Holland honeyeater ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"). Furthermore, a study of bird species diversity in wandoo woodland around Bakers Hill found that honeyeater species and numbers were much reduced in forest that lacked a "Banksia sessilis" understory; the plant is a key source of nectar and insects during the winter months. A field study in jarrah forest 9Â km south of Jarrahdale, where "B. sessilis" grows in scattered clumps, found that western wattlebirds and New Holland honeyeaters sought out groups of plants with the greatest numbers of new inflorescences, particularly those one or two days after anthesis, where nectar yield was highest. The birds likely recognises these by visual clues.
