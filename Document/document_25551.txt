Winslet said that her workload of 2011 helped her get over heartbreak from her divorce, and after finishing work on "Carnage" she took a break from acting to focus on her children. A short part that she had filmed four years earlier for the anthology film "Movie 43" was her sole screen appearance of 2012, and it received the worst reviews of her career. Winslet also performed an audiobook recording of Ãmile Zola's novel "ThÃ©rÃ¨se Raquin". She was reluctant to accept Jason Reitman's offer to star in his 2013 film adaptation of Joyce Maynard's novel "Labor Day", but agreed after Reitman postponed the production for a year to accommodate Winslet's commitment to her children. Set over a Labor Day weekend, it tells the story of Adele (Winslet), an agoraphobic single mother, who falls in love with an escaped convict. Describing Adele's character as having "more vulnerability than strength", Winslet found her to be a departure from the strong-willed women she typically played. A scene in the film required her to make a pie, for which she drew on her baking experience from "Mildred Pierce". Critical reception for the film was negative, but it earned Winslet her tenth Golden Globe nomination. Chris Nashawaty of "Entertainment Weekly" criticised it as "mawkish and melodramatic" but commended Winslet for adding layers to her passive role.
