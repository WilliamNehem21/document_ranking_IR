Frusciante's drug addiction worsened as the years progressed. An article published by the "New Times LA" described him as "a skeleton covered in thin skin". He participated in an interview with Dutch public broadcast station VPROâthe first media appearance he made since leaving the Chili Peppers. In the interview Frusciante speaks of the positive effects drugs have had on his mind and proudly admits to being a "junkie". He went on to confess addictions to heroin and crack cocaine, but ultimately described himself as being in the best health of his life. In 1997, Frusciante released his second solo album "Smile From the Streets You Hold", primarily for drug money. "Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt" was estimated to have sold only 45,000 copies when Frusciante ordered it out of print in 1998âwhen Frusciante rehabilitated and rejoined the Chili Peppers. "Smile From the Streets You Hold" was withdrawn from the market a year later. In 1999 "Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt" was re-released on American Recordings. In the early 2000s, Frusciante said he planned to re-release "Smile From the Streets You Hold" sometime in the future, but did not give any indication as to when. It was eventually re-released on American Records in Europe of 2006.
