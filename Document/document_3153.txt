The next year, at 20ÃÂ years of age, Richard was elevated to the Cocoa Astros of the Florida State League in high-A small time baseball. Richard again arranged a low hits for each nine innings (H/9IP) proportion by surrendering just 67ÃÂ hits in 109 all out innings pitched. Regardless of his 4Ã¢ÂÂ 11 winÃ¢ÂÂ misfortune record, Richard completed the season with a 2.39ÃÂ ERA and even tossed a no-hitter against the Daytona Beach Dodgers. Amid the season, Richard had the capacity to toss a precise fastball which once in a while surpassed 100ÃÂ miles every hour, and his slider 93ÃÂ miles every hour, quicker than those of most significant class pitchers. Amid the 1970Ã¢ÂÂ 71 off-season, the Astros again advanced Richard: this opportunity to Class-AAA baseball, one stage underneath the real groups, with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the now-ancient American Association. Richard wore numberÃÂ 50 and kept that number for the remainder of his small time and real group vocation. Richard began everything except one of the recreations he pitched that season. He pitched eight complete diversions and drove the alliance with 202ÃÂ strikeouts in 173ÃÂ innings of work. He finished the season with sevenÃÂ losses before being called up by the Houston Astros.
