The first non-album outtake from the "Highway 61 Revisited" sessions to be released was the single "Positively 4th Street", although on an early pressing of the single Columbia used another "Highway 61" outtake, "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?", by mistake. "Crawl Out Your Window" was subsequently re-recorded with the Hawks in October, and released as a single in November 1965. Columbia accidentally released an alternate take of "From a Buick 6" on an early pressing of "Highway 61 Revisited", and this version continued to appear on the Japanese release for several years. Other outtakes officially released between 1991 and 2005 include alternate takes of "Like a Rolling Stone" and "It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry", and a previously unreleased song, "Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence", on "The Bootleg Series Volumes 1â3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961â1991", as well as alternate takes of "Desolation Row", "Highway 61 Revisited", "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", "Tombstone Blues", and "It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry" on "The Bootleg Series Volume 7". Excerpts from several different takes of "Like a Rolling Stone" appeared on the "Highway 61 Interactive" CD-ROM, released in February 1995.
