The two places of the governing body casted a ballot to shape boards of trustees to explore asserted pay off in the outcome, however most Republicans kept away from casting a ballot on the goals. The House board of trustees examination finished uncertainly. The Ohio Senate board declined to enable Hanna's lawyer to partake in the procedures. Depending on lawful exhortation, Hanna wouldn't affirm and asked supporters not to coordinate. The state Senate council announced that an endeavor to influence Otis had been made by an obscure operator of Hanna; three Hanna associates, including Charles Dick, were ensnared. The report was sent to the US Senate in May 1898, which alluded it to the Committee on Privileges and Elections. The Republican greater part of the council detailed in February 1899 that while it acknowledged that an endeavor had been made to reward Otis, the issue had been known before the vote, Otis had voted in favor of McKisson at any rate, and that there was no proof connecting Hanna to the endeavor. The report did gently scold Hanna and his partners for not collaborating with the Ohio Senate board of trustees. Democrats on the Privileges and Elections Committee asked further examination, yet the US Senate requested the board of trustees' report to be printed, and made no further move. Hanna remained a power in the Senate until his demise in 1904.
