The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on JulyÂ 13, which quickly intensified due to its small size. By JulyÂ 15, Fengshen attained typhoon status, and after initially moving to the north, it began a movement toward the northwest. On JulyÂ 18, the typhoon reached peak 10-minute winds of 185Â km/h (115Â mph), according to the JMA, making it the strongest storm of the season. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 270Â km/h (165Â mph), and the agency estimated that Fengshen was a super typhoon for five days. This broke the record for longest duration at that intensity, previously set by Typhoon Joan in 1997, and later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006.
