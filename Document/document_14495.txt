Since the 1970s Wintjiya had made ancient rarities, for example, "ininti" seed pieces of jewelry, mats and crates, utilizing conventional imaginative methods including weaving of spinifex grass. At the point when the ladies of Kintore, including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, began making solicits, their works looked to some extent like those of their male companions (who had been painting for certain years). Wintjiya's first endeavors were community oriented, as one of a gathering of ladies who made paintings on the Kintore Women's Center dividers in 1992. She at that point joined a composition camp with other ladies from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to create "a progression of extremely extensive cooperative canvases of the gathering's shared Dreamings" (dreamings are stories used to pass "essential information, social qualities and conviction frameworks" from age to age). Twenty-five ladies were engaged with arranging the works, which included three canvases that were square, just as two that were ; Tjunkiya and Wintjiya played out a stylized move as a component of the arrangements. Wintjiya and her sister were resolved to take an interest in the task regardless of waterfalls meddling with their vision. Similar to the case for Makinti Napanangka, an activity to evacuate waterfalls brought about another brilliance to Wintjiya's organizations. Sources contrast on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their waterfalls evacuated: Johnson proposes 1999, yet workmanship focus organizer Marina Strocchi, who worked intimately with the ladies, expresses that it was 1994. In the mid 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore, however in 2008 they were working from their home: "the widows' camp outside her 'child' Turkey Tolson's previous living arrangement".
