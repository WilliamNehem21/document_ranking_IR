The PanzerÂ I was upgraded in order to increase its lethality. On 8Â August 1937, Major General GarcÃ­a Pallasar received a note from GeneralÃ­simo Francisco Franco that expressed the need for a PanzerÂ I (or "negrillo", as their Spanish crews called them) with a 20-millimeter gun. Ultimately, the piece chosen was the Breda Model 1935, due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German Flak 30. Furthermore, the 20Â mm Breda was capable of perforating 40Â millimeters of armour at 250Â meters (1.57Â in at 275Â yd), which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armour of the T-26. Although originally 40 Italian CV.35 light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament, this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the PanzerÂ I would yield better results. Prototypes were ready by SeptemberÂ 1937 and an order was placed after successful results. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement. Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of Seville, but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership's request for more lethal tanks. The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank's commander to aim, was found to be a dangerous weak point.
