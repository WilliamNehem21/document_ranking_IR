Turpin is best referred to for his endeavors as an outlaw, however before his execution the main contemporary report of him accordingly was in June 1737, when a broadsheet entitled "news: extraordinary and magnificent news from London in a state of chaos or a clamor after the Great Turpin, with his getaway into Ireland" was distributed. Albeit a portion of his peers turned into the subject of chapbooks, names, for example, James Hind, Claude Duval and William Nevison, are not so notable today as the legend of Dick Turpin, whose fictionalized adventures initially started to show up around the turn of the nineteenth century. It was, be that as it may, the account of a mythical ride from London to York that gave the stimulus to nineteenth century creator William Harrison Ainsworth to incorporate and decorate the adventure in his 1834 novel "Rookwood". Ainsworth utilized Turpin as a plot gadget, portraying him in a way that makes him more enthusiastic than the book's different characters. Turpin is presented with the pen name, and is later compelled to escape on his steed, Black Bess. Albeit quick enough to keep in front of those in interest, Black Bess in the long run bites the dust under the worry of the voyage. This scene offered more to perusers than the remainder of the work, and as Turpin was delineated as an agreeable character who influenced the life of a criminal to appear to be engaging, the story came to shape some portion of the cutting edge legend encompassing Turpin. The craftsman Edward Hull profited by Ainsworth's story, distributing six prints of outstanding occasions in Turpin's vocation.
