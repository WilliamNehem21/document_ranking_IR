At about a similar minute that "Patterson" located the Japanese ships and went without hesitation, the Japanese floatplanes overhead, on requests from Mikawa, dropped airborne flares legitimately over "Canberra" and "Chicago". "Canberra" reacted promptly, with Captain Frank Getting requesting an expansion in speed, an inversion of an underlying swing to port, which kept "Canberra" between the Japanese and the Allied transports, and for her weapons to prepare out and shoot at any objectives that could be located. Short of what one moment later, as "Canberra"s firearms trained in on the Japanese, "ChÃÂkai" and "Furutaka" opened flame on her, scoring various hits inside a couple of moments. "Aoba" and "Kako" participate with gunfire, and inside the following three minutes "Canberra" took up to 24 substantial bore hits. Early hits murdered her gunnery officer, mortally injured Getting, and demolished both engine compartments, thumping out capacity to the whole ship before "Canberra" could discharge any of her weapons or impart a notice to other Allied boats. The cruiser coasted to a stop, ablaze, with a 5-to 10-degree rundown to starboard, and unfit to battle the flames or siphon out overwhelmed compartments on account of absence of intensity. Since the majority of the Japanese boats were on the port side of "Canberra", the harm to the ship's starboard side happened either from shells entering low on the port side and leaving beneath the waterline on the starboard side, or from a couple of torpedo hits on the starboard side. In the event that torpedoes hit "Canberra" on the starboard side, at that point they may have originated from an adjacent Allied ship, and right now the U.S. destroyer "Bagley" was the main ship on that side of the Australian cruiser and had terminated torpedoes minutes sooner.
