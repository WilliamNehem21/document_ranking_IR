Two atoms of 113 were detected. The aim of this experiment had been to synthesise the isotopes 113 and 113 that would fill in the gap between isotopes produced via hot fusion (113 and 113) and cold fusion (113). After five alpha decays, these nuclides would reach known isotopes of lawrencium, assuming that the decay chains were not terminated prematurely by spontaneous fission. The first decay chain ended in fission after four alpha decays, presumably originating from Db or its electron-capture daughter Rf. Spontaneous fission was not observed in the second chain even after four alpha decays. A fifth alpha decay in each chain could have been missed, since Db can theoretically undergo alpha decay, in which case the first decay chain would have ended at the known Lr or No and the second might have continued to the known long-lived Md, which has a half-life of 51.5Â days, longer than the duration of the experiment: this would explain the lack of a spontaneous fission event in this chain. In the absence of direct detection of the long-lived alpha decays, these interpretations remain unconfirmed, and there is still no known link between any superheavy nuclides produced by hot fusion and the well-known main body of the chart of nuclides.
