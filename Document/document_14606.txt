The chanonry, alluded to in the house of prayer's chartulary as the "school of the chanonry" or just as the "school", was the gathering of the standards' chateaus that were assembled around the church building. A generous divider, over high, thick and around long, encased the house of prayer and manors and isolated the congregation network from the common people; just the chateau of Rhynie lay outside the west divider. The places of 17ÃÂ vicars and the numerous clerics were likewise arranged outside the west divider. The divider had four doors: the West Port offered access to the burgh, the North Port gave access to the way to the minister's royal residence of Spynie, the South Port opened inverse the medical clinic of Maison Dieu and the enduring East or Panns Port enabled access to the meadowland called "Le Pannis". The Panns Port represents the portcullis resistances of the door houses (Fig. 1). Every group or dignitary was in charge of giving his very own house and was worked to mirror his status inside the part. The stronghold having turned out to be unacceptable, Edward I of England remained at the house of Duffus on 10 and 11 September 1303 as did James II in 1455. In 1489, a century after the ignitable assault on the church building and region in 1390 and 1402, the basilica records uncovered a chanonry as yet missing a considerable lot of its houses.
