Lody expressed that he had been sent to the UK "to stay until the first [naval] experience had occurred between the two Powers, and to send exact data as respects the real misfortunes of the British Fleet", just as to see what he could of Fleet developments off the coast. The court military went into an "in camera" session while touchy proof was being heard. Lody asserted that he had asked in August to be eradicated from military administration on the grounds of weakness and to be permitted to venture out to the United States. This was won't, he went on, however an individual from maritime knowledge whom he had already never met urged him into undertaking a mission in the UK depending on the prerequisite that he could go to the US a while later. Lody told the council that he was not compelled but rather that "I have never been a weakling in my life and I positively would not be a shirker", and that he had endured with his central goal in light of the fact that "once a man has guaranteed to complete a thing he does it, that is the understanding." His administrations were given "totally as a respect and free", while he had never planned to be a covert operative: "I was squeezed for mystery administration, yet not as a spyÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ goodness, no. On the off chance that that would have been referenced to me at Berlin I without a doubt would have won't. The word in the sentence, I don't think it goes together." He asserted that he had "swore my pledge of respect" not to name his controller.
