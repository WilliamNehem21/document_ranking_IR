Matured 16, Streltsov made his presentation for Torpedo amid the 1954 season, showed up in each group amusement and scored four objectives. The group completed ninth in the association, a drop from third the earlier year. In his second season Streltsov was the association's most productive goalscorer, scoring 15 objectives in 22 amusements as his side rose to fourth place. Streltsov was chosen for the Soviet national group without precedent for 1955, part of the way through the season; his introduction arrived in a well disposed match against Sweden in Stockholm on 26 June, when he scored a cap trap inside the initial 45 minutes as the Swedish group was vanquished 6Ã¢ÂÂ 0. On his second appearance, a well disposed home diversion against India, he scored three objectives once more. A further diversion in Hungary and an objective against France implied that by the beginning of 1956, Streltsov had scored seven objectives for the Soviet Union in four matches. In the wake of scoring in a match against Denmark in April 1956, he missed three worldwide matches before returning in September with an objective following three minutes in a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1 away triumph over West Germany. Streltsov kept on scoring consistently for Torpedo, overseeing 12 group objectives amid the 1956 season, yet showed up in two progressive thrashings for the Soviets before they ventured out in November 1956 to the Olympic Games in Melbourne. Streltsov scored three objectives in a 16Ã¢ÂÂ 2 triumph over Australia in an informal match on 15 November before scoring a late winning objective in the primary competition coordinate against the United Team of Germany nine days after the fact. The Soviets required a replay to beat Indonesia in the quarter-finals and met Bulgaria in the semi-last.
