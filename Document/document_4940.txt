The Parsons family spent mid-1929 on a voyage through Europe before coming back to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the beginning of the Great Depression their fortune started to wane, and in July 1931 Jack's granddad Walter kicked the bucket. Parsons started learning at the secretly run University School, a liberal establishment that adopted a whimsical strategy to educating. He prospered scholastically, getting to be manager of the school's paper "El Universitano" and winning an honor for artistic magnificence; instructors who had prepared at the adjacent California Institute of Technology (Caltech) sharpened his considerations on the investigation of science. With the family's monetary troubles developing, Parsons started working amid ends of the week and school occasions at the workplaces of the Hercules Powder Company, where he got familiar with explosives and their potential use in rocket drive. He and Forman proceeded to autonomously investigate the subject in their extra time, building and testing diverse rockets, once in a while with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons before long developed a strong fuel rocket motor, and with Forman compared with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had long periods of phone discussions about rocketry in their separate nations just as their very own exploration.
