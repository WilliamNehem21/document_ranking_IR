Pressured again by Manningham and Douglas (it was the latter who took her confession), she made a further admission on 8Â December and another on 9Â December, before being sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell, charged on a statute of Edward III as a "vile cheat and imposter". In her earlier, unpublished confessions, she blamed the entire affair on a range of other participants, from her mother-in-law to John Howard. She also claimed that a travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such a scheme would ensure that she would "never want as long as I liv'd". The "British Journal" reported that on 7Â January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of Quarter Sessions at Westminster, charged "for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births". Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further. "Mist's Weekly Journal" of 24Â December 1726 reported that "the nurse has been examined as to the person's concerned with her, but either was kept in the dark as to the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others."
