Fixes of the seismic tremor harm started in 1908, notwithstanding second thoughts from some college organization in regards to its cost; it was shut somewhere in the range of 1906 and 1913 while it was fixed. The college president needed to delay scholastic ventures to pay for the congregation's reclamation, just as the rebuilding of the whole grounds. Eventually, they fixed Memorial Church since they perceived that it was "basic to the personality of the youthful college". The congregation and the Old Chemistry building were the main two structures in the college's Inner Quad that were fixed. The degree of the harm was with the end goal that the congregation must be totally modified. The whole church, aside from its enduring intersection structure and workplaces, was destroyed stone by stone, which, alongside the windows, were named and put away, and were later relaid in their unique positions. As indicated by design student of history Willis L. Lobby in his 1917 book about the congregation, "In recreation extraordinary consideration has been taken to guarantee perpetual quality". The stones were safely darted to one another, "making the entire structure for all intents and purposes one enormous empty shake on an incredible steel establishment skeleton". The tile floor was supplanted with stopper. The structure's intersection got a tiled hipped rooftop and an oculus, which lit the inside of the congregation, and was included over the revamped vault, which had a frescoed roof beautified with bronze plans instead of the gold leaf present before the seismic tremor. The first rose window over the front exterior was supplanted with one with a more straightforward curve shape since it was progressively like the style of the remainder of the structures in the Inner Quad.
