Toward the west, the 1903 proposed expansion from Knightsbridge to Hammersmith through Kensington High Street remained, however it was to proceed past Hammersmith under King Street, the last station being at the intersection of King Street, Goldhawk Road and Chiswick High Road. The passages were to proceed past the last station for a further under Chiswick High Road, to finish at the intersection with Homefield Road. The circle north from Hammersmith to Shepherd's Bush was dropped; rather a more straightforward course to Shepherd's Bush was proposed as a branch from the Hammersmith expansion at Addison Road. It was to keep running under Holland Road to Shepherd's Bush Green, with a station being developed inverse the CLR station there. It would then proceed with west under Uxbridge Road to Acton Vale, where a warehouse was to be based superficially between Agnes Road and Davis Road. To take care of the expense of the proposed augmentations, forces to raise further capital of ÃÂ£4.2 million were looked for. The audit of the bill in Parliament was postponed as the Royal Commission was all the while sitting amid the principal half of 1905; the bill was pulled back by the GNP&BR in July 1905, as deficient time at that point stayed for culmination the parliamentary procedure before the finish of the session.
