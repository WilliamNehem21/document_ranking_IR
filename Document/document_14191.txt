Aristotle (384Ã¢ÂÂ 322 BC) and Pliny (23Ã¢ÂÂ 79 AD) both expounded on the legend of a challenge among the flying creatures to see who ought to be their lord, the title to be granted to the one that could fly most noteworthy. At first, it looked as if the falcon would win effectively, however as he started to tire, a little winged animal that had covered up under the bird's tail quills rose to fly significantly higher and asserted the title. Following from this legend, in much European old stories the wren has been portrayed as the "lord of the winged creatures" or as a fire conveyor. Be that as it may, these terms were additionally connected to the "Regulus" species, the blazing crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them bound to be the first bearers of these titles, and, as a result of the legend's reference to the "littlest of fowls" getting to be above all else, the title was likely exchanged to the similarly small wren. The disarray was most likely aggravated by the comparability and resulting compatibility of the Greek words for the wren ( , "ruler") and the peaks ( , "kinglet"). In English, the relationship between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been strengthened by the kinglet's old name of "gold-peaked wren".
