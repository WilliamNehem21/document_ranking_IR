The 1996 season started well for Zolak, whose agreement was stretched out through 1998. In any case, to stay with the Patriots, Zolak accepted a $250,000 decrease in salary to work around the pay top. While he seemed set to keep his reinforcement work heading into preparing camp, he confronted extreme challenge from Jay Barker. While Zolak respected the test, his status as the reinforcement quarterback appeared to be questionable half a month into preparing camp. Before the finish of preparing camp, Barker had been cut, and Zolak's quarterback work was protected. He played the job of crisis quarterback all through the 1996 season, with Bledsoe taking about every one of the snaps and Tom Tupa filling in as the reinforcement upon his marking. Zolak played in three recreations, finishing one go for five yards. He saw some playing time in the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Steelers, yet did not play in Super Bowl XXXI. Parcells requested Zolak to get more fit, which Zolak did all through a significant part of the period. The 1997 season was business as usual for Zolak, backing up Bledsoe, however the Patriots had another mentor in Pete Carroll. As preparing camp finished, Zolak picked up essentially all the more playing time amid drills and the preseason matchups then he had under Parcells. As the customary season went back and forth, notwithstanding, he had negligible playing time. Zolak saw activity in four amusements, finishing six of nine goes for 67ÃÂ yards and two touchdowns, giving him a quarterback rating of 128.2.
