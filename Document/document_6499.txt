Close to the finish of September 2001, an inadequately characterized tropical wave moved westbound over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, through a territory of unfriendly wind shear, which was brought about by a huge upper-level low inside a trough, toward the upper east of the Lesser Antilles. A couple of days after the fact, the upper-level low isolates from the trough and moved southwestward over the Caribbean Sea, taking into consideration an upper-level edge, or high-weight region, to frame over the tropical wave. The change gave a positive domain to tropical advancement, and a territory of convection before long bloomed along the wave's hub. As the tropical wave moved toward the Lesser Antilles, a mid-level breeze course framed inside the most profound piece of the convection, and a low-level flow turned out to be bit by bit progressively articulated on satellite symbolism. In spite of the fact that its low-level flow was little and ineffectively characterized, the framework expanded in association enough to be delegated Tropical Depression Eleven at 12:00ÃÂ UTC on OctoberÃÂ 4, situated about 100ÃÂ mi (160ÃÂ km) southeast of Barbados. Operationally, be that as it may, Hurricane Hunters did not affirm the wretchedness' arrangement until nine hours after the fact.
