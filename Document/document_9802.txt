ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d was conceived around 870, the most established offspring of King Alfred the Great and his Mercian spouse, Ealhswith, who was a little girl of ÃÂthelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, one of the clans of Mercia. Ealhswith's mom, Eadburh, was an individual from the Mercian regal house, most likely a relative of King Coenwulf (796Ã¢ÂÂ 821). ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d was in this way half-Mercian and the collusion among Wessex and Mercia was fixed by her marriage to ÃÂthelred, Lord of the Mercians. They are referenced in Alfred's will, which most likely dates to the 880s. ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d, depicted just as "my oldest little girl", got a bequest and 100 mancuses, while ÃÂthelred, the main ealdorman to be referenced by name, got a sword worth 100 mancuses. ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d was first recorded as ÃÂthelred's significant other in a contract of 887, when he allowed two bequests to the see of Worcester "with the authorization and sign-manual of King Alfred" and the attestors included "ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d "conjux"". The marriage may have occurred before, maybe when he submitted to Alfred following the recuperation of London in 886. ÃÂthelred was a lot more seasoned than ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d and they had one known kid, a little girl called ÃÂlfwynn. ÃÂthelstan, the oldest child of Edward the Elder and future lord of England, was raised in their court and, in the perspective on Martin Ryan, absolutely joined their battles against the Vikings.
