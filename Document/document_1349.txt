The jail authority conveyed his irregular hostage to the consideration of The Commissioners for dealing with Sick and Wounded Seamen and for the Care and Treatment of Prisoners of War, the body then in charge of every single therapeutic administration in the Royal Navy and for supervising the welfare of detainees of war. , an individual from the Commission, and Dr Cochrane, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, played out a trial to test Domery's eating limit and resistance for surprising sustenances. At 4:00ÃÂ am, Domery was stirred and sustained 4ÃÂ lbs (1.8ÃÂ kg) of crude cow's udder, which was eaten decisively. At 9:30ÃÂ am he was given a dinner of 5ÃÂ lbs (2.3ÃÂ kg) of crude hamburger, twelve huge fat candles totalling oneÃÂ pound (453ÃÂ g), and a jug of doorman, which were all expended. At 1:00ÃÂ pm Domery was given another dinner of a further 5ÃÂ lbs of meat, a pound (453ÃÂ g) of candles, and three vast containers of doorman, which were all likewise eaten and flushed. Over the span of the analysis he didn't poo, pee or regurgitation anytime, his heartbeat stayed normal and his skin did not change temperature. Upon Domery's arrival to his quarters at 6:15ÃÂ pm after the finish of the test, he was recorded as being of "especially optimism", and moved, smoked his pipe and drank a further jug of doorman.
