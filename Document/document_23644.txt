Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac attempts in "Louis Lambert" to construct a viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his "TraitÃ© de la VolontÃ©", which â having been confiscated by a teacher â is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connoteÂ ... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes a section of the "TraitÃ© de la VolontÃ©" which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.
