Though no skull remains were discovered with the original "Brachiosaurus" skeleton, one partial skull from a different location may belong to "Brachiosaurus": the Felch Quarry skull (specimen USNM 5730). Since there is no overlapping material between the two specimens, the skull has only been assigned to "Brachiosaurus" sp. (of uncertain species). As reconstructed, the skull was about long from the occipital condyle at the back of the skull to the front of the premaxillae (the front bones of the upper jaw), making it the largest sauropod skull from the Morrison Formation. It appears to have been most similar to and intermediate between that of "Giraffatitan" and "Camarasaurus". Overall, the skull was tall as in "Giraffatitan", with a snout that was long (about 36% of the skull length) in front of the nasal bar between the nostrils â typical of brachiosaurids. The snout, set at an angle relative to the rest of the skull, gave the impression of pointing downward. The frontal bones on top of the skull were short and wide (similar to "Giraffatitan"), fused and connected by a suture to the parietal bones, which were also fused together. The surface of the parietals between the supratemporal fenestrae (openings at the rear skull roof) was wider than that of "Giraffatitan", but narrower than that of "Camarasaurus". The skull differed from that of "Giraffatitan" in its U-shaped (instead of W-shaped) suture between frontal and nasal bones, a shape which appears more pronounced by the frontal bones extending forward over the orbits (eye sockets).
