The localizations for the "Persona" series are generally handled by translator Yu Namba of Atlus USA, who also handles localization for multiple other "Megami Tensei" games. Another prominent staff member was Nich Maragos, who worked with Namba on multiple "Persona" games until moving to Nintendo of America prior to 2015. The localization of "Persona" was handled by a small team, which put a lot of pressure on them as they needed to adjust the game for Western audiences: the changes implemented included altering names, changing the appearance of characters, and removing numerous cultural references. An entire alternate main quest was also removed. After "Persona", it was decided that future "Persona" games should be as faithful as possible to their original releases. Namba's first localization project for the series was "Eternal Punishment". For the release of "Innocent Sin", there was a debate over whether to release it, as it contained potentially controversial content including allusions to Nazism. In the end, due to staff and resource shortages, "Innocent Sin" was passed over for localization in favor of its sequel "Eternal Punishment". Later, when the company developed the PSP ports, the team released the ports of "Persona" and "Innocent Sin" overseas so fans attracted by "Persona 3" and "4" would be able to easily catch up with the rest of the series. The localization for "Persona" was completely redone, reverting all the previous altered content and restoring all previously cut content. The port of "Eternal Punishment" was not localized due to "unusual circumstances", so the company released the original version on PSN instead.
