Late works have commonly acknowledged the picture of Theramenes as a moderate, focused on the perfect of a hoplite-based wide theocracy. Donald Kagan has said of him that "...his whole profession uncovers him to be a nationalist and a genuine moderate, earnestly dedicated to a constitution allowing capacity to the hoplite class, regardless of whether as a constrained majority rules system or a comprehensively based theocracy", while John Fine has noticed that "in the same way as other an individual after a center course, he was abhorred by both political boundaries." The constitution of the 5,000 is perceived as his political perfect work of art; his endeavor to achieve a comparable move towards moderatism in 404 drove straightforwardly to his demise. That passing, in the mean time, has turned out to be celebrated for its show, and the narrative of Theramenes' last minutes has been rehashed again and again all through established historiography. "Since he met his shocking a despot," John Fine notes, "it is anything but difficult to admire Theramenes." In the centuries since his demise, Theramenes has been both romanticized and censured; his concise seven-year profession in the spotlight, contacting as it did on all the real purposes of contention in the most recent long stretches of the Peloponnesian War, has been liable to horde distinctive understandings. From the polemical contemporary works which portray his profession have developed the blueprints of a perplexing figure, graphing an unsafe course through the disorder of the late fifth century Athenian political scene; despite the fact that history specialists from antiquated occasions to the present have offered unquestionably increasingly explicit representations, of some structure, it might be that just that layout will ever be known with conviction.
