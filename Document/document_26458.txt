Eaton was posted to Britain following the end of World WarÂ II, and attended RAF Staff College the next year. In September 1947, he was appointed Officer Commanding No.Â 81 (Fighter) Wing in Japan, as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). The Australian contingent initially comprised three combat units, Nos.Â 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons, as well as No.Â 381 (Base) Squadron, No.Â 481 (Maintenance) Squadron, No.Â 111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and No.Â 5 Airfield Construction Squadron. By mid-1949, it had been reduced to No.Â 77 Squadron alone, and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded; Eaton served as "RAAF Component" commander for the remainder of his tenure in Japan. As well as surveillance patrols, training and inter-service exercises, the Australian airmen took part in ceremonial flypasts. On one such occasion, over Tokyo, Eaton led his formation of thirty Mustangs into cloud with a faulty artificial horizon in his plane, with the result that he and his comrades, who were following his lead, became badly disorientated and were fortunate to avoid collision; RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered this a not-atypical example of the casual attitude to flying safety exhibited at the time by the veteran pilots of World WarÂ II.
