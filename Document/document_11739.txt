Zihuatanejo has been deciphered as a simple for paradise or heaven. In the film, Andy depicts it as a spot with no memory, offering pardon from his wrongdoings by overlooking them or enabling them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name signifies "harmony". The likelihood of getting away to Zihuatanejo is just raised after Andy concedes that he feels in charge of his significant other's passing. Correspondingly, Red's opportunity is just earned once he acknowledges he can't spare himself or offer reparations for his wrongdoings. Freeman has depicted Red's story as one of salvation as he isn't guiltless of his wrongdoings, not at all like Andy who discovers recovery. While some Christian watchers translate Zihuatanejo as paradise, it can likewise be deciphered as a Nietzschean type of guiltlessness accomplished outside conventional ideas of good and abhorrence, where the amnesia offered is the devastation as opposed to pardoning of wrongdoing, which means Andy's point is common and agnostic. Similarly as Andy can be translated as a Christ-like figure, he can be viewed as a Zarathustra-like prophet offering escape through instruction and the experience of opportunity. Ebert contended that "The Shawshank Redemption" is a moral story for keeping up one's sentiment of self-esteem when set in a sad position. Andy's honesty is an essential subject in the story line, particularly in jail, where trustworthiness is inadequate.
