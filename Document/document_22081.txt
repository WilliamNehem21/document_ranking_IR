Historians agree that at some point in history the order of words in this construction shifted, putting the noun at the end rather than beginning, like in the present-day construction "NumberÂ âÂ ClassifierÂ âÂ Noun". According to historical linguist Alain Peyraube, the earliest occurrences of this construction (albeit with mass-classifiers, rather than count-classifiers) appear in the late portion of Old Chinese (500Â BCE to 200Â BCE). At this time, the "NumberÂ âÂ Mass-classifier" portion of the "NounÂ âÂ NumberÂ âÂ Mass-classifier" construction was sometimes shifted in front of the noun. Peyraube speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a modifier (like an adjective) for the head noun, as opposed to a simple repetition as it originally was. Since Chinese generally places modifiers before modified, as does English, the shift may have been prompted by this reanalysis. By the early part of the Common Era, the nouns appearing in "classifier position" were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers. Estimates of when classifiers underwent the most development vary: Wang Li claims their period of major development was during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE â 220 CE), whereas Liu Shiru estimates that it was the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 â 589 CE), and Peyraube chooses the Tang Dynasty (618 â 907 CE). Regardless of when they developed, Wang Lianqing claims that they did not become grammatically mandatory until sometime around the 11th century.
