Sestak won the May 18 essential with 53.8 percent of the vote, or 568,563 of the votes cast, contrasted with 46.2 percent and 487,217 votes in favor of Specter. The thrashing prompted the finish of Specter's about 30-year Senate vocation, the longest of any Pennsylvania Senator ever. A while later, Sestak pronounced, "This is the thing that vote based system should resemble: a success for the general population over the foundation. It should not shock anybody that individuals need a change." Specter yielded rout and stated, "It's been an incredible benefit to serve the general population of Pennsylvania. It's been an extraordinary benefit to be in the United States Senate." Commentators recommended Specter's thrashing flagged an electorate unsatisfied with the foundation in both real gatherings, and showed that the sponsorship of noticeable government officials had little impact on voters amid this political age. Sestak's triumph was viewed as a minor shame for Obama, who firmly and freely supported for Specter amid the race. A few news outlets mirrored that Sestak's TV commercials censuring Specter as a wolf in sheep's clothing and shark were particularly viable and may have been the essential factor in his triumph. "The Washington Post" said the Pennsylvania race drew more consideration than some other essential decision in 2010 because of Specter's life span and his change to the Democratic party.
