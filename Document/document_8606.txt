A couple of individuals in the Astronaut Office, including Walter Cunningham, felt Armstrong and Scott "had messed up their first mission". There was theory that Armstrong could have rescued the mission in the event that he had turned on just a single of the two RCS rings, sparing the other for mission goals. These reactions were unwarranted; no glitch strategies had been composed, and it was conceivable to turn on just both RCS rings, not either. Quality Kranz stated, "The team responded as they were prepared, and they responded wrong since we prepared them off-base." The mission organizers and controllers had neglected to understand that when two shuttle were docked, they should be viewed as one rocket. Kranz considered this the mission's most essential exercise. Armstrong was discouraged that the mission was stopped, dropping most mission goals and denying Scott of his EVA. The Agena was later reused as a docking focus by Gemini 10. Armstrong and Scott got the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and the Air Force granted Scott the Distinguished Flying Cross also. Scott was elevated to lieutenant colonel, and Armstrong got a $678 salary increase to $21,653 per year (), making him NASA's most generously compensated space traveler.
