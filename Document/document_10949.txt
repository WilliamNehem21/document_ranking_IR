At the point when parliament met to talk about Richard's destiny, the religious administrator of St Asaph read thirty-three articles of affidavit that were collectively acknowledged by rulers and house. On 1 October 1399, Richard II was formally ousted and on 13 October, the blowout day of Edward the Confessor, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, was delegated Henry IV of England. Henry had recently consented to let Richard live after his resignation. This all changed when it was uncovered that the dukes of Huntingdon, Kent and Salisbury and Lord Despenser, and perhaps at the same time the Earl of Rutlandall now downgraded from the positions they had been given by Richardwere wanting to kill the new ruler and reestablish Richard in the Epiphany Rising. In spite of the fact that turned away, the plot featured the risk of permitting Richard to live. He is thought to have starved to death in bondage close by 14 February 1400, in spite of the fact that there is some inquiry over the date and way of his passing. His body was taken south from Pontefract and showed in the old St Paul's Cathedral on 17 February before entombment in King's Langley Priory on 6 March.
