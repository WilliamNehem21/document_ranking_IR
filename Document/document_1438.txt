Mohammad Nor Khalid was conceived on 5 March 1951 out of a "kampung" (town) in Gopeng, Perak, Malaysia. His dad was an administration assistant with the Malaysian Armed Forces, and his mom a housewife. Khalid was a stocky kid with a cherubic face, which drove his family to epithet him "bulat" (round). His companions abbreviated it to "Lat"; it turned into the name by which he was all the more regularly known in his "kampung" and later on the planet. Lat was the oldest kid in his family, and he frequently played in the wildernesses, estates, and tin mines with his companions. Their toys were normally extemporized from ordinary sundries and things of nature. Lat got a kick out of the chance to doodle with materials given by his folks, and his different types of entertainment were perusing funnies and staring at the TV; Lat adored nearby visual artist Raja Hamzah, who was famous with his stories of swashbuckling Malay saints. Malaysian craftsmanship faultfinder and student of history Redza Piyadasa trusts Lat's initial a very long time in the "kampung" imbued the sketch artist with satisfaction in his "kampung" roots and a "curiously Malay" standpointÃ¢ÂÂ"loaded with [...] delicacy and refinement".
