The amusement started generation close by the organization's second task, "", and stayed being developed after that diversion's 1993 discharge. It then proceeded through the production of their titles "Framework Shock" (discharged in 1994) and "Flight Unlimited". The diversion was liable to various postponements, which Schmidt later credited to its absence of a set due date. He expressed that the group was "attempting to run with a similar theory" as the organization's prior amusements, in that they would "build up the frameworks and the diversion would leave it". Be that as it may, the group's improvement needs normally changed, and the developer who drove the task left quite a while into generation. As indicated by Schmidt, his takeoff implied that "there was nobody left who was psyched about making this truly [realistic] reenactment". Notwithstanding this reality, the group kept utilizing the thought, despite the fact that genuine challenges were associated with accomplishing it. Schmidt said that the amusement's improvement status was questionable after the software engineer left, and that he acquired the job of lead developer around that time simply in light of the fact that the position must be filled. He later accepted the job of undertaking pioneer. In January 1995, Looking Glass demonstrated "Land Nova" close by "Flight Unlimited" at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, under their "Vivid Reality" showcasing name.
