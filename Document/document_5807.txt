Harvey issued his own cash, or scrip, which was acknowledged and utilized as money in and around Monte Ne. Scrip was a method for financing his commercial without requiring working capital. Harvey would buy things with the scrip and guaranteed to reclaim it inside 30 days. In the event that the thing did not sell, the scrip had no esteem. Likewise in downtown was the Bank of Monte Ne. It was composed by Harvey in 1905 and the structure was planned, in the same way as other structures in Monte Ne, by A. O. Clarke. The two-story, 50 by 70ÃÂ ft (15 by 21ÃÂ m) building (normally alluded to as the "Bank Block") incorporated the bank and a store room on the principle floor, just as a hotel room and workplaces on the second floor. The structure was over the road from the mail station. The Interstate Bankers' Summer Club held their 1906 gathering there and the nearby Odd Fellows stop were among the gatherings who utilized the upstairs workplaces. Harvey sold stock in the bank for $15 an offer. The bank kept going until 1914. Contributors and moneylenders were satisfied and some other assets were exchanged to a bank in Rogers.
