"Tintin in Tibet" is generally welcomed by pundits from the funnies and abstract fields. Farr calls it "remarkable in numerous regards, emerging among the twenty-three finished "Tintin" adventuresÃÂ ... a declaration of the morally sound estimation of obligations of kinship." Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier praise it as "a definitive "Tintin" book", achieving "a level of flawlessness, both in its story and in its staggering craftsmanship, that has once in a while been paralleled, previously or since" and "seemingly the best book in the arrangement". They detail the story's numerous passionate minutes: Haddock's ability to forfeit his life for Tintin's, Tharkey's arrival, the sad gathering of Tintin and his destitute companion Chang, the adoration paid to Tintin by the Grand Abbot and the priests, and the Yeti's misery while viewing the takeoff of his solitary companion. "For a comic book to deal with such ground-breaking feelings, pass on them to the perusers, and make them feel what the characters are feeling is an uncommon and valuable accomplishment." Thompson calls it "a book of overpowering whiteness and immaculateness", saying that the "seriously close to home nature of the story made this present HergÃÂ©'s top pick "Tintin" experience", including that if perusers wonder whether "the colossal weight [was] lifted from HergÃÂ©'s shoulders, [this] can be found in his next book, "The Castafiore Emerald", a gem of unwinding." As "Tintin in Tibet" was converted into 32 dialects, Donald Lopez, educator of Buddhist and Tibetan investigations, considers it the "biggest selling book about Tibet."
