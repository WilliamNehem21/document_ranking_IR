Sultan Khalid, Captain Saleh and around forty supporters looked for shelter in the German office following their departure from the royal residence, where they were watched by ten outfitted German mariners and marines while Mathews positioned men outside to capture them on the off chance that they attempted to leave. In spite of removal demands, the German emissary would not surrender Khalid to the British as his nation's removal settlement with Britain explicitly avoided political detainees. Rather, the German diplomat guaranteed to expel Khalid to German East Africa without him "setting foot on the dirt of Zanzibar". At 10:00 on 2 October, SMS "Seeadler" of the German Navy touched base in port; at high tide, one of Seeadler's water crafts influenced it to up to the department's patio nursery door, and Khalid ventured straightforwardly from consular grounds to a German war vessel and consequently was free from capture. He was exchanged from the pontoon onto the "Seeadler" and was then taken to Dar es Salaam in German East Africa. Khalid was caught by British powers in 1916, amid the East African Campaign of World War I, and banished to Seychelles and Saint Helena before being permitted to come back to East Africa, where he kicked the bucket at Mombasa in 1927. The British rebuffed Khalid's supporters by driving them to pay reparations to take care of the expense of shells shot against them and for harms brought about by the plundering, which added up to 300,000 rupees.
