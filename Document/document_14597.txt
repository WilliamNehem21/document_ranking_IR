The underlying round of gunfire executed just the Tsar, the Empress and two male hirelings, and injured Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. By then the shooters needed to leave the room on account of smoke and lethal exhaust from their weapons and mortar dust their slugs had discharged from the dividers. In the wake of enabling the murkiness to clear for a few minutes, the shooters returned. Dr Botkin was slaughtered, and a shooter named Ermakov over and over endeavored to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, however fizzled on the grounds that gems sewn into the kid's garments protected him. Ermakov attempted to cut Alexei with a blade however flopped once more, lastly Yurovsky discharged two shots into the kid's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov drew closer Olga and Tatiana, who were hunched against the room's back divider, sticking to one another and shouting for their mom. Ermakov wounded both young ladies with his 8-inch pike, however experienced issues infiltrating their middles as a result of the gems that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters attempted to stand, yet Tatiana was murdered immediately when Yurovsky shot her in the back of her head. After a minute, Olga too passed on when Ermakov shot her in the jaw.
