Lee picked the generally all around rested directions of D. H. Slope, Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder to lead the Confederate hostile, as they had scarcely taken part in the battling of the day preceding. James Longstreet and A.P. Slope's divisions were held available for later as they were in no condition to battle after Glendale, with practically a large portion of their officers and near a fourth of the enrolled men slaughtered or injured. Brig. Gen Winfield Featherston's unit was incidentally told by Brig. Gen George B. Anderson of D.H. Slope's division, as there was no one remaining in the detachment over the position of major. As indicated by Lee's arrangement, the Army of Northern Virginia would shape a semi-circle encompassing Malvern Hill. D. H. Slope's five detachments would be put along the northern essence of the slope, shaping the focal point of the Confederate line, and the directions of Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks, separately. Whiting's powers would position themselves on the Poindexter ranch, with the outfits of Brig. Gen. Charles Sidney Winder and Richard Ewell adjacent. The infantry of these three separations would give fortification to the Confederate line if fundamental. Two veteran commanders rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia for the fight, Brig. Gen Wade Hampton and Brig. Gen Jubal Early, both injured two months sooner. Hampton and Early were given order of two of Jackson's units that had lost their officers at Gaines Mill and had just unpracticed colonels to lead them. Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes would take up a situation on the extraordinary Confederate right flank.
