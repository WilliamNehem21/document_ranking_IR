The custom that a family gravely carries a sign into the house and lights it on the hearth on Christmas Eve has been recorded in different pieces of Europe. In England, a Yule log used to be merrily aroused on the residential hearth so "that sweet karma may come while the log is a-teending", as depicted by seventeenth century artist Robert Herrick. In France, the log had diverse local names: "chalendal", "calignaou", "trÃÂ©foir", and "trÃÂ©fouet". In Provence, it must be cut from an organic product tree; it was gotten by the entire family while they sang a tune appealing to God for gift on the house, that the ladies may bear kids, the caretaker goats kids, and the ewes sheep, and that their grain and wine may flourish. Before the log was set on the flame, the most youthful youngster in the family poured wine on it. Logs were reverentially laid on the household fire on Christmas Eve in different pieces of Italy; in Tuscany, Christmas is designated "Festa di Ceppo", actually "dining experience of log". In the Val di Chiana, the offspring of the family were blindfolded and told to beat the consuming log with tongs. Hints of Christmas-log traditions can likewise be found in Germany and Scandinavia. In Thuringia the family put a "Christklotz" (Christ log) on the flame before hitting the sack, with the goal that it may consume the night.
