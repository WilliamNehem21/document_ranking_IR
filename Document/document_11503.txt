Regardless of his reservations, in October 2011 Virtanen participated with another researcher, Vesa SirÃÂ©n, to plan three of the more created sections for execution. The portrayals were duplicated and cleaned, yet nothing not composed by Sibelius was added to the material. Consent from the Sibelius Rights Holders was verified, and John StorgÃÂ¥rds, boss director of the Helsinki Philharmonic, consented to play and record these portions at the ensemble's practice session on 30 October 2011. The pieces involve an opening section of about a moment's span, an eight-second section that may be a piece of a scherzo, and a last piece of instrumental music again enduring around a moment. SirÃÂ©n depicts the music as "unusual, ground-breaking, and with brave, hot harmoniesÃ¢ÂÂa stage into the new even after "Tapiola" and the music for "The Tempest"". Stearns gives a progressively nitty gritty knowledge: "The primary passage is great Sibelian declaration of a first development. There's a sophisticated instrumental thunderclap that tosses open the way to a consonant world that is Sibelius' distant from everyone else, except has abnormal cacophonies dissimilar to some other work. Another impression sounds like the start of a scherzo, shockingly spring-like with a light woodwind solo. Another piece has an exemplary Sibelian bassoon solo, the sort that discusses base things and goes to a dim, snowy black market."
