As Mary was announced ruler, Dudley, Ridley, Cheke, and Jane's dad, the Duke of Suffolk were detained. In any case, no move was made against the ecclesiastical overseer. On 8 August he drove Edward's memorial service as indicated by the rituals of the Prayer Book. Amid these months, he exhorted others, including Peter Martyr, to escape England, however he himself remained. Transformed clerics were expelled from office and moderate pastorate, for example, Edmund Bonner, had their old positions reestablished. Cranmer did not go down without a battle. At the point when bits of gossip spread that he approved the utilization of the mass in Canterbury Cathedral, he pronounced them to be false and stated, "[A]ll the precept and religion, by our said sovereign ruler lord Edward VI is progressively unadulterated and as per God's assertion, than any that hath been utilized in England these thousand years." of course, the administration viewed Cranmer's presentation as equivalent to dissidence. He was requested to remain before the gathering in the Star Chamber on 14 September and on that day he said his last farewell to Martyr. Cranmer was sent directly to the Tower to join Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley.
