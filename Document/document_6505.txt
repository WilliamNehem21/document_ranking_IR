After Davidson's demise and internment, press consideration shriveled as papers focused on increasingly noteworthy occasions in the years prior to the Second World War. In the decades after the war enthusiasm for the undertaking was occasionally restored. In 1963 Blythe, regarded by Parris to be the issue's "best student of history", distributed his record. Later during the 1960s, two phase melodic adaptations were delivered: "The Stiffkey Scandals of 1932", which showed up in Edinburgh in 1967 and London in 1968, and "God Made the Little Red Apple", arranged in Manchester in 1969. Neither of these creations was financially effective; when the previous was adjusted for TV, "The Daily Telegraph"s pundit scrutinized the masterful support for a melodic about "so miserable and impossible to miss an individual". During the 1970s Davidson's case was the subject of a radio narrative, "A Proper Little Gent", and in 1994 a scene of BBC Television's "Self evident Fact" arrangement inspected the issue. Cullen's full-length account of Davidson in 1975 sets a hypothesis that numerous identities drove him to carry on in various routes in varying conditions. Robert Brown, in an anecdotal sketch for the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", recommends that what truly inspired Davidson will never be known. In 2007 John Walsh distributed a fictionalized record of Davidson's life, "Sunday at the Cross Bones" (Fourth Estate), in which, as per an audit in "The Guardian", Davidson is portrayed as "good natured however insufficient, baffled by the world's insidiousness and his very own scarcely recognized wants".
