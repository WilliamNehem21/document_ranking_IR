Ranulf de Glanvill, King Henry II's Lord Chief Justice, established a Premonstratensian convent on the swamps at Minsmere in 1182. The region was embanked to shield the nunnery from the ocean and to recover farmland, yet at the same time endured quite a while of extreme flooding in the fourteenth century. The site was surrendered in 1363, and the stone from the structures was utilized to modify Leiston Abbey at another area further inland. The remaining parts of the monastery church, fish lake and different structures can in any case be recognized subterranean, however the main unmistakable structure is the demolished house of prayer of St Mary, worked inside the nave of the previous church. The lower segment of the house of prayer was fabricated not long after the annihilation of the monastery in 1363, and the block upper parts are thought to have been included by previous abbot John Green, who lived there as a recluse when he resigned from his post in 1527. The site was relinquished in 1537 amid the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the main further development being a pillbox that was worked inside the sanctuary amid World War II. The remains are a planned landmark of national significance.
