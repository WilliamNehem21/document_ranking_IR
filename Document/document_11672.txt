In 2003, Williamson and Carr distributed a theoretical development arrangement of "S. validum", appearing as the adolescent stage. They proposed that adolescents were described by a level, thickened frontoparietal rooftop, with bigger supratemporal fenestrae, and studded with firmly divided tubercles and hubs. The parietosquamosal rack was not decreased in size, and the frontoparietal suture was open. Sub-grown-ups had hill like vaults, with the back piece of the parietal and skull-rooftop being level. The supratemporal fenestrae demonstrated asymmetry in size, and the conclusion of the frontoparietal suture was variable. The hubs were extended or nearly crushed as the vault extended amid development, with a tesserated surface remaining. The example was regularly devastated at the most noteworthy point (pinnacle) of the vault, the region where greatest extension happened. The tubercles on the skull were extended in various ways, and those at the edge of the parietosquamosal rack may have been hypertrophied (expanded) tubercles. The back and sides of sub-grown-up and grown-up skulls were ornamented by less changed tubercles. Before being joined into the broadening vault, the skull bones extended, bringing about intersections between these bones. The grown-up arch was expansive and curved, and consolidated a large portion of the rack, which was diminished in size and overhung the occiput as a thick "lip". The supratempooral fenestrae were shut, yet the suture between the frontoparietal and associated skull bones was not constantly shut in grown-ups and subadults.
