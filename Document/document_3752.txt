In November 1943, Kinkaid supplanted Carpender as Commander Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific Area, and the Seventh Fleet, known as "MacArthur's Navy". General Douglas MacArthur had twice mentioned Carpender's alleviation, and Kinkaid's record working with the Army in Alaska settled on him a coherent decision. Australian papers hailed the arrangement of a "battling naval commander", yet neither MacArthur nor the Australian government had been counseled about the arrangement, which was made by the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King. This was an infringement of the worldwide understanding that had built up the Southwest Pacific Area. The Navy Department at that point declared that the supplanting of Carpender with Kinkaid was just a proposition, and MacArthur and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, were inquired as to whether Kinkaid was worthy. They concurred that he was. In his new job, Kinkaid had two experts. As leader of the Seventh Fleet, he was liable to King, yet as Commander Allied Naval Forces, Kinkaid was responsible to MacArthur. Tasks were led based on "common participation" instead of "solidarity of direction", and relations between the Army and Navy were bad. Kinkaid was not the most senior maritime officer in the theater, for the Royal Australian Navy's Admiral Sir Guy Royle and the Royal Netherlands Navy's Admiral Conrad Helfrich were both senior to him.
