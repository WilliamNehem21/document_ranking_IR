Al-Ma'mun had made no official arrangements for his progression. His child, al-Abbas, was mature enough to control and had procured involvement of direction in the fringe wars with the Byzantines, yet had not been named beneficiary. As per the record of al-Tabari, on his deathbed al-Ma'mun directed a letter choosing his sibling, as opposed to al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as caliph on 9August, with the regnal name of al-Mu'tasim (in full "al-MuÃÂ¿taÃ¡Â¹Â£im bi'llÃÂh", "he who looks for asylum in God"). It is difficult to know whether this reflects real occasions, or whether the letter was a creation and Abu Ishaq only exploited his vicinity to his withering sibling, and al-Abbas' nonattendance somewhere else, to drive himself to the honored position. As Abu Ishaq was the progenitor of all consequent Abbasid caliphs, later students of history wanted to scrutinize the authenticity of his increase, however unmistakably his position was a long way from secure: a vast piece of the military favored al-Abbas, and a designation of officers even went to him and attempted to broadcast him as the new Caliph. Just when al-Abbas rejected them, regardless of whether out of shortcoming or out of a craving to maintain a strategic distance from a common war, and himself made the vow of faithfulness to his uncle, did the troopers assent in al-Mu'tasim's progression. The dubiousness of his position is additionally prove by the way that al-Mu'tasim promptly canceled the endeavor, relinquished the Tyana venture and came back with his military to Baghdad, which he came to on 20September.
