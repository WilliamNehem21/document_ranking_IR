Furthermore, hypothesis of a conceivable trans-Neptunian planet has spun around the purported "Kuiper bluff". The Kuiper belt ends abruptly at a separation of 48ÃÂ AU from the Sun. Brunini and Melita have guessed that this abrupt drop-off might be ascribed to the nearness of an article with a mass between those of Mars and Earth situated past 48ÃÂ AU. The nearness of an article with a mass like that of Mars in a round circle at 60ÃÂ AU prompts a trans-Neptunian object populace contrary with perceptions. For example, it would seriously drain the plutino populace. Space experts have not prohibited the likelihood of an article with a mass like that of Earth found more distant than 100ÃÂ AU with an unusual and slanted circle. PC recreations by Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University have proposed that an article with a mass somewhere in the range of 0.3 and 0.7 Earth masses, shot out outward by Neptune right off the bat in the Solar System's development and presently in an extended circle somewhere in the range of 101 and 200ÃÂ AU from the Sun, could clarify the Kuiper bluff and the exceptional segregated items, for example, Sedna and . Albeit a few stargazers, for example, Renu Malhotra and David Jewitt, have mindfully upheld these cases, others, for example, Alessandro Morbidelli, have rejected them as "invented". In 2017, Malhotra and Kat Volk contended that a startling fluctuation in tendency for KBOs more remote than the precipice at 50 AU gave proof of a conceivable Mars-sized planet living at the edge of the Solar System.
