There simply is nothing else on TV that can coordinate it for thoughts, composing and execution." Sarah Dempster of "The Guardian" concurred, including that "Four years into its astute 'leaving a mark on the world look less poop' operationÃÂ ... HH stays consistent with its point, with fastidiously gathered chronicled information + roaringly very much watched popular culture pastiches = apparently unending legacy lolz." Writing in "The Independent", Grace Dent lauded the cast specifically, saying that the show "has the unmistakable feel of a gathering of splendid, youthful, learned, writery-actory sparkles having an enormously decent time." Venning of "The Stage" emphasized his acclaim for the show, including that "it likewise has the boldness to handle possibly dubious occasions head on", explicitly refering to the melody highlighting the Civil Rights Movement dissident Rosa Parks as retelling her story in a "sharp, compact and available route without trivializing it." In 2016, Margaret Lyons of "The New York Times" adulated the arrangement as "profoundly senseless", "every now and again amusing", and,"very predictable".
