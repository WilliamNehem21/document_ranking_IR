On 7 January 1941, "Distinguished" set sail to give air spread to guards to Piraeus, Greece and Malta as a feature of Operation Excess. For this activity, her contenders were strengthened by a unit of three Fulmars from 805 Squadron. Amid the morning of 10 January, her Swordfish assaulted an Italian guard without critical impact. Later that morning three of the five Fulmars on Combat Air Patrol (CAP) connected with three SM.79s at low height, guaranteeing one shot down. One Fulmar was harmed and compelled to come back to the transporter, while the other two depleted their ammo and fuel amid the battle and arrived at Hal Far landing strip on Malta. The rest of the pair drew in a couple of torpedo-conveying SM.79s, harming one seriously enough that it smashed after landing. They were low on ammo and out of position, as they pursued the Italian air ship over from "Distinguished". The transporter propelled four substitutions at 12:35, exactly when 24Ã¢ÂÂ 36 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka plunge planes of the First Group/Dive Bomber Wing 1 (I. Gruppe/Sturzkampfgeschwader (StG) 1) and the Second Group/Dive Bomber Wing 2 (II. Gruppe/StG 2) started their assault, driven by Paul-Werner Hozzel. Another pair were endeavoring to take off when the primary bomb struck simply forward of the toward the back lift, obliterating the Fulmar whose motor had neglected to begin and exploding high in the lift well; the other air ship took off and connected with the Stukas as they hauled out of their jump.
