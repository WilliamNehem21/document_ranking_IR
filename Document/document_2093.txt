Continuing for New South Wales in 1952Ã¢ÂÂ 53, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in the last match before the start of the Test arrangement against South Africa. By and by, the selectors ignored him for the principal Test and in the accompanying state coordinate, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, Barnes offered to go about as twelfth man to give a chance to a more youthful player, Ray Flockton. Amid a beverages break on the second day of the match, he showed up on the ground in formal attire, (instead of 'whites') conveying pointless things, for example, stogies, frosted towels, a mirror and brush, a radio and a garments brush. The group at first reacted well to the joke, yet their mind-set soured when the interim reached out past its planned time and Barnes got analysis for postponing the diversion. The South Australian group, captained by Australian selector Phil Ridings, formally whined to the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express lament over the occurrence. Regardless of the affiliation's help for Barnes amid his issues of the past season, he evaded the truth. In the long run, the NSWCA sent a composed statement of regret for his benefit.
