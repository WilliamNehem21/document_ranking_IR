The reason for this war is questionable. There is a section in Bede's "Ministerial History" that proposes Aethelhere of East Anglia was the reason for the war. Then again, it has been contended that an issue of accentuation in later compositions confounded Bede's importance on this point, and that he in reality intended to allude to Penda as being in charge of the war. Albeit, as per Bede, Penda endured some Christian lecturing in Mercia, it has been proposed that he seen Bernician sponsorship of Christianity in Mercia and Middle Anglia as a type of "religious imperialism" that undermined his capacity, and this may have incited the war. Somewhere else the likelihood has been proposed that Penda looked to keep Oswiu from reunifying Northumbria, not needing Oswiu to reestablish the kingdom to the power it had delighted in under Edwin and Oswald. A view of the contention as far as the political circumstance among Bernicia and Deira could clarify the job of Aethelwald of Deira in the war, since Aethelwald was the child of Oswald and might not conventionally be relied upon to align with the individuals who had executed his dad. Maybe, as the child of Oswald, he looked to acquire the Bernician sovereignty for himself.
