In a top to bottom investigation of the structure "In Dreams Awake", Binkelman opines that this melody bears a solid contemporary traditional impact and that a few people may even hear strains of Philip Glass' music. He says there is an excited feel to the tune, but since Joseph keeps up total control of subtlety and shading the tune never plunges into exaggerated acting or grandiloquence. As the track advances, the state of mind and style shifts into an increasingly recognizable new age theme, with more textural synths, ringer tones and chime trees, and a progressively articulated clearing impression of stifled glory. The Glass-like theme returns for the melody's finale. Parsons describes this equivalent melody as "an idea piece that starts with an extraordinary and charming subject for cello or viola and strings. Working as it advances, it never calmly inhales until close to the finish of the topic. From that point, the piece winds up fantastic and encompassing, "drifting easily" on console sounds until the first strings reemerge, expanding to the power of the primary subject". In the meantime, Debbage notes "...the multi-developments found on the difficult 'In Dreams Awake'..." and says that it "...opens with an all-inclusive bit of strings that nearly give off an impression of being doing combating against one another, just to move into an excellent fantastic waist to by and by come back to the more tumultuous strings, much like our silly dreams".
