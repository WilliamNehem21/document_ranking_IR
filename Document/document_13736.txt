With numerous very much protected skeletons, "S. stenops" safeguards all locales of the body, including the appendages. The scapula (shoulder bone) is sub-rectangular, with a strong edge. Despite the fact that it isn't in every case flawlessly protected, the acromion edge is marginally bigger than in "Kentrosaurus". The cutting edge is generally straight, despite the fact that it bends towards the back. There is a little knock on the back of the sharp edge, that would have filled in as the base of the "triceps" muscle. Explained with the scapula, the coracoid is sub-round. The rear feet each had three short toes, while every fore foot had five toes; just the internal two toes had a dull foot. The phalangeal recipe is 2-2-2-2-1, which means the deepest finger of the fore appendage has two bones, the following has two, and so on. Every one of the four appendages were upheld by cushions behind the toes. The fore appendages were a lot shorter than the stocky rear appendages, which brought about a surprising stance. The tail seems to have been held well clear of the ground, while the head of "Stegosaurus" was situated moderately down and out, presumably no higher than over the ground.
