Rather than coming back to battle after his leave, Ball was presented on instructional obligations with No.ÃÂ 34 (Reserve) Squadron RFC, based at Orford Ness, Suffolk. About this time he was questioned by flying educator Philip Gribble, who was accused of finding the strategies of expert military pilots; Gribble chose Ball worked on "foremost valor and a touch of karma". Ball asked Gribble to give him a chance to attempt a Bristol Scout, which he landed gravely, genuinely harming the undercarriage; Ball requested another machine to attempt once more, with a similar outcome, after which he reassured himself by eating "seven pounds of chocolate". It was while serving on the home front that he had the capacity to campaign for the structure and testing of the Austin-Ball A.F.B.1 warrior. He planned to have the capacity to take a case of the sort to France with him, however the model was not finished until after his demise in real life. In November he was welcome to test fly the model of the new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 single-situate scout, clearly the principal administration pilot to do as such. He was neutral, finding the heavier, progressively stable warrior less receptive to the controls than the Nieuports he was utilized to. His negative appraisal of different parts of the S.E's. execution, then again, stood out uniquely from the responses of individual pilots who tried the model about this time. Ball was to keep up his supposition of the S.E. as a "failure", in any event until he had scored a few triumphs on the sort after his arrival to France.
