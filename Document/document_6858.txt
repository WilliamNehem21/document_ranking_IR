In a May 7, 1918, letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia portrayed a snapshot of bliss regardless of her misery and depression and stress for the debilitated Alexei: "We played on the swing, that was the point at which I thundered with giggling, the fall was so great! For sure! I educated the sisters concerning it so often yesterday that they got very tired, yet I could continue disclosing to it masses of timesÃÂ ... What climate we've had! One could essentially yell with euphoria." In his diaries, one of the gatekeepers at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, recollected Anastasia as "all around agreeable and loaded with fun", while another watchman said Anastasia was "an exceptionally enchanting fallen angel! She was fiendish and, I think, once in a while tired. She was vivacious, and was attached to performing comic pantomimes with the canines, as if they were performing in a carnival." Yet one more of the watchmen, be that as it may, called the most youthful stupendous duchess "hostile and a fear monger" and whined that her at times provocative remarks here and there caused pressure in the positions. Anastasia and her sisters helped their servant darn tights and helped the cook in making bread and other kitchen tasks while they were in imprisonment at the Ipatiev House.
