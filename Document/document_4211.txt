A portion of Shakespeare's plays were distributed in quarto versions, starting in 1594, and by 1598, his name had turned into an offering point and started to show up on the cover sheets. Shakespeare kept on acting in his own and different plays after his prosperity as a writer. The 1616 release of Ben Jonson's "Works" names him on the cast records for "Each Man in His Humor" (1598) and "Sejanus His Fall" (1603). The nonappearance of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's "Volpone" is taken by certain researchers as a sign that his acting vocation was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623, in any case, records Shakespeare as one of "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first organized after "Volpone", in spite of the fact that we can't know for certain which jobs he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford composed that "positive attitude" played "royal" jobs. In 1709, Rowe go down a custom that Shakespeare played the apparition of Hamlet's dad. Later customs keep up that he additionally played Adam in "As You Like It", and the Chorus in "Henry V", however researchers question the wellsprings of that data.
