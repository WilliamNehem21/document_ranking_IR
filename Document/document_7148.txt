The last arrangement, displayed on the Nancy Drew Notebooks, was gone for a more youthful gathering of people, and kept running from 1997 to 2000. Conversely, the "Casefiles", started 10 years sooner in 1987, was gone for a more established gathering of people than the "Solid Boys Mystery Stories". In the new arrangement, the Hardys' work with a mystery government association just called the "System", with which they team up to "penetrate sorted out wrongdoing, fight fear based oppressors and track down professional killers around the globe." The Hardys' identities are depicted as increasingly independent and particular, and they once in a while battle; in the first of the arrangement, "Dead on Target", for instance, the siblings fight after Frank attempts to limit Joe after Joe's better half, Iola Morton, is murdered by a vehicle bomb. When all is said in done, the arrangement is increasingly savage, and the Hardy Boys convey different firearms; Lines like "Joe! Give me the Uzi!" are not bizarre.

I was told the accentuation was on high activity and tension and there must be a precipice holder completion of each section."
