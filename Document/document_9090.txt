Different logicians and authors distinguished as impacts incorporate Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gilles Deleuze, Ray Brassier, Emil Cioran, and Eugene Thacker. Mathijs Peters, in a piece for "Film International", contended that "Genuine Detective" tests Schopenhauerian rationality through its way to deal with independence, forbearance, the fight among dim and light, etc. Ben Woodard noticed the show's advancing rationality, which looks at a setting where culture, religion, and society are immediate side-effects of natural shortcoming. Woodward expressed, "Organic programming gets recovered and socially redistributed dreams, beliefs, and acidic identities steer of unsure finishes making an existence where 'individuals leave'." Even the setting, Fintan Neylan contended, accentuates a world "where the frailty of human requesting can't be shrouded." He expressed, "This isn't where trust fled; it is where expectation would never flourish. It is with these individuals and environs that the genuine ghastliness is sourced." Yet Neylan saw that Cohle's activities are not inspired by cynicism, rather a drive to challenge "the individuals who attempt to either mask or control this fragility of people for their own advantage." And in doing as such, Cohle at last defies "a whole philosophical history which has accepted its assignment as that of clearing delicacy away." Christopher Orr at "The Atlantic" said "Genuine Detective" was "Fincherian in the best sense", a combination of "Se7en" (1995) and "Zodiac" (2007), on account of its topic, smooth cinematography, and "distinctive, agitating" atmosphere.
