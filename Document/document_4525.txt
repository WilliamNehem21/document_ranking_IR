At the point when Lester is discovered jerking off via Carolyn, his furious answer about their absence of closeness is the first occasion when he says out loud what he ponders her. By going up against the issue and Carolyn's "shallow interests in others", Lester is endeavoring to "recover a voice in a home that [only respects] the voices of mother and girl". His last defining moment comes when Angela and he nearly engage in sexual relations; after she admits her virginity, he never again thinks about her as a sex object, yet as a girl. He holds her nearby and "wraps her up". Mendes called it "the most fulfilling end to [Lester's] venture there could have been". With these last scenes, Mendes planned to demonstrate Lester at the determination of a "legendary journey". After Lester gets a brew from the cooler, the camera pushes toward him, at that point quits confronting a lobby down which he strolls "to meet his destiny". Having started to behave once more, Lester accomplishes conclusion. As he grins at a family photograph, the camera container gradually from Lester to the kitchen divider, onto which blood splashes as a shot rings out; the moderate dish mirrors the tranquility of Lester's passing. His body is found by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's gazing into Lester's dead eyes is "the finish of the topic" of the film: that magnificence is discovered where it is least anticipated.
