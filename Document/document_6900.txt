From 1970 to 1973, much enactment went through the South Australian Parliament. Laborers saw increments in welfare, drinking laws were additionally changed, an Ombudsman was made, control was changed, safety belts were made compulsory, the training framework was upgraded, and the open administration was continuously expanded (multiplying in size amid the Dunstan time). Adelaide's water supply was fluoridated in 1971 and the time of lion's share was brought from 21 down to 18. A Commissioner of Consumer Affairs was made, a bad mark point framework was acquainted with punish poor driving practices trying to cut the street toll, and pay for specialists was improved. Police self-governance and forces were confined after a rally contrary to the Vietnam War, which was separated by police, in spite of the fact that Dunstan had needed the demonstrators to have the capacity to shut down off the road. An imperial commission was called into the police magistrate's dismissal for Dunstan's requests, and brought about enactment giving the administration more power over the police; the chief at that point resigned. The clothing standard for the Parliament was loose amid this period, the formal attire was never again observed as compulsory, and Dunstan himself caused media free for all when he touched base at Parliament House in 1972 wearing pink shorts that finished over his knees. After his takeoff from open life he conceded that his style explanation may have gone past the cutoff points. All things considered, his design sense brought about his being casted a ballot "the hottest political pioneer in Australia" by "Lady's Day" in 1975, and the picture of Dunstan in the shorts stays famous.
