The lighthearted comedy "America's Sweethearts" was Zeta-Jones' sole film task of 2001. She featured as a keen motion picture star, inverse Julia Roberts who included as her character's under-sure kin. The commentator Roger Ebert contrasted the film negatively with the melodic "Singin' in the Rain" (1952), yet believed that Zeta-Jones was appropriately "crisp and manipulative" in her part. The next year, Zeta-Jones featured nearby RenÃÂ©e Zellweger as the deadly dance club artist Velma Kelly in "Chicago" (2002), a movie adjustment of the Broadway melodic of a similar name from the executive Rob Marshall. She based her character's look and quirks on the performing artist Louise Brooks, and as the content did not give a backstory to Kelly, she attempted to pass on her character's "colorfulness" and "urgency" through "little looks and subtleties". The film and her execution got basic recognition. William Arnold of the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" felt that the performing artist made "a superbly statuesque and disagreeable cantina goddess", and David Edelstein of "Slate" magazine composed that she has "a seething certainty that takes your brain off her not-constantly liquid dancingalthough she's an impeccably fine hoofer, with great appendages and a telling cleavage" and especially commended her version of the tune "Such Jazz". "Chicago" earned around the world, and was the beneficiary of the Academy Award for Best Picture. For her execution, Zeta-Jones won the Academy Award, SAG Award, and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress, among different honors and selections.
