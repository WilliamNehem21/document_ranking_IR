There remained the issue of collaboration between the Manhattan's Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick squeezed for assets to fabricate an atomic reactor at what is presently known as the Chalk River Laboratories. England and Canada consented to pay the expense of this venture, however the United States needed to supply the substantial water. Around then, the United States controlled, by a supply contract, the main real creation site on the landmass, that of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company at Trail, British Columbia. Given that it was probably not going to have any effect on the war, Conant specifically was cool about the proposition, however substantial water reactors were of incredible intrigue. Forests was happy to help the exertion and supply the overwhelming water required, however with specific confinements. The Montreal Laboratory would approach information from the examination reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, yet not from the creation reactors at the Hanford Site; nor would they be given any data about plutonium. This course of action was formally affirmed by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. The Canadian ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor went basic on 5 September 1945.
