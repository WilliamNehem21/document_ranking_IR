Florida State got the post-score kickoff simply expecting to rundown the clock to verify its lead and the success. TwoÃÂ complete leaves set behind a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, yet his third-down pass missed the mark, ceasing the clock and driving a Florida State punt. One moment and a half had kept running off the clock, and Virginia Tech recouped the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State submitted a pass obstruction punishment that gave Virginia Tech 15ÃÂ automatic yards and a first down. As in the past drive, the extra shot began the Virginia Tech offense. On the following play, Vick associated with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard passÃ¢ÂÂthe longest hostile play of the diversionÃ¢ÂÂthat drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. From that point onward, a Florida State holding punishment gave Virginia Tech a first-and-objective from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick mixed fourÃÂ yards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was currently sliced to 11ÃÂ points. The drive had taken quite recently 55ÃÂ seconds off the clock, and it gave the idea that Virginia Tech still got an opportunity to make it a nearby amusement. As previously, Virginia Tech endeavored a two-point change, and as previously, it fizzled. With 10:50 staying in the diversion, the score was currently Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.
