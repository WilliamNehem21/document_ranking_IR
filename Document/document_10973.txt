Stops were set up inland as opposed to in the region of the port on the grounds that the Japanese compromised an arrival on the coast. A speed limit was forced to limit harm to the fundamental street. This was secured with of residue that swung to mud when it sprinkled. The surface before long separated under substantial military traffic. The street was just sufficiently wide to take into consideration single direction traffic and had various barrette twists that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The tenth Advanced Ordnance Depot was set up at 17 Mile in pre-assembled hovels, raised by Papuan work, while the eighth Advanced Ammunition Depot dealt with the ammo stations at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the emergency long periods of mid 1942 some of ammo was dumped where it was emptied off the trucks and secured with coverings, with just a single storeman available to get it. Before long, nobody realized what lay under the canvases. This was difficult to amend as there was an intense lack of weapons work force because of the low need agreed to support units. The 19 Mile site was poor and another stop was created on a superior site at 12 Mile.
