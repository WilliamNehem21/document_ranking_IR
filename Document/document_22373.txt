The game began production alongside the company's second project, "", and remained in development after that game's 1993 release. It then continued through the creation of their titles "System Shock" (released in 1994) and "Flight Unlimited". The game was subject to numerous delays, which Schmidt later attributed to its lack of a set deadline. He stated that the team was "trying to go with the same philosophy" as the company's earlier games, in that they would "develop the systems and the game would come out of it". However, the team's development priorities regularly changed, and the programmer who led the project left several years into production. According to Schmidt, his departure meant that "there was no-one left who was psyched about making this really [realistic] simulation". Despite this fact, the team continued using the idea, even though serious difficulties were involved in achieving it. Schmidt said that the game's development status was uncertain after the programmer left, and that he inherited the role of lead programmer around that time merely because the position had to be filled. He later assumed the role of project leader. In January 1995, Looking Glass showed "Terra Nova" alongside "Flight Unlimited" at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, under their "Immersive Reality" marketing label.
