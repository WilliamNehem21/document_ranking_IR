"Surprising" was distributed in mash group until the January 1942 issue, when it changed to bedsheet. It returned to mash for six issues, beginning in May 1943, and afterward turned into the first of the class sf magazines to be distributed in condensation design, starting with the November 1943 issue. The arrangement stayed unaltered until CondÃÂ© Nast delivered 25 bedsheet issues of "Simple" between March 1963 and March 1965, after which it came back to process group. In May 1998, and again in December 2008, the organization was changed to be marginally bigger than the typical condensation measure: first to 8.25 x 5.25 in (210 x 135ÃÂ mm), and afterward to 8.5 x 5.75 in (217 x 148ÃÂ mm). The magazine was initially titled "Surprising Stories of Super-Science"; this was abbreviated to "Shocking Stories" from February 1931 to November 1932, and the more extended title returned for the three Clayton issues toward the beginning of 1933. The Street and Smith issues started as "Bewildering Stories", and changed to "Amazing Science-Fiction" in March 1938. The hyphen vanished in November 1946, and the title at that point stayed unaltered until 1960, when the title "Simple Science Fact and Fiction" was staged in the middle of February and October (i.e., the words "Surprising" and "Simple" both showed up on the spread, with "Simple" continuously expanding in unmistakable quality throughout the months, coming full circle in the name "Shocking" being totally dropped.) In April 1965 the caption was turned around, so the magazine moved toward becoming "Simple Science Fiction and Fact", and it has stayed unaltered from that point forward, however it has experienced a few elaborate and orthographic varieties.
