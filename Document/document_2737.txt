As yet educating in England following the finish of the war, Cobby was picked to lead the AFC's Anzac Day flypast over London before the Prince of Wales on 25ÃÂ April 1919, working together with a motorcade by Australian fighters. By 2:30 toward the evening, he was taking his 50-in number aeronautical arrangement through a progression of wild tricks over the frightened Prince's head, and later recounted to the story that he flew so near the walking warriors that their pikes nearly pierced his undercarriage. Cobby later said this was: "presumably the most stupid thing I have ever done". He came back to Australia in May 1919, and wedded Hilda Maude Urban in Caulfield, Victoria, on 24ÃÂ April 1920; the couple had a child and a little girl. Following the disbandment of the AFC, Cobby joined the recently framed Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. Positioned flying officer (privileged flight lieutenant), he was one of the first 21 officers reporting in real time power's quality at its development that March. His first posting, alongside a large portion of his associates, was to a blended squadron outfitted basically with S.E.5s and DH.9s at No.ÃÂ 1 Flying Training School, based at RAAF Point Cook. Flight Lieutenant Cobby ended up Commanding Officer (CO) of No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron when it was transformed at Point Cook on 1ÃÂ July 1925, serving in the situation until August 1926.
