On 19ÃÂ January Rewa began to influence Queensland with heavy downpour and tempest compel windspeeds which caused some harm along the coast. Anyway it didn't make its anticipated landfall close Mackay, rather it recurved toward the south-southeast and came to inside 100ÃÂ km (60ÃÂ mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were safeguarded from an angling trawler by a military Black Hawk helicopter after high oceans harmed the trawler's propeller and snapped its overwhelming grapple chain, abandoning it floating weakly in the violent wind's way. The most exceedingly terrible influenced island was Lady Elliot as it endured the worst part of the breeze, while on Heron Island, a few uncommon trees and winged creature rookeries were either decimated or seriously harmed. As Rewa communicated with an upper trough of low weight on 19ÃÂ January, substantial precipitation and rainstorms were seen in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane got over 144ÃÂ mm (5.7ÃÂ in) in only six hours, which prompted some limited glimmer flooding in parts of the city and four passings. Three of the passings were from individuals smashing their autos, while the other demise happened when an individual went surfing Brisbane's rising water and got caught in a tempest channel. Inside Brisbane, 20ÃÂ cars were harmed by the rising waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket coordinate between Western Australia and Queensland was deferred, after the Gabba took after a little lake.
