The Royal Commission gave its discoveries and proposals to the legislature in August 1913. It reasoned that global relations were falling apart in the Pacific and there was an expanded danger of the NEI getting to be engaged with a war among western and Asian forces. Therefore, the Commission contended that the Netherlands should build up an amazing armada of warships to implement Dutch lack of bias and offer a valid protection should any country assault the NEI or the nation of origin itself. The Commission was quite certain in its call for nine battleships, expressing that they ought to be boats of , having a speed of , and mounting eight firearms, sixteen , and twelve weapons. It was likewise prescribed that the armada incorporate six "torpedo cruisers"Ã¢ÂÂ accepted by "Conways" to be nearer to huge destroyersÃ¢ÂÂeight destroyers (a job which would be filled by the "Fuss" class), eight torpedo water crafts (additionally effectively finished, however they were old), eight expansive submarines and two substantial minelayers. This eager arrangement was evaluated to cost almost ÃÂ17,000,000 every year for the following 35 (until 1949), signifying about ÃÂ595,000,000; this would triple the Navy's financial plan. The Commission prescribed that the expense of the armada be somewhat counterbalanced by lessening the span of the ""Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger"" (Royal Dutch East Indies Army) as the Navy would give a more grounded barrier from assault than the Army could.
