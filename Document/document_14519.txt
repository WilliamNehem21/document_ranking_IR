In spite of the melody's business achievement, "We Are the World" got blended surveys from columnists, music pundits and the open after its discharge. American writer Greil Marcus felt that the tune seemed like a Pepsi jingle. He composed, "... the steady redundancy of 'There's a decision we're making' conflates with Pepsi's trademarked 'The decision of another age' in a path that, with respect to Pepsi-contracted musicians Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is positively not purposeful, and much more unquestionably past the domain of luck." Marcus included, "In the domain of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less regarding Ethiopia than it does about PepsiÃ¢ÂÂand the genuine outcome will probably be less that specific Ethiopian people will live, or in any case live somewhat longer than they generally would have, than that Pepsi will get the catchphrase of its promoting effort sung for nothing by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest." Professor and dissident Reebee Garofalo concurred, and communicated the assessment that the line "We're sparing our very own lives" was a "disagreeable component of guilty pleasure". He affirmed that the craftsmen of USA for Africa were broadcasting "their very own salvation for singing around an issue they will never involvement in the interest of a people a large portion of them will never experience".
