In August 2007, Congolese understudy Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo documented a grievance in Brussels, guaranteeing that the book was an affront to the Congolese individuals and required prohibiting. Open examiners explored and started a criminal case. The issue was in the end exchanged to a common court in April 2010. Mondondo's legal counselors contended that "Tintin in the Congo" added up to "an avocation of colonization and of racial oppression", and Mondondo called it "supremacist and xenophobic". Alain Berenboom, attorney for both Moulinsart, the organization which controls HergÃÂ©'s domain, and Casterman, the book's distributer, contended that the visual artist's portrayal of the Congolese "wasn't bigotry yet kind paternalism". He said that restricting it would set a risky point of reference for the accessibility of works by other verifiable creators, for example, Charles Dickens or Jules Verne, which contain comparative generalizations of non-white ethnicities. The court decided in February 2012 that the book would not be restricted, concluding that it was "obvious that neither the story, nor the way that it has been put on special, has an objective toÃÂ ... make a scary, threatening, corrupting, or mortifying condition", and that it in this way did not infringe upon Belgian law. Belgium's Center for Equal Opportunities cautioned against "over-response and hyper political accuracy".
