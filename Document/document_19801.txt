Stoke won automatic promotion to the Premier League on the final day of the 2007â08 season, finishing in 2nd place in the Championship. On 18 July 2008, the club broke their transfer record to purchase striker Dave Kitson for Â£5.5 million from Reading. A 3â1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2008â09 season saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties. The following weekend, the Britannia Stadium hosted its first ever top-flight game, against Aston Villa, with a home win courtesy of Mamady Sidibe's injury-time goal from a Rory Delap throw-in, giving Stoke City their first ever Premier League points. The club went on to record a 12th-place finish in their first season back in the Premier League. A much cited aspect of the team's style of play has been the utilisation of Rory Delap's long throw to create goal-scoring opportunities. Pulis signed Robert Huth and Tuncay ÅanlÄ± from Middlesbrough for a combined fee in the region of Â£10 million, in a bid to establish the club in the Premier League prior to the 2009â10 season. This feat was achieved comfortably as the club finished in 11th place, thereby securing a third season in the Premier League. Pulis bolstered his squad for 2010â11 season with the club record Â£8 million signing of Kenwyne Jones.
