On 18 July 1944, "ReichsfÃ¼hrer"-SS Heinrich Himmler ordered that the battalion be expanded to divisional size, although the authorised strength was only 6,600 troops. The 24th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "KarstjÃ¤ger" was to be established by the Higher SS and Police Leader () for the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, SS-"GruppenfÃ¼hrer" (Major General) Odilo Globocnik. The name "KarstjÃ¤ger" was derived from a combination of "Karst", denoting the region of operations, and "JÃ¤ger", the German military term for light infantry. The division was to consist of two "GebirgsjÃ¤ger" (mountain infantry) regiments, with an artillery regiment, reconnaissance, "PanzerjÃ¤ger" (anti-tank) and pioneer battalions, as well as replacement and supply troops. The division was supplied with 14 captured Italian Carro Armato P 40 tanks, but these proved unreliable, with only half being serviceable at any one time. In August 1944, the under-strength division participated in Operation "Dachstein" under the command of the 188th Mountain Division. Between August and November 1944, the division continued performing anti-partisan duties in the same region, but its strength had only reached 3,000, less than half of its authorised establishment. It proved impossible to recruit sufficient troops for the division, and in December 1944 the division was downgraded to a brigade.
