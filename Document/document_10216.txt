USÃÂ 113ÃÂ Business starts at a crossing point with USÃÂ 113 (Worcester Highway) south of Snow Hill. The business course travels upper east as two-path Market Street into as far as possible and to the downtown territory. USÃÂ 113ÃÂ Business goes close to the neoclassical home Chanceford and by the Julia A. Purnell Museum, which shows the history and memorability of Snow Hill, including the namesake's embroidery. The course passes the Georgian-style Samuel Gunn House and All Hallows Episcopal Church, a case of eighteenth century church vernacular engineering, on either side of its intersection with MDÃÂ 12 (Church Street). MDÃÂ 12 joins USÃÂ 113ÃÂ Business for a short simultaneousness through downtown Snow Hill, amid which the two expressways pass the Worcester County Courthouse and Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church, an Isaac PursellÃ¢ÂÂ planned High Victorian Gothic church regarding Francis Makemie, the originator of Presbyterianism in the United States. After MDÃÂ 12 turns north onto Washington Street, the business course passes the Gothic RevivalÃ¢ÂÂ style George Washington Purnell House and meets the west end of MDÃÂ 365 (Bay Street) at the east end of downtown Snow Hill. USÃÂ 113ÃÂ Business crosses Purnell Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the town furthest reaches of Snow Hill only west of its northern end at USÃÂ 113.
