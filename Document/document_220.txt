The group hues are red, high contrast, and they can be seen on both the home and street shirts. The home shirt, which was the group's street pullover until the NHL swapped home and street hues in 2003, is predominantly red in shading. There are three high contrast stripes, one over each arm and one over the midsection. The street shirt (the group's previous home pullover) is white in shading with a comparable structure, then again, actually the three stripes are dark and red. The shoulders are hung with dark on the two garbs. Prior to the 1992Ã¢ÂÂ 93 season, the garbs were green and red with somewhat unique striping, driving a few fans to lovingly allude to them as "Christmas hues." The Devils still can't seem to present a third pullover and are one of just two NHL groups (Detroit is the other) never to have worn one. Lamoriello had expressed that he didn't ever plan to present a third pullover for the Devils, saying, "I don't trust in it", Lamoriello said. "I emphatically trust that you must have one way of life as a group. We need to make an inclination that our home and away pullovers are unique and that it implies something exceptional to wear one." Unlike most groups, the Devils kept a similar uniform structure when the NHL changed to the shirts by Reebok for the 2007Ã¢ÂÂ 08 season.
