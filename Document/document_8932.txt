Structure 7 is a vast stage situated toward the east of the square on TerraceÃÂ 3 in the Central Group and is considered to have been a standout amongst the most sacrosanct structures at Takalik Abaj because of a progression of essential finds related with it. StructureÃÂ 7 measures and dates to the Middle Preclassic, despite the fact that it didn't achieve its last structure until the last piece of the Late Preclassic. Based upon the northern piece of StructureÃÂ 7 are two littler structures, assigned as StructuresÃÂ 7A and 7B. In the Late Classic, Structures 7, 7A and 7B were altogether refaced with stone. StructureÃÂ 7 underpins three columns of landmarks adjusted northÃ¢ÂÂ south that may have filled in as a galactic observatory. One of these columns was lined up with the star grouping Ursa Major in the Middle Preclassic, another lined up with Draco in the Late Preclassic, while the center line was lined up with StructureÃÂ 7A. Another vital find in StructureÃÂ 7 was a Late Classic round and hollow incensario given the name "La NiÃÂ±a" by archeologists because of its conspicuous female appliquÃÂ© figure. It dates to the soonest dimensions of K'iche' control of the site and is high and wide at the base. It was discovered together with an extensive amount of different contributions including further earthenware production and pieces of broken models.
