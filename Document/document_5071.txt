At an obscure point before 1811, the first altarpiece was broken into something like three pieces, conceivably because of harm, in spite of the fact that "The Magdalen" section is in great condition. The dark overpaint was likely included after the mid seventeenth century when Netherlandish painting had tumbled from support and was unfashionable. Campbell trusts that after the expulsion of the foundation detail "it looked adequately like a sort piece to hang in a notable accumulation of Dutch seventeenth-century artistic creations". From the measure of three enduring boards in connection to the illustration, it is assessed that the first was at any rate 1ÃÂ m high by 1.5ÃÂ m wide; the priest and the Magdalene appear to obviously stamp the level limits, yet the degree of the image above and underneath the enduring components and the illustration can't be judged. Such a size is equivalent with littler altarpieces of the period. The foundation was overpainted with a thick layer of dark/brown color until it was cleaned in 1955; it was simply after the layer's evacuation that it was connected to the chest area and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in stock until 1907, when they show up in the gathering of LÃÂ©o Lardus in Suresnes, France.
