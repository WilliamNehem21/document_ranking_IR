On a stormy night, Nina lets herself in to a University of Cambridge room, where she is found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, but it is not loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the rooms of Squiresâa classicist who sets crosswords for "Varsity" as "the Sphinx"âto seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: "I teach wild creature without hospital building" results in "ARCHITECTURE", which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was, he says, "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered "DOWNANDOUT" and "WRAP"; Squires answers "DESI" and helps with "TRENT". Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; her excuse is that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce "SWAMPLANDS", meaning "bog". Nina, though, suggests that it should be "bogs", otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She now displays clear proficiency, answering "ASPHYXIATION".
