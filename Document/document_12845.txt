This left the SLA and the coalition of volunteer army gatheringsÃ¢ÂÂwhich wound up known as the "Unholy Alliance", and was coordinated by a "Joint Military Committee"Ã¢ÂÂ the main powers fit for going up against the RUF. The SLA had been incapacitated through the UN's DDR procedure; to rebuild it and enable it to re-arm, the UN lifted its arms ban on Sierra Leone, and the British powers started exhorting and preparing the SLA. A global group had been wanted to send to Sierra Leone to help the SLA with longer-term advancement and vote based responsibility, and a British Short-Term Training Team (STTT) conveyed at the same time to improve the SLA's infantry aptitudes. The STTT mission was codenamed Operation Basilica and based at the Benguema Training Center, a relinquished garisson huts close Waterloo that had been repaired for the reason. The main unit to take on the job was based around second Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment, and involved roughly 250 staff, including 45 educators and a power insurance organization. The Anglians touched base at Benguema on 15 June to prepare 1,000 SLA initiates, and the ARG pulled back. The preparation at Benguema included guidance on the Geneva Convention, unit cohesiveness, and different abilities and learning to incorporate the SLA with an expert armed force.
