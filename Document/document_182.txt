On 5 June, the principle part of the regiment was joined with two organizations of infantry and a squadron of tanks to shape Wilder Force, which was to assume control over the front from the fifth New Zealand Infantry Brigade. A Squadron pushed up the valley and Wilder Force progressed behind, through Balsorano. After the Axis withdrew to their next line of barrier, the New Zealand Division pulled back to Arce for preparing. The regiment pushed ahead again on 10 July, progressing to Cortona on 11Ã¢ÂÂ 12 July. BÃÂ Squadron was exchanged to sixth New Zealand Infantry Brigade and sent forward to Castiglion Fiorentino to clear the street among Castiglion and Palazzo del Pero. The street was opened by the sixth Armored Division, and the intersection on Route 73 was come to on 15 July. The New Zealand Division moved to catch Florence; the regiment propelled west to Siena and after that swung north to Castellina. A Squadron upheld the 23rd and 28th Battalions progressing on San Casciano and the rest of the regiment touched base at San Donato by 22 July. After two days, C Squadron joined with A Squadron of the nineteenth Armored Brigade, No. 2 Company of the 22nd Battalion and first Troop of the 31st Anti-tank Battery to frame "Armcav". The power progressed on 25 July, taking Fabbrica and progressing toward Bibbione. Bibbione was taken in spite of decided restriction the following day and the other two squadrons bolstered the Maori Battalion. "Armcav" was disbanded on 27 July and C Squadron stayed under the order of the fourth Armored Brigade.
