The number of inhabitants in dim parrots portrayed from the island of RÃÂ©union (alluded to as "Psittacula" cf. "bensoni" by Hume) is thought to have been conspecific with that on Mauritius. Until subfossils of "P. bensoni" are found on RÃÂ©union, it can't be affirmed whether the dim parrots of the two islands had a place with similar animal varieties. During the 1860s, French naturalists Charles Coquerel and Auguste Vinson recommended these could have been parrots of the sort "Coracopsis", however fossils of neither that variety nor "Psittacula" have ever been found on RÃÂ©union. While "Coracopsis" parrots are known to have been acquainted with that island during the 1700s, a populace did not wind up set up. While no live or dead Mascarene dim parakeets are known with assurance to have been traded, Hume has recommended that a darker parrot exampleÃ¢ÂÂonce housed in Cabinet du Roi however at this point lostÃ¢ÂÂmay have been a stained old Mascarene dim parakeet, or maybe a lesser vasa parrot ("Coracopsis nigra"). This example was depicted by French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779. Cheke and Hume recommended in 2008 that Mascarene dark parakeets did not achieve Europe since they were viewed as unremarkable or had too concentrated an eating regimen.
