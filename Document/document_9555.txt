The ocean mink was a marine well evolved creature that lived around the rough shorelines of New England and the southernmost Maritime Provinces until chased to eradication in the late nineteenth century. Most ocean mink remains are uncovered on the shoreline of Maine. Despite the fact that it is hypothesized that they at one point occupied Connecticut and Rhode Island, they were usually caught along the bank of the Bay of Fundy (in the Gulf of Maine), and it is said that they some time ago existed on the southwestern shore of Nova Scotia. There were reports of bizarrely substantial mink hides being gathered from Nova Scotia routinely. The bones of an example uncovered in Middleboro, Massachusetts, were dated to be around 4,300ÃÂ±300 years old, from salt water. The ocean mink may have achieved that zone by going up waterways, or may have been brought there by Native Americans. The last is in all probability as no other mink remains have been found between Casco Bay in Maine and southeastern Massachusetts. Ocean mink bones have been uncovered in Canada, despite the fact that these may have been conveyed there by Native Americans from the Gulf of Maine. The rough shorelines of the Down East locale of Maine may have spoken to a northernmost obstruction in their range. Mead inferred that just American minks occupied the terrain and that ocean minks were confined to islands off the coast. If so, at that point all remaining parts found on the territory were conveyed there. Graham tested that theory, expressing that it is impossible that all ocean mink examples start from one populace.
