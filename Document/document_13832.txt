"Starship Troopers" is commonly considered to advance militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Researcher Bruce Franklin alluded to it in 1980 as a "cornet blowing, drum-pounding glorification" of military administration, and composed that militarism and colonialism were the unequivocal message of the book. Sci-fi author Dean McLaughlin called it "a book-length enrolling blurb". In 1968 sci-fi pundit Alexei Panshin called "Starship Troopers" a battle ready questioning and contrasted it with an enlisting film, expressing that it "indicates to demonstrate the life of a run of the mill warrior, with a soundtrack discourse by sincere earnest Private Jones who translates what we see for us." Panshin expressed that there was no "supported human clash" in the book: rather, "Every one of the fighters we see are extreme, savvy, equipped, cleancut, clean-shaven, and respectable." Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, contended that Heinlein disregarded the truth of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid struggle existed essentially in light of the fact that, "Starship troopers are not half so wonderful sitting on their butts cleaning their weapons for the tenth time for absence of whatever else to do." Literature researcher George Slusser, in portraying the novel as "backward and retrogressive", contended that calling its belief system militarism or colonialism was insufficient, as these portrayals proposed a financial thought process. Slusser rather says that Heinlein advocates for a total "mechanical enslavement of nature", of which the Arachnids are an image, and that this oppression itself is delineated as an indication of human headway.
