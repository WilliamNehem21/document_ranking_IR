The real topic running all through McNeile's works is the First World War. Somewhere in the range of 1915 and 1918 he had five accumulations of short stories distributed about the war, while his post-war fiction can be viewed as an augmentation of those accounts, as "both treat the war as a preliminary with masculinity in question". His war stories were considered by contemporary groups of onlookers as hostile to wistful, sensible portrayals of the channels, and as a "festival of the characteristics of the Old Contemptibles". McNeile's view, as communicated through his composition, was that war was an intentional action for the country and for people, regardless of whether that reason for existing was later squandered: a "significant possibility at national recharging that had been wasted". The beneficial outcomes of war on the individual were illustrated by McNeile in "The Making of an Officer", his arrangement of articles in "The Times", in which he expounded on "the characteristics of initiative and benevolence fundamental to 'rouse' subalterns", a topic he came back to in his war storiesÃ¢ÂÂespecially "The Lieutenant and Others" and "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E"Ã¢ÂÂ and after that a short time later in his anecdotal stories, outstandingly the Bulldog Drummond works.
