Polk had been restless to build up a regional government for Oregon once the arrangement was powerful in 1846, yet the issue ended up entangled in the contentions over subjugation, however few idea Oregon reasonable for that foundation. A bill to set up an Oregon regional government passed the House in the wake of being revised to bar bondage; the bill kicked the bucket in the Senate when rivals ran out the clock on the congressional session. A restored bill, as yet excepting subjection, again passed the House in January 1847 yet it was not considered by the Senate before Congress deferred in March. When Congress met again in December, California and New Mexico were in U.S. hands, and Polk in his yearly message encouraged the foundation of regional governments in each of the three. The Missouri Compromise had settled the issue of the geographic reach of bondage inside the Louisiana Purchase regions by forbidding subjugation in states north of 36ÃÂ°30Ã¢ÂÂ² scope, and Polk tried to broaden this line into the recently procured domain. Whenever reached out to the Pacific, this would have made bondage unlawful in San Francisco, yet permitted it in Monterey and Los Angeles. An arrangement to achieve the expansion was vanquished in the House by a bipartisan collusion of Northerners. As the last congressional session before the 1848 race found some conclusion, Polk marked the solitary regional bill gone by Congress, which built up the Territory of Oregon and denied servitude in it.
