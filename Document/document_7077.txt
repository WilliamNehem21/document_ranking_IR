Kydd moved on from secondary school toward the finish of 2000, and moved to Kensington, an internal suburb of Melbourne, in February 2001 to consider the travel industry and friendliness at Victoria University. Toward the start of the 2001 season, two of the Kestrels' principle stars, Shelley O'Donnell and Janine Ilitch, both reported that they would be sidelined for most or the majority of the period in view of pregnancy, and Kydd was called upon to fill the opportunity. She turned into a center player right away, and despite the fact that the Kestrels battled, Kydd shaped a compelling blend with objective shooter Amanda Burton (who she had recently played with in the interstate challenge). Kydd was among the group's champion entertainers and was much of the time adulated in the media for both her precision and consistency, leaving without end at season's end with 390 objectives and the fifth most astounding scoring normal in the challenge. She kept on speaking to Australia in less than 21 rivalry, being chosen for a few home matches against England and a voyage through New Zealand, and was again chosen in the national open squad in the number one spot up to the 2002 Commonwealth Games, however was by and by cut from the last group.
