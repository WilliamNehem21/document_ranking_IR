The Benty Grange cap was made by covering an iron casing with horn. It most likely weighed about , the heaviness of the Weston Park Museum's 1986 copy. The system, which presently exists in sixteen consumed parts, initially comprised of seven iron strips, each somewhere in the range of 1 and 2 millimeters thick. A temples band, long and wide, surrounded the head. Two segments of a similar width kept running from front to back, and from side to side. The long nose-to-scruff band stretched out in the front and in the back; the expansion over the nose was straight, though the augmentation at the back was bended inwards, in order to fit the scruff of the wearer. The horizontal band kept running from ear to ear; the two closures are severed somewhat underneath the temples band, however it would have expanded further as a component of a cheek or ear security. It was joined to the outside of the dexter (wearer's correct) side of the temples band, within the evil (wearer's left) side, and the outside of the nose-to-scruff band. The four quadrants made by this arrangement were each subdivided by a smaller backup segment of iron, just a single currently endures. Every backup strip was joined to the outside of the forehead band from the focal point of the parallel band. Here they were wide, and, while decreasing towards a width of , ascended at a 70ÃÂ° point towards the horizontal band, which they covered at a 50ÃÂ° edge just underneath the peak. Within the protective cap was no doubt initially fixed with calfskin or material, since rotted.
