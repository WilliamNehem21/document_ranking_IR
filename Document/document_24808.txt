The plans for Hawkwood's commemoration were modified on December 2, 1395, when it was decided to also rework the wooden monument of Pietro Farnese, the hero of the Pisan war, and to place marble tomb monuments to Farnese and Hawkwood on the north aisle, facing the high altar. Painters Agnolo Gaddi and Giuliano Arrighi were selected by a committee to sketch directly onto the Duomo wall models for the Hawkwood and Farnese tombs. Although neither tomb was realized, documentary evidence suggests that a painting of Hawkwoodâwith a figure of Hawkwood by Gaddi and a sarcophagus by Peselloâwas completed by June 16, 1396. Historian Frances Stonor Saunders speculates that Uccello may have based his representation of Hawkwood on this early painting and that the earlier painting may have been based on a death mask of Hawkwood. The Hawkwood fresco is situated in the third bay of the northern wall, today flanked by paintings of Dante (c.Â 1455) and a similar fresco monument to fellow mercenary NiccolÃ² da Tolentino (1456, by Andrea del Castagno); fictive tombs in fresco of two humanist ecclesiastsâBishop Corsini (c.Â 1422, probably by Giovanni dal Ponte) and Fra Luigi de' Marsigli (c.Â 1439 by Bicci di Lorenzo), an Augustinian monk who founded a literary academyâare much smaller than those of the two "condottieri". The fresco probably came to replace the tomb (rather than serving as a place marker for it), maybe for reasons of expedience and frugality, although there is little documentary evidence on this regard.
