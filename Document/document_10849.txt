In 80, Domitia and Domitian's solitary bore witness to child was conceived. It isn't realized what the kid's name was, however he kicked the bucket in adolescence in 83. In a matter of seconds following his increase as Emperor, Domitian gave the honorific title of "Augusta" upon Domitia, while their child was worshipped, showing up in that capacity on the turn around of coin types from this period. All things considered, the marriage seems to have confronted a noteworthy emergency in 83. For no good reason, Domitian quickly banished Domitia, and after that before long reviewed her, either out of adoration or because of bits of gossip that he was carrying on an association with his niece Julia Flavia. Jones contends that in all probability he did as such for her inability to create a beneficiary. By 84, Domitia had come back to the royal residence, where she lived for the rest of Domitian's rule without occurrence. Little is referred to of Domitia's exercises as Empress, or how much impact she used in Domitian's legislature, yet it appears her job was constrained. From Suetonius, we realize that she at any rate went with the Emperor to the amphitheater, while the Jewish essayist Josephus discusses benefits he got from her. It isn't known whether Domitian had other youngsters, however he didn't wed once more. Notwithstanding claims by Roman wellsprings of infidelity and separation, the marriage seems to have been glad.
