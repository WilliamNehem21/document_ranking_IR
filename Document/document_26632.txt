One of the most common geebungs, "Persoonia linearis" is found from the Macleay River catchment on the New South Wales Mid North Coast to the Tambo River in eastern Victoria. It is found from sea level to altitudes of with an average yearly rainfall of . It is a component of dry sclerophyll forest on both sandstone and clay soils. It grows in sunny to lightly shaded areas in open forest or woodland with a shrubby understory. In the Sydney Basin, it is associated with such trees as Sydney peppermint ("Eucalyptus piperita"), silvertop ash ("E.Â sieberi"), blue-leaved stringybark ("E.Â agglomerata"), blackbutt ("E.Â pilularis"), grey ironbark ("E.Â paniculata"), snappy gum ("E.Â rossii"), Sydney blue gum ("E.Â saligna"), narrow-leaved stringybark ("E.Â sparsifolia") and smooth-barked apple ("Angophora costata") and shrubs such as "Grevillea obtusiflora", "G.Â phylicoides", Kowmung hakea ("Hakea dohertyi"), long leaf smoke bush ("Conospermum longifolium") and stiff geebung ("Persoonia rigida"). In the vicinity of Nowra and Jervis Bay, it is an understory component of the widespread Currambene Lowlands Forest community, alongside such plants as gorse bitter pea ("Daviesia ulicifolia"), bearded heath ("Leucopogon juniperinus") and native daphne ("Pittosporum undulatum") with spotted gum ("Corymbia maculata"), white stringybark ("Eucalyptus globoidea") and woollybutt ("E.Â longifolia") as the dominant trees. The tall dry sclerophyll forest is on hilly terrain with good drainage. The underlying soil is a yellow loam originating from mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.
