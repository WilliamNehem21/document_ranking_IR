Crossing the American border, the Pigeon River Bridge is west of the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge and east of the Fort Frances-International Falls International Bridge, and is near a visitor center. HighwayÂ 61 begins at the Ontario-Minnesota border at the Pigeon River; the road continues south to Duluth as State HighwayÂ 61 on the American side. Proceeding north from the border, the route passes the customs station and curves to the north. Passing its former routing along HighwayÂ 593, the highway curves eastward to avoid mountains. It zig-zags around a range of mountains, eventually turning northward and passing to the west of Cloud Bay. The highway continues north for through Neebing, running between mountain ranges on either side. It rises at Moose Hill, meets HighwayÂ 608 and enters one of the few agricultural areas in northwestern Ontario. Shortly thereafter, HighwayÂ 61 curves to the east, passing the southern terminus of HighwayÂ 130 along the way. It then enters the outskirts of Thunder Bay.
The highway passes Chippewa Road, its former route through Thunder Bay, and returns to its northward orientation. It officially enters the city as it crosses the Kaministiquia River. The highway swerves east at Thunder Bay International Airport as it widens to four lanes then continues north, crossing Arthur Street. North of Arthur Street, the highway is also known as the Thunder Bay Expressway. It continues north for and ends at the Harbour Expressway and Trans-Canada Highway.
