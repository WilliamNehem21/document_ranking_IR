The natural product assortment of "Lactifluus volemus" has a meaty and firm top with a smooth or smooth surface and a shape that changes with development: it begins off raised, with edges bended inwards, at that point later develops level with a gloom in the center. With a common measurement of 5 to 11ÃÂ cm (2Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ in), its shading ranges from apricot to brownish. The top colouration, notwithstanding, is fairly factor, as has been noted in Asian, European, and North American examples. The stem, whose stature fluctuates somewhere in the range of 4 and 12ÃÂ cm ( and 5ÃÂ in), and which is regularly between thick, has a marginally lighter colouration than the top. It is firm, with a smooth or smooth surface that occasionally has dejections running longitudinally here and there its length. The gills are adnate to somewhat decurrent, weak, restricted, firmly separated and some of the time forked. Regularly a pale brilliant yellow shading, the gills turn dark colored when wounded. Sprinkled between the gills are lamellulae, short gills that don't stretch out to the stem. The tissue is whitish and firm. The mushroom smells to some degree fishy; one source recommends the scent is "like a dead shad, which fishermen will let you know is presumably the most rancid freshwater fish". The smell is concentrated when the organic product bodies are dried. One of the mushroom's most unmistakable highlights is the bounteous latex, so copious that a little scratch on the gills will make it "sob" the smooth substance. The latex will in general give dark colored stains on whatever it contacts.
