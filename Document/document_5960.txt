The armada attempted a heavier preparing plan for 1906 than in earlier years. The boats were busy with individual, division and squadron practices all through April. Beginning on 13 May, significant armada practices occurred in the North Sea and kept going until 8 June with a journey around the Skagen into the Baltic. The armada started its standard summer voyage to Norway in mid-July. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" and the I Squadron tied down in Molde, where they were joined on 21 July by Wilhelm II on board the steamer SS "Hamburg". The armada was available for the birthday of Norwegian lord Haakon VII on 3 August. The German boats left the next day for Helgoland to join practices being led there, landing back in Kiel by 15 August, where arrangements for the harvest time moves started. On 22Ã¢ÂÂ 24 August, the armada partook in landing practices in EckernfÃÂ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The moves were stopped from 31 August to 3 September when Kiel facilitated vessels from Denmark and Sweden, alongside a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September. The moves continued on 8 September and endured five more days. The ship partook in the uneventful winter journey into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December.
