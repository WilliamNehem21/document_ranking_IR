There were objections, notwithstanding, that the narrative did not sufficiently delineate of the political parts of the Iraqi War. Farhi stated, "The hour and a half narrative doesn't say much regarding the bigger issues confronting Iraq, yet it captures some little and enthralling human stories... They happen to live in what one kid portrays as 'the most perilous city on Earth.' You don't see a lot of Iraq's viciousness in "Baghdad High", yet you definitely feel its gravity and their fear." The "Boston Herald"s Mark Perigard said that he felt the narrative was "an individual story, not a political one". In "The New York Times", Mike Hale remarked, "While the young men talk as often as possible about viciousness and misery, they seldom examine legislative issues or ethnic contrasts (except for Anmar, the Christian) and they never legitimately address the American nearness. We do hear some parental feelings, which are shockingly nonpartisan. One mother says: 'We shouldn't censure the Americans for everything. There is some kind of problem with us as well'." Jennifer Marin, a culture feature writer from the "Los Angeles Times", composed at About.com, that while it was creative, useful and a respectable test, the recording is "undistinguished and unpleasant on the grounds that the hands holding the cameras weren't gifted and the eyes encircling the shots were not those of specialists or sharp eyewitnesses." She felt that, except for Mohammad, the young men needed allure, and that the movie neglected to catch the show of living in a battle area, because of the absence of an executive making major decisions. Perigard stated, "After the time you've contributed [as a viewer], it's not about fulfilling enough. For every one of the inquiries this interesting film raises, it should be written in sand."
