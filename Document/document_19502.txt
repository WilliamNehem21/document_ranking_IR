The Mopan population has been estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 people at the time of contact. In 1692 the Council of the Indies ordered that the Manche ChÊ¼ol and the Mopan be dealt with decisively. The population suffered the effects of war and disease, and the few survivors were moved into Spanish "reducciones" in southeastern PetÃ©n, before being moved to colonial settlements in other parts of PetÃ©n. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect the province of Guatemala with YucatÃ¡n, and soldiers commanded by Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala, conquered several ChÊ¼ol communities. The most important of these was SakbÊ¼ajlan on the LacantÃºn River in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695. This was one part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of PetÃ©n and neighbouring Chiapas; a second group joined up with Barrios Leal having marched from Huehuetenango. The third group, under Juan DÃ­az de Velasco, marched from Verapaz against the Itza. Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil who served as an advisor as well as his personal confessor and chaplain to his troops. The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers. Mercederian friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon ChÊ¼ols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring ChÊ¼ol communities.
