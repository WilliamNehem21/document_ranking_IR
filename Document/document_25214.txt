In the 1860s, subfossil foot bones and a lower jaw were found along with remains of other Mauritian animals in the Mare aux Songes swamp, and were identified as belonging to a rail by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1866. He also determined they belonged to the birds in the 17th century descriptions and illustrations. In 1869, Milne-Edwards combined the genus name of "Aphanapteryx imperialis", which had been coined the previous year by the Austrian naturalist Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld for the Hoefnagel painting, with the older specific name "broecki". Due to nomenclatural priority, the genus name was later combined with the oldest species name "bonasia", which was coined by the Belgian scientist Edmond de SÃ©lys Longchamps in 1848. SÃ©lys Longchamps had originally named the genus "Apterornis", wherein he also included the RÃ©union solitaire and the RÃ©union swamphen, but the name was preoccupied by "Aptornis", a bird described by the English biologist Richard Owen in 1844. "Aphanapteryx" means "invisible-wing", but the meaning of "bonasia" is unclear. Some early accounts refer to red rails by the vernacular names for the hazel grouse, "Tetrastes bonasia", so the name evidently originates there. The name itself perhaps refers to "bonasus", meaning "bull" in Latin, or "bonum" and "assum", meaning "good roast". It has also been suggested to be a Latin form of the French word "bonasse", meaning simple-minded or good-natured.
