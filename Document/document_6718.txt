Analyses in acclimatizing raccoons into the USSR started in 1936, and were rehashed a further multiple times until 1962. Generally speaking, 1,222 people were discharged, 64 of which originated from zoos and hide ranches (38 of them having been imports from western Europe). The rest of from a populace recently settled in Transcaucasia. The scope of Soviet raccoons was never single or nonstop, as they were regularly acquainted with various areas a long way from one another. All presentations into the Russian Far East fizzled; melanistic raccoons were discharged on Petrov Island close Vladivostok and a few regions of southern Primorsky Krai, yet kicked the bucket. In Middle Asia, raccoons were discharged in Kyrgyzstan's Jalal-Abad Province, however they were later recorded as "essentially missing" there in January 1963. An extensive and stable raccoon populace (yielding 1000Ã¢ÂÂ 1500 gets per year) was set up in Azerbaijan after a prologue to the region in 1937. Raccoons clearly endure a presentation close Terek, along the Sulak River into the Dagestani marshes. Endeavors to settle raccoons on the Kuban River's left tributary and Kabardino-Balkaria were fruitless. An effective acclimatization happened in Belarus, where three presentations (comprising of 52, 37 and 38 people in 1954 and 1958) occurred. By January 1, 1963, 700 people were recorded in the nation.
