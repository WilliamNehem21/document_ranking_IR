The eating regimen of the fossa in the wild has been examined by breaking down their particular scats, which look like dim chambers with wound finishes and measure long by thick. Scat gathered and dissected from both Andohahela and Andringitra contained lemur matter and rodents. Eastern populaces in Andringitra fuse the most extensive recorded assortment of prey, including the two vertebrates and spineless creatures. Vertebrates devoured extended from reptiles to a wide assortment of winged creatures, including both understory and ground fowls, and warm blooded animals, including insectivores, rodents, and lemurs. Spineless creatures eaten by the fossa in the high mountain zone of Andringitra incorporate bugs and crabs. One investigation found that vertebrates included 94% of the eating routine of fossas, with lemurs involving over half, trailed by tenrecs (9%), reptiles (9%), and winged animals (2%). Seeds, which involved 5% of the eating routine, may have been in the stomachs of the lemurs eaten, or may have been overwhelmed by natural product taken for water, as seeds were increasingly basic in the stomach in the dry season. The normal prey measure changes geologically; it is just in the high heaps of Andringitra, rather than in sticky timberlands and over in dry deciduous backwoods. In an investigation of fossa diet in the dry deciduous backwoods of western Madagascar, over 90% of prey things were vertebrates, and over half were lemurs. The essential eating regimen comprised of around six lemur species and a few barbed tenrec animal groups, alongside snakes and little warm blooded creatures. For the most part, the fossa preys upon bigger lemurs and rodents in inclination to littler ones.
