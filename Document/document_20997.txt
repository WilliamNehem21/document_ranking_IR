As Charley moved across eastern North Carolina, hurricane warnings were extended northward, first to Virginia Beach; they were later extended to Cape Charles, then to the Maryland/Delaware border, and ultimately as far north as Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Prior to its arrival, the storm resulted in the closure of Norfolk International Airport, and more than 9,000Â people evacuated the coastline for emergency shelters. Tropical storm force winds spread across southeastern Virginia, with wind gusts reaching 82Â mph (133Â km/h) on Cape Charles. Offshore, a station on the Chesapeake Bay BridgeâTunnel recorded sustained winds of 97Â mph (157Â km/h) with gusts to 104Â mph (168Â km/h). After the gust, the bridge-tunnel was closed overnight. The winds downed many trees, and in Norfolk, a motorist died after crashing into a downed tree. In Virginia Beach, the winds blew off the roof of a hotel and destroyed two homes under construction. Across the area, the storm left about 110,000Â customers without power. Rainfall in Virginia was fairly light, including a 24-hour total of just over 1Â in (25Â mm) in Norfolk. Strong waves destroyed 250Â ft (76Â m) of Harrison's Pier in Norfolk. A preliminary damage estimate for the area was $1Â million (1986Â USD).
