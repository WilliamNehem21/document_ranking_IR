Near Birch Run, the highway turns northwesterly next to a large outlet mall. Between here and the Saginaw area, the freeway runs through more wooded lands, crossing the Cass River near Bridgeport. I-75/USÂ 23 enters the Tri-Cities (named for Saginaw, Bay City and Midland) when it bypasses Saginaw to the east. The freeway intersects M-46 in Buena Vista Township south of the junction with I-675. North of downtown Saginaw, the freeway crosses the Saginaw River on the Zilwaukee Bridge, a "post-tensioned, segmental, [concrete] box girder bridge" that is "infamous" for a series of "construction mishaps, cost overruns, and government foibles."
Past the bridge, I-75/USÂ 23 meets the northern end of I-675 and continues through fields and woods to the Bay City area. At exitÂ 162, the freeway meets the eastern terminus of USÂ 10 and the western terminus of M-25 west of downtown. The next interchange north is with the Connector M-13 (CONN M-13) freeway, which was the previous northern end of USÂ 23's freeway in Michigan. The connector runs due northward, and I-75/USÂ 23 turns northwesterly to bypass around Kawkawlin. The highway veers north, crosses the Kawkawlin River and the Pinconning Creek before coming to an interchange southwest of Standish. There, USÂ 23 curves east, separating from I-75. USÂ 23 continues for about as a freeway which ends at the intersection with M-13 south of Standish. The lowest AADT along any freeway section of USÂ 23 in Michigan is the section immediately east of I-75; here the traffic levels drop from 20,763Â to 4,466Â vehicles per day after USÂ 23 separates from I-75.
