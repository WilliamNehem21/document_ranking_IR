In 1557 Pleydell was charged in the chamber by previous partner John Berwick, who blamed him for shielding two criminals from discipline. The men (one indicted for homicide and the other of abetting a robbery) were Pleydell's workers in his ability as boss officer and manager of Savernake Forest. Berwick, accepted by the antiquarian Stanley Thomas Bindoff to carry on of envy, was the past holder of the titles and associated with a debate with Pleydell over the rights to property close to the woods. Pleydell enrolled the guide of serving and previous individuals from parliament, including William Button, Henry Clifford, Griffith Curteys and John Hooper, in July. Their obligation was to analyze observers and proof on the two sides of the contention, and they introduced a rundown of 240 articles concerning the hirelings' exercises. Pleydell's endeavors were seen by the court as an endeavor to undermine the honesty of the Queen's judges and, maybe, to actuate resistance among his supporters. This, notwithstanding rupturing a promise to meet normally with the Privy Council under recognizance after his detainment, prompted his arraignment by Attorney-General Edward Griffin amid the Michaelmas expression. Pleydell was detained in the Tower of London, relinquishing his two ÃÂ£500 bonds. He was discharged for good conduct on 19 December, and left for the home of material vendor Thomas Garrard (a brother of the William Garrard with whom Pleydell filled in as Member for Wootton Bassett) in the wake of posting a ÃÂ£1,000 bond.
