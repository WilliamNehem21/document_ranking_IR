In 1924 Walpole moved into a house close Keswick in the Lake District. His vast salary empowered him to keep up his London level in Piccadilly, however Brackenburn, on the slants of Catbells sitting above Derwentwater, was his fundamental home for a mind-blowing remainder. He was rapidly made welcome by neighborhood occupants, and the view and climate of the Lake District regularly found their way into his fiction. The commentator James Agate remarked that one may think from a portion of Walpole's accounts that their creator had made the English Lakes, however that he was likely just counseled about them. Toward the finish of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who before long turned into his companion and partner and remained so for an incredible remainder. In Hart-Davis' words, he came closer than some other individual to Walpole's for quite some time looked for origination of an ideal companion. Cheevers, a policeman, with a spouse and two kids, left the police drive and entered Walpole's administration as his driver. Walpole confided in him totally, and gave him broad command over his issues. Regardless of whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was quite often with him, and frequently went with him on abroad excursions. Walpole gave a house in Hampstead to Cheevers and his family.
