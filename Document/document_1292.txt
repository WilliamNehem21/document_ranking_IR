Despite the fact that lemur scientific categorization had created, it was not until the 1960s that the in-situ (or on location) investigation of lemur conduct and nature started to bloom. Jean-Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter-Rousseaux visited Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, reviewing a considerable lot of its lemur species and mentioning imperative objective facts about their social groupings and generation. In 1960, the time of Madagascar's autonomy, David Attenborough acquainted lemurs with the West with a business film. Under the direction of John Buettner-Janusch, who established the Duke Lemur Center in 1966, Alison Jolly headed out to Madagascar in 1962 to ponder the eating routine and social conduct of the ring-followed lemur and Verreaux's sifaka at Berenty Private Reserve. The Petters and Jolly produced another period of enthusiasm for lemur environment and conduct and were in a matter of seconds pursued by anthropologists, for example, Alison Richard, Robert Sussman, Ian Tattersall, and numerous others. Following the political unrest of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's unrest, field thinks about continued during the 1980s, thanks to some degree to the recharged inclusion of the Duke Lemur Center under the course of Elwyn L. Simons and the protection endeavors of Patricia Wright. In the decades that pursued, immense steps have been made in lemur contemplates and numerous new species have been found.
