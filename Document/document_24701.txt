After Cien Caras left CMLL for AAA in 1992, CMLL decided to hold a traditional 16-man single-elimination tournament to crown a new World Heavyweight Champion. The tournament ran from October 30 to November 20, 1992. On the first night of the tournament, all sixteen competitors competed in a battle royal where the order of elimination determined the pairings for the first round. The last two wrestlers were Vampiro and El Egipico, who faced off in the last of the first round matches. The first two matches of the first round were held on November 3, at CMLL's weekly ""Martes de Coliseo"" show where Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Rick Patterson both won their matches, followed by Jalisco Jr. winning his quarterfinal match the same night. On November 6, at the weekly "CMLL Super Viernes" show, King Haku and Brazo de Plata advanced in the first round with King Haku qualifying for the semi-final match with another victory. On November 8, an additional tournament match was held with Pirata Morgan advancing to the second round. The November 10 show saw Black Magic and Kahoz advance to face each other, with Black Magic moving to the semi-finals. On November 11, CMLL held the final first round and quarterfinal match, which Vampiro won, and then held both of the semi-finals on the same night. By the end of the night, Black Magic and Jalisco Jr. qualified for the final. The following week, at the November 20 "Super Viernes", Black Magic won the finals and became the third CMLL World Heavyweight Champion.
