Within the Quichean sub-branch KÊ¼icheÊ¼ (QuichÃ©), the Mayan language with the largest number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 KÊ¼icheÊ¼ Maya in the Guatemalan highlands, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the CuchumatÃ¡n mountains, as well as by urban emigrants in Guatemala City. The famous Maya mythological document, "Popol Vuh", is written in an antiquated KÊ¼icheÊ¼ often called Classical KÊ¼icheÊ¼ (or QuichÃ©). The KÊ¼icheÊ¼ culture was at its pinnacle at the time of the Spanish conquest. QÊ¼umarkaj, near the present-day city of Santa Cruz del QuichÃ©, was its economic and ceremonial center. Achi is spoken by 85,000 people in Cubulco and Rabinal, two "municipios" of Baja Verapaz. In some classifications, e.g. the one by Campbell, Achi is counted as a form of KÊ¼icheÊ¼. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as KÊ¼icheÊ¼. The Kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from Guatemala City westward to the northern shore of Lake AtitlÃ¡n. TzÊ¼utujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake AtitlÃ¡n. Other members of the KÊ¼ichean branch are Sakapultek, spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in El QuichÃ© department, and Sipakapense, which is spoken by 8,000 people in Sipacapa, San Marcos.
