Walker distributed another expert article in 1933, entitled "Barrage Aviation: Bulwark of National Defense". "At whatever point we talk as far as 'flying corps' we are considering assault flight," he composed, rejecting different types of avionics. This was standard at the Air Corps Tactical School, which instructed that "each dollar which goes into the structure of assistant flying and extraordinary sorts, which types are not basic for the proficient working of the striking power can just happen to the detriment of that flying corps' hostile power." Walker's real proposition was that "a decided air assault, once propelled, is most troublesome, if not difficult to stop when coordinated against land destinations." At the finish of his article, he recharged his require the making of an autonomous flying corps "as a power with a particular mission, of significance parallel to that of the Army and the Navy." Walker's relentless support of key besieging prompted visit conflicts with Captain Claire Chennault, who drove guidance in interest flight at the Air Corps Tactical School from 1931 to 1936. Chennault trusted that the correct blend of warriors and ground safeguards could effectively overcome an aircraft attack and criticized Walker for proposing that planes couldn't be quit, prompting "incredible" banters between the two.
