As indicated by Elisabeth Dhanens, the shape and adjusted top of the first edge is reminiscent of those found on the top register of boards of the Ghent altarpiece, which are acknowledged as planned by Jan's sibling Hubert. She trusts the present edge is excessively tight and little, and contains "cumbersome marbling". From a nitty gritty 1851 stock, we know the content of the psalm engraved on unique edge. The content is written in a beautiful structure and started on the lower fringe and afterward expanded upwards on the vertical outskirts, finishing on the top outskirt. The lower fringe of the casing read ; the sides and top ("The mother is the little girl. This dad is conceived. Who has known about a wonder such as this? God brought into the world a man"). The fifth stanza of the song (excluded in van Eyck's translation) peruses, "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth however not staineth. In this way, the Virgin, as she might have been. Virgin still remaineth." The lettering on the stitch of her robe echoes the engraving on the casing, words like those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 "Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele", an entry from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) perusing ("For she is more delightful than the sun, and exceeds expectations each group of stars of the stars. Contrasted and the light she is observed to be prevalent").
