Meanwhile, "Andrea Doria" took an interest in a few tasks proposed to get British escorts in the Mediterranean, including the Operation Excess guards in January 1941. Before the year's over, the two warships were entrusted with escorting caravans from Italy to North Africa to help the Italian and German powers battling there. These caravans included Operation M41 on 13 December and Operation M42 on 17Ã¢ÂÂ 19 December. Amid the last mentioned, "Andrea Doria" and "Giulio Cesare" connected with British cruisers and destroyers in the First Battle of Sirte on the main day of the activity. Neither the Italians nor the British squeezed their assaults and the fight finished uncertainly. "Caio Duilio" was doled out to removed help for the task, and was excessively far away to effectively take an interest in the fight. Caravan escort work proceeded into mid 1942, yet from there on the armada started to experience the ill effects of an extreme lack of fuel, which kept the boats in port for the following two years. "Caio Duilio" cruised far from Taranto on 14 February with a couple of light cruisers and seven destroyers so as to capture the British guard MW 9, limited from Alexandria to Malta, yet the power couldn't find the British boats, thus came back to port. Subsequent to learning of "Caio Duilio" flight, be that as it may, British escorts left the vehicle "Rowallan Castle", recently crippled by German flying machine.
