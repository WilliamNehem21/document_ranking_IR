Friedrich settled forever in Dresden in 1798. Amid this early period, he tested in printmaking with etchings and plans for woodcuts which his furnishings creator sibling cut. By 1804 he had created 18 etchings and four woodcuts; they were clearly made in little numbers and just conveyed to companions. Notwithstanding these attacks into other media, he inclined toward working fundamentally with ink, watercolor and sepias. Except for a couple of early pieces, for example, "" (1797), he didn't work widely with oils until his notoriety was progressively settled. Scenes were his favored subject, roused by continuous excursions, starting in 1801, to the Baltic coast, Bohemia, the KrkonoÃÂ¡e and the Harz Mountains. For the most part dependent on the scenes of northern Germany, his artworks portray woods, slopes, harbors, morning fogs and other light impacts dependent on a nearby perception of nature. These works were displayed on representations and investigations of beautiful spots, for example, the bluffs on RÃÂ¼gen, the surroundings of Dresden and the waterway Elbe. He executed his investigations only in pencil, notwithstanding giving land data, yet the unpretentious climatic impacts normal for Friedrich's mid-period works of art were rendered from memory. These impacts took their quality from the portrayal of light, and of the brightening of sun and moon on mists and water: optical marvels exceptional to the Baltic coast that had at no other time been painted with such an accentuation.
