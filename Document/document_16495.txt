Around 4:00, "Indefatigable" was hit around the rear turret by two or three shells from "Von der Tann". She fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking towards the stern and listing to port. Her magazines exploded at 4:03 after more hits, one on the forecastle and another on the forward turret. Smoke and flames gushed from the forward part of the ship and large pieces were thrown into the air. The most likely cause of her loss was a deflagration or low-order explosion in 'X' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the steering control shafts, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. "Von der Tann" fired only fifty-two shells at "Indefatigable" before she exploded. Of her crew of 1,019, only three survived. While still in the water, two survivors found "Indefatigable's" captain, C. F. Sowerby, who was badly wounded and died before they could be rescued. Two survivors, Able Seaman Frederick Arthur Gordon Elliott and Leading Signalman Charles Farmer, were rescued by the German torpedo boat . A third survivor, Signalman John Bowyer, was picked up by another unknown German ship. He was incorrectly reported as a crew member from HMS "Nestor" in "The Times" on 24 June 1916.
