Before "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" was released, it was predicted to sell even more copies than the highly successful "Halo 3"; it had received reviews as high as "Halo 3"s, it was launching on three systems as opposed to one for "Halo 3", and demand for the game led to a wide range of retailers only having enough available to satisfy pre-orders. It fulfilled the prediction and the Xbox 360 version became the best-selling video game in the United States from November 2007 to January 2008 according to the NPD Group. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would go on to sell 1.57 million and 444,000 units, respectively, in the United States in November 2007. 1.47 million units of the Xbox 360 version were sold in December 2007; the game sold 331,000 copies for the Xbox 360 and 140,000 copies for the PlayStation 3 in January 2008. The Xbox 360 version was the third best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S. with 3.04 million units sold, behind "Halo 3", which sold 4.82 million units, according to the NPD Group. By January 2008, "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" had sold more than 7 million copies worldwide, and was the best-selling game of 2007. On June 3, 2008, Infinity Ward reported that the game had sold over 10 million units. During a May 2009 conference call, Activision announced that the game has sold 13 million copies, surpassing "Super Mario Galaxy" as the best selling game released that week of November 2007. By November 2013, the game had sold 15.7 million copies.
