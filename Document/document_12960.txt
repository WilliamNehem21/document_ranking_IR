It was accounted for as "a standout amongst the most amazing burial services which have gone through the entryways of the West Terrace Cemetery", and "presumably one of the biggest military memorial services at any point held in Adelaide". The minister at the administration said that Jensen was, "unassuming dependably... ever prepared to develop the fortitude of others, without addressing his own achievements". His decoration set, including his Victoria Cross, was given by a relative to the Australian War Memorial in 1987 at a service gone to by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and is shown in the Hall of Valor of the commemoration. In 2006, a remembrance to Jensen was revealed in LÃÂ¸gstÃÂ¸r by the Australian envoy to Denmark, and a book about him was distributed in Denmark around the same time. Every year wreaths are set at the commemoration in memory of Jensen, and in 2014 a wreath was put by the Australian diplomat, Damien Miller.
