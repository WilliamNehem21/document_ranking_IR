German magazine "Happy-Computer" commended the point-and-click interface and likened it to that of "Uninvited" by ICOM Simulations. The publication highlighted "Maniac Mansion"s graphics, originality, and overall enjoyability: one of the writers called it the best adventure title yet released. "Happy-Computer" later reported that "Maniac Mansion" was the highest-selling video game in West Germany for three consecutive months. The game's humor received praise from "Zzap!64", whose reviewers called the point-and-click controls "tremendous" and the total package "innovative and polished". Shay Addams of "Questbusters: The Adventurer's Newsletter" preferred "Maniac Mansion"s interface to that of "Labyrinth: The Computer Game". He considered the game to be Lucasfilm's best, and he recommended it to Commodore 64 and Apple II users unable to run titles with better visuals, such as those from Sierra On-Line. A writer for "ACE" enjoyed the game's animation and depth, but he noted that fans of text-based adventures would dislike the game's simplicity. "Entertainment Weekly" picked the game as the #20 greatest game available in 1991, saying: "The graphics are merely okay and the music is Nintendo at its tinniest, but Maniac Mansion's plot is enough to overcome these faults. In this command-driven game â adapted from the computer hit â three buddies venture into a sinister haunted mansion and wind up juggling a bunch of wacky story lines."
