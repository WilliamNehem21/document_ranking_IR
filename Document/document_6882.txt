Homes were manufactured following pair development and took two to four days to build; this procedure was exceedingly synchronized inside a state. The female picked the settling site by sitting on it and flicking its wings. The male at that point painstakingly chose settling materials, normally twigs, and gave them to the female over her back. The male at that point went looking for all the more settling material while the female built the home underneath herself. Homes were worked between over the ground, however commonly above , and were made of 70 to 110 twigs woven together to make a free, shallow bowl through which the egg could without much of a stretch be seen. This bowl was then ordinarily fixed with better twigs. The homes were about wide, high, and profound. In spite of the fact that the home has been depicted as rough and feeble contrasted with those of numerous different winged animals, stays of homes could be found at locales where settling had occurred quite a long while earlier. Almost every tree equipped for supporting homes had them, regularly more than 50 for each tree; one hemlock was recorded as holding 317 homes. The homes were set on solid branches near the tree trunks. A few records express that ground under the settling territory looked as though it had been cleared spotless, because of the considerable number of twigs being gathered in the meantime, yet this zone would likewise have been shrouded in fertilizer. As both genders dealt with the home, the sets were monogamous for the term of the settling.
