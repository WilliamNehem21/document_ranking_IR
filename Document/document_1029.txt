Hilda Rix and her sister Elsie both played melodic instruments as kids, and would perform tunes or moves at local shows. Elsie was an artist and on-screen character who performed at the gatherings of the Austral Salon, and the sisters worked together in structuring blurbs to publicize the Salon's exercises. As a youngster, Hilda was energetic about illustration. Her creative endeavors drew acclaim while she was going to secondary school at Melbourne Girls Grammar (known as Merton Hall), however in most different regards Rix was not a remarkable understudy. Both Elsie and Hilda took some craftsmanship exercises with a Mr Mather, before Hilda proceeded to learn at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905, where she was educated by a main individual from the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. Her kindred understudies were for the most part ladies and included Jessie Traill, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. Rix would in this way be condemning of McCubbin's way to deal with instructing, alluding to his techniques as "ambiguous influences". All things considered, the creator of the main far reaching life story of Rix, John Pigot, thought about that McCubbin impacted her in a few different ways: he stressed the inventiveness of people as opposed to mimicking the style of any one school of painting; he displayed the significance of nationalistic thoughts and subjects that would turn out to be so noticeable in her later painting; and his work underscored the sketch's subject over specialized contemplations.
