Examination of "Voyager" pictures persuaded that the magma streams on Io were made for the most part out of different types of liquid natural sulfur. The colouration of the streams was observed to be like its different allotropes. Contrasts in the magma shading and brilliance are a component of the temperature of polyatomic sulfur and the pressing and holding of its particles. An investigation of the streams that transmit out from Ra Patera uncovered distinctively shaded materials, all related with fluid sulfur, at various separations from the vent: dull albedo material near the vent at , red material in the focal piece of each stream at , and orange material at the most remote finishes of each stream at . This shading design relates to streams emanating out from a focal vent, cooling as the magma voyages from it. What's more, temperature estimations of warm discharge at Loki Patera taken by "Voyager 1"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer and Radiometer (IRIS) instrument were steady with sulfur volcanism. Nonetheless, the IRIS instrument was not fit for identifying wavelengths that are demonstrative of higher temperatures. This implied temperatures predictable with silicate volcanism were not found by "Voyager". In spite of this, "Voyager" researchers found that silicates must assume a job in Io's young appearance, from its high thickness and the requirement for silicates to help the lofty slants along patera dividers. The inconsistency between the basic proof and the phantom and temperature information following the "Voyager" flybys prompted a discussion in the planetary science network in regards to the structure of Io's magma streams, regardless of whether they were made out of silicate or sulfurous materials.
