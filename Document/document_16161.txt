The typhoon first affected the Northern Mariana Islands, where it left US$2.5Â million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114Â homes. The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4Â million in damage. About 250,000Â people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left Â¥4.08Â billion (US$36.9Â million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322Â mm (52.0Â in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61Â daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29Â people and caused Â¥94.9Â billion (US$854Â million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon affected the Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35Â people, and its effects were significant enough for the name to be retired.
