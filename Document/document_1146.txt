The holotype of "C. nasicornis" was found with its left metatarsals II to IV intertwined. Bog, in 1884, committed a short article to this at the time obscure element in dinosaurs, taking note of the nearby similarity to the condition found in present day winged animals. The nearness of this component in "Ceratosaurus" ended up disputable in 1890, when Georg Baur guessed that the combination in the holotype was the aftereffect of a recuperated crack. This case was rehashed in 1892 by Cope, while contending that "C. nasicornis" ought to be named a types of "Megalosaurus" because of inadequate anatomical contrasts between these genera. In any case, instances of intertwined metatarsals in dinosaurs that are not of obsessive root have been portrayed since, including taxa more basal than "Ceratosaurus". Osborn, in 1920, clarified that no irregular bone development is clear, and that the combination is strange, however likely not obsessive. Ronald Ratkevich, in 1976, contended that this combination had restricted the running capacity of the creature, however this case was dismissed by Paul in 1988, who noticed that a similar element happens in some quick moving creatures of today, including ground feathered creatures and ungulates. A 1999 examination by Darren Tanke and Bruce Rothschild proposed that the combination was in reality neurotic, affirming the prior case of Baur. Different reports of pathologies incorporate a pressure crack in a foot bone doled out to the sort, just as a broken tooth of a unidentified types of "Ceratosaurus" that hints at further wear got after the break.
