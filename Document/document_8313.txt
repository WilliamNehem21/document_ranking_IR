"Child Boy" accomplished a situating on the business diagrams before its physical discharge in the United States. The track prompted a higher "Board" 200 outline setting for "Perilously in Love", and helped the collection to achieve multi-platinum affirmation in the United States. The single appeared on the "Board" Hot 100, at number fifty-seven, while its forerunner "Insane in Love" was still on the top spot. "Child Boy" ruled the airplays in the United States, eventually achieving the highest point of the "Announcement" Hot 100. It achieved the graph's top spot two months after its presentation, and remained there for nine back to back weeks. The single remained number one for seven days longer than "Insane in Love" had, turning into BeyoncÃÂ©'s longest-graphing number-one single. The accomplishment was not broken until her single "Essential" (2006), from her second collection "B'Day" (2006), went through ten weeks at the top spot from late 2006 until mid 2007 because of overwhelming airplay. "Infant Boy" remained on the HotÃÂ 100 for twenty-nine weeks, and was confirmed platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 6, 2006. "Infant Boy" made progress on "Bulletin" hybrid and standard radio diagrams, showing up on the Top 40 Tracks, Rhythmic and Mainstream Top 40, just as cresting on the Radio Songs and Dance/Mix Show Airplay, and at number two on Dance Club Songs. As of October 6, 2010, "Infant Boy" had sold 600,000 physical units in the United States.
