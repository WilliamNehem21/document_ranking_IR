Pests include root-knot nematodes and cabbage maggots, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; aphids, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; harlequin bugs, which cause white and yellow leaves; thrips, which lead to leaves with white-bronze spots; striped flea beetles, which riddle leaves with small holes; and caterpillars, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves. The caterpillar stage of the "small cabbage white butterfly" ("Pieris rapae"), commonly known in the United States as the "imported cabbage worm", is a major cabbage pest in most countries. The large white butterfly ("Pieris brassicae") is prevalent in eastern European countries. The diamondback moth ("Plutella xylostella") and the cabbage moth ("Mamestra brassicae") thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops. The cabbage looper ("Trichoplusia ni") is infamous in North America for its voracious appetite and for producing frass that contaminates plants. In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide. Destructive soil insects include the cabbage root fly ("Delia radicum") and the cabbage maggot ("Hylemya brassicae"), whose larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.
