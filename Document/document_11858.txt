From around this time onwards, while Etty still held to his conviction that the reason for craftsmanship is to show moral exercises, he started to relinquish the artistic, religious and legendary topics which had ruled his work. He started to paint still lifes, starting with "Fowl and Peach" (prone to be the canvas presently called "Dead Pheasant and Fruit"); during the 1840s he displayed six altogether, and painted some more. Etty was the main English painter to paint huge still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English an essentially Netherlandish structure. Additionally out of the blue, he started to paint a noteworthy number of scene artworks. Etty still kept on painting history artistic creations, however while he kept on delivering exceptionally acclaimed reworkings of his past pictures, those takes a shot at crisp points were commonly ineffectively gotten. Etty's decrease in quality can be ascribed to some extent to London craftsmanship vendors; from 1835 seller Richard Colls had turned out to be progressively near Etty, and by 1844 had a close syndication on his work. As the significance of the landed upper class to the workmanship showcase declined, the new buyers of craftsmanship were industrialists; for the most part ailing in established training and with little enthusiasm for Old Masters, they liked to purchase works by then-contemporary specialists, for example, Etty, and depended on vendors to exhort them.
