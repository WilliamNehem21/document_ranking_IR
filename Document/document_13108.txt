After Richard's demise on 6 April 1199 there were two potential inquirers to the Angevin royal position: John, whose guarantee laid on being the sole enduring child of Henry II, and youthful Arthur I of Brittany, who held a case as the child of John's senior sibling Geoffrey. Richard seems to have begun to perceive John as his beneficiary hypothetical in the last a very long time before his passing, however the issue was not obvious and medieval law gave little direction about how the contending cases ought to be chosen. With Norman law favoring John as the main enduring child of Henry II and Angevin law favoring Arthur as the main child of Henry's senior child, the issue quickly turned into an open clash. John was upheld by the majority of the English and Norman honorability and was delegated at Westminster Abbey, sponsored by his mom, Eleanor. Arthur was bolstered by most of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and got the help of Philip II, who stayed focused on separating the Angevin regions on the mainland. With Arthur's military squeezing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip's powers moving down the valley towards Tours, John's mainland domain was in risk of being cut in two.
