Xiao Tong (501â531), a crown prince of the Liang Dynasty (502â557), immortalized several of Zhang's works in his literary anthology, "Selections of Refined Literature (Wen xuan" æé¸")". Zhang's rhapsodies (, "fu") include "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" ("XÄ« jÄ«ng fÃ¹" è¥¿äº¬è³¦), "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody" ("DÅng jÄ«ng fÃ¹" æ±äº¬è³¦), "Southern Capital Rhapsody" ("NÃ¡n dÅ« fÃ¹" åé½è³¦), "Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery" ("SÄ« xuÃ¡n fÃ¹" æçè³¦), and "Rhapsody on Returning to the Fields" ("GuÄ« tiÃ¡n fÃ¹" æ­¸ç°è³¦). The latter fuses Daoist ideas with Confucianism and was a precursor to later Chinese metaphysical nature poetry, according to Liu Wu-chi. A set of four short lyric poems ("shi" è©©) entitled "Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows" ("SÃ¬ chÃ³u fÃ¹" åæè©©), is also included with Zhang's preface. This set constitutes some of the earliest heptasyllabic "shi" Chinese poetry written. While still in Luoyang, Zhang became inspired to write his "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" and "Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody", which were based on the "Rhapsody on the Two Capitals" by the historian Ban Gu. Zhang's work was similar to Ban's, although the latter fully praised the contemporaneous Eastern Han regime while Zhang provided a warning that it could suffer the same fate as the Western Han if it too declined into a state of decadence and moral depravity. These two works satirized and criticized what he saw as the excessive luxury of the upper classes. Zhang's "Southern Capital Rhapsody" commemorated his home city of Nanyang, home of the restorer of the Han Dynasty, Guangwu.
