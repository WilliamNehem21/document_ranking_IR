The year 1902 started with indistinguishable daily schedule of preparing tasks from in earlier years for the boats of the I Squadron. The last ironclad at long last left the squadron in February, having been supplanted by "Kaiser Friedrich III"s recently dispatched sister send . The squadron started a noteworthy preparing voyage on 25 April; that day, while the boats were going through the Danish straits, a genuine kettle mishap happened on board "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse", constraining her to turn back for fixes. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the remainder of the squadron proceeded into the North Sea, toward Scotland. They went through the Pentland Firth on 29 April before turning south toward Ireland. The boats ceased quickly in Lough Swilly on 1 May before continuing to Bantry Bay, where they secured off Berehaven five days after the fact. There, Prince Heinrich visited his British cousin, Prince Arthur, and the boats were gotten by the British Channel Squadron. The German vessels at that point steamed to Dublin, and after that to the Isles of Scilly, where "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" rejoined the squadron. They came back to Dublin, where they were visited by Gerald Cadogan, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The boats at long last started their arrival voyage to Germany on 24 May, and came to Kiel four days after the fact.
