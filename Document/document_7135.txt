Amid his preliminary, Berger guaranteed that he had not known about the Final Solution until after the war, however the arraignment delivered proof that he had been available at the first of Himmler's scandalous 1943 Posen discourses in which the "Reichsfuhrer-SS" had expressly discussed the killing of Jews. Berger's resistance counsel guaranteed that his customer did not trust "annihilation" had been utilized by Himmler with respect to Jews amid the discourse. Berger's legal counselor went on trying to relieve Berger's activities by asserting that the Cold War bore solid parallels to the Nazi battle against "Jews and Bolsheviks", and the likelihood that the US would likewise need to battle the Soviet Union sooner rather than later. Amid the war, Berger wrote in an article, "We the National Socialists trust the Fuhrer when he says that the destruction of Jewry in Europe remains toward the finish of the battle induced by the Jewish World Parasite against us as his most grounded foe." Berger and others likewise guaranteed that the unit directed by Dirlewanger was not part of the SS, despite the fact that when the content of Himmler's second Posen discourse was revealed in 1953, it "cast questionable light" on Berger's case. He showed no regret for his activities.
