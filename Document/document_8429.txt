"An excess of Too Soon" got positive audits from contemporary commentators. Evaluating the collection in "Moving Stone", Dave Marsh hailed the New York Dolls as the main hard musical gang in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's skillful drumming, Johansen's capacity to add profundity to his characters, and Thunders' inventive guitar playing. Bog particularly adulated his playing on "Chatterbox", calling it "a work of art", and accepted even the most audacious melodies sounded fruitful in light of the fact that Morton's creation featured the gathering's increasingly foul melodic characteristics. Composing for "Creem" magazine, Christgau said the cleaned sound generation safeguarded the band's crude characteristics, particularly on account of Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and commented that Rundgren "ought to be embarrassedÃ¢ÂÂShadow Morton has gotten more out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any however their greatest evenings." Robert Hilburn from the "Los Angeles Times" felt "An excess of Too Soon" was a superior created collection that ended up being the band to be "the genuine article", considering it the best record of criticizing punk shake since "Outcast on Main St." by the Rolling Stones in 1972. In "The New Yorker", Ellen Willis composed that she figured out how to acknowledge "An excessive amount of Too Soon" more than "New York Dolls" in the wake of seeing the band perform tunes from the previous collection in show, especially "Person" and "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from "Phonograph Record" magazine said the gathering's "agreeable unexpected reasonableness" was communicated "unmistakably more amusingly and accessibly" here than on their introduction collection.
