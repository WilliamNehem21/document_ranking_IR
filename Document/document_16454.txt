At the time of its release, "Famicom TsÅ«shin" awarded the Saturn console 24 out of 40 possible points, higher than the PlayStation's 19 out of 40. In June 1995, Dennis Lynch of the "Chicago Tribune" and Albert Kim of "Entertainment Weekly" both praised the Saturn as the most advanced gaming console available, with the former complimenting its double-speed CD-ROM drive and "intense surround-sound capabilities" and the latter citing "Panzer Dragoon" as a "lyrical and exhilarating epic" demonstrating the ability of new technology to "transform" the industry. In December 1995, "Next Generation" evaluated the system with three and a half stars out of a possible five, highlighting Sega's marketing and arcade background as strengths but the system's complexity as a weakness. "Electronic Gaming Monthly"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s December 1996 Buyer's Guide had four reviewers rate the Saturn 8, 6, 7, and 8 out of 10; these ratings were inferior to those of the PlayStation, which was scored 9, 10, 9, and 9 in the same review. By December 1998, "Electronic Gaming Monthly"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviews were more mixed, with reviewers citing the lack of games for the system as a major issue. According to "EGM" reviewer Crispin Boyer, "the Saturn is the only system that can thrill me one month and totally disappoint me the next".
