Subsequent to finishing "The War of the End of the World", Vargas Llosa started to compose books that were essentially shorter than a considerable lot of his prior books. In 1983, he completed "The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta" ("Historia de Mayta", 1984). The epic spotlights on a radical insurgence that occurred on May 29, 1962 in the Andean city of Jauja. Later that year, amid the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando BelaÃÂºnde Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a team to ask into the slaughter of eight writers on account of the residents of Uchuraccay. The Commission's fundamental object was to examine the homicides so as to give data with respect to the occurrence to people in general. Following his contribution with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa distributed a progression of articles to protect his situation in the undertaking. In 1986, he finished his next novel, "Who Killed Palomino Molero" ("ÃÂ¿QuiÃÂ©n matÃÂ³ a Palomino Molero?"), which he started composing not long after the finish of the Uchuraccay examination. Despite the fact that the plot of this riddle novel is like the appalling occasions at Uchuraccay, abstract faultfinder Roy Boland brings up that it was anything but an endeavor to reproduce the killings, but instead a "scholarly expulsion" of Vargas Llosa's very own encounters amid the commission. The experience likewise propelled one of Vargas Llosa's later books, "Demise in the Andes" ("Lituma en los Andes"), initially distributed in 1993 in Barcelona.
