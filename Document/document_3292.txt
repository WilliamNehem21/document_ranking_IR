With government appropriations guaranteed, at first at $385,000 per year, and with the support of the main speculation bank Brown Brothers, Collins established the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, naturally known as the Collins Line. He promptly set out on a goal-oriented steamship development program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, , was propelled in 1849 and started administration in April 1850. Her three sister ships, , and , were all in administration before the finish of 1850. The four, all developed of wood, were comprehensively comparative in size and execution; "Cold" was hardly the biggest, at long and 2,856 tons by American custom house estimation. The new Collins Line steamers were around 25 percent bigger than the greatest of the Cunard sends, and were before long beating them; intersections in ten days ended up schedule. "Cold" entered administration on October 26, 1850. The sumptuous guidelines of its traveler convenience appeared differently in relation to those accomplished by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's "Britannia" in 1840. Dickens discovered his "Britannia" lodge dull and cramped, "an altogether sad, and significantly crazy box", while the hopeless cantina was "a long thin loft, much the same as a massive funeral car". In "Ice", as indicated by a prepared transoceanic traveler, her lodges "in solace and polish outperformed that of any dealer vessel Great Britain at that point had", while the fundamental cantina had "a demeanor of practically Oriental eminence".
