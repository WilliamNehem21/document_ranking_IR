The illustration room was developed during the 1880s period of structure, when Armstrong had sold his Jesmond house and was dwelling exclusively at Cragside. Aslet recommends that the motivation for the plan was the extraordinary lobby at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, in spite of the fact that Saint thinks about Shaw's Dawpool Hall, Cheshire as the almost certain source. Pevsner and Richmond notice Hardwick Hall and Hatfield House as conceivable models for the "tremendous" generally speaking plan. The room contains a titanic marble inglenook chimneypiece, rumored to gauge ten tons, and structured by Shaw's collaborator, W. R. Lethaby. Muthesius portrays the chimney as an "awe inspiring model ... with finely created alleviation enhancement". Jenkins thinks of it as "most likely the world's greatest inglenook" and portrays the general effect of the room as "thrilling", taking note of the top-lit roof and the expand Jacobethan plasterwork. Others have been less complimentary; the essayist Reginald Turnor, no admirer both of Shaw or of Victorian engineering and its modelers all the more for the most part, composed of the room's "ostentatious and rather sickening point of interest". When of its development, Shaw, progressively working for customers of incredible riches, had proceeded onward from his "Early English" style, and the room is planned and beautified in a more terrific and increasingly lavish Renaissance taste.
