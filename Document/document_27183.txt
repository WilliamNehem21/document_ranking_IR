Some of the deposited chemical species may interact with the ice, so what is detected in an ice core is not necessarily what was originally deposited. Examples include HCHO and . Another complication is that in areas with low accumulation rates, deposition from fog can increase the concentration in the snow, sometimes to the point where the atmospheric concentration could be overestimated by a factor of two.
Galactic cosmic rays produce in the atmosphere at a rate that depends on the solar magnetic field. The strength of the field is related to the intensity of solar radiation, so the level of in the atmosphere is a proxy for climate. Accelerator mass spectrometry can detect the low levels of in ice cores, about 10,000 atoms in a gram of ice, and these can be used to provide long-term records of solar activity. Tritium (), created by nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s, has been identified in ice cores, and both Cl and have been found in ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland. Chlorine-36, which has a half-life of 301,000 years, has been used to date cores, as have krypton (, with a half-life of 11 years), lead (, 22 years), and silicon (, 172 years).
