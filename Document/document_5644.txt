Gens' relations with the different Jewish obstruction bunches were stressed. He enabled some opposition individuals to get away from the ghetto, however contradicted the designs for obstruction since he felt they would compromise the whole ghetto's presence. Gens guaranteed to give help to the obstruction gatherings and may have guaranteed to go along with them in a revolt if the time was correct. He provided cash, taken from the different Judenrat assets, to the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO), an opposition gather in the ghetto. In view of the requirement for mystery, the FPO did not have an approach to legitimately request cash from the ghetto occupants. Gens gave assets to another opposition gathering, the "Battle Group" built up by Boris 'Borka' Fridman. It later converged with the "Yechiel Group", built up by Yechiel Sheinbaum, to shape the "Yechiel's Struggle Group". He gave a gun to the Struggle Group, its first. The FPO endeavored to keep the development of other obstruction bunches in the ghetto, principally in light of the fact that they expected that it would expand the odds of German disclosure just as rivalry for rare assets. Gens' help for the Struggle Group seems to have prompted contact among himself and the FPO.
