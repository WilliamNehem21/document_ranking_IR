During 1917, one of the guns on each boat was placed on an anti-aircraft mount. On 21 April, four Austro-Hungarian destroyers, accompanied by "84Â F", "92Â F", "94Â F" and "100Â M", conducted a night raid on the Otranto Barrage, sinking one drifter. On 11 May, the British submarine stalked "78Â T" off Pola, firing two torpedoes at her. The British captain had kept his submarine's periscope extended too far and for too long, and the tell-tale "feather" alerted the crew of "78Â T", allowing her to avoid the incoming torpedoes. That night, the destroyer "CsikÃ³s", accompanied by "78Â T", "93Â F" and "96Â F", were pursued in the northern Adriatic by an Italian force of five destroyers, but were able to retire to safety behind a minefield. On 14â15 May 1917, several 250t-class boats were part of the support forces for a major raid on the Otranto Barrage. When the raiding force departed, torpedo boats and aircraft secured the approaches to the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro. Once the raiding force had departed for the barrage, "Sankt Georg", a destroyer, and "84Â F", "88Â F", "99Â M" and "100Â M" were to be prepared to sortie out to support the raiders on their return voyage. The old coastal defence ship and "86Â F", "91Â F" and "95Â F" were also available at Cattaro if needed. Although the raid was a success, sinking 14 drifters, the raiding force was then engaged by Allied ships in the Battle of the Otranto Straits. Both support groups sailed to meet the returning Austro-Hungarian force, including the heavily damaged "Novara", which was under tow. On marrying-up with the raiding force, the torpedo boats fanned out to screen the larger warships, protecting them as they returned to port.
