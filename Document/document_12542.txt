Before the attack, noteworthy fortresses known as the Rupnik Line were developed along the Italian and German fringes, inside what turned into the seventh Army's region of activities. Along the outskirts with Italy, commonly supporting fortifications were set up on forward inclines of the mountain goes behind a belt of impediments. The principle positions pursued a line from Mount BlegoÃÂ¡ south-south-east through HlavÃÂe Njive, ÃÂ½irovski Vrh, Vrh Svetih Treh Kraljev, Zaplana, Mount Slivnica, Grahovo, and LoÃÂ¾ to PetiÃÂak. Toward the north of Mount BlegoÃÂ¡, positions kept running behind the lines of the SelÃÂ¡ka Sora and Sava Bohinjka waterways. Fortresses were likewise settled in the rugged Gorski kotar locale among Karlovac and Fiume on the upper Adriatic coast. Along the German outskirt, the Yugoslavs focused on planning to obstruct the goes through the Karawank and Kamnik Alps, and constructed fortifications behind deterrents along the courses driving south from the fringe towards Dravograd, Maribor and Ptuj.
