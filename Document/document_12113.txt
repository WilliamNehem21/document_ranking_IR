In 1511, a Spanish caravel was destroyed in the Caribbean, and around twelve survivors made landfall on the shore of YucatÃÂ¡n. They were seized by a Maya master, and most were yielded, albeit two figured out how to get away. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish endeavors investigated the YucatÃÂ¡n coast, and occupied with various fights with the Maya occupants. After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan tumbled to the Spanish in 1521, HernÃÂ¡n CortÃÂ©s despatched Pedro de Alvarado to Guatemala with 180 mounted force, 300 infantry, 4 guns, and a large number of united warriors from focal Mexico; they touched base in Soconusco in 1523. The KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼ capital, QÃÂ¼umarkaj, tumbled to Alvarado in 1524. In no time thereafter, the Spanish were welcomed as partners into Iximche, the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya. Great relations did not last, because of over the top Spanish requests for gold as tribute, and the city was deserted a couple of months after the fact. This was trailed by the fall of Zaculeu, the Mam Maya capital, in 1525. Francisco de Montejo and his child, Francisco de Montejo the Younger, propelled a long arrangement of battles against the nations of the YucatÃÂ¡n Peninsula in 1527, lastly finished the victory of the northern part of the promontory in 1546. This left just the Maya kingdoms of the PetÃÂ©n Basin free. In 1697, MartÃÂ­n de UrsÃÂºa propelled an ambush on the Itza capital NojpetÃÂ©n and the last autonomous Maya city tumbled to the Spanish.
