By the mid 1970s, it was questionable whether the kakapo was as yet a surviving species. Toward the finish of 1974, researchers found a few progressively male kakapo and mentioned the main logical objective facts of kakapo blasting. These perceptions drove Don Merton to conjecture out of the blue that the kakapo had a lek rearing framework. From 1974 to 1978 a sum of 18 kakapo were found in Fiordland, however all were guys. This raised the likelihood that the species would wind up wiped out, on the grounds that there may be no enduring females. One male flying creature was caught in the Milford territory in 1975, initiated "Richard Henry", and exchanged to Maud Island. Every one of the winged animals the Wildlife Service found from 1951 to 1976 were in U-molded glaciated valleys flanked by nearly vertical precipices and encompassed by high mountains. Such outrageous landscape had moderated colonization by perusing warm blooded creatures, leaving islands of for all intents and purposes unmodified local vegetation. Be that as it may, even here, stoats were available and by 1976 the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and just a couple of guys endure high on the most out of reach portions of the bluffs.
