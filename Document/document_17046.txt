At the conclusion of the festival the Wagner family departed for an extended stay in Venice. To accommodate the large party of children, servants and expected guests they took a spacious apartment in the Palazzo Vendramin Calergi, overlooking the Grand Canal. The principal concern during the autumn and winter months was Wagner's declining health; his heart spasms had become so frequent that on 16 November 1882 Cosima recorded: "Today he did "not" have a spasm!". Cosima's journal entry for 12 February 1883âthe last she was to makeârecords Wagner reading FouquÃ©'s novel "Undine", and playing the Rhinemaidens' lament from "Das Rheingold" on the piano. However, an underlying cause of domestic friction may have surfaced concerning Carrie Pringle, an English soprano from the "Parsifal" cast who was rumoured to be having an affair with Wagner. According to Isolde, recalling the occasion much later, the Pringle suspicions led to a furious row between Cosima and Wagner on the morning of 13 February. There is no solid evidence of an affair between Wagner and Pringle, nor is Isolde's story of a row supported by any other testimony. At around noon on that day, Wagner suffered a fatal heart attack, and died in the middle of the afternoon.
