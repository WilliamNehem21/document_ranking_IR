When the CalabiÃ¢ÂÂ Yau complex has been deteriorated into less complex parts, reflect symmetry can be comprehended in an instinctive geometric way. For instance, consider the torus portrayed previously. Envision that this torus speaks to the "spacetime" for a physical hypothesis. The central objects of this hypothesis will be strings spreading through the spacetime as indicated by the guidelines of quantum mechanics. One of the essential dualities of string hypothesis is T-duality, which expresses that a string proliferating around a hover of range formula_1 is identical to a string engendering around a hover of span formula_2 as in every recognizable amount in one portrayal are related to amounts in the double depiction. For instance, a string has energy as it proliferates around a circle, and it can likewise twist around the circle at least multiple times. The occasions the string twists around a circle is known as the winding number. On the off chance that a string has force formula_16 and winding number formula_17 in one depiction, it will have energy formula_17 and winding number formula_16 in the double portrayal. By applying T-duality at the same time to the majority of the circles that break down the torus, the radii of these circles become upset, and one is left with another torus which is "fatter" or "skinnier" than the first. This torus is the reflection of the first CalabiÃ¢ÂÂ Yau.
