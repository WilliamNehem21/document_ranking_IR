KetÃ¨lbey was financially successful enough to leave Columbia Records in 1926 to spend more time composing, although he continued to conduct for them on an occasional basis, particularly between 1928 and 1930 when he conducted sixteen of his own works with the company, published as "KetÃ¨lbey Conducting his Concert Orchestra". He spent his time undertaking annual conducting tours and composing, and in 1927 he published "By the Blue Hawaiian Waters" and the suite "In a Fairy Realm", while in the following year he wrote another suite, "Three Fanciful Etchings". His works continued to sell well, and in the October 1929 issue of the "Performing Right Gazette" his publisher described him as "Britain's greatest living composer"; when the advertisement was mentioned in "The Musical Times", the anonymous writer wrote "we sympathise with Mr KetÃ¨lbey in being thus raised to a pinnacle which he himself, we are sure, would be very far from claiming." Sant writes that KetÃ¨lbey subsequently became Britain's first millionaire composer. In February 1930 he began what became an annual series of concerts at the Kingsway Hall, conducting a new work, "The Clock and the Dresden Figures". In a review of the 1933 concert, the critic S.R. Nelson wrote that "as a descriptive writer KetÃ¨lbey really does take some beating. He has the happy knack of combining infinitely melodious themes and the cleverly diluted likeness of the authentic atmosphere."
