Quite a while before expressing "Changeling", TV screenwriter and previous writer J. Michael Straczynski was reached by a source at Los Angeles City Hall. The source disclosed to him that authorities were intending to copy various file records, among them "something [Straczynski] should see". The source had found a transcript of the city gathering welfare hearings concerning Collins and the result of her child's vanishing. Straczynski ended up interested with the case; he did some examination, and composed a spec content titled "The Strange Case of Christine Collins". A few studios and autonomous makers optioned the content, however it never found a purchaser. Straczynski felt he came up short on an opportunity to give to making the story work and just came back to the undertaking following the undoing of his TV arrangement "Jeremiah" in 2004. Following 20 years as a screenwriter and maker for TV, Straczynski felt he required a break from the medium, so he went through a year inquiring about the Collins case through chronicled criminal, province town hall, city lobby and city funeral home records. He said he gathered around 6,000 pages of documentation on Collins and the Wineville murders, before adapting enough to "make sense of how to tell it". He composed the principal draft of the new content in 11 days. Straczynski's specialist passed the content to maker Jim Whitaker. He sent it to Ron Howard, who optioned it right away.
