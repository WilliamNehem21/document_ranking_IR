As opposed to different characters in the "Last Fantasy" arrangement, whose identity characteristics were formed to fit a story, Toriyama imagined Lightning's essential identity before "XIII"s account had been settled. She has a cool mien, which was intended to conflict in an engaging route with Snow's bluntness. Nomura remarked that Lightning has "a solid component of secret about her character". She initially had a coy viewpoint to her identity, which was exchanged to Oerba Yun Fang when Fang was changed from male to female. For "Lightning Returns", the engineers needed to depict Lightning in a few distinct lights, rather than her static identities in earlier appearances. One of their most noteworthy needs was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become profoundly powerless therefore. Fashioner Yuji Abe expounded that, due to her misfortunes and freshly discovered defenselessness, Lightning appeared to be darker, marginally desensitized to her environment, and "like a manikin, similar to somebody who doesn't exactly have her genuine self inside." He explained that this impact indicates "the sort of powerlessness she has, and it's the point from which she begins to change a short time later." The choice to extend her identity thusly was initially recommended by Yoshinori Kitase, who was worried that Lightning's coolness in past diversions had made it troublesome for players to bond with her.
