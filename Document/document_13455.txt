In 1084, Guiscard came back to the Balkans and arranged another hostile against Corfu, where a joined Greek-Venetian armada, told by Selvo, anticipated his landing. At the point when the Normans moved toward the island, the consolidated armadas managed Guiscard a much more prominent annihilation than he had gotten in the maritime fight at Durazzo. Guiscard requested another assault three days after the fact, however the outcomes were still progressively shocking for the Normans. Selvo was totally persuaded of his armada's triumph and sent every harmed ship north to Venice for fixes, to free them for different utilizations, and to report of their triumph. The Doge at that point resigned with the rest of the boats to the Albanian coast to anticipate the flight of the Normans. Following up on the Doge's conviction that a third assault would be far-fetched and that the nearness of a marginally exhausted Venetian armada implied more noteworthy chances for triumph, Guiscard brought each drifting vessel he could discover and drove the Normans into an unexpected assault. His technique, however maybe unsafe, was eventually very much determined as it caused mass disarray among the Venetians, who were overpowered on all flanks, while the Greeks fled what they thought to be a losing fight. Selvo scarcely figured out how to withdraw with the rest of his armada, however not before 3,000 Venetians kicked the bucket and another 2,500 were taken prisoner. The Venetians likewise lost 9 incredible galleys, the biggest and most vigorously outfitted ships in their war armada.
