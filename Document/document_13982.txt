Discussion has seethed with respect to how unordinary this blending depended on the couple's age and blood relationship. Noted Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn contends it was not especially uncommon, nor was Poe's nicknaming his better half "Sissy" or "Sister". Another Poe biographer, Kenneth Silverman, fights that however their first-cousin marriage was not strange, her young age was. It has been recommended that Clemm and Poe had a relationship more like that among sibling and sister than among a couple. Biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn couldn't help contradicting this view, refering to an intense love letter to contend that Poe "adored his little cousin with the love of a sibling, yet additionally with the enthusiastic commitment of a sweetheart and forthcoming spouse." Some researchers, including Marie Bonaparte, have perused a considerable lot of Poe's functions as self-portraying and have inferred that Virginia kicked the bucket a virgin. It has been guessed that she and her significant other never culminated their marriage, albeit no proof is given. This understanding regularly accept that Virginia is spoken to by the title character in the ballad "Annabel Lee": a "lady... by the name of Annabel Lee". Poe biographer Joseph Wood Krutch proposes that Poe did not require ladies "in the manner in which that ordinary men need them", yet just as a wellspring of motivation and care, and that Poe was never intrigued by ladies explicitly. Companions of Poe proposed that the couple did not share a bed for in any event the initial two years of their marriage yet that, from the time she turned 16, they had a "typical" wedded life until the beginning of her sickness.
