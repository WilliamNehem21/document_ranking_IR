As the 114th United States Congress amassed in January 2015 with Republicans responsible for the Senate, McCain progressed toward becoming seat of the Armed Services Committee, a long-lasting objective of his. In this position, he drove the composition of proposed Senate enactment that tried to alter portions of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 so as to return duty regarding significant weapons frameworks procurement back to the individual furnished administrations and their secretaries and far from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. As seat, McCain attempted to keep up a bipartisan methodology and fashioned a decent association with positioning part Jack Reed. In April 2015, McCain declared that he would keep running for a 6th term in Arizona's 2016 Senate race. While there was as yet preservationist and Tea Party outrage at him, it was indistinct in the event that they would mount a powerful essential test against him. Amid 2015, McCain emphatically contradicted the Obama organization's proposed complete concession to the Iranian atomic program (later settled as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)), saying that Secretary of State Kerry was "whimsical" and "giv[ing] away the store" in exchanges with Iran. McCain bolstered the Saudi Arabian-drove military mediation in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and powers faithful to previous President Ali Abdullah Saleh, saying: "I'm certain regular people bite the dust in war. Not such a large number of as the Houthis have executed."
