Davenport's first paid job in journalism, in 1889, was drawing for the Portland newspaper, "The Oregonian", where he showed a talent for sketching events from memory. He was fired in 1890, it was said, for poorly drawing a stove for an advertisementâhe could not draw buildings and appliances well. By another story, he was let go when there was only work for one in the paper's engraving department, and he was junior man. He then worked for the "Portland Sunday Mercury", traveling to New Orleans for a prizefight in January 1891 between Jack Nonpareil Dempsey of Portland and Bob Fitzsimmons. When he returned, earned money through selling his drawings as postcards.
Davenport's talent came to the attention of C.W. Smith, general manager of the Associated Press, and also Timothy Davenport's first cousin. Smith got the young cartoonist a free pass on the railroad to San Francisco in 1891 and wrote a letter to the business manager of "The San Francisco Examiner", essentially a demand that Davenport be hired. He was; the "Examiner"'s business manager had been greatly impressed by doodles that Davenport drew while waiting. At the "Examiner", Davenport was not a cartoonist, but a newspaper artist who illustrated articlesâthe technology to directly reproduce photographs in newspapers was still a few years away. After a year at the "Examiner", he was fired; several stories state that this occurred after he asked for a raise from his meager salary of $10 per week.
