On 30 May Ballantine called the Claimant to the stand. Amid his examination-in-boss, the Claimant addressed inquiries on Arthur Orton, whom he portrayed as "a substantial boned man with sharp highlights and a protracted face somewhat set apart with smallpox". He had dismissed Orton somewhere in the range of 1862 and 1865, yet they had met again in Wagga, where the Claimant had talked about his legacy. Under questioning the Claimant was shifty when squeezed for further subtleties of his association with Orton, saying that he didn't wish to implicate himself. In the wake of addressing him on his visit to Wapping, Hawkins asked him straightforwardly: "Are you Arthur Orton?" to which he answered "I am most certainly not". The Claimant showed significant numbness when examined concerning his time at Stonyhurst. He couldn't recognize Virgil, mistook Latin for Greek, and did not comprehend what science was. He created a buzz when he announced that he had lured Katherine Doughty and that the fixed bundle given to Gosford, the substance of which he prior asserted not to review, contained guidelines to be followed in case of her pregnancy. Rohan McWilliam, in his account of the undertaking, remarks that starting there on the Tichborne family were battling for their homes as well as for Katherine Doughty's respect.
