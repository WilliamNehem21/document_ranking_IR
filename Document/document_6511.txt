The main goaltender to play for the Canadiens somewhere in the range of 1910 and 1925, VÃÂ©zina helped the group win the Stanley Cup in 1916 and 1924, while achieving the Stanley Cup Finals three additional occasions. Nicknamed the "Chicoutimi Cucumber" for his quiet self-control while in objective, VÃÂ©zina permitted the least objectives in the alliance multiple times in his profession: multiple times in the NHA and multiple times in the NHL. In 1918, VÃÂ©zina turned into the first NHL goaltender to both record a shutout and gain a help on an objective. Toward the beginning of the 1926Ã¢ÂÂ 27 NHL season, the Canadiens gave the Vezina Trophy to the NHL as an honor to the goaltender who permitted the least objectives amid the season. Since 1981, the honor has been given to the most remarkable goaltender as controlled by a vote of NHL general supervisors. In VÃÂ©zina's main residence of Chicoutimi, the games field is named the Center Georges-VÃÂ©zina in his respect. At the point when the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945, VÃÂ©zina was one of the first nine inductees, and in 2017 the NHL included him on their rundown of the 100 biggest players allied history.
