In 1975, the American scientistss Jack McIntosh and David Berman examined the authentic issue of whether Marsh had appointed a mistaken skull to "Brontosaurus" (at the time thought to be a lesser equivalent word of "Apatosaurus"), and observed the Felch Quarry skull to be of "the general "Camarasaurus" type", while proposing that the vertebra found close it had a place with "Brachiosaurus". They inferred that if Marsh had not subjectively doled out the Felch quarry skull and another "Camarasaurus"- like skull to "Brontosaurus", it would have been perceived before that the genuine skull of "Brontosaurus" and "Apatosaurus" was increasingly like that of "Diplodocus". McIntosh later probably perceived the Felch Quarry skull as having a place with "Brachiosaurus", and conveyed it to the consideration of the American scientistss Kenneth Carpenter and Virginia Tidwell, while encouraging them to portray it. They conveyed the skull to the Denver Museum of Natural History, where they further arranged it and made a recreation of it dependent on throws of the individual bones, with the skulls of "Giraffatitan" and "Camarasaurus" going about as formats for the missing bones. In 1998, Carpenter and Tidwell portrayed the Felch Quarry skull, and formally doled out it to "Brachiosaurus" sp., since it is difficult to decide if it had a place with the animal types "B. altithorax" itself. They based the skull's task to "Brachiosaurus" on its closeness to that of "B. brancai", later known as "Giraffatitan".
