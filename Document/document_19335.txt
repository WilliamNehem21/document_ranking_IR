"Drowning Girl" was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited the Art Institute of Chicago from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the Tate Modern in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and The Centre Pompidou from July 3 to November 4, 2013. During the 2012â13 retrospective, "The Huffington Post" described "Drowning Girl" as Lichtenstein's "masterpiece of melodrama". Danish art critic and Louisiana Museum of Modern Art director Poul Erik TÃ¸jner called the work an example of Lichtenstein's "post-coital perdition" pieces, describing it as the "star witness" of this genre of his works. He notes that the subject is reaching far-flung depths as she acts out of pride. TÃ¸jner perceived eroticism in this painting, likening the open mouth to a vaginal feature and noting the singularity of Lichtenstein using an open mouth. With that in mind, he compares the tears to ejaculate residue.
This was painted at the apex of Lichtenstein's use of enlarged dots, cropping and magnification of the original source. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum curator Diane Waldman notes that Lichtenstein made "Drowning Girl" a cornerstone of his career because of "his extraordinary sense of organization, his ability to use a sweeping curve and manipulate it into an allover pattern". According to "The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists", the work is "a mix of clichÃ©, melodrama, pathos, and absurdityÂ ..." The result is described by art scholar Jonathan Fineberg as "a remarkably impassive style". The image is typical of Lichtenstein's depiction of comic subjects responding to a situation in a clichÃ©d manner.
