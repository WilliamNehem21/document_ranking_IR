Notwithstanding the nearness of Haflinger stallions at a stud ranch in Stadl-Paura in Upper Austria after World War I, the Haflinger may well not exist in Austria today. In spite of these stallions, the Haflinger rearing projects were not on strong balance in Austria, with legislative spotlight on other Austrian breeds and private reproducing programs not sufficiently extensive to impact national rearing practices. Amid this time, the breed was held alive through crosses to the Hucul, Bosnian, Konik and Noriker breeds. In 1919 and 1920, the rest of the stallions were allocated all through Austria, numerous to zones that had facilitated private rearing homesteads before the war. In 1921, the North Tyrolean Horse Breeders' Cooperative was shaped in Zams, and in 1922, the first Haflinger Breeders' Show was held in a similar area. Numerous surviving Austrian Haflinger female horses were viewed as of excessively low quality to be utilized as brood female horses, and each exertion was made to import higher-quality brood female horses from the South Tyrol groups now in Italy. In 1926, the primary studbook was set up in North Tyrol. In the late 1920s, different cooperatives were set up for Haflinger raisers in Weer and WildschÃÂ¶nau, and had the capacity to pick up government consent to buy 100 Haflinger female horses from South Tyrol and split them between North Tyrol, Upper Austria and Styria. This single exchange spoke to 33% of every single enlisted female horse in South Tyrol, and numerous others were sold through private arrangement, leaving the two areas equivalent as far as reproducing stock populaces. In 1931, another reproducers' helpful was set up in East Tyrol in Austria, and Haflinger rearing spread all through the whole Tyrolean region.
