By 1920 Puccini was confronting expanding weight, from producers as well as from his distributing firm, Casa Ricordi, to permit "Il trittico" to be separated and introduced independently. Musical show houses originally needed to exclude "Suor Angelica", which had demonstrated the least mainstream of the three, yet some wished to preclude "Il tabarro" also. Puccini had left London certain that "Il trittico" would pick up a spot in the Covent Garden collection, yet before long discovered that the musical drama house's executive, Henry V. Higgins, had evacuated "Suor Angelica", feeling that the crowd hated it. Truth be told, Higgins could never organize it again. Puccini vociferously questioned, as did his long-lasting London companion, Sybil Seligman, without much of any result. Higgins then chose to evacuate "Il tabarro", and arrange "Gianni Schicchi" together with a Russian expressive dance introduction. Puccini countered, "This is a genuine selling out", however at last gave in and allowed the execution. Puccini, notwithstanding, was as yet persuaded that the three works ought to be performed together, and that his unique origination was by and large "fiercely destroyed". The Metropolitan Opera participated in the evisceration: after 1920, it would not again introduce the three musical dramas together until 1975.
