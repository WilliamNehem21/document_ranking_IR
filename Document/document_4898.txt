After the battalion of Nevesinje had been eased, Laxa coordinated his primary exertion towards the Gacko and Avtovac regions. Touchy to the way that the Italians had not regarded the regional fringes of the NDH when they sent their section to Gacko, he thought of it as vital that Croatian military and political eminence be reestablished, generally the Italians may choose to stay in the region as opposed to pull back to their battalion close to the Adriatic coast. He wanted to pursue this union by clearing the fringe regions with Montenegro at that point clearing the hinterland of any residual radicals. For this last errand he expected to send a yet-to-be-shaped uncommon unit to be driven by Lieutenant Colonel Josip Metzger. The assignment of re-attesting NDH specialist in the Gacko and Avtovac regions was distributed to Prohaska's gathering, comprising of the sixth Battalion, one organization of the eighteenth Battalion, two organizations of the seventeenth Battalion, and the as of late arrived fifteenth and 21st Battalions, which were to be sent to Nevesinje from Mostar. Prohaska was to act working together with the eleventh Battalion who were at that point in the region of PluÃÂ¾ine, just toward the north of the NevesinjeÃ¢ÂÂ Gacko street. In readiness, the fifteenth Battalion was trucked to Nevesinje, and an organization of the seventeenth Battalion directed a planned assault with the eleventh Battalion on agitator positions close Kifino Selo. This assault was vanquished by the radicals, and a legion administrator was executed.
