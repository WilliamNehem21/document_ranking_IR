Settling states pulled in vast quantities of predators, including American minks, American weasels, American martens, and raccoons that went after eggs and nestlings, feathered creatures of prey, for example, owls, falcons, and hawks that went after nestlings and grown-ups, and wolves, foxes, catamounts, bears, and mountain lions that went after harmed grown-ups and fallen nestlings. Birds of prey of the variety "Accipiter" and hawks sought after and went after pigeons in flight, which thus executed complex flying moves to keep away from them; Cooper's falcon was known as the "extraordinary pigeon sell" because of its triumphs, and these birds of prey supposedly pursued moving traveler pigeons. While numerous predators were attracted to the herds, singular pigeons were to a great extent ensured because of the sheer size of the group, and generally speaking little harm could be caused on the herd by predation. In spite of the quantity of predators, settling states were large to the point that they were evaluated to have a 90% achievement rate if not irritated. In the wake of being relinquished and leaving the home, the fat adolescents were powerless against predators until they had the capacity to fly. The sheer number of adolescents on the ground implied that just a little level of them were murdered; predator satiation may along these lines be one reason for the very social propensities and mutual rearing of the species.
