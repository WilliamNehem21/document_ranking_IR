Because the series is an anthology, each season has a self-contained narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings. Pizzolatto began contemplating the lead roles while he was pitching the series to networks in early 2012. "True Detective" anthology format required actors to commit to only a single season, so Pizzolatto was able to attract film stars who normally avoid television series because of their busy schedules. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey were among the actors Pizzolatto considered for star billing. McConaughey, who had recently finished filming "Killer Joe" (2011), was contracted well before HBO commissioned the season. Impressed with his performance in "The Lincoln Lawyer" (2011), Pizzolatto at first assigned him to play Hart, but McConaughey convinced him to give him the part of Cohle. When asked in a "Variety" interview about his decision to switch parts, the actor replied, "I wanted to get in that dude's head. The obsession, the island of a manâI'm always looking for a guy who monologues. It's something really important as I feel I'm going into my better work." To prepare for the role, McConaughey created a 450-page analysisâthe "Four Stages of Rustin Cohle"âto study his character's evolution during the season.
