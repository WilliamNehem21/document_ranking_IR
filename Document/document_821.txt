In January 1954 Fleming and his significant other, Ann, headed out to their Goldeneye home in Jamaica for their yearly two-month occasion. He had officially composed two Bond books, "Gambling club Royale", which had been distributed in April 1953, and "Live and Let Die", whose production was up and coming. He started stating "Moonraker" on his landing in the Caribbean. He later composed an article for "Books and Bookmen" magazine portraying his way to deal with composing, in which he stated: "I compose for around three hours in the morningÃÂ ... what's more, I do one more hour's work somewhere in the range of six and seven at night. I never right anything and I never return to perceive what I have writtenÃÂ ... By following my recipe, you compose 2,000 words every day." By 24 February he had composed more than 30,000 words, in spite of the fact that he kept in touch with a companion that he had a feeling that he was at that point spoofing the two prior Bond books. Fleming's own duplicate bears the accompanying engraving, "This was written in January and February 1954 and distributed a year later. It depends on a film content I have had in my psyche for a long time." He later said that the thought for the film had been unreasonably short for a full novel, and that he "needed to pretty much join the primary portion of the book onto my film thought so as to convey it up to the vital length".
