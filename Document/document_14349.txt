Bennett's demeanors to the music of his mainland peers, beside that of Mendelssohn, were wary. Arthur Sullivan guaranteed that Bennett was "sharply biased against the new school, as he called it. He would not have a note of Schumann; and with respect to Wagner, he was outside the pale of analysis." In Bennett's 1858 address on "The visits of renowned remote artists to England", the most recent notice is of Mendelssohn, bypassing Chopin, Wagner, Verdi and Hector Berlioz, (who all just came to England after Mendelssohn's last visit); Liszt (who visited London in 1827) is excluded. In a resulting address he opined that Verdi was "vastly second rate" to Gioachino Rossini, and could just say for Berlioz that he "must be permitted the character of a fruitful and gave artistÃÂ ... it can't be questioned that his treatment of an extraordinary symphony is excellent in the outrageous." Of Wagner, "the legend of the alleged 'music of things to come'", Bennett noted "I have no expectation of treating him impolitely; that I altogether misconstrue him and his melodic sentiments might be my blame and not his. At any rate he has an impact right now over melodic life, which it is difficult to disregard."
