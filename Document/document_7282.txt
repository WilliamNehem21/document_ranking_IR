Under Emperor Diocletian (284Ã¢ÂÂ 305), the naval force's quality supposedly expanded from 46,000 men to 64,000 men, an assume that speaks to the numerical pinnacle of the late Roman naval force. The Danube Fleet ("Classis Histrica") with its chaperon legionary flotillas is still very much validated in the "Notitia Dignitatum", and its expanded movement is remarked upon by Vegetius ("De Re Militari", IV.46). In the West, a few fluvial armadas are referenced, however the old standing praetorian armadas had everything except evaporated ("De Re Militari", IV.31) and even the staying western commonplace armadas seem to have been truly understrength and unequipped for countering any noteworthy savage assault. In the East, the Syrian and Alexandrian armadas are known from lawful sources to have still existed in c. 400 ("Codex Justinianus", XI.2.4 and XI.13.1), while an armada is known to have been positioned at Constantinople itself, maybe made out of the remainders of the praetorian armadas. In 400 it was adequate to butcher an extensive number of Goths who had assembled pontoons and attempted to cross the piece of ocean that isolates Asia from Europe. Its size, be that as it may, is obscure, and it doesn't show up in the "Notitia".
