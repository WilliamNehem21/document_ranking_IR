Klenau's triumph was the particular achievement. On 14 October Mack sent two sections out of Ulm in anticipation of a breakout toward the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch made a beeline for Elchingen to verify the scaffold there, and the other under Franz von Werneck ran north with a large portion of the overwhelming big guns. Perceiving the chance, Marshal Michel Ney rushed the remainder of his VI Corps forward to restore contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. In a two dimensional assault Ney sent one division toward the south of Elchingen on the correct bank of the Danube. This division started the attack at Elchingen. In the meantime another division crossed the stream toward the east and moved west against Riesch's position. In the wake of clearing Austrian pickets from an extension, the French assaulted and caught a deliberately found monastery at the highest point of the slope at pike point. The Austrian rangers ineffectively endeavored to battle off the French, yet the Austrian infantry broke and ran. In this commitment alone, the Austrians lost the greater part their save gunnery park, 6,000 (out of 8,000 complete members) dead, injured or caught and four hues. Reisch's section likewise neglected to annihilate the extensions over the Danube.
