In "The Musical Times" Edwin Evans adulated Tippett's content: "straightforward and direct ... he has shrewdly opposed any impulse to utilize semi scriptural or 'Pioneer's Progress' language." Evans was dubious whether the music was genuinely intelligent of the words: "...the feeling appeared to be independently cool under the incitements portrayed in the content". Dissimilar to Glock, Evans was unconvinced by the case for the consideration of the spirituals: "[T]he exceptional impact they have in their customary structure will in general vanish in their new condition". Eric Blom, in "Music and Letters", thought utilizing spirituals "splendid", and the similarity with Bach's chorales persuading. Blom was less energetic about the content, which he found "exceptionally succinct and uncovered Ã¢ÂÂ rather poor, truly"Ã¢ÂÂ however he thought this desirable over the pomposities, for example, those that portray libretti composed for Handel. In his life account, Tippett makes just quieted references to the debut, noticing that the occasion "had some blended audits", however in a letter to his companion Francesca Allinson he affirmed himself enchanted with the expansiveness of reaction to the work: "It has over not exclusively to the conventional audience members yet even to the scholarly people like [MÃÂ¡tyÃÂ¡s] Seiber, who has kept in touch with me of a portion of the 'dazzling surface of a portion of the numbers'".
