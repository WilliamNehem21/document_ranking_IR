Dissimilar to in numerous different areas of the Pacific Northwest, logging had little effect on the future park. The roughness of the landscape and the presence of all the more financially suitable timber assets that were nearer to transportation courses generally prevented the timber business from signing in the zone. In 1897 the Washington Forest Reserve was put aside, saving the forestland that would later turn into the recreation center. By 1905, the administration of the hold was exchanged from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. The Forest Service was therefore made to direct these backwoods holds across the country, which were redesignated as National Forests. Despite the fact that the Department of Agriculture enabled business endeavors to log the timberland with a grant, a large portion of the timber taken from the area was utilized locally for the development of lodges and comparable little scale ventures. Logging extended when the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project was started by the open utility, Seattle City Light during the 1920s. Nearly of timber would have been left submerged by the finishing of the Ross Dam. An agreement to remove the timber was granted in 1945 and the task was finished in 1958. None of the dams or territories that were broadly logged are inside the present limits of the national park, however they are in the connecting Ross Lake National Recreation Area.
