In 1801 Epsilon Eridani was incorporated into , Joseph JÃÂ©rÃÂ´me LefranÃÂ§ois de Lalande's list of around 50,000 stars, in view of his perceptions of 1791Ã¢ÂÂ 1800, in which perceptions are masterminded in time request. It contains three perceptions of Epsilon Eridani. In 1847, another release of Lalande's list was distributed by Francis Baily, containing most of its perceptions, in which the stars were numbered arranged by right rising. Since each perception of each star was numbered and Epsilon Eridani was watched multiple times, it got three numbers: 6581, 6582 and 6583. (Today numbers from this list are utilized with the prefix "Lalande", or "Lal".) Lalande relegated Epsilon Eridani size 3. Likewise in 1801 it was incorporated into the list of Johann Bode, in which around 17,000 stars were assembled into 102 heavenly bodies and numbered (Epsilon Eridani got the number 159 in the group of stars Eridanus). Bode's list depended on perceptions of different space experts, including Bode himself, yet generally on Lalande's and Lacaille's (for the southern sky). Bode appointed Epsilon Eridani greatness 3. In 1814 Giuseppe Piazzi distributed the second version of his star index (its first release was distributed in 1803), in light of perceptions amid 1792Ã¢ÂÂ 1813, in which in excess of 7000 stars were assembled into 24 hours (0Ã¢ÂÂ23). Epsilon Eridani is number 89 in hour 3. Piazzi allocated it extent 4. In 1918 Epsilon Eridani showed up in the Henry Draper Catalog with the assignment HDÃÂ 22049 and a primer unearthly arrangement of K0.
