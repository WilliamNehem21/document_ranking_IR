Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 preceding the last was bowled for 31 by Laker following two hours of batting. Morris attempted to compel a ball from Laker away, yet hit it from the center of his bat into his back cushion, and the ball bounced back onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a guarded field, utilizing leg hypothesis to moderate the scoring. The English head pressed the leg side with defenders, including two short legs, and requested Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman practically inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before guarding uneasily for a period. With Laker ceasing the scoring at the opposite end, Bradman oversaw just four keeps running in his initial 20 minutes of batting. The Australian chief viewed Bedser as the best crease bowler he looked in his vocation, and he batted in an attentive way as he tried to set up himself. At the opposite end, Bradman misconstrued a ball from Laker and a mistakenly executed cut shot barely went wide of the slip defender. Presently matured 40, Bradman's reflexes had moderated and he never again begun his innings as unhesitatingly as he had done before. Barnes then achieved his 50 years following 135 minutes, pulling Barnett for four, and the Australians passed 100 preceding lunch following 125 minutes of batting. At the deferment, the visitors were 104/1.
