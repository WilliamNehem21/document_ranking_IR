The Parrett then flows through the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which contains a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold ("Caltha palustris"), meadowsweet ("Filipendula ulmaria") and ragged robin ("Lychnis flos-cuculi"). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewickâs swan ("Cygnus columbianus bewickii"), Eurasian curlew ("Numenius arquata"), common redshank ("Tringa totanus"), skylark ("Alauda arvensis"), common snipe ("Gallinago gallinago"), common teal ("Anas crecca"), Eurasian wigeon ("Anas penelope") and whimbrel ("Numenius phaeopus"), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier ("Circus aeruginosus") and peregrine falcon ("Falco peregrinus"). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle ("Synaptus filiformis"), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle ("Hydrochara caraboides"), "Bagous nodulosus", "Hydrophilus piceus", "Odontomyia angulata", "Oulema erichsoni" and "Valvata macrostoma". In addition, the area supports an important European otter ("Lutra lutra") population. 282 American mink ("Mustela vison") have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles ("Arvicola amphibius") to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10Â years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.
