As the climate deteriorated Bartlett requested supplies and hardware to be exchanged onto the ice, both to help the ship and as a safety measure should it be important to forsake the vessel in a rush. Nourishment supplies were increased via seal chasesÃ¢ÂÂa few seals multi day was the normal sack, as indicated by McKinlayÃ¢ÂÂand by a solitary polar bear that had meandered close to the ship in mid-November. On 15 November "Karluk" achieved 73ÃÂ°N, the most northerly purpose of its float, and after that started moving south-west, in the general bearing of the Siberian coast. By mid-December the evaluated position was from Wrangel Island. In spite of the hopeless viewpointÃ¢ÂÂBartlett was secretly persuaded that "Karluk" would not endure the winterÃ¢ÂÂa decided exertion was made to observe Christmas, with adornments, introduces, a program of games on the ice, and a meal. By then they were only north of Herald Island, a rough station east of Wrangel Island; on 29 December land was obvious out there, however whether this was Herald Island or Wrangel Island was not clear. The locating of land quickly raised confidence, yet in the New Year the ice started separating and framing weight edges. Throughout the following couple of days, composed McKinlay, "the twanging, drumming, unpropitious ice sounds got more intense and closer."
