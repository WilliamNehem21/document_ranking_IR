A third Dooley accumulation, "Mr. Dooley's Philosophy", showed up in 1900. The lead story was "A Book Review", that is, Mr. Dooley's discourse of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt's wartime journal, "The Rough Riders". In Mr. Dooley's variant, Roosevelt wins the entire war independent from anyone else, a job marginally more noteworthy than that in his real book. Dooley's decision: "No man that has hard feelings toward himself'll ever be legislative head of a state. Furthermore, if Teddy done everything he should say as much and mitigate the anticipation. In any case, on the off chance that I were him I'd call the book "Alone in Cuba"." Somewhat amazingly, "Rosenfelt" (as Dooley called him) took the sting in geniality, and when the two met, told Dunne of a youthful female admirer of his, who told the representative that she had perused the majority of his books, with her top choice "Alone in Cuba". Roosevelt was chosen VP on McKinley's ticket in 1900, and when he prevailing after the president was killed the next year, Dunne composed of the new CEO, the most youthful to hold that position, "a man isÃÂ ... mature enough to be president when he moves toward becoming president. On the off chance that he ain't, it'll age him."
