"Unruly accomplices" includes a few on-screen characters coming back to the arrangement. Catherine Tate was offered the chance to return as Donna Noble amid lunch with official maker Julie Gardner. Tate, who expected Gardner would get some information about showing up in a biopic, later let it be known was "the farthest thing from [her] mind". Tate's arrival was questionable among "Specialist Who" fans; the analysis she got was contrasted with Daniel Craig after he was given a role as James Bond. Howard Attfield, who showed up as Donna's dad Geoff in "The Runaway Bride", taped a few scenes for this scene, however kicked the bucket before his scenes for the rest of the period were finished. The makers resigned his character out of regard, and devoted him in the end credits for the scene. Maker Phil Collinson proposed exchanging his qualities to the random character Stan Mott from "Voyage of the Damned", and modifying his job as Donna's granddad. Official makers Russell T Davies and Gardner loved the thought and reviewed Bernard Cribbins to the job to re-film Attfield's scenes, with the character renamed as WilfredÃ¢ÂÂa name Davies favored for Donna's granddadÃ¢ÂÂin time for the credits of "Voyage of the Damned" to be changed.
