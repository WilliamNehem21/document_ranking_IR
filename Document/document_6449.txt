Delegates of the ship's organization moved toward Captain Claude Cumberlege to request a one-day delay on flight; this would enable the mariners to have an entire few days of leave, allow Perth-conceived work force to visit their families, and allow faculty to welcome individuals on board. Cumberlege answered that as "Australia" had a tight timetable of "welcome home" port visits, such deferrals couldn't be considered. The following morning, at around 10:30, somewhere in the range of 80 and 100 mariners accumulated before 'P' turret, some in working uniform, other people who had quite recently come back from shore leave still in libertyman rig. Cumberlege sent the official officer to discover why the men had collected, and on discovering that they were rehashing the earlier day's solicitation for a deferral in takeoff, went down to address them. In a severe, legalistic tone, he educated the mariners that deferring "Australia"s takeoff was incomprehensible, and requested them to scatter. The gathering complied with this request, albeit some were vocal in their disappointment. Not long after, "Australia" was prepared to leave, however when the request to discharge the mooring lines and get in progress was given, Cumberlege was educated that the stokers had deserted the engine compartments. After the get together on deck, a few mariners had conceal themselves with dark cloths, and energized or scared the stokers on obligation into leaving their posts, leaving the naval force's leader stranded at the float, in full perspective on dignitaries and groups coating the adjacent wharf. The senior non-charged officers, alongside mariners drafted from different offices, were sent to the engine compartment to get "Australia" moving, and takeoff from Fremantle was just postponed by 60 minutes.
