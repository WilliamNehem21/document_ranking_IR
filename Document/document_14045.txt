IliÃÂ and SivÃÂev's new streamlined low-wing monoplane configuration had a retractable undercarriage. Like the IK-2 it was at first grown secretly by the two men. A scale display was tried in the Eiffel-manufactured breeze burrow in Paris, yet the pair before long understood that they required a third specialist to help assess the plan and decide the basic subtleties. Slobodan ZrniÃÂ, the head of development at the Yugoslav State Aircraft Factory in Kraljevo, was enrolled, as he had functioned as an authority air ship engineer in France. The undertaking name for the IK-2 was changed from IK, representing (Ljubomir) IliÃÂ and Kosta (SivÃÂev), to IKZ, to incorporate ZrniÃÂ. This name was changed, conceivably because of the likenesses between the Cyrillic "ÃÂ" (Z) and the Arabic numeral "3", and the flying machine ended up known as the IK-3. The air ship was to be fueled by a Hispano-Suiza 12Y29 motor, producing at an elevation of . The planners favored mobility over speed, endeavoring to discover a trade off between the German and British ideas of an advanced monoplane warrior. The structure had a littler wing zone than the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire, to accomplish a higher speed for the motor power. In contrast with the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the Yugoslav structure had a shorter fuselage and littler turning span. It varied from British and German structure ideas in that its proposed weapon was amassed in the fuselage.
