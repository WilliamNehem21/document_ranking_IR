The makers and Universal considered opening "Changeling" wide in its first end of the week to gain by Jolie's apparent film industry claim, yet they eventually displayed the discharge plan after those of other Eastwood-coordinated movies, "Spiritualist River" specifically. While the typical methodology is to open movies by remarkable chiefs in each significant city in the United States to guarantee an expansive opening gross, in what the business calls a "stage discharge", Eastwood's movies by and large open in few performance centers before opening wide seven days after the fact. "Changeling" was discharged in 15 theaters in nine markets in the United States on October 24, 2008. The advertising system included trailers that advanced Eastwood's contribution and the more business riddle spine chiller components of the story. General trusted the restricted discharge would profit by great informal help from "genuine film fans" as opposed to those in the 18Ã¢ÂÂ 25-year-old statistic. The film was discharged crosswise over North America on October 31, 2008, playing at 1,850 theaters, growing to 1,896 performance centers by its fourth week. "Changeling" was discharged in the United Kingdom on November 26, 2008, in Ireland on November 28, 2008, and in Australia on February 5, 2009.
