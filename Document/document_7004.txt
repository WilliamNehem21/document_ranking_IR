Michael's first reaction was to arrange the Armeniac armed force to assault Thomas. The Armeniacs were effectively vanquished in fight and Thomas continued through the eastern pieces of the Armeniac Theme to possess the boondocks area of Chaldia. His victory of the Armeniac region was left fragmented in light of the fact that the Abbasids, exploiting the Byzantine common war, propelled attacks via land and ocean against southern Asia Minor, where Thomas had left couple of troops. Rather than coming back to confront these attacks, Thomas propelled an extensive scale intrusion of his own against Abbasid domain in spring 821, either in Syria (as indicated by Bury and others) or in Arab-held Armenia (as indicated by Treadgold). Thomas at that point sent an emissary to the Caliph al-Ma'mun, who was adequately inspired by Thomas' show of power to get his recommendations, particularly in perspective on the Caliphate's very own issues with the resistance of the Khurramites under Babak Khorramdin. Thomas and Ma'mun closed a settlement of harmony and shared partnership. The Caliph enabled Thomas to select men from Arab-ruled domains, and gave leave for him to cross the fringe and travel to Arab-held Antioch, where he was delegated head by the iconophile Patriarch of Antioch, Job. In return, Thomas is said to have guaranteed to surrender unspecified domains and become a tributary vassal of the Caliph, however the understanding's careful terms are left vague in the sources. At about a similar time, Thomas received a young fellow of cloud source, whom he named Constantius and made his co-sovereign.
