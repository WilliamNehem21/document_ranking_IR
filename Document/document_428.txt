No.ÃÂ 36 Squadron started parachute preliminaries with the Hercules in September 1960. Starting in May 1962, RAAF powers based at Ubon, Thailand, under SEATO courses of action were provided by a normal Hercules administration. In December that year, the Hercules made their first troop-conveying flights into a battle zone, when one of No.ÃÂ 36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airdrop from Singapore to Borneo at the initiation of the "Konfrontasi" among Indonesia and Malaysia; comparative missions would be attempted for a further five years. In 1964, the initial two Dassault MirageÃÂ III warriors to be collected in Australia were flown in pieces from France to the Government Aircraft Factories at Avalon, Victoria, by RAAF Hercules. That year, following the section into Australian administration of the de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou with No.ÃÂ 38 Squadron, No.ÃÂ 486 Squadron was disbanded and its hardware and staff partitioned somewhere in the range of Nos.ÃÂ 36 and 38 Squadrons. The RAAF's power of twelve C-130A Hercules was expanded by twelve C-130Es starting in August 1966. No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron, disbanded in 1948, was re-framed at Richmond to work the new models. No.ÃÂ 486 Squadron was likewise re-framed to give support to both Hercules squadrons. No.ÃÂ 36 Squadron's entrusting was principally residential and strategic in nature, while No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron's was abroad and key, attributable to the more drawn out scope of its C-130Es. In May 1967, three Hercules of No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron bolstered Operation Fast Caravan, the arrangement of 23 Mirages of No.ÃÂ 75 Squadron to Butterworth.
