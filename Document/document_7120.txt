In the long run credited with triumphs more than twelve adversary flying machine, in addition to two probables and eight harmed, Barr moved toward becoming No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron's most noteworthy scoring part. He flew an aggregate of eighty-four battle fights, twenty of them in one fortnight, and six on 16ÃÂ June 1942 alone. His logic was that the P-40 was not a top-class warrior, however that its inadequacies "could be counterbalanced by unbridled hostility", so he set out to regard elevated battle as he would a fight and "conquer much better rivals by just going for them". Bobby Gibbes progressed toward becoming No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron's boss in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight administrator. Elevated to flight lieutenant on 1ÃÂ April, Barr was raised to acting squadron pioneer and selected to direction the unit in May, scarcely a half year after he initiated activities, following Gibbes' hospitalization with a broken lower leg. Barr had never looked for initiative of the squadron, and felt that others were similarly too fit the bill for the job. As a leader he designated most regulatory errands to his auxiliary however, as opposed to ordinary practice, composed letters to the closest relative of losses himself.
