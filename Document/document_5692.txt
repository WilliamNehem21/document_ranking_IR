A few analysts note that a noteworthy hero is Kolkata itself, which is "overflowing with warm, thoughtful occupants". An audit in Rediff.com takes note of that the executive pays an "affectionate yet downplayed tribute" to the city by joining symbolism, for example, "yellow cabs, comfortable cable cars, clogged traffic, claustrophobic metros, incapacitated block houses, decreasing back roads, rajnigandhas, lal paad saris, sizzling luchis". As per the analyst, "Kahaani" did not rely upon the tropes of Kolkata culture ordinarily utilized in Bollywood movieÃ¢ÂÂ"O-accentuating accent, sensational play of conch shells, rasgulla/mishti doi overabundances." The executive recognizes that Kolkata "turns into a focal character" of the film. Gautaman Bhaskaran, composing for "Inlet Times", takes note of that Kolkata symbolism was cleaned up in the movie; noted Bengali executive Srijit Mukherji contends that the depiction of the city in "Kahaani" was much the same as a "Forlorn Planet exotica" on the city. Uddalak Mukherjee of "The Telegraph" clarifies that Kolkata in "Kahaani" was restorative and come up short on a profound threatening nearness. Mukherjee contends the delineation of the city never coordinates the dimension of Satyajit Ray's Calcutta set of three, where "supported by carnage, ravenousness and decadence,ÃÂ ...CalcuttaÃÂ ..., despite the fact that a position of dreams, wants and expectation, slides irreversibly into bedlam, nervousness and an ethical emergency, taking its inhabitants with it".
