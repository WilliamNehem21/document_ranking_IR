The Point sticks into the ocean on a north-bound coast, which implies that transient feathered creatures might be found in spring and harvest time, once in a while in tremendous numbers when the climate conditions constrain them towards land. Numbers are moderately low in spring, yet harvest time can create huge "falls, for example, the several European robins on 1 October at least 1951 than 400 basic redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The normal feathered creatures are consistently joined by scarcer species like greenish songbirds, extraordinary dark shrikes or Richard's pipits. Seabirds might be located passing the Point, and relocating waders feed on the swamps during this season. Vagrant rarities have turned up when the climate is fitting, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and a birch flycatcher in 2010. Ornithologist and spearheading winged creature picture taker Emma Turner began ringing regular terns on the Point in 1909, and the utilization of this system for relocation examines has proceeded since. An outstanding recuperation was a Sandwich tern killed for nourishment in Angola, and a Radde's songbird caught for ringing in 1961 was just the second British record of this species around then. In the winter, the bogs hold brilliant plovers and wildfowl including basic shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, brent geese and basic greenish blue, while regular scoters, basic eiders, normal goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim seaward.
