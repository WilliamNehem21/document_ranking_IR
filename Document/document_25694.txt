Ultimate released "Sabre Wulf" for the ZX Spectrum in 1984 and the other Sabreman titles both released later that year. "Sabre Wulf" was Ultimate's first game to use what would become the company's standard price and mysterious, unadorned packaging. Retailing at Â£9.95, Ultimate nearly doubled its usual price in what they saw as a "bold step" to combat piracy. They expected legal owners to be more protective over letting friends copy their more expensive games. Ultimate had seen competitor prices slowly increasing and felt that the price was fair for their time invested. The game retailed in a large, high-quality cardboard box with a glossy instruction manual, both upgrades over typical game packaging. It became Ultimate's standard packaging for new games. The company's game packaging was nondescript and showed no screenshots of the in-game world. Ultimate's games also did not display internal credits. The company hired outside developers to complete "Sabre Wulf" ports for other computers. Paul Proctor wrote the BBC Micro conversion, and in 1985, Greg Duddle wrote the Commodore 64 conversion, which was licensed under Firebird. "Sabre Wulf" later appeared in the 1985 compilation "They Sold a Million", a collection of Spectrum games that had together sold a million units. When the compilation was released for the Amstrad CPC, "Sabre Wulf" was converted for the platform and eventually released in a standalone edition. "Sabre Wulf" also appeared alongside "Underwurlde", its sequel, in a Commodore 64 pack, and in the August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Ultimate and Rare titles, "Rare Replay".
