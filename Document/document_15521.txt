"I'm Not There" (2007) saw Moore work with Todd Haynes for the third time. The film explored the life of Bob Dylan, with Moore playing a character based on Joan Baez. In 2008, she starred with Mark Ruffalo in "Blindness", a dystopian thriller from the director Fernando Meirelles. The film was not widely seen, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Moore was not seen on screen again until late 2009, with three new releases. She had a supporting role in "The Private Lives of Pippa Lee", and then starred in the erotic thriller "Chloe" with Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. Shortly afterwards, she appeared in the well-received drama "A Single Man". Set in 1960s Los Angeles, the film starred Colin Firth as a homosexual professor who wishes to end his life. Moore played his best friend, "a fellow English expat and semi-alcoholic divorcee", a character that Tom Ford, the film's writer-director, created with her in mind. Leslie Felperin of "Variety" commented that it was Moore's best role in "some time", and was impressed by the "extraordinary emotional nuance" of her performance. "A Single Man" was selected as one of the top 10 films of 2009 by the American Film Institute, and Moore received a fifth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film.
