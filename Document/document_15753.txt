White was only able to offer his writers one cent per word, which was substantially lower than the leading magazines in the fieldâ"Analog Science Fiction and Fact" paid five cents, and "Galaxy" and "Fantasy & Science Fiction" paid three. Most stories would only be submitted to White once the higher-paying markets had rejected them, but among the rejects White was sometimes able to find experimental material that he liked. For example, Piers Anthony had been unable to sell an early fantasy novel, "Hasan"; White saw a review of the manuscript and promptly acquired it for "Fantastic", where it was serialized starting in the December 1969 issue. White also took care to establish relationships with newer writers. White bought Gordon Eklund's first story, "Dear Aunt Annie", it appeared in the April 1970 issue and was nominated for a Nebula award. Eklund was unwilling to become a full-time writer, despite this success, because of the financial risks, so White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in "Amazing" and "Fantastic" over the next few years. In addition to experimental work, White was able to obtain material by some of the leading sf writers of the day, including Brian Aldiss and John Brunner. White also acquired some early work by writers who became better known in other fields: Roger Ebert sold two stories in the early 1970s to "Fantastic"; the first, "After the Last Mass", appeared in the February 1972 issue; and in 1975 White bought Ian McEwan's second story, "Solid Geometry". It was included in "First Love, Last Rites", McEwan's first short story collection, which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976.
