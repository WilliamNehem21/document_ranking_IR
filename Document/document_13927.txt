After the show-taking execution, Reprise Records consented to appropriate "Are You Experienced". In any case, in spite of the expanded mindfulness that the Experience's execution at Monterey gave, the second Experience single, "Purple Haze"/"The Wind Cries Mary", discharged in the US on August 16, 1967, slowed down at number 65 on the "Board" Hot 100. In spite of the fact that the single performed ineffectively in the US graphs, its quality on underground FM radio stations, which were changing from simple tuning in and traditional music organizations to collection cuts, essentially supported offers of the LP. Repeat distributed a $20,000 special spending plan for the LP, which was an exceptional sum for a problematic craftsman. Discharged in the US on August 23 by Reprise, "Are You Experienced" achieved number five on the "Bulletin" 200. The collection stayed on "Billboard"s collection graph for 106 weeks, 27 of those in the Top 40. The North American version of "Are You Experienced" highlighted another spread by Karl Ferris and another track list, with Reprise excluding "Red House", "Recall", and "Would you be able to See Me", and including the initial three A-sides discarded from the UK discharge: "Hello Joe", "Purple Haze", and "The Wind Cries Mary".
