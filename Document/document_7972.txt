Practically all pinnipeds have fur garments, the special case being the walrus, which is just inadequately secured. Indeed, even some completely furred species (especially ocean lions) are less haired than most land well evolved creatures. In species that live on ice, youthful little guys have thicker coats than grown-ups. The individual hairs on the coat, referred to all in all as lanugo, can trap heat from daylight and keep the puppy warm. Pinnipeds are ordinarily countershaded, and are darker hued dorsally and lighter hued ventrally, which serves to dispense with shadows brought about by light sparkling over the sea water. The unadulterated white hide of harp seal little guys disguises them in their Arctic condition. A few animal groups, for example, lace seals, ringed seals and panther seals, have examples of differentiating light and dim tinge. All completely furred species shed; phocids shed once every year, while otariids step by step shed all year. Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat known as lard that is especially thick in phocids and walruses. Fat serves both to keep the creatures warm and to give vitality and sustenance when they are fasting. It can comprise as much as half of a pinniped's body weight. Little guys are brought into the world with just a slight layer of fat, yet a few species adjust for this with thick lanugos.
