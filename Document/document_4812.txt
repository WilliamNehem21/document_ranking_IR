Instructing duties left MacLaren inaccessible for the beginning of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Despite the fact that he had just batted once in the season, he was picked to play in the second Test match of the late spring among England and Australia, a choice made disputable by his absence of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England group was picked by the Lancashire advisory group, who perceived that MacLaren would draw in observers as a neighborhood player. He was rejected by the principal ball he looked in the main innings, and scored 15 keeps running in the second as England were vanquished. Soon after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to an attract a match they appeared to probably lose. This was sufficient for him to hold his place in the group for the last Test coordinate, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted viably for the remainder of the period, completing with 713 keeps running for Lancashire at 54.85. Pundits adulated his batting, yet his unlucky deficiencies may have kept the group from winning the Championship; they completed second. In all top of the line matches, he scored 922 keeps running at 36.88.
