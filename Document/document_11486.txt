The achievement did not keep going long, as the Russian 27th Rifle Division pivoted and landed at Radzymin in the nick of time for its 81st Brigade to drive the depleted Polish powers back towards the town of SÃÂupno. Undermined by further assaults from SÃÂupno and Wieliszew, the 85th Regiment withdrew in the wake of enduring overwhelming setbacks, including the leader of the first Battalion, Captain Ryszard Downar-Zapolski. This time the Soviet 81st Rifle Brigade (27th Rifle Division) sought after the Poles and figured out how to pierce Polish barriers close WÃÂ³lka RadzymiÃÂska and DÃÂbkowizna, getting during that time line of safeguards, which were the last before as far as possible. The Polish base camp at Warsaw was "petrified to know about the total annihilation of the nineteenth [Lithuanian-Belarusian] Division", a report that luckily for the Poles ended up being false. The risk toward the northern flank was stopped, with overwhelming losses on the two sides, on account of the intercession of the division's leader Jan RzÃÂdkowski, just as Front boss JÃÂ³zef Haller, who landed on the war zone to by and by sort out a specially appointed line of protection west of WÃÂ³lka RadzymiÃÂska, with Polish ordnance units shelling the propelling Russians with direct shoot. The Soviet development was ended, and this time mayhem in the Polish positions was maintained a strategic distance from, however again absence of fortifications behind the principle line of resistances demonstrated a significant issue.
