The spores are barely ellipsoid to ovoid, meager walled, hyaline (translucent), with measurements of 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5.5 by 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ ÃÂµm. At the point when recolored with Melzer's reagent, the spores turn a light blue shading. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, measure 16Ã¢ÂÂ 20 by 3.5Ã¢ÂÂ 4ÃÂ ÃÂµm, and decrease progressively towards the base. Cystidia are not separated in this species. The top surface is made of a fingernail skin of outspread, to some degree agglutinated, rather coarse hyphae that vary mainly in size from the fundamental tissueÃ¢ÂÂat first 1Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ ÃÂµm in breadth, getting to be 5Ã¢ÂÂ 7ÃÂ ÃÂµm wide in the hidden tissue. The hyphae are clipped, and encrusted with shallow unpredictably formed masses that are most obvious in the surface cells. The gill tissue is made of hyphae that venture descending from the top and orchestrated in a subparallel style, implying that the hyphae are for the most part parallel to each other and are somewhat interlaced. The hyphae are braced, with a restricted, spread minimal subhymenium (a limited zone of little, short hyphae promptly underneath the hymenium) made out of hyphae 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ ÃÂµm in distance across. The conidia are 8.5Ã¢ÂÂ 12 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ÃÂµm, shelled nut molded, non-amyloid (not changing shading when recolored with Melzer's reagent), cinched, and delivered by discontinuity of the coarse mycelium. Cinch associations are available in the hyphae. Abiogenetic spores are 10.0Ã¢ÂÂ 15.5 by 3Ã¢ÂÂ 4ÃÂ ÃÂµm, ellipsoid to elongated, non-amyloid, and contain granular substance. The grayish shade of the organic product bodies is brought about by encrusted colors (crystalline totals of color atoms, conceivably melanin) that happen all through the tissue of the stem and top, including the gills; these colors are missing in "Collybia" species.
