The works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. "Le Chevalier d'Harmental" (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true opÃ©ra comique ("in a somewhat pretentious style") was a failure, and an unpretentious opÃ©rette in the same year, "La FiancÃ©e en loterie", fared no better. After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes "Les P'tites Michu" (1897) as "a sensational hit", and Harding calls it the best of Messager's opÃ©rettes so far (classing "Le Basoche" as opÃ©ra comique, as did its composer). The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Traubner describes the piece as "one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better". Setting a scene in the market of Les Halles was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: "clever, liltingÂ ... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain". He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic.
