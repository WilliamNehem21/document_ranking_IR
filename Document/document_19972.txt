During the inquest evidence was taken from George Purcell, the stoker on "Bywell Castle", who, on the night of the sinking, had told several people that the captain and crew of the ship were drunk. Under oath he changed his claims, and stated that they were sober, and that he had no recollection of claiming that anyone was drunk. Evidence given by other members of "Bywell Castle"s crew showed it had been Purcell that had been drunk; one crewman said that "Purcell was like the generality of firemen. He was rather the worse for drink, but not so bad that he could not take his watch". Evidence was also taken concerning the state of the Thames at the point the ship sank, and of the construction and stability of "Princess Alice". On 14 November, after twelve hours of discussion, the inquest released its verdict; four members of the nineteen-member jury refused to sign the statement. Their verdict was:
That the death of the said William Beachey and others was occasioned by drowning in the waters of the River Thames from a collision that occurred after sunset between a steam vessel called the "Bywell Castle" and a steam vessel called the "Princess Alice" whereby the "Princess Alice" was cut in two and sunk, such collision not being wilful; that the "Bywell Castle" did not take the necessary precaution of easing, stopping and reversing her engines in time and that the "Princess Alice" contributed to the collision by not stopping and going astern; that all collisions in the opinion of the jury might in future be avoided if proper and stringent rules and regulations were laid down for all steam navigation on the River Thames.
