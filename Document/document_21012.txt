Meanwhile, Kondo ordered Abe's Vanguard force to race ahead to try to intercept and engage the U.S. warships. Kondo also brought his own Advanced force forward at maximum speed so that "JunyÅ"s aircraft could join in the attacks on the U.S. ships. At 08:10, "ShÅkaku" launched a second wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 19 dive bombers and five Zeros, and "Zuikaku" launched 16 torpedo bombers and four Zeros at 08:40. Thus, by 09:10 the Japanese had 110 aircraft on the way to attack the U.S. carriers.
The U.S. strike aircraft were running about 20 minutes behind the Japanese. Believing that a speedy attack was more important than a massed attack, and because they lacked fuel to spend time assembling prior to the strike, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships, rather than forming into a single large strike force. The first groupâconsisting of 15 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, six Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, and eight Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, led by Lieutenant Commander William J. "Gus" Widhelm from "Hornet"âwas on its way by about 08:00. A second groupâconsisting of three SBDs, nine TBFs (including the Air Group Commander's), and eight Wildcats from "Enterprise"âwas off by 08:10. A third groupâwhich included nine SBDs, ten TBFs (including the Air Group Commander's), and seven F4Fs from "Hornet"âwas on its way by 08:20.
