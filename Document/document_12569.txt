Republicans restricted the endorsement procedure, and were angered that the Democrats were endeavoring to overhaul the whole constitution without calling a protected tradition, as had been called for in the state's two past constitutions. Marshall contended that no tradition was required in light of the fact that the current constitution did not call for one. Republicans prosecuted the issue and the Marion County Circuit Court allowed an order expelling the constitution from the 1912 tally. Marshall bid, however the Indiana Supreme Court maintained the choice in a judgment which expressed that the Constitution of Indiana couldn't be supplanted altogether without an established tradition, in view of the point of reference set by Indiana's initial two constitutions. Marshall was irate with the choice and conveyed a discourse assaulting the court and blaming it for violating its position. He propelled a last intrigue to the United States Supreme Court yet left office in January 1913 while the case was all the while pending. Soon thereafter, the court declined the intrigue, finding that the issue was inside the sole locale of the state courts. Marshall was disillusioned with the result. Ensuing researchers, for example, Linda Gugin and legitimate master James St. Claire have called the procedure and the record "genuinely imperfect" and contended that had the constitution been received, vast parts would presumably have been ruled unlawful by the government courts.
