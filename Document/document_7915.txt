The firm record by Plutarch, which manages this bit of the legend, contrasts in numerous regards from the known Egyptian sources. SetÃ¢ÂÂwhom Plutarch, utilizing Greek names for a significant number of the Egyptian divinities, alludes to as "Typhon"Ã¢ÂÂ contrives against Osiris with seventy-two unspecified accessories, just as a ruler from old Aethiopia (Nubia). Set has a detailed chest made to accommodate Osiris' careful estimations and after that, at a feast, pronounces that he will give the chest as a blessing to whoever fits inside it. The visitors, thusly, lie inside the pine box, yet none fit inside aside from Osiris. When he rests in the chest, Set and his assistants pummel the spread shut, seal it, and toss it into the Nile. With Osiris' body inside, the chest drifts out into the ocean, touching base at the city of Byblos, where a tree develops around it. The ruler of Byblos has the tree chopped down and made into a column for his royal residence, still with the chest inside. Isis must expel the chest from inside the tree so as to recover her significant other's body. Having taken the chest, she leaves the tree in Byblos, where it turns into an object of love for local people. This scene, which isn't known from Egyptian sources, gives an etiological clarification for a clique of Isis and Osiris that existed in Byblos in Plutarch's time and conceivably as ahead of schedule as the New Kingdom.
