On 23 March 1912, during fleet training, "Elsass" accidentally collided with a Swedish steamshipââin heavy fog in the western entrance to the Skagerrak. "Pollux" was badly damaged in the accident and sank, though "Elsass" was able to take off her crew. In April, "Elsass" served as a target ship during gunfire training with the armored cruiser in a demonstration held off the Faroe Islands. On the 29th of the month, the new dreadnought battleship replaced "Elsass" in the I Squadron, and the latter had her crew reduced. On 24 August, the ship received her full complement again, to allow "Elsass" to take part in the annual maneuvers with the newly formed III Squadron. She also came under the temporary command of "KzS" Leberecht Maass. After the exercises, the squadron was dissolved, and on 29 September "Elsass" again had her crew reduced. She returned to active duty on 1 December, when she was assigned to the V Division of the III Squadron, along with her sister ship and the new dreadnought . The ships began the year with individual training, followed by divisional exercises in the Baltic later in January 1913. In early March, fleet exercises were held in the North Sea. "Elsass" was sent to Kiel on 17 March to begin preparations for her decommissioning, as her place in the division was taken by the new dreadnought . On 13 May, "Elsass" was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea. Effective 15 October, she was assigned to the "Marinestation der Ostsee" (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea).
