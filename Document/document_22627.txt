Beginning with "Caged Bird", Angelou used the same "writing ritual" for many years. She would get up at five in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff were instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, "Roget's Thesaurus", and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. She averaged 10â12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. Lupton stated that this ritual indicated "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to "enchant" herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to "relive the agony, the anguish, the "Sturm und Drang"". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in "Caged Bird", to "tell the human truth" about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about "Caged Bird": "...Though easily read, [it] is no 'easy read'". Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in itâha! It's so delicious!" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in "telling the truth".
