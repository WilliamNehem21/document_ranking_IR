The disappointment of the Arab attack prompted a significant change in the idea of fighting among Byzantium and the Caliphate. The Muslim objective of success of Constantinople was viably relinquished, and the wilderness between the two realms balanced out along the line of the Taurus and Antitaurus Mountains, over which the two sides kept on propelling customary strikes and counter-attacks. In this ceaseless outskirt fighting, wilderness towns and fortifications changed hands as often as possible, however the general layout of the fringe stayed unaltered for more than two centuries, until the Byzantine triumphs of the tenth century. The eastern armadas of the Caliphate entered a century-long decay; just the Ifriqiyan armadas kept up standard strikes on Byzantine Sicily, until they excessively died down after 752. Undoubtedly, except for the development of the Abbasid armed force under Harun al-Rashid up to Chrysopolis in 782, no other Arab armed force could ever come quite close to the Byzantine capital again. Thus, on the Muslim side the attacks themselves in the end gained a practically custom character, and were esteemed for the most part as a show of the proceeding "jihad" and supported by the Caliph as an image of his job as the pioneer of the Muslim people group.
