The report containing the Ordinances is dated 5 October, and contains forty-one articles. In the introduction, the Ordainers voiced their worry over what they saw as the insidiousness councilors of the ruler, the trickiness of the military circumstance abroad, and the risk of insubordination at home over the severe prises. The articles can be isolated into various gatherings, the biggest of which manages constraints on the forces of the lord and his authorities, and the substitution of these forces with baronial control. It was appointed that the ruler ought to delegate his officers just "by the advice and consent of the baronage, and that in parliament." Furthermore, the lord could never again do battle without the assent of the baronage, nor would he be able to make changes of the coinage. Also, it was chosen that parliament ought to be held in any event once per year. Parallel to these choices were changes of the imperial accounts. The Ordinances restricted what was viewed as extortionate prises and traditions, and in the meantime announced that incomes were to be paid legitimately into the Exchequer. This was a response to the rising pattern of accepting incomes legitimately into the imperial family unit; making every single regal fund responsible to the exchequer permitted more noteworthy open examination.
