In July 1623, two additional boats arrived: the "Anne", under the order of Captain "Ace" William Peirce and Master John Bridges; and the "Little James", under the direction of Captain Emanuel Altham. These boats conveyed 96 new pioneers, among them Leideners, including William Bradford's future spouse Alice, and William and Mary Brewster's little girls Patience and Fear. A portion of the travelers who touched base on the "Anne" were either caught off guard for outskirts life or unfortunate increments to the province and came back to England the following year. As indicated by Gleason Archer, "the individuals who remained were not willing to join the state under the terms of the concurrence with the Merchant Adventurers. They had set out for America upon a comprehension with the Adventurers that they may settle in their very own network, or if nothing else be free from the bonds by which the Plymouth homesteaders were subjugated. A letter routed to the homesteaders and marked by thirteen of the traders presented these certainties and asked acknowledgment of the new comers on the predetermined terms." The fresh debuts were designated land in the zone of the Eel River, known as Hobs Hole, which moved toward becoming Wellingsley, a mile south of Plymouth Rock.
