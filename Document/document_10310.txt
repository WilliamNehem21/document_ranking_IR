Specialized issues over the decoration and the work on the mountain caused strains, and political contrasts between Borglum, a Republican, and Randolph, a functioning Democrat, prompted poor relations between the two. Borglum, Venable, and Randolph sponsored diverse KKK individuals for national authority. Both Borglum and the Association blamed each other for join; the stone carver recommended that he structure a syndicate to buy the half dollars from the Mint and pitch them with the benefits to be connected straightforwardly to development costs. Randolph derided the recommendation, expressing that it would permit Borglum to cut "whatever he satisfied on the mountain". Borglum blamed Randolph for utilizing gifts for his very own advantage, and spending unreservedly on a business ledger. These disputes wound up open, and in February 1925, the Association terminated Borglum. Randolph expressed, as one explanation behind expelling the artist, that Borglum had taken seven months to plan the coin, when, he stated, any equipped craftsman could have done it in three weeks. He blamed Borglum for deferring with the goal that the Association would be humiliated.
