"Akagi" was laid down as an at Kure, Japan, on 6 December 1920. The ship was named after Mount Akagi, following the Japanese ship-naming conventions for battlecruisers. Construction was halted, however, when Japan signed the Washington Naval Treaty on 6 February 1922. The treaty placed restrictions on the construction of battleships and battlecruisers although it authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls under construction into aircraft carriers of up to displacement. The IJN had decided, following the launch of its first aircraft carrier, , to construct two larger, faster carriers for operations with major fleet units. The incomplete hulls of and "Akagi" were thus selected for completion as the two large carriers under the 1924 fleet construction program. Â¥24.7 million was originally budgeted to complete "Akagi" as a battlecruiser and an estimated Â¥8 million had been expended when construction stopped in February 1922. Shortly thereafter, the Diet approved an additional Â¥90 million to complete "Akagi" and "Amagi" as carriers.
Construction of "Akagi" as an aircraft carrier began on 19 November 1923. "Amagi"s hull was damaged beyond economically feasible repair in the Great KantÅ earthquake of 1 September 1923 and was broken up and scrapped. "Akagi", the only remaining member of her class, was launched as a carrier on 22 April 1925 and commissioned at Kure Naval Arsenal on 25 March 1927, although trials continued through November 1927. She was the second carrier to enter service with the IJN, after "HÅshÅ" and before (which replaced "Amagi").
