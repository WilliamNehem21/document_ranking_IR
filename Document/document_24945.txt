In early 2008, Rihanna unveiled a new song titled "Take a Bow", which premiered on February 14, 2008 on the KIIS-FM radio show "On Air with Ryan Seacrest". MTV News reported that the track would serve as the lead single from "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded", a reissue of the original album to mark its first anniversary. Rihanna further announced that apart from "Take a Bow", the expanded album would contain two more songs, one of which was a duet with American pop rock band Maroon 5, to supplement the original track listing. "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" was first released digitally on June 2, 2008 in certain countries, including Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The album was released physically on June 13 in Germany. On June 17, it was released in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A DVD containing behind-the-scenes footage of Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour (2007â09) was included in a special version launched in the US for a limited time. Rihanna subsequently hosted a promotion party for "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" in New York City, which featured several celebrity guests, including LeToya Luckett, Teyana Taylor, and Wynter Gordon.
Four new songs were recorded for "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded": "Disturbia", "Hatin' on the Club", "If I Never See Your Face Again" (with Maroon 5) and "Take a Bow". All were initially confirmed for inclusion on the album, though "Hatin' on the Club" was removed for unspecified reasons. The song was leaked online in January 2009 on "Big Mike & DJ Neptune's R&B Kings Part Two" mixtape.
