In the mean time, the development of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the once in the past Hungarian-involved Yugoslav area of Baranja made holding the line of the Danube basic for the Germans. Toward the beginning of November the Soviet troops built up a bridgehead over the Danube from Apatin (in advanced Serbia). From 9 November ahead, the division was submitted in a few phases toward the Eastern Front, beginning with the surveillance legion which went energetically at DÃÂ¡rda west of the Apatin bridgehead on 10 November. They were trailed by a gathering of three contingents (I/27, II/28 and II/28), a mounted guns brigade (III/AR 13) and pioneer support. Known as "Kampfgruppe Hanke" after their officer Hans Hanke, they moved from the BrÃÂko bridgehead and joined a blocking position at PÃÂ©lmonostor on 14 November south-west of a second Soviet bridgehead that had been set up at Batina (in current Croatia). Subsequently, the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia. Inside seven days they were joined by the observation legion, which had vindicated itself well in battling west of Apatin. By 20 November, the Red Army was over the Danube in power at Batina. The next day "Kampfgruppe Hanke" was driven out of its positions, when the staying 200 troops pulled back. By 25 November the remainder of the division was en route from the Zagreb zone. The leftovers of "Kampfgruppe Hanke" were set under order of "Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister", pulling back similarly as SiklÃÂ³s in southern Hungary by 29 November.
