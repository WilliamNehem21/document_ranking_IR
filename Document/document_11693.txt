Churchill's last takeoff from political office came nearly sixteen months after the fact when, on 5 April 1955, he led his last bureau, right around a long time since he had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The next day he held a casual get-together for staff at Downing Street before heading to Chartwell. On being asked by a writer on entry how it felt never again to be Prime Minister, Churchill answered, "It's constantly decent to be home". For the following ten years, Churchill invested much energy at Chartwell, albeit both he and Lady Churchill likewise voyaged widely. His days there were spent composition, painting, playing bezique or sitting "by the fish lake, sustaining the brilliant orfe and pondering". Of his last a very long time at the house, Churchill's little girl, Mary Soames, reviewed, "in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'work cart' seat thinking about the perspective on the valley he had cherished for such a long time". On 13 October 1964, Churchill's last supper visitors at Chartwell were his previous essential private secretary Sir Leslie Rowan and his significant other. Woman Rowan later reviewed, "It was tragic to see such an extraordinary man become so delicate". The next week, progressively crippled, Churchill went out once and for all. His official biographer Martin Gilbert records Churchill was, "never to see his darling Chartwell again". After his demise in January 1965, Lady Churchill quickly surrendered her rent and displayed Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to general society in 1966, one year after Churchill's demise.
