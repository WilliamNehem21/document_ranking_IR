The cliffhanger, in which Rousseau and Karl are murdered and Alex calls out in edginess that she is Ben's little girl, picked up a blended reaction. In a 8.8 out of 10 survey, IGN's Chris Carabott called the scene "totally strange Ã¢ÂÂ¦ attached and vexing" as it "came at the most unusual minute". Jay Glatfelter of "The Huffington Post" considered the cliffhanger "a stunner"; he asked "do we truly mind [about Karl's death]? That is to say, he had a pleasant new hair style and all, yet he truly wasn't excessively intriguing of a character." Despite his evaluation that "this noteworthy scene was a fitting middle of the season finale", Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones composed that the "peak wasn't as powerful as one could have sought after, as the aggregate destinies of Alex, Danielle and the ultra-nonessential Karl don't awaken a lot of enthusiasm." Grading the scene as a "B", "Stimulation Weekly"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jeff Jensen was likewise unmoved with the cliffhanger and the characters conveying it; he felt that arrange administrators were halfway to fault for conflicting with the desire of the show's imaginative group to communicate "Meet Kevin Johnson" as a middle of the season debut instead of a middle of the season finale. Jensen censured the scene's one of a kind flashback group, remarking that it came up short on the standard thing "more profound, increasingly vivid experience [that] adorns the advancement of the narrating" of "Lost".
