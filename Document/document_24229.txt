The groundwork was laid in 1947, when Clark Publishing, the company that would publish the first issue of "Imagination", was incorporated in Evanston, Illinois, by Raymond Palmer. He worked for Ziff-Davis as the editor of "Amazing Stories" and did not leave until the end of 1949, but he launched two magazines under the Clark name before that date: "Fate", in the spring of 1948, and "Other Worlds", the first issue of which was dated November 1949. Both of these magazines listed their editor as "Robert N. Webster", a pseudonym Palmer adopted while he was still at Ziff-Davis because of the conflict of interest. The second issue of "Other Worlds" reported that Webster and Palmer were going to edit together; by the third issue, dated March 1950, the pretense had been dropped and although there was no masthead listing the editor, the editorial was simply signed "Rap" (for "Raymond A. Palmer"). At the 1949 World Science Fiction Convention in Cincinnati, held over the weekend of 3â5 September, Palmer announced that he had left Ziff-Davis and described his plans for Clark Publishing. He also met and hired Bea Mahaffey, a 21-year-old science fiction fan attending her first convention, as his assistant editor.
