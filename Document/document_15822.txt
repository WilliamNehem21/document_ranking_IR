Swift's vocals were described by Sophie Schillaci of "The Hollywood Reporter" as "sweet, but soft". The "Los Angeles Times" identified Swift's "defining" vocal gesture in studio recordings as "the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy". "Rolling Stone", in a "Speak Now" review, wrote: "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough." In another review of "Speak Now", "The Village Voice" wrote that her phrasing was previously "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean." "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote that her live vocals are "fine", but they do not match those of her peers. In 2009, Ken TuckerÂ of "Entertainment Weekly" described Swift's vocals as "flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt". However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.
