After Frederick closed the tranquility on 25 December 1748, Seydlitz came back with his squadron to Trebnitz. In the ensuing long periods of harmony, Seydlitz created adaptable mounted force strategies. He amassed an arrangement on strategic structure and preparing for the Prussian mounted force and displayed it to the King. Frederick affirmed the methods and Seydlitz set up a thorough preparing program. He would leave his own home by bouncing the entryway; he required comparable horsemanship from every one of his men, paying little heed to whether they were cuirassiers, hussars or dragoons. They must be equipped for dashing crosswise over broken fields, wheeling in development, and riding in close activity. Moreover, they must be set up to help any development of infantry, or to respond to any activity from the foe. Under Seydlitz's heading, Prussian mounted force figured out how to utilize just their swords, not the guns or carbines that couldn't be shot with precision or then must be reloaded. Frederick set up straw fakers for his troopers to shoot; their shots were woefully mistaken, however Seydlitz's strategies showed that the troopers could hit their objective with a sword inevitably. For the most part, rangers steeds were the tough warm-blood Trakehners, from Frederick's stud ranch in Trakenhen, East Prussia.
