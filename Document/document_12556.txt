At the point when Australia pronounced war in September 1939, Flight Lieutenant Balmer was an individual from No.ÃÂ 22 Squadron, which led seaside observation out of Richmond with Ansons and, later, CAC Wirraways. Elevated to squadron pioneer, he was presented on RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, on 1ÃÂ June 1940, turning into the debut leader of No.ÃÂ 13 Squadron, which had been "tore up" from the base's inhabitant unit, No.ÃÂ 12 Squadron. Holding its Wirraway flight, No.ÃÂ 12 Squadron surrendered its two flights of Ansons to the new development; these were supplanted soon thereafter by increasingly competent Lockheed Hudsons. From August 1940 until February 1941, No.ÃÂ 13 Squadron was in charge of watching the ocean paths off Australia's north coast. Every so often, Balmer identified Japanese luggers that were unlawfully angling in Australian waters and, as per Mark Johnston, overflew them at such a low height, that "his Hudson's slipstream shook the vessels savagely" and the group "shook their clench hands" at him. He was elevated to brief wing administrator in April. The next month, No.ÃÂ 13 Squadron directed acquaintance flights over the Dutch East Indies. Balmer gave over order of the unit in August, and exchanged to a contact post at Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin.
