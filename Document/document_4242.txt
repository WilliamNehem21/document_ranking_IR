A second, conceivably pre-twelfth century mention to the CÃÂ¦dmon story is found in two Latin writings related with the Old Saxon "Heliand" lyric. These writings, the "Praefatio" (Preface) and "Versus de Poeta" (Lines about the writer), clarify the sources of an Old Saxon scriptural interpretation (for which the "Heliand" is the main known hopeful) in language emphatically reminiscent of, and without a doubt now and again indistinguishable to, Bede's record of CÃÂ¦dmon's vocation. As indicated by the writing "Praefatio", the Old Saxon ballad was formed by a famous vernacular artist at the direction of the sovereign Louis the Pious; the content at that point includes that this artist had remained unaware of vernacular piece until he was requested to interpret the statutes of holy law into vernacular tune in a fantasy. The "Versus de Poeta" contain an extended record of the fantasy itself, including that the writer had been a herder before his motivation and that the motivation itself had gotten through the mechanism of a wonderful voice when he nodded off in the wake of feeding his cows. While our insight into these writings depends completely on a sixteenth century version by Flacius Illyricus, both are generally expected on semantic and linguistic grounds to be of medieval arrangement. This evident obligation to the CÃÂ¦dmon story concurs with semantic proof authenticated by Green showing the impact of Anglo Saxon scriptural verse and wording on early mainland Germanic literary works.
