Trumbull and Dykstra found the Magicam models hazardous. The Klingon cruiser's lighting was dim to the point that there was no real way to make them sufficiently brilliant on film. As Trumbull additionally felt the "Enterprise"s lights were illsuited for his needs, he overhauled the two models. He scrutinized that the "Undertaking" could be voyaging a long time from any wellspring of light yet still be completely lit up. Rather than having the ship totally dull put something aside for viewports, Trumbull thought of an arrangement of self-light; he envisioned the ship as something like an oceanliner, "a great woman of the oceans during the evening". A comparative strategy was utilized on the Klingon cruiser demonstrate, yet he made it less sufficiently bright to pass on an unexpected look in comparison to the perfect visuals of the FederationÃ¢ÂÂthe cruiser was intended to bring out "an adversary submarine in World War II that has been out adrift for a really long time". The models were recorded in numerous passes and composited together in after creation; different goes with just the model's lighting running were added to the first go for the last look. The Klingon cruiser arrangement was created to maintain a strategic distance from an opening like "Star Wars", with one model utilized for every one of the three found in the film.
