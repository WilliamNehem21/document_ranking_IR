"Weird Tales" was by now well established, but in 1931 Clayton finally gave it some direct competition with "Strange Tales", which was also edited by Bates. Like its competitor, "Strange Tales" frequently published science fiction as well as fantasy; as with "Astounding" it paid better rates than the competition, and as a result attracted some good writers, including Jack Williamson, whose "Wolves of Darkness", about an invasion by beings from another dimension, is one of its better-remembered stories. "Strange Tales" did not last long: by late 1932, Clayton was in financial difficulties, and "Astounding" switched to a bimonthly schedule. Already bimonthly, "Strange Tales" also reduced its publication frequency. The bulk of Clayton's debts were owed to his printer, which Clayton tried to acquire to prevent it buying out his publishing house, but this proved a disastrous move. He lacked funds to complete the transaction, and was forced to declare bankruptcy. The January 1933 issue of both magazines was intended to be the last, but enough stories remained in inventory to produce one more issue of "Astounding", which appeared in March 1933. Street & Smith acquired "Astounding" and "Strange Tales" from the sale of Clayton's assets, and relaunched "Astounding" in October that year. "Strange Tales" did not reappear; Street & Smith decided to run the stories in "Strange Tales"' inventory in "Astounding" instead.
