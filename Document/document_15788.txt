The travel motif is a recurring theme in "Traveling Shoes", as evidenced in the book's title, but Angelou's primary motivation in living in Africa, as she told interviewer George Plimpton in 1990, was "trying to get home". Angelou not only related her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compared to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by Ernest Hemingway and Henry James. Angelou's issues were resolved at the end of "Traveling Shoes" when she decided to return to America. She called her departure a "second leave-taking", and compared it to the last time she left her son with his grandmother in "Singin' and Swingin'" when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors. As Lupton states, "Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World". Even though Angelou's sixth autobiography "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" took place in her home country, the travel motif continued. Reviewer Patricia Elam described "Song" as a "journey through an authentic and artistic life".
