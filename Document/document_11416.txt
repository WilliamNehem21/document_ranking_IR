The expression "Amid the ideal opportunity for which he was chosen" has not been dubious. Equity Joseph Story has elucidated in his "Editorials on the Constitution of the United States" that the excluding occasion terminates at the finish of the chosen term in which it happened. This view is ordinarily acknowledged. Additionally, Department of Justice memoranda, laying out authority sentiments by United States Attorney General, hold that "the Ineligibility Clause covers just increments amid the term that a Member of Congress is [or would be] right now serving". This rule was connected, for instance, to the topic of whether President Clinton could designate Representative Bill Richardson as Ambassador to the United Nations regardless of a pay increment before his present term, and whether President Harding could choose Senator William Kenyon as a Judge notwithstanding the Congressional increment of legal pay rates amid his past term. Feelings issued by the Clinton organization Office of Legal Counsel frequently assumed the utilization of the condition, and yielded that "[t]he custom of deciphering the Clause has been 'formalistic' as opposed to 'utilitarian". Another illumination came in 1969, when recently re-chose Representative Melvin Laird was President-elect Nixon's decision for Secretary of Defense and Congress was relied upon to raise the compensation of Cabinet individuals in the new term. Lawyer General Ramsey Clark gave an official feeling, which Laird pursued, that Laird could be confirmed and serve in the new term from January 3 to January 20 (when Nixon would get down to business) without crossing paths with the Clause, as long as he joined the bureau before the salary increase became effective.
