Early on AugustÂ 31, a reconnaissance flight indicated that Emily had become a CategoryÂ 2 hurricane on the SaffirâSimpson scale, and further intensification was expected because of warm waters. Later that day, reconnaissance reported that Emily had achieved a peak intensity of , a CategoryÂ 3 major hurricane; the aircraft also observed flight-level winds of . At its peak, the center of the hurricane was located 23Â mi (37Â km) east of Hatteras Island while turning northward. Its eye measured 45Â mi (75Â km) in diameter, and a portion moved over Hatteras and the Pamlico Sound, constituting a direct hit but not a landfall. After affecting the Outer Banks, Emily continued around the large high-pressure area, turning northeastward into an area with cooler ocean temperatures. The eye nonetheless remained distinct, and Emily maintained much of its intensity through SeptemberÂ 2. Later that day, the hurricane turned sharply eastward in response to a trough nearby. Wind shear over the region increased, weakening Emily as its eye feature quickly dissipated. Emily turned to the southeast and diminished to a tropical storm on SeptemberÂ 3, about 500Â mi (800Â km) northeast of Bermuda, with a significant deterioration of the convection. Once again becoming nearly stationary, Emily further weakened to a tropical depression late on SeptemberÂ 4, after only a small area of thunderstorms remained near the center. It accelerated toward the northeast and became extratropical on SeptemberÂ 6, dissipating shortly thereafter.
