Williams was advanced chief on 5ÃÂ January 1916. He was selected a flight leader in No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (AFC), which was at first numbered 67ÃÂ Squadron Royal Flying Corps by the British. The unit left Australia in March 1916 with no air ship; in the wake of landing in Egypt it got B.E.2 warriors, a sort inadequate in speed and mobility, and which needed forward-shooting assault rifles. Williams composed that in battle with the German Fokkers, "our battling noticeable all around was of brief length however could mean a brisk end", and that when it came to besieging, he and his individual pilots "depended for the most part on karma". He further cited a clichÃÂ© in the Flying Corps that "if another pilot got past his initial three days without being shot down he was fortunate; in the event that he overcame three weeks he was progressing admirably and in the event that he traversed three months he was set". Williams and different Australians were at first engaged with segregated assignments around the Suez Canal, appended to different Royal Flying Corps (RFC) units. No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron started to work deliberately in December 1916, supporting the Allied development on Palestine. Williams finished his RFC connection in February 1917.
