By June the stench from the waterway had turned out to be bad to the point that business in Parliament was influenced, and the window ornaments on the stream side of the structure were absorbed lime chloride to defeat the smell. The measure was not effective, and discourses were held about potentially moving the matter of government to Oxford or St Albans. "The Examiner" announced that Disraeli, on going to one of the panel rooms, left in the blink of an eye a while later with different individuals from the board of trustees, "with a mass of papers in a single hand, and with his pocket cloth connected to his nose" on the grounds that the smell was so unpleasant. The disturbance to its authoritative work prompted questions being brought up in the House of Commons. As per "Hansard", the Member of Parliament (MP) John Brady educated Manners that individuals were unfit to utilize either the Committee Rooms or the Library as a result of the stench, and asked the clergyman "if the respectable Lord has taken any measures for moderating the emanation and ending the annoyance". Habits answered that the Thames was not under his locale. After four days a second MP said to Manners that "By an unreasonable inventiveness, one of the noblest of waterways has been changed into a cesspool, and I wish to ask whether Her Majesty's Government plan to find a way to cure the underhanded?" Manners brought up "that Her Majesty's Government have nothing whatever to do with the condition of the Thames". The ironical magazine "Punch" remarked that "The one retaining point in the two Houses of ParliamentÃÂ ... was the Conspiracy to Poison question. Of the blame of that old guilty party, Father Thames, there was the most plentiful proof".
