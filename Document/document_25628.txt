"Rare Replay" Nintendo 64 emulation pleased critics. "Ars Technica" wrote that the polygonal upgrades compensated for the "blurry" and "pixelated" source material, though the Nintendo 64 multiplayer modes lacked the frame rate upgrades that their single-player modes received. "Kotaku" noted that the Xbox One had more Nintendo 64 re-releases than Nintendo's Wii U Virtual Console. Its reviewer found the in-game Xbox One button prompts to be "delightful anachronisms". "Ars Technica" reviewer commended Rare's choice of the Nintendo 64 version of "Conker's Bad Fur Day" over its updated but censored Xbox re-release. Initial reviews found "Jet Force Gemini" unplayable without dual thumbstick controls, which were later added. While Machkovech ("Ars Technica") considered Rare's Microsoft games to the weakest of the lot, Whitehead ("Eurogamer") found them even more enjoyable in the context of "Rare Replay". Reviewers noted frame rate and technical issues in the Xbox 360 emulation and did not like its separation from the rest of the compilation. Kollar ("Polygon") called the Xbox 360 game installation process needlessly complex, and Marty Sliva ("IGN") did not like how the Xbox 360 startup sequence interrupted the compilation's cohesion. He added that the emulated Xbox 360 experience was subpar compared to the unemulated experience.
