In 1857, the Supreme Court held in "Dred Scott v. Sandford" that African slaves, previous slaves, and their relatives were not qualified to be natives. After the Civil War (1861Ã¢ÂÂ 65) and the subsequent annulment of subjection in the United States, steps were taken to allow citizenship to the liberated slaves. Congress previously authorized the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which incorporated a condition pronouncing "all people conceived in the United States and not expose to any outside power" to be natives. Indeed, even as the Civil Rights Act was being bantered in Congress, its rivals contended that the citizenship arrangement was illegal. In light of this worry, just as to ensure the new allow of citizenship for previous slaves from being canceled by a later Congress, the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution incorporated a Citizenship Clause, which would dig in the Constitution (and accordingly set past the future reach of Congress or the courts) an assurance of citizenship expressing that "All people conceived or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the locale thereof, are natives of the United States". The Fourteenth AmendmentÃ¢ÂÂincluding the Citizenship ClauseÃ¢ÂÂwas approved by state governing bodies and turned into a piece of the Constitution in 1868.
