Bannon followed "Odd Girl Out" with "I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman â Must Society Reject Me?)" in 1959. "I Am a Woman" (the working and common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as she finds herself in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character that proved to be her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mindÂ ... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." The resolution to "I Am a Woman" completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.
