Behring conducted one last operation from 13 to 17 April, with "Prinz Adalbert", "Thetis", and "LÃ¼beck", to support the minelayer , which laid a minefield off DagÃ¶. On the 20th, the "Admiralstab" instituted a reorganization of the Baltic Sea forces, and Behring was replaced with "Konteradmiral" Albert Hopman. At the same time, Michelsen was promoted to Hopman's chief of staff, with his place as "Prinz Adalbert"s commanding officer being taken by "KapitÃ¤n zur See" Wilhelm Bunnemann. The ship remained the flagship of the unit, and Hopman made his first cruise aboard the vessel from Kiel to Danzig on 27 April. At this time, "Generalfeldmarschall" (General Field Marshal) Paul von Hindenburg, the commander in chief of German forces on the Eastern Front, ordered a major assault on Libau. Hopman ordered his forces to support an attempt by the German Army to seize the city. The pre-dreadnoughts of the IV Battle Squadron and the IV Scouting Group were allocated to Hopman's command to provide additional support to the operation. The attack took place on 7 May, and consisted of "Prinz Adalbert" and the armored cruisers and "Prinz Heinrich", the elderly coast defense ship , and the cruisers "Augsburg", "Thetis", and "LÃ¼beck". They were escorted by a number of destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers. The bombardment went as planned, though the destroyer struck a mine in Libau's harbor, which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship. German ground forces were successful in their assault and they took the city.
