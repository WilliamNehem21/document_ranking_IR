Martin Conway depicts the depiction of an honorable man set apart by a grave articulation and profound "wrinkles furrowed by seventy years of work and distress". Conway trusted the quality of the picture is partially accomplished through DÃÂ¼rer's capacity to pass on this hardship, while in the meantime showing a man still permeated with hints of pride, and having "a thoughtful old face". Taking note of the undeniable fondness between the dad and child just as the half grin of the more established man, he thinks about whether that smile may have been conceived of Albrecht the Elder's fulfillment that his drudge has been compensated by a child of such ability, who was presently going to set out on the world for his "wanderjahr". A contributing component to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder prepared his child in his very own calling, as a gem specialist, yet at one point came to lament the decision of apprenticeship as the more youthful man was so clearly fit to drawing and painting. In any case, his child learned numerous aptitudes amid that period and it gave him an order with his hands that turned into a characterizing component of his work, particularly in his capacity as an etcher.
