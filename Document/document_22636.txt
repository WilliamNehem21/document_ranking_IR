Pink Floyd recorded "The Dark Side of the Moon" between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on "Dark Side" while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's "Dark Side" album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.
Released in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of "The Dark Side of the Moon" because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient. "Melody Maker"s Roy Hollingworth described side one as "utterly confusedÂ ... [and] difficult to follow", but praised side two, writing: "The songs, the soundsÂ ... [and] the rhythms were solidÂ ... [the] saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled". "Rolling Stone"s Loyd Grossman described it as "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement."
