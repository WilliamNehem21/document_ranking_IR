In past movies, Starfleet's scope of capital boats had been transcendently spoken to by the Constitution class "Endeavor" and only five other ship classes: the "Miranda" class from "" (spoken to by the USS "Dependent"), the "Excelsior" and the "Oberth" class "Grissom" from "", and the "Universe" and "Cloud" classes from "The Next Generation". ILM chief John Knoll demanded that "First Contact"s space fight demonstrate the expansiveness of Starfleet's ship setups. "Starfleet would most likely toss all that it could at the Borg, including ships we've never observed", he contemplated. "Also, since we figured a ton of the foundation activity in the space fight would should be finished with PC produced ships that should have been worked without any preparation at any rate, I understood there was no reason not to do some new structures." Alex Jaeger was selected special visualizations workmanship executive to the film and doled out the assignment of making four new starships. Principal needed boats that would appear to be unique from a separation, so the executive conceived different body profiles. Glade and Jaeger had chosen that the boats needed to comply with certain "Star Trek" deliver points of reference, with a saucer-like essential body and extended twist nacelles in sets. The "Akira" class highlighted the customary saucer area and nacelles joined with a sailboat style twofold body; the "Norway" class depended on the USS "Voyager"; the "Saber" class was a littler ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer segment; and the "Steamrunner" class included twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and associated by a designing segment in the back. Each plan was displayed as a three-dimensional advanced wire-outline show for use in the film.
