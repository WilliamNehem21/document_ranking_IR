Against the background of the quickly urbanizing United States of the 1920s, one house from the fake framework of present day, arranged America takes off in the fantasy of a lady who has devoured Welsh rarebit. "The Flying House" is rendered in careful reasonable detail. The house is traditional in each regardÃ¢ÂÂuntil the watcher achieves the upper room, where the lady's significant other is seen tending a colossal motor. He appends a propeller to a pole out front of the house, and tells his better half that his activities are in response to their proprietor's expectation to remove them over delinquency. He says he plans to "take the house", and the couple fly away to discover a spot where their proprietor will never discover themÃ¢ÂÂa marsh, the sea, even the moon, where they are pursued off by the Man in the Moon with a flyswatter. The movie hesitantly guides the watchers to see the quality and precision of the liveliness when the house takes off into space, pointing out the "exceptional bit of movement which pursues", precisely demonstrating the unrests of the Earth and Moon and the "lovely group of stars of Orion". The lady winds up on edge that they will move toward becoming "lost in the sky". At last, the house is struck by a military rocket, finishing the bad dream as the lady stirs in her bed.
