In 2003, Square, presently Square Enix, started a drive to start creating "polymorphic substance", an advertising and deals system to "[provide] surely understood properties on a few stages, enabling presentation of the items to as wide a crowd of people as would be prudent". The first of these was the "Gathering of Final Fantasy VII", and Square Enix expected to have crusades for different arrangement whereby various recreations in various classifications would be grown all the while. Albeit no such task for the "Mana" arrangement had been declared by this point, it was reported in late 2004 that an anonymous "Mana" amusement was being developed for the up and coming Nintendo DS stage. In mid 2005, Square Enix reported a ""World of Mana"" venture, the utilization of this "polymorphic substance" thought to the "Mana" establishment, which would incorporate a few recreations crosswise over various classifications and stages. These diversions, similarly as with the remainder of the arrangement, would not be immediate spin-offs or prequels to each other, regardless of whether showing up so at first look, however would rather share topical associations. The principal discharge in this undertaking and the 6th discharge in the "Mana" arrangement was declared in September 2005 as "Offspring of Mana" for the DS. Four amusements were discharged in 2006 and 2007 in the "Realm of Mana" subseries: "Offspring of Mana", "First light of Mana", and "Companions of Mana" in 2006, and "Legends of Mana" in 2007.
