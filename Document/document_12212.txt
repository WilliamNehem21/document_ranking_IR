The custom is the focal piece of the festival. Vespers change from spot to put as for the season of the start of the administration, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the flame typically comes after the administration, and is finished by a minister or by a regarded parishioner. Prior to the consuming, the tree might be processionally conveyed the congregation. On account of more than one badnjak, the trees are put in the state of a cross. The collected enthusiasts toss then into the flame their twig clusters, each speaking to a little badnjak. The sanctification or gift is performed by a cleric: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he articulates petitions, he pours wine and spreads nectar on it. Rather than applying wine and nectar, blessed water might be sprinkled on the tree by plunging a group of basil into a bowl with the water. This ceremony is for the most part performed after the putting on the flame, despite the fact that it might occur previously, in which case the sanctification might be performed in the congregation itself or in its yard.
