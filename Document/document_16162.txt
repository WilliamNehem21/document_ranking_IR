Following a police investigation that lasted over a year, on 21 August 1984 the trial against Heidemann and Kujau opened in Hamburg. Both men were charged with defrauding "Stern" of 9.3Â million DMs. Despite the seriousness of the charges facing the two men, Hamilton considers that "it also appeared clear that the trial was going to be a farce, a real slapstick affair that would enrage the judge and amuse the entire world." The proceedings lasted until July 1985, when both men were sent to prison: four years and eight months for Heidemann, four years and six months for Kujau. In September one of the supporting magistrates overseeing the case was replaced after he fell asleep; three days later the court were "amused" to see pictures of Idi Amin's underpants, which Heidemann had framed on his wall. At times the case "denigrated into a slanging match" between Kujau and Heidemann. In his summing up Judge Hans-Ulrich Schroeder said that "the negligence of "Stern" has persuaded me to soften the sentences against the two main co-conspirators." Heidemann was found guilty of stealing 1.7Â million DMs from "Stern"; Kujau guilty of receiving 1.5Â million DMs for his role in the forgeries. Despite the lengthy investigation and trial, at least fiveÂ million DMs remained unaccounted for.
