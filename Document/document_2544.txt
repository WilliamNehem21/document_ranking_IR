In the mid year of 1558, Knox distributed his best known leaflet, "The principal impact of the trumpet against the monstruous regiment of ladies". In calling the "routine" or principle of ladies "monstruous", he implied that it was "unnatural". Knox expresses that his motivation was to illustrate "how loathsome before God is the Empire or Rule of an evil lady, yea, of a traiteresse and jerk". The ladies rulers that Knox had as a primary concern were Queen Mary I of England and Mary of Guise, the Dowager Queen of Scotland and official for the benefit of her little girl, Mary, Queen of Scots. This scriptural position was not irregular in Knox's day; notwithstanding, even he knew that the handout was perilously subversive. He in this way distributed it secretly and did not tell Calvin, who prevented learning from claiming it until a year after its production, that he had composed it. In England, the leaflet was formally denounced by imperial declaration. The effect of the report was muddled soon thereafter, when Elizabeth Tudor moved toward becoming Queen of England. In spite of the fact that Knox had not focused on Elizabeth, he had profoundly irritated her, and she never pardoned him.
