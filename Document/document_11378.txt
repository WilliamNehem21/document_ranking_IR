Promptly toward the beginning of the day of 10 January 1914, McKinlay records, "a serious shiver shook the entire ship" as the ice assaulted the body. Bartlett, as yet wanting to spare his ship, offered requests to help her by expelling all amassed snow from the decks. He likewise requested all hands to have comfortable apparel prepared. At 6.45 at night a boisterous blast demonstrated that the structure had been punctured; Bartlett went quickly to the motor room and watched water pouring in through a slice long. There was no probability that the siphons could manage the inflow, and the chief gave the request to forsake transport. Climate conditions, says McKinlay, could barely have been more awful, however the group and staff worked for the duration of the night, in pitch murkiness and driving snow, to add to the amounts of apportions and gear previously put away on the ice. Bartlett stayed on board until the last minutes, playing boisterous music on the ship's Victrola. At 3:15ÃÂ p.m. on 11 January, Bartlett put on Chopin's Funeral March as a last salute to the ship, and ventured off. "Karluk" sank inside minutes, her yardarms snapping off as she vanished through the tight gap in the ice. McKinlay checked out the stranded party: 22 men, one lady, two youngsters, 16 hounds and a feline.
