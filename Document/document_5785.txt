In 2000, Bowie was casted a ballot by other music stars as the "most powerful craftsman ever" in a survey by "NME". Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" composed that Bowie was affirmed by 1980 to be "the most vital and compelling craftsman since the Beatles". Neil McCormick of "The Daily Telegraph" expressed that Bowie had "one of the preeminent vocations in mainstream music, craftsmanship and culture of the twentieth century" and "he was excessively creative, excessively irregular, unreasonably bizarre for everything except his most dedicated fans to stay aware of". The BBC's Mark Easton contended that Bowie gave fuel to "the innovative powerhouse that Britain has progressed toward becoming" by testing future ages "to point high, to be goal-oriented and provocative, to go for broke". Easton presumed that Bowie had "changed the way the world sees Britain. What's more, the manner in which Britain sees itself". Annie Zaleski of "Elective Press" expressed, "Each band or solo craftsman who's chosen to tear up their playbook and begin again owes an obligation to Bowie". In 2016, he was named "The Greatest Rock Star Ever" by "Moving Stone" magazine.
