In 1989, Emily B. Griffin found that "Stegoceras" and different pachycephalosaurs had a decent feeling of smell (olfaction), in view of the investigation of cranial endocasts that indicated extensive olfactory knobs in the mind. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and associates found that "Stegoceras" would have required cartilaginous nasal turbinates in the front of the nasal entries for wind current to achieve the olfactory locale. Proof for the nearness of this structure is a hard edge to which it could have joined. The measure of the olfactory area likewise demonstrates that "Stegoceras" had a sharp feeling of smell. The analysts found that the dinosaur could have had either a parchment formed turbinate (like in a turkey) or a spread one (as in an ostrich) as both could have guided air to the olfactory district. The vein framework in the sections likewise propose that the turbinates served to chill off warm blood vessel blood from the body that was making a beeline for the cerebrum. The skull of "S. validum" example UALVP 2 was appropriate for an investigation of this sort because of its remarkable conservation; it has hardened delicate tissue in the nasal depression, which would somehow or another be cartilaginous and subsequently not safeguarded through mineralization.
