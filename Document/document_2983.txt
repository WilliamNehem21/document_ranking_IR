In the war's result, Gibraltar made conclusive strides towards executing regular citizen self-administration over most issues of open arrangement. The Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights (AACR), driven by Gibraltarian attorney Joshua Hassan, won the majority of the seats in the primary post-war City Council races in 1945. Ladies were given the privilege to cast a ballot in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was set up. A two-party framework had risen by 1955 with the production of the Commonwealth Party as an opponent to the AACR. That equivalent year Hassan turned into the main Mayor of Gibraltar. The Governor still held generally speaking expert and could overrule the Legislative Council. This definitely caused pressure and discussion if the Governor and Legislative Council deviated, however in 1964 the British Government consented to restrict the forces of the Governor to issues of barrier, security and outside relations. Another constitution was chosen in 1968 and proclaimed in 1969, blending the City Council and Legislative Council into a solitary House of Assembly (known as the Gibraltar Parliament since 2006) with 15 chose individuals, two non-chose authorities and a speaker. The old title of "Settlement of Gibraltar" was dropped and the domain was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.
