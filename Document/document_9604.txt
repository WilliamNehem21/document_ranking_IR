Most remarkably, he played out the first historically speaking kidney transplant in the UK, at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Woodruff had been sitting tight for the correct patient for quite a while, wanting to locate a patient with an indistinguishable twin to go about as the benefactor, as this would fundamentally decrease the danger of dismissal. The patient that Woodruff in the end found was a 49-year-elderly person experiencing seriously weakened kidney work who got one of his indistinguishable twin sibling's kidneys on 30 October 1960. The two twins experienced an extra six years before kicking the bucket of an inconsequential malady. Woodruff suspected that he must be cautious with his first kidney transplant, as he respected the British restorative network's frame of mind to be moderate towards transplantation. From that point until his retirement in 1976, he performed 127 kidney transplants. Likewise in 1960, Woodruff distributed "The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs", a thorough overview of transplant science and one of seven books he composed. He was granted the 1969 Lister Medal for his commitments to careful science. The comparing Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was conveyed on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Organic parts of independence'.
