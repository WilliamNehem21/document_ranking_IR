California Chrome has been depicted as a return to ponies with sturdiness and soundness. His sire, Lucky Pulpit, and his dam, Love the Chase, each had moderately undistinguished dashing professions, yet their progenitors were fruitful on the track, and some were outstanding for stamina over separation. Fortunate Pulpit was sired by Pulpit, who is credited with 63 stakes champs and especially known for his child Tapit. 1992 Belmont Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic victor A. P. Indy is the sire of Pulpit, and in 2015, California Chrome turned into the unsurpassed driving worker from the A. P. Indy sire line. The sire line of these stallions follows to Bold Ruler, considered one of the best North American sires of the twentieth century, and at last to the Darley Arabian through Eclipse. A. P. Indy was by 1977 Triple Crown victor Seattle Slew, and is a grandson of Secretariat on his dam's side, conveying a second cross to Bold Ruler into the family. Platform is a grandson of Mr. Miner on his dam's side, a line accepted to cross well with Seattle Slew's rearing. Lectern's maternal granddam, Narrate, conveys lines to Bold Ruler and to 1964 Kentucky Derby champ Northern Dancer. Fortunate Pulpit's dam, Lucky Soph, is a relative to the dam of Unbridled's Song and furthermore a granddaughter of Caro, who sired 1988 Kentucky Derby champ Winning Colors. Princequillo, who was noted for his stamina, seems a few times in Lucky Pulpit's family.
