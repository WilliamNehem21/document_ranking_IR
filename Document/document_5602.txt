The endeavor's disappointment debilitated the Umayyad state. As student of history Bernard Lewis remarked, "Its disappointment brought a grave minute for Umayyad control. The money related strain of preparing and keeping up the endeavor caused an irritation of the monetary and budgetary mistreatment which had effectively stimulated such unsafe restriction. The annihilation of the armada and armed force of Syria at the ocean dividers of Constantinople denied the routine of the central material premise of its capacity". The hit to the Caliphate's strength was extreme, and in spite of the fact that the land armed force did not endure misfortunes in a similar degree as the armada, Umar is recorded as thinking about pulling back from the ongoing triumphs of Hispania and Transoxiana, just as a total clearing of Cilicia and other Byzantine regions that the Arabs had seized over the earlier years. In spite of the fact that his counsels deterred him from such radical activities, most Arab battalions were pulled back from the Byzantine wilderness locale they had involved in the number one spot up to the attack. In Cilicia, just Mopsuestia stayed in Arab hands as a cautious defense to secure Antioch. The Byzantines even recuperated some domain in western Armenia for a period. In 719, the Byzantine armada struck the Syrian coast and torched the port of Laodicea and, in 720 or 721, the Byzantines assaulted and sacked Tinnis in Egypt. Leo likewise reestablished authority over Sicily, where updates on the Arab attack of Constantinople and desires for the city's fall had provoked the neighborhood senator to pronounce his very own sovereign, Basil Onomagoulos. It was amid this time, in any case, that viable Byzantine power over Sardinia and Corsica stopped.
