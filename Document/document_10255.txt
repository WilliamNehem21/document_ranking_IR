Walton's first work for full ensemble, "Portsmouth Point" (1925), motivated by a Rowlandson print of a similar name, delineates a rumbustious dockside scene (in Kennedy's expression, "the mariners of H.M.S. Pinafore have had a night on the tiles") in a quick moving score brimming with syncopation and cross-cadence that for quite a long time demonstrated perilous for directors and symphonies alike. All through his vocation, Walton composed works in this example, for example, the exuberant Comedy Overture "Scapino", a virtuoso piece charged by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, depicted by "The Musical Times" as "a cunning mixing of sections in invigorating bounty." Walton's post-war works in this classification are the "Johannesburg Festival Overture" (1956), the "occupying yet hard-edged "Capriccio burlesco"" (1968), and the more "Partita" (1957), composed for the Cleveland Orchestra, portrayed by "Woods" as "an amazingly focused score with a brave finale [with] steely antithesis and instrumental virtuosity". Walton's shorter pieces additionally incorporate two tributes to melodic associates, "Minor departure from a Theme by Hindemith" (1963) and the "Spontaneous creations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten" (1969), in the two of which the source material is step by step changed as Walton's own voice turns out to be progressively unmistakable. The faultfinder Hugh Ottaway remarked that in the two pieces "the association of two melodic identities is... intriguing".
