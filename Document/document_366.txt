Pre-generation work for the film started in February 2014, when Katharina Suckale, Jasleen Marwah, and Arfi Lamba of the Bombay Berlin Film Production demonstrated enthusiasm for adjusting the content into a full-length include film. Saria said that the screenplay was worked out of "profound disgrace and dread" and on fulfillment was not pitched to any financial specialists, yet rather secured into a cabinet. The content was grabbed by Suckale and Lamba, who consented to co-produce Saria's directorial debut. The film's title is a purposeful incorrect spelling of "affection", however the two are articulated indistinguishably and are basically equivalent words. The incorrect spelling was clarified by Saria in a meeting with "Gaylaxy": "regardless of how unique love may look like contrasted with tradition, for example regardless of how it is spelt, it is still love". The Supreme Court of India's December 2013 choice to restore Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which condemned same-sex connections in India had a noteworthy bearing on Saria's work. In the film's authentic discharge proclamation Saria discussed the condition that he worked in saying that, "it was in this India [referring to the Supreme Court judgement] that our on-screen characters, specialists, financial specialists and supporters met up to make this film, working in outright mystery".
