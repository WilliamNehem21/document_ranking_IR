Clarke's style has much of the time been depicted as a pastiche, especially of nineteenth-century British journalists, for example, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. In particular, the novel's minor characters, including sycophants, rakes, and the Duke of Wellington, inspire Dickens' personifications. Laura Miller, in her survey for "Salon", proposes that the novel is "about a specific abstract voice, the famously cultivated voice of mid nineteenth century social parody", exemplified by crafted by Austen. The tale even uses outdated spellingsÃ¢ÂÂ"chuse" for "pick" and "shewed" for "appeared", for instanceÃ¢ÂÂto pass on this voice just as the free circuitous discourse made renowned by Austen. Clarke herself noticed that Austen's impact is especially solid in the "local scenes, set in parlors and drawing rooms where individuals for the most part "visit" about enchantment" where Dickens' is unmistakable "whenever there's more activity or depiction". While numerous commentators contrast Clarke's style with that of Austen, Gregory Feeley contends in his survey for "The Weekly Standard" that "the purposes of likeness are for the most part shallow". He composes that "Austen gets serious energetically, while Clarke takes part in an inquisitive story procedure of consistent deferral and postponement." For instance, Clarke makes reference to Jonathan Strange on the primary page of the novel, yet just in a commentary. He returns in different references all through the opening yet does not show up as a character in the content legitimate until a fourth of the route through the novel.
