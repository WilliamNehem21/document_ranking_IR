There has been extensive research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial body of research has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes in place of the fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical antipsychotic. The ferrocenylâhaloperidol compound investigated has structure (CH)Fe(CH)âC(=O)â(CH)âN(CHCH)C(OH)âCHCl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope Ru produces a ruthenocenylâhaloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of Ru produces the metastable isotope Rh in a rhodocenylâhaloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodoceniumâhaloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenylâhaloperidol and the rhodoceniumâhaloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. Rh has a half-life of 56Â min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8Â keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include I, Fe, and Ca, and Rh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.
