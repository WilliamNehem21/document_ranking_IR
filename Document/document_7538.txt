In 1957, American News Company, by a wide margin the biggest magazine merchant, was exchanged. Practically all the sci-fi magazines needed to locate another merchant, and the littler autonomous organizations staying in the market regularly requested month to month production and a bigger configuration from the magazines they took on. A considerable lot of the magazines did not have the promoting income required to help these changes, and inside a few years, a large number of them had vanished: the quantity of sci-fi magazines being distributed dropped from a high of 46 out of 1953 to not exactly twelve before the decade's over. For some time "If" was elusive on the news stands, yet it endure. Quinn tried the smooth configuration (utilizing gleaming paper, dissimilar to the less expensive paper utilized for pulps and processes) for a sidekick magazine, "Space Age", which he propelled in November 1958; the trial was fruitless, in any case. While trying to improve "If's" dissemination, Quinn enlisted author Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Dissemination neglected to increment, however this was at any rate somewhat because of the issues with appropriation, and by mid 1959, Quinn chose to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.
