"Banksia aquilonia" grows as a tall shrub or small tree up to high, though plants up to have been recorded. It has hard, fissured, grey bark, and narrow elliptic or lanceolate leaves measuring long by wide with entire (straight) margins and acute tips. They are a smooth shiny green above and white below with a prominent midrib covered in red-brown hair. The brownish new growth appears in summer. The plant is in bloom from March to June. Flowers occur in "Banksia" characteristic vertical flower spike, an inflorescence made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. "B.Â aquilonia" flower spike is a pale yellow colour, roughly cylindrical, high, and up to in diameter. The tubular perianths of the individual flowers are long. These open at maturity (anthesis) to release the styles. All old flower parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles develop on the bare woody spike. The follicles measure long, high, and wide. Furry at first, they become smooth with age and open when ripe, and their two half-oval valves split to release the one or two seeds they contain. The obovate dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwich a woody separator. Measuring long, they are made up of a wedge-shaped seed body, long by wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. Seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons around long. Juvenile leaves are narrower, measuring long and wide, and often have serrate (toothed) margins.
