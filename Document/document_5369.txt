The makers included Justin's sister Iris as a supporting character in the overhauled arrangement, and set up a sexual strain between the two characters at an opportune time. While commentators were uncertain what to make of it, Daniel Knauf publicized the relationship as "similarly as distorted and forbidden as ever" in the new season. Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) and Amy Madigan (Iris) recognized the desire between their characters yet accepted their relationship had not been fulfilled in the main season. They were not for their characters getting together like HBO had needed, as "that is truly not what they're about." Per Brown, the kin relationship illuminates Brother Justin's and Iris' character and thought processes, and proceeded with pressure alarms the group of onlookers more on the off chance that it is never settled. Albeit Brown and Madigan needed to leave the status of their characters' relationship as darlings open, they intentionally played their kisses more close and commonplace than the vast majority would think about agreeable. A few characters mediate the kin's relationship amid the show's run. The journalists had arranged a sexual allusion among Iris and Tommy Dolan, a news correspondent who researches in the illegal conflagration case, however Robert Knepper (Dolan) later felt his character may very well have been a pawn between Brother Justin and Iris as kin, making Brother Justin desirous. The Crowes likewise normally enlist new house keepers, which Knauf clarified as Iris arranging surrogate ladies to soothe Brother Justin's sexual weight.
