By August 9, the creation was at that point an entire day behind timetable. Regardless of the postponements, Wise wouldn't shoot over twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge a short time later. He was understanding on set; wagers were set on when he would at last lose his temper, however pool coordinators restored the cash when Wise never did. Given his newness to the source material Wise depended on the performing artists, particularly Shatner, to guarantee that exchange and portrayals were predictable with the show. While the extension scenes were shot early, issue with recording the transporter room scene postponed further work. Group taking a shot at the transporter stage found their footwear softening on the lit lattice while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole successions created additional postponements. The recording for the scene was shot two different ways; first, at the standard 24 outlines for each second, and after that at the quicker 48 outlines; the ordinary film was a back-up if the moderate movement impact created by the quicker casing rate did not turned out as arranged. The shoot delayed for such a long time that it turned into a running joke for cast individuals to attempt and top each other with wormhole-related plays on words. The scene was at last finished on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being taped in the meantime on the equivalent soundstage.
