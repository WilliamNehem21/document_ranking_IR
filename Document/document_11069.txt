Sasse, depicted by authority antiquarian Charles Bean as "elated" by the accomplishment that morning, moved toward Shout with a proposition to rehash the accomplishment. Yell concurred. The couple gathered a gathering of eight men this opportunity to convey sandbags and additional bombs. Having observed the Turks' position, the recently raised blockade was pushed down and, next to each other, Sasse and Shout kept running forward. While Sasse shot his gun and Shout heaved bombs, the Australian party progressed in short stages along the channel and fabricated a blockade each time they ended. Bean composed that Shout battled with "awe inspiring jollity" all through the attack, student of history Stephen Snelling including that Shout was "chuckling and clowning and rooting for his men". As the Australians advanced, the two officers found an appropriate position to raise their last blockade. Preparing himself for this last push forward, Shout all the while lit three bombs. He effectively tossed two, yet the third blasted similarly as it was leaving his hand. Yell was deplorably injured; the blast burned his correct hand and part of the left, pulverized his left eye, cut his cheek, and made consumes his chest and leg. Notwithstanding the seriousness of his injuries Shout stayed cognizant and was hauled out of the terminating line, where, "still happy" as indicated by Bean, he "drank tea and made an impression on his significant other".
