After his arrival to London in 1946, toward the second's end World War, various real productions resulted, including "Lilies of the World" in 1950. The RHS additionally forced two noteworthy assignments on their bookkeeper. In 1950, Frederick Chittenden, a past executive of RHS Wisley and Keeper of the Library, kicked the bucket leaving incomplete the four volume RHS "Word reference of Gardening" that the general public had dispatched from him before the war. The war had intruded on the work the same number of the normal benefactors were inaccessible. Stearn, together with Patrick Synge, the RHS Publications Editor, embraced to finish the work, especially volume IV (RÃ¢ÂÂ Z), an errand he finished inside a half year, with 50 new articles. The completed work was distributed in 1951 and in addition to the fact that he undertook the job of altering this extensive work his commitments secured 50 genera, 600 species and complex recognizable proof keys, for example, "Solidago" and "Viola". Since Stearn's entrances in volume IV reached out from "Soldanella" to "Zygotritonia", he would joke that he was yet "an unconventional specialist on plants from 'So-' onwards". He issued a reexamined form in 1956 with Synge in which he included a further 86 articles. His memory of this assignment was that he obtained "that word related danger of compilers of reference books", exhaustive information.
