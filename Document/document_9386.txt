Gens himself has been classified "a standout amongst the most dubious Jewish ghetto pioneers". Chaim Lazar, an individual from the FPO, composed of Gens that "It might be charged that his course was hurtful, however everybody realizes that he was never a double crosser. All that he did amid his residency as Chief of the Ghetto was for his kin". Yitzhak Arad, in his history of the Vilnius Ghetto, says that Gens "blundered in his key conceptionÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ that the German organization respected the presence of the ghetto and its occupants essential for monetary reasons" and that "the approach set somewhere near Jacob Gens was the special case that managed expectation and some prospect of survival". Vadim Altskan, of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, expresses that "...ÃÂ Holocaust historiography treated individuals such asÃÂ ... Jacob GensÃÂ ... as instruments of pulverization in the hands of the Nazi murdering machine.ÃÂ ... Connected reflectively, these charges generally are judgmental and add next to no to our comprehension of the occasions. Neither Jewish functionaries nor 'conventional' Jews had any useful or mental involvement in managing the dismal truth of the Nazi occupation, in light of the fact that at no other time in their long history of oppression had the Jews encountered an attack of such extent and watchful plan." Regarding the accuse of teaming up of the Germans, Dawidowicz opined, "to state that [Gens and others like him] 'coordinated' or 'worked together' with the Germans is semantic disarray and verifiable deception". The Israeli Zionist writer Nathan Alterman researched the historical backdrop of the Vilnius Ghetto, including talking with survivors, for example, Abba Kovner, and expressed "Had I been in the ghetto, I would have been in favor of the Judenrat."
