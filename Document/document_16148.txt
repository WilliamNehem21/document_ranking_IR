"Mama Africa", a musical about Makeba, was produced in South Africa by Niyi Coker. Originally titled "Zenzi!", the musical premiered to a sold-out crowd in Cape Town on 26 May 2016. It was performed in the US in St. Louis, Missouri and at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City between October and December 2016. The musical returned to South Africa in February 2017 for what would have been Makeba's 85th birthday.
From 25 to 27 September 2009, a tribute television show to Makeba entitled "Hommage Ã  Miriam Makeba" and curated by Beninoise singer-songwriter and activist AngÃ©lique Kidjo, was held at the Cirque d'hiver in Paris. The show was presented as "Mama Africa: Celebrating Miriam Makeba" at the Barbican in London on 21 November 2009. A documentary film titled "Mama Africa", about Makeba's life, co-written and directed by Finnish director Mika KaurismÃ¤ki, was released in 2011. On 4 March 2013, and again on International Women's Day in 2017, Google honoured her with a Google Doodle on their homepage.
In 2014 she was honoured (along with Nelson Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and Steve Biko) in the Belgian city of Ghent, which named a square after her, the "Miriam Makebaplein".
