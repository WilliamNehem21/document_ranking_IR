Patricia's winds at landfall are relatively uncertain, and the 150Â mph (240Â km/h) value is based upon the Knaff-Zehr-Courtney pressure-wind relationship and an extrapolation of a 54Â mbar (hPa; 1.59Â inHg) filling using the Dvorak Technique. An additional equation stemming from work by Willoughby (1993) yielded a landfall intensity of . A NOAA automated weather station at the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, at an elevation of , recorded sustained winds of and a maximum gust of . Further raw data from this station indicated unrealistically high sustained winds of and a maximum gust of . Based on the station's distance from Patricia's eye, outside the radius of maximum winds, the observations from this station are considered unreliable. The highest reliably measured winds of occurred in Pista between 22:30 and 23:00Â UTC on OctoberÂ 23 before the anemometer failed.
Even faster weakening ensued through OctoberÂ 24 as the hurricane traversed the Sierra Madre mountains; its eye disappeared from satellite imagery within hours of moving ashore. The system weakened below hurricane strength by 03:00Â UTC as it passed west of Guadalajara. Patricia accelerated inland between a trough over Northwestern Mexico and the ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. Convection dramatically decreased in organization and the low- and mid- to upper-level circulation centers of the cyclone soon decoupled. The system degraded into a tropical depression by 12:00Â UTC as little organized convection remained, and the storm dissipated shortly thereafter over central Mexico. Unimpeded by the mountains of Mexico, the mid- to upper-level circulation of Patricia, accompanied by considerable moisture, continued northeast and interacted with a cold front over the western Gulf of Mexico. The new system produced flooding rains across large areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.
