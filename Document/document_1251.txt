In 1935, Vladimir Fock demonstrated that the quantum mechanical bound Kepler issue is comparable to the issue of a free molecule restricted to a three-dimensional unit circle in four-dimensional space. In particular, Fock demonstrated that the SchrÃÂ¶dinger wavefunction in the force space for the Kepler issue was the stereographic projection of the round sounds on the circle. Revolution of the circle and reprojection results in a ceaseless mapping of the circular circles without changing the vitality; quantum precisely, this compares to a blending of all orbitals of a similar vitality quantum number "n". Valentine Bargmann noted in this manner that the Poisson sections for the precise energy vector L and the scaled LRL vector D framed the Lie variable based math for SO(4). Basically, the six amounts D and L relate to the six preserved precise momenta in four measurements, related with the six conceivable basic turns in that space (there are six different ways of picking two tomahawks from four). This end does not suggest that our universe is a three-dimensional circle; it just implies that this specific material science issue (the two-body issue for backwards square focal powers) is "scientifically comparable" to a free molecule on a three-dimensional circle.
