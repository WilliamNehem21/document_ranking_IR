The canvas was, generally, generally welcomed by craftsmanship pundits when previously showed. A November 1963 "Craftsmanship Magazine" survey by Donald Judd depicted "Whaam!" as one of the "wide and incredible artistic creations" of the 1963 presentation at Castelli's Gallery. In his audit of the display, "The New York Times" workmanship faultfinder Brian O'Doherty depicted Lichtenstein's system as " pointillismÃÂ ... that arduously pounds out such minutes as a fly shooting down another stream with a major BLAM". As indicated by O'Doherty, the outcome was "surely not craftsmanship, [but] time may make it so", contingent upon whether it could be "rationalizedÃÂ ... what's more, put in line for the future to absorb as history, which it hints at each doing." The Tate Gallery in London gained the work in 1966, prompting warmed contention among their trustees and some vocal individuals from general society. The buy was produced using craftsmanship seller Ileana Sonnabend, whose soliciting cost from ÃÂ£4,665 (ÃÂ£ in 2019 money) was decreased by arrangement to ÃÂ£3,940 (ÃÂ£ in 2019 cash). Some Tate trustees contradicted the obtaining, among them artist Barbara Hepworth, painter Andrew Forge and the writer and commentator Herbert Read. Shielding the obtaining, workmanship antiquarian Richard Morphet, at that point an associate guardian at the Tate, proposed that the depiction tends to a few issues and painterly styles in the meantime: "history painting, Baroque excess, and the quotidian marvel of mass-flow funny cartoons." "The Times" in 1967 portrayed the procurement as an "exceptionally huge and dynamite painting". The Tate's executive, Norman Reid, later said that the work excited more open enthusiasm than any of its acquisitions since World War II.
