Industry forecasters predicted that "The Pale Emperor" was on course for a top ten debut on the "Billboard" 200, with estimated first-week sales of around 42,000 units. The album debuted at number eight on the chart with sales of over 51,000 album-equivalent units, of which 49,000 units were "pure" album salesâthat is, traditional copies of the album, rather than units calculated as a measure of track sales or streaming. This was the band's highest opening-week figure since "Eat Me, Drink Me" debuted at the same position with 88,000 copies in 2007, and was their sixth consecutive top ten album. It also debuted at number six on "Billboard"s Top Albums Salesâthe current equivalent of the "Billboard" 200 before it was reconfigured to accommodate track sales and streamingâas well as number three on Top Rock Albums and number one on the Top Hard Rock Albums charts. On its second week, the album dropped to number 24 on the Top Albums Chart, selling a further 12,275 "pure" copies. As of December 2015, "The Pale Emperor" has sold more than 136,000 "pure" copies in the US. The album debuted at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart, with sales of over 5,000 copies on its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan.
