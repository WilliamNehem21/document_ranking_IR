After interviews with its partners, Sparta sent a nomination to Athens requesting certain concessions, for example, the quick removal of the Alcmaeonidae family including Pericles and the withdrawal of the Megarian Decree, undermining war if the requests were not met. The conspicuous motivation behind these recommendations was the induction of a showdown among Pericles and the general population; this occasion, to be sure, would come around a couple of years after the fact. Around then, the Athenians unhesitatingly adhered to Pericles' directions. In the primary unbelievable discourse Thucydides puts in his mouth, Pericles exhorted the Athenians not to respect their adversaries' requests, since they were militarily more grounded. Pericles was not set up to make one-sided concessions, trusting that "on the off chance that Athens yielded on that issue, at that point Sparta was certain to think of further requests". Subsequently, Pericles requested that the Spartans offer a "renumeration". In return for withdrawing the Megarian Decree, the Athenians requested from Sparta to desert their routine with regards to intermittent ejection of outsiders from their domain (xenelasia) and to perceive the self-governance of its united urban communities, a solicitation suggesting that Sparta's authority was likewise savage. The terms were dismissed by the Spartans, and with neither one of the sides willing to withdraw, the two urban communities arranged for war. As indicated by Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, teachers of vital examinations and global governmental issues, "as opposed to submit to coercive requests, Pericles picked war". Another thought that may well have impacted Pericles' position was the worry that revolts in the domain may spread if Athens showed itself frail.
