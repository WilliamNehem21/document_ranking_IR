By the by, this left open the topic of where to find the capital. At first the Bombala locale in the furthest south of NSW was proposed, to which southern Monaro, (which consolidated Bombala), Orange and Yass were before long included. The NSW Premier, John See, offered to give any of the three prescribed destinations as a future capital region. Edmund Barton, the primary Prime Minister of the new Federal Government, added another four destinations to this rundown: Albury, Tamworth, Armidale and Tumut, and individuals from the new government visited the different locales in 1902. The visit demonstrated uncertain, and upon their arrival the individuals chose to allude the issue to a Royal Commission, with the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne, pushing for Tumut or Albury as he favored a site in his electorate. In this manner, the Commission introduced its report to Parliament in 1903, prescribing the destinations of Albury, Tumut and Orange, in a specific order. In any case, there kept on being issues, as the House of Representatives sponsored the Tumut alternative, while the Senate favored the town of Bombala. Because of this difference the bill slipped by, and it was left to the second Parliament to pick an area for the capital.
