In May 2009, Fox said that the undertaking was a "reboot" of the "Outsider" establishment, and soon a while later was accounted for as an untitled prequel to "Outsider". Improvement ceased in June 2009 when Fox conflicted with Scott over his determination of previous TV commercial executive Carl Erik Rinsch as chief. Fox was possibly keen on seeking after the venture if Scott coordinated. By July 2009, Scott was contracted to coordinate the movie, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was procured to compose the content dependent on his pitched thought for an immediate "Outsider" prequel. With the chief and essayist set up, and satisfied with Spaihts' pitch, Fox planned a discharge date for December 2011, yet this was in the long run dropped. In June 2010, Scott reported that the content was finished and that pre-creation would start, and a recording date was set for January 2011. Fox in the long run pushed to form the venture into a unique work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been contracted to redevelop Spaihts' screenplay. In October 2010, Lindelof presented his changed screenplay to Fox. Scott had at first mentioned a $250 million spending plan and a grown-up situated venture, yet Fox was hesitant to contribute this measure of cash, and needed to guarantee the film would get a lower age-rating to widen the potential group of onlookers.
