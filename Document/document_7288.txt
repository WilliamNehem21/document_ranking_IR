Amid this period Delius did not restrict himself to absolutely instrumental works; he created his last musical drama, "Fennimore and Gerda" (1908Ã¢ÂÂ 10), like "A Village Romeo and Juliet" written in scene structure, yet in his develop style. His choral works of the period, remarkably "An Arabesque" (1911) and "A Song of the High Hills" (1911) are among the most radical of Delius' compositions in their juxtapositions of inconsequential harmonies. The last work, completely silent, contains probably the most troublesome choral music in presence, as indicated by Heseltine. After 1915, Delius directed his concentration toward conventional sonata, chamber and concerto frames, which he had to a great extent taken off alone since his disciple days. Of these pieces Payne features two: the Violin Concerto (1916), for instance of how, writing in new classes, Delius remained elaborately consistent with himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, coming up short on the nature of a symphonic sense of taste, turns into a melodic triumph. Cardus' decision, be that as it may, is that Delius' chamber and concerto works are to a great extent disappointments. After 1917, as per Payne, there was a general disintegration in the amount and nature of Delius' yield as sickness grabbed hold, in spite of the fact that Payne exempts the accidental music to "Hassan" (1920Ã¢ÂÂ 23) from judgment, trusting it to contain a portion of Delius' best work.
