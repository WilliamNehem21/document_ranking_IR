Garran went with Hughes and Joseph Cook (at that point the Minister for the Navy) to the 1917 and 1918 gatherings of the Imperial War Cabinet in London, United Kingdom, and was additionally part of the British Empire designation to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference in Paris, France. There he was on a few of the arrangement drafting councils, and added to numerous arrangements, prominently the bits of the League of Nations Covenant identifying with League of Nations orders. Despite the fact that concentrating chiefly on League of Nations matters, Garran and John Latham (the head of Australian Naval Intelligence) had the status of specialized counselors to Hughes and Cook, thus could go to the principle meeting and any of the related chambers. Watching the procedures, Garran appreciated the "moral and physical valor" of French head Georges Clemenceau, whom he viewed as resolved to shield France from Germany yet in a deliberate and mild way; in Garran's words, Clemenceau "dependably withstood the over the top requests of the French chauvinists, of the French armed force, and of Foch himself." Garran saw a few similitudes between British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and United States President Woodrow Wilson where others saw just contrasts, since Lloyd George "additionally had a solid vein of optimism in his character", and Wilson could be down to business when the circumstance called for it, for example, in talks identifying with American interests. Garran additionally met other political and military pioneers at the meeting, including T. E. Lawrence, "an Oxford youth of 29 Ã¢ÂÂ he looks 18", who was unassuming and "with no artificiality... in an organization of a few [he] could talk in all respects curiously, yet at a bigger social affair he was adept to be stupid."
