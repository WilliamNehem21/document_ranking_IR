At the point when the group worked with Ne-Yo, they recorded the melody with a male vocalist. In any case, they figured a female vocalist would be increasingly appropriate, and Ne-Yo likewise suspected that it was enabling for a lady to sing it. Eriksen of Stargate said it was an A&R individual who recommended that the tune would work better when sung by a lady. Two names needed the tune. While BeyoncÃÂ© chipped away at material for "B'Day", she was satisfied with the demo of the "Fundamental" that was introduced to her. In any case, "Key" did not appear to fit on "B'Day", which should be "a hard-hitting club collection". Swizz Beatz, who was dealing with the collection, pronounced that BeyoncÃÂ© would be insane not to incorporate the melody on the record. BeyoncÃÂ© requested changes to the tune, including the expansion of drums, vocal courses of action, and singing in a higher register than the demo. Espen Lind and Amund BjÃÂ¸rklund, from the Norwegian generation group Espionage, composed the harmony structure and the guitar part. In a meeting with MTV, Ne-Yo stated, "BeyoncÃÂ© had some stuff that she needed to get off her chest", while intending to make a record that ladies could identify with, with regards to the topic of the collection.
