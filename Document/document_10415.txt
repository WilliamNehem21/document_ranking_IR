Notwithstanding the issues, the visit was a triumph, and Lloyd performed to pressed auditoriums all through America. Her demonstration highlighted the melodies "The Tiddly Wink", "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and "The Aviator". The numbers were well known, halfway because of the Americanisation of every melody's verses. On an individual dimension, Lloyd's time in America was hopeless and was exacerbated by the expanding residential maltreatment she got from Dillon. The ambushes made her miss a few key exhibitions, which incensed the theater administrator, Edward Albee, who compromised her with a break of agreement activity. She guaranteed that sickness made it troublesome for her to perform and dissented at her charging position. The dramatic press were not persuaded. The "New York Telegraph" theorized "In vaudeville circles her local relations are believed to be at the base of her assaults of air." Back in England, Hurley had kicked the bucket of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while showing up in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying "until we meet once more". She was accounted for in "The Morning Telegraph" as saying: "With all due regard to the dead, I can merrily say that is the best bit of news I've heard in numerous years, for it implies that Bernard Dillon and I will wed when this unfortunate year closes." Lloyd wedded Dillon on 21 February 1914, the service occurring at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. At the point when the visit completed, Lloyd remarked, "[I will] always remember the embarrassment to which I have been oppressed and I will never sing in America again, regardless of how high the pay advertised."
