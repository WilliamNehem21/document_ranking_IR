Due to the quantity of men serving in the military, many band programs opened up to ladies amid this time. At Texas Tech, a neighborhood sorority for ladies in the band was built up as Tau Beta Sigma. The ladies of Tau Beta Sigma appealed to Kappa Psi to be sanctioned as a helper section of the organization, which was bolstered by originator A. Plain Martin, who was filling in as National Executive Secretary, and Max Mitchell, Grand Second Vice President. On January 25, 1944, Martin kept in touch with individual organizer, William Scroggs, "On the off chance that we don't meet this new circumstance and offer acknowledgment to the young ladies who are coming into the groups or make it conceivable to give help or help to the numerous colleges and universities that have groups made out of both young men and young ladies, we will play second fiddle inside the following five years to some band clique that will allow participation to young men and young ladies and their sections will open up in the littler schools where our own have kicked the bucket." The club was unfit to choose whether or not to acknowledge Tau Beta Sigma's request because of the seriously diminished number of individuals and the cancelation of the 1943 and 1945 national traditions.
