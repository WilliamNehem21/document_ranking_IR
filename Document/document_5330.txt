McNeile's previously known distributed story, "Memories of Sergeant Michael Cassidy", was serialized on page four of the "Every day Mail" from 13 January 1915. As serving officers in the British Army were not allowed to distribute under their very own names with the exception of amid their half-pay holidays, many would compose under a pen name; Northcliffe, the proprietor of the "Every day Mail", gave McNeile the nom de plume "Sapper", as the Royal Engineers were generally known as the Sappers. McNeile later trusted that he had begun composing through "sheer fatigue". A portion of his accounts showed up on page four of the "Every day Mail" over the next months. Northcliffe was awed by his composition and endeavored, yet fizzled, to have him discharged from the military to fill in as a war reporter. Before the finish of 1915, he had composed two accumulations of short stories, "The Lieutenant and Others" and "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.", the two of which were distributed by Hodder and Stoughton. Albeit a considerable lot of the tales had just showed up in the "Day by day Mail", somewhere in the range of 1916 and 1918 "Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E." sold 135,000 duplicates and "The Lieutenant and Others" sold 139,000 duplicates. Before the finish of the war he had distributed three additional accumulations, "Men, Women, and Guns" (1916), "A dead zone" (1917) and "The Human Touch" (1918). In 1916 he composed a progression of articles titled "The Making of an Officer", which showed up under the initials C. N., in five issues of "The Times" somewhere in the range of 8 and 14 June 1916. The articles were gone for youthful and new officers to disclose their obligations to them; these were gathered together and distributed by Hodder and Stoughton later in 1916.
