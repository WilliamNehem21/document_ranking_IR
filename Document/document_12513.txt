The Germans and Austro-Hungarians needed to transport weapons down the Danube to the Ottoman Empire, so on 24 December 1914, "Bodrog" and the minesweeper "Almos" escorted the steamer "Trinitas" stacked with weapons, the watch watercraft "b" and two pulls from Zemun past Belgrade towards the Iron Gates gorge on the SerbianÃ¢ÂÂ Romanian fringe. The escort ran the gauntlet of the Belgrade guards safe, however when it came to Smederevo it got data that the Russians had set up a minefield and log obstruction only south of the Iron Gates. It turned back under overwhelming flame, and pulled back similarly as PanÃÂevo without genuine harm to any vessel. "Bodrog" came back to base, and the screen was sent to monitor the weapons and escort the guard back to Petrovaradin. In January 1915, British mounted guns landed in Belgrade, further reinforcing its guards, and "Bodrog" went through the primary months of the year at Zemun. On 23 February, LSL Kosimus BÃÂ¶hm took order. On 1 March, "Bodrog" and a few different vessels including the screen were moved to Petrovaradin. After the initiation of the Gallipoli crusade, weapons supply to the Ottomans wound up basic, so another endeavor was arranged. On 30 March, the steamer "Belgrad" left Zemun, escorted by "Bodrog" and "Enns". The guard was undetected as it cruised past Belgrade around evening time amid a tempest, however after the screens came back to base, "Belgrad" struck a mine close VinÃÂa, and in the wake of going under overwhelming mounted guns shoot, detonated close Ritopek. On 22 April 1915, a British picket watercraft that had been brought overland by rail from Salonika was utilized to assault the Danube Flotilla mooring at Zemun, terminating two torpedoes without progress.
