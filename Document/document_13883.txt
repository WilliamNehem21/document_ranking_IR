Juster quit his place of employment with the goal that he could take a shot at the book. His creative energy terminated by a kid who moved toward him in the city and with whom he talked about the idea of vastness, Juster needed to complete the anecdote around "a kid who made an excessive number of inquiries" before coming back to the book on urban areas. Juster imparted his home in Brooklyn Heights to sketch artist Jules Feiffer whose room was promptly beneath, and who could hear him pacing in the night. Feiffer was astounded to discover that his companion's a sleeping disorder was not brought about by the urban areas book, yet by a book about a kid. Juster demonstrated Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the craftsman started portraying outlines. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who set up arrangements together in the distributing exchange and was his future lady of the hour. Sheftel got Jason Epstein, a creative manager at Random House with a profound gratefulness for youngsters' writing, to consent to audit the original copy. Some at Random House considered the book's vocabulary excessively troublesome: at the time, instructors prompted against youngsters' writing containing words the intended interest group did not definitely know, dreading the new would demoralize youthful students. In light of seven parts of original copy, in addition to a three-page framework of the remainder of the story, Epstein purchased the book.
