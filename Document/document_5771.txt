With the happening to the Interstate Highways, the hallway was to be moved up to Interstate models. In late 1958, a gathering of motel proprietors whose properties were situated on SRÃÂ 84 firmly questioned any directing of I-8 that would not experience the city of Casa Grande. Motel proprietors in Yuma proposed their own option in 1961 to the four routings of I-8 through the city that had been proposed, raising worries about losing income from the travel industry. In January 1962, the choices were limited to two, with one of them being the course upheld by the motel proprietors. Be that as it may, close-by school authorities communicated concerns with respect to that course, in light of the fact that 1200ÃÂ students would never again have the capacity to stroll to class if the road was developed along that course. Soon thereafter, another course had been proposed, along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River. By 1963, work was in advancement, with segments of the interstate among Mohawk and Gila Bend, and between Gila Bend and close Stanfield updated. Different shippers protested the steering, and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their worries following the last endorsement of the course in 1964. Another park was to be assembled east of the Colorado River crossing, simply inverse downtown; city authorities trusted this would give an improved look to the town as drivers previously arrived.
