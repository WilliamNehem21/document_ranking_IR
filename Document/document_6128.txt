New Zealand's 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1 arrangement win over the Lions in 1959 turned out to be the beginning of a prevailing period in All Black rugby. This was trailed by the 1963Ã¢ÂÂ 64 visit to Britain and Ireland, driven by Wilson Whineray, in which New Zealand were denied of a Grand Slam by a scoreless draw with Scotland. The main misfortune on this visit was to Newport RFC, who won 3Ã¢ÂÂ 0 at Rodney Parade, Newport on 30 October 1963. The 1967 side won three tests against the home countries, yet was unfit to play Ireland due to a foot-and-mouth alarm. This visit shaped piece of New Zealand's longest series of wins, somewhere in the range of 1965 and 1970, of 17 test triumphs. This was likewise the longest test series of wins by any country at the time; it would be equalled by the Springboks in 1998, and outperformed by Lithuania in 2010. Despite the fact that the 1966 Lions were vanquished 0Ã¢ÂÂ 4 in their New Zealand visit, there was an inversion of fortune five years after the fact when the 1971 Lions, under the captaincy of Welshman John Dawes, beat New Zealand in a test arrangement, which remains the Lions' solitary arrangement triumph in New Zealand.
