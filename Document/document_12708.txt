Quick's vocals were depicted by Sophie Schillaci of "The Hollywood Reporter" as "sweet, however delicate". The "Los Angeles Times" distinguished Swift's "characterizing" vocal signal in studio accounts as "the line that slides down like a placated moan or up like a cocked eyebrow, giving her dearest young lady time hits their quality of simple closeness". "Moving Stone", in a "Speak Now" survey, stated: "Quick's voice is sufficiently unaffected to veil how magnificent she has progressed toward becoming as a vocalist; she brings down her voice for the result lines in the great method of a bashful young lady endeavoring to talk intense." In another audit of "Speak Now", "The Village Voice" composed that her expressing was already "tasteless and obfuscated, yet that is changed. She can in any case sound stressed and dainty, and frequently strays into a pitch that makes a few people insane; yet she's figured out how to make words seem like what they signify." "The Hollywood Reporter" composed that her live vocals are "fine", yet they don't coordinate those of her companions. In 2009, Ken TuckerÃÂ of "Amusement Weekly" portrayed Swift's vocals as "level, slender, and now and again as unbalanced as an infant foal". In any case, Swift has gotten acclaim for declining to address her pitch with Auto-Tune.
