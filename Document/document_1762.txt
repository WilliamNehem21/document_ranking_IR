In 1966, the French stud book was changed to incorporate draft types from different regions of France that were firmly identified with the PercheronÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ including the steeds of Berrichon, Nivernais, Marne, Augeron, Bourbonnais, Loire and SaÃÂ´ne-et-Loire. French Percherons were additionally hit hard by the coming of motorization, and somewhere in the range of 1970 and 1990 spotlight was put on rearing ponies of more noteworthy mass for the meat showcase. The biggest and heaviest stallions were chosen for rearing. Starting at the 1989 World Percheron Congress, French reproducers understood that they required a lighter breed for the travel industry, fare to Japan for draft work, and different markets. In 1993, a pattern of bringing in American stallions to France was begun with the dark stallion Silver Shadows Sheik. This stallion and others were utilized to make a progressively exquisite, littler and sleeker look in the French Percheron, while as yet holding the conventional bone and foot structure. All the imported stallions were dark, restoring the notoriety of dark Percherons in France. French reproducers keep on bringing in American-reared Percheron stallions so as to deliver lighter foals, moving far from the heavier meat-type ponies of the late twentieth century. Likewise in 1993, the SociÃÂ©tÃÂ© Hippique Percheronne foreseen the expanding visitor and exportation showcases by forbidding docking, which was not disallowed for other draft breeds until 1996. This was incompletely in line with the Germans, and mostly because of the impact of magazines, for example, "Cheval".
