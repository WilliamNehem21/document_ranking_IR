As in a considerable lot of Argento's movies, which will in general eroticize the homicide of wonderful ladies, sex, sexuality and power are serious issues foregrounded by the film. The anecdotal novel inside the film is depicted as being "about human corruption and its impacts on society". Male and female sexual deviancy are a focal topic, with the exploited people being explicitly freed ladies who the principal executioner Ã¢ÂÂ preservationist TV moderator Cristiano Berti Ã¢ÂÂ alludes to as "dingy, disgusting degenerates". The main unfortunate casualty is an explicitly wanton shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian correspondent and her androgynous sweetheart. Berti murders the relatively typical Maria simply because she accidentally finds his bent impulse. His "ethical campaign" is roused by Ã¢ÂÂ and in his mind given believability by Ã¢ÂÂ Neal's epic. Neal's own inspirations for turning into an executioner are uncovered in "Freudian flashbacks". As abridged by McDonagh, these flashbacks "uncover how the misogyny obvious in his books really originates from being explicitly embarrassed by a lovely lady in his childhood." McDonagh additionally noticed that "Tenebrae" develops the subjects of sexuality and transvestitism found in Argento's before movies, "The Bird with the Crystal Plumage", "The Cat o' Nine Tails", "Four Flies on Gray Velvet" (1972), and "Dark Red" (1975), yet trusts that "Tenebrae"s "in general exotic nature separates it from Argento's other "gialli"." She says that the movie's sexual substance and inexhaustible bareness make it "the first of Argento's movies to have a plainly sensual angle", and further notes that ""Tenebrae" is full of free-gliding uneasiness that is explicitly sexual in nature." Gracey takes note of that in a few scenes the exploited people look legitimately into the camera, which shows Argento's "distraction with voyeurism and display".
