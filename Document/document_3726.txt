The name of Djedkare's essential spouse isn't known. An imperative ruler associate whose name is lost was all around likely the proprietor of a huge pyramid complex situated toward the upper east of Djedkare's pyramid in Saqqara. This could show that she was the mother of Djedkare's successor, Unas, or that Djedkare owed the position of royalty to her. The high status of this ruler is recommended by certain highlights of her funerary complex that are generally saved to rulers: her pyramid has its very own satellite pyramid, has a thoroughfare driving from a valley sanctuary up to a morgue sanctuary committed to the clique of the ruler and had a passageway corridor "pr-wrw", an open yard and a square vestibule. Besides, a few reliefs demonstrating the ruler had been adjusted with imperial emblem and vultures included over her head. Since the development of the ruler's pyramid was evidently attempted after the arranging of Djedkare's pyramid and her alleviation had been revised, the Egyptologist Klaus Baer recommends that this ruler may have controlled after the passing of Djedkare, assuming an essential job in his progression. This is dismissed by different Egyptologists, for example, Michel Baud, inferable from the absence of proof for a rule or interregnum among Djedkare and Unas.
