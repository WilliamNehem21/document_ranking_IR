In late May 1942, in an effort to draw out and destroy the elusive American carriers, Japanese forces organized attacks on the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and Midway Atoll in the Western Pacific. Nagumo, aboard "Akagi", led "Kaga", "SÅryÅ«", and "HiryÅ«" and the support ships of the First Carrier Striking Force to Midway. In the initial attack, Japanese planes neutralized a small force of fighter aircraft and inflicted heavy damage to American installations. Torpedo planes and dive-bombers sent from Midway to harry the Japanese fleet had little effect, but the Japanese attack plan had been deciphered by codebreakers, and the American carriers' planes were already en route. Torpedo bombers from , , and joined the attack in succession, forcing the Japanese carriers to maneuver violently to avoid torpedoes and rendering them unable to launch additional aircraft. American dive-bombers, arriving late after difficulty locating the fleet, soon landed fatal strikes on "Akagi", "Kaga", and "SÅryÅ«". "Yorktown", handicapped by hits from "HiryÅ«"s bombers, managed to return to the fight only to take two torpedo hits a couple of hours later. The burning "Yorktown" was abandoned, but her scouts pinpointed "HiryÅ«"s location, and bombers from "Enterprise" put "HiryÅ«" out of action with four bomb strikes. Japan lost all four carriers of the First Carrier Striking Force at Midway.
