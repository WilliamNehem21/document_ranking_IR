Days preceding Chandler's suspicion of the commissionership, the Brooklyn Dodgers' general director, Branch Rickey, had reported the marking of Jackie Robinson to a small time contract with the Montreal Royals, making him the primary dark to play for a Major League Baseball partner. The next year, Rickey exchanged Robinson's agreement from Montreal to Brooklyn, successfully breaking baseball's shading line. In a discourse at Wilberforce University in February 1948, Rickey described a mystery meeting that had supposedly been held by baseball authorities at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago on August 28, 1946. At the gathering, Rickey asserted that Ford Frick dispersed a report that expressed, "Anyway good natured, the utilization of Negro players would risk every physical property of baseball." According to Rickey, each of the 15 group proprietors aside from him casted a ballot to support the report. Rickey asserted Frick carefully gathered all duplicates of the report toward the finish of the gathering to keep them from being dispersed. Baseball history specialist Bill Marshall later composed that the archive and consequent vote to which Rickey was alluding was the warning advisory group's underlying draft of prescribed changes. Marshall further recorded that Rickey distinguished the gathering and the report not long after his discourse at Wilberforce and withdrew his case of 15Ã¢ÂÂ 1 restriction to Robinson's entrance into Major League Baseball.
