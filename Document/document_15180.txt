In the late 1940s, both "Thrilling Wonder" and "Startling Stories" began to publish much more mature fiction than they had during the war, and although "Astounding" was still the leading magazine in the field, it was no longer the only market for the writers who had been regularly selling to Campbell. Many of the best new writers still broke into print in "Astounding" rather than elsewhere. Arthur C. Clarke's first story, "Loophole", appeared in the April 1946 "Astounding", and another British writer, Christopher Youd, began his career with "Christmas Tree" in February 1949. Youd would become much better known under his pseudonym "John Christopher". William Tenn's first sale, "Alexander the Bait", appeared in May 1946, and H. Beam Piper's "Time and Time Again" in the April 1947 issue was his first story. Along with these newer writers, Campbell was still publishing strong material by authors who had become established during the war. Among the better-known stories of this era are "Vintage Season", by C.L. Moore (under the pseudonym Lawrence O'Donnell); Jack Williamson's story "With Folded Hands"; "The Players of Null-A", van Vogt's sequel to "The World of Null-A"; and the final book in E.E. Smith's "Lensman" series, "Children of the Lens".
