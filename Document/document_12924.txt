Ben wore a similar garments in the two seasons, and to make them seem to be indistinguishable, around twenty products of his coveralls were made by hand.

Short's closet comprised of loose jeans and an Italian bowler cap that gave him a 1920s look rather than the 1930s, demonstrating his garments were second-hand. The stripper garments of Rita Sue and Libby were affected by Mae West, whore motion pictures and quiet movies of the 1930s, with extra research put into Asian prostitutes, Latin artists and Hawaiian artists.
