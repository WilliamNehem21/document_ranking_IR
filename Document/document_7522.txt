Like other elanid kites, the dark bore kite chases by quartering prairies for little animals. This can be from a roost, however more frequently by floating in mid-air. It is diurnal, liking to chase amid the day, especially in the early morning and mid to late evening, and at times chases in sets. Its chasing design, outside reproducing periods and times of plentiful prey, has particular crepuscular pinnacles, maybe relating to mouse action. When chasing, the kite floats with its body hanging vertically, and its head into the breeze. In contrast to the nankeen kestrel, the dark winged kite demonstrates no undeniable sideways development, even in a solid breeze. One investigation of a settling pair noticed that the male hunt aeronautically down 82% of the inquiry time. Normally, a kite floats over a specific spot, peering down eagerly, once in a while for just a couple of moments, frequently for a moment or progressively, at that point skims quickly to another vantage point and drifts once more. When chasing from a roost, a dead tree is the favored stage. Like other "Elanus" kites, The dark carried kite holds a vertical branch with a foot on either side, every one over the other and turned inwards, which empowers them to keep up a safe balance on generally little branches. Despite the fact that drifting is the most well-known chasing technique, the kites have been watched looking through the ground underneath a vantage point for times of as long as 60 minutes.
