From Turkic peoples of Central Asia during the Northern Wei (386â535 AD) period the Eastern Romans acquired yet another name for China: "Taugast" (Old Turkic: "Tabghach"). Theophylact Simocatta, a historian during the reign of Heraclius (r. 610â641 AD), wrote that Taugast (or Taugas) was a great eastern empire colonised by Turkic people, with a capital city northeast of India that he called "Khubdan" (from the Turkic word "Khumdan" used for the Sui and Tang capital Chang'an), where idolatry was practised but the people were wise and lived by just laws. He depicted the Chinese empire as being divided by a great river (the Yangzi) that served as the boundary between two rival nations at war; during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Maurice (582â602 AD) the northerners wearing "black coats" conquered the "red coats" of the south (black being a distinctive colour worn by the people of Shaanxi, location of the Sui capital Sui Chang'an, according to the 16th-century Persian traveller Hajji Mahomed, or Chaggi Memet). This account may correspond to the conquest of the Chen dynasty and reunification of China by Emperor Wen of Sui (r. 581â604 AD). Simocatta names their ruler as "Taisson", which he claimed meant Son of God, either correlating to the Chinese "Tianzi" (Son of Heaven) or even the name of the contemporary ruler Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626 â 649 AD). Later medieval Europeans in China wrote of it as two separate countries, with "Cathay" in the north and "Mangi" in the south, during the period when the Yuan dynasty led by Mongol ruler Kublai Khan (r. 1260â1294 AD) conquered the Southern Song Dynasty.
