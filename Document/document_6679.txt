Ruler ÃÂthelwulf's ring was found in a truck groove in Laverstock in Wiltshire in about August 1780 by one William Petty, who sold it to a silversmith in Salisbury. The silversmith sold it to the Earl of Radnor, and the duke's child, William, gave it to the British Museum in 1829. The ring, together with a comparative ring of ÃÂthelwulf's little girl ÃÂthelswith, is one of two key instances of nielloed ninth century metalwork. They seem to speak to the rise of a "court style" of West Saxon metalwork, portrayed by an irregular Christian iconography, for example, a couple of peacocks at the Fountain of Life on the ÃÂthelwulf ring, related with Christian everlasting status. The ring is recorded "ÃÂthelwulf Rex", solidly connecting it with the King, and the engraving frames some portion of the structure, so it can't have been included later. A significant number of its highlights are average of ninth century metalwork, for example, the plan of two flying creatures, beaded and spotted outskirts, and a saltire with bolt like terminals on the back. It was likely produced in Wessex, however was ordinary of the consistency of creature decoration in England in the ninth century. In the perspective on Leslie Webster, a specialist on medieval craftsmanship: "Its fine Trewhiddle style adornment would absolutely fit a mid ninth-century date." In Nelson's view, "it was without a doubt made to be a blessing from this illustrious ruler to a strong supporter: the indication of an effective ninth-century majesty". The workmanship student of history David Wilson considers it to be a survival of the agnostic custom of the liberal ruler as the "ring-supplier".
