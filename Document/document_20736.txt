Controversy surrounded the program briefly in 2007 when the Board of Directors of the Baltimore City College Alumni Association, an influential group that performs several tasks in perpetuation of the school, including managing a nearly $2 million scholarship endowment and coordinating fundraising efforts for capital projects and other initiatives, argued to school officials that the IB Program diverts a significant percentage of the school's resources to benefit a fraction of the student population. Approximately 30Â students were enrolled in the full IB Diploma Program at that time. The Association also argued that the rigidity of the program did not give students enough coursework scheduling flexibility. Citing these concerns, the board of directors of the BCC Alumni Association formally voted to recommend that the school replace the IB Program with the "A course", which was discontinued in the 1990s, and expand the number of Advanced Placement courses offered to students. The recommendation, though non-binding, was intended to persuade the school to replace the curriculum with what its members believed to be more equitable and flexible. Despite the recommendation, school administrators proceeded with plans to expand the City College IB Program by incorporating the IB Middle Years Program into the 9th and 10th grade curricula. In addition to the IB courses, the school's academic program offers a small selection of Advanced Placement courses.
