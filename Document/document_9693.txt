Hayes had declared from the get-go in his administration that he would not look for another term, which implied that the challenge for the Republican designation in 1880 was available to all challengersÃ¢ÂÂincluding Blaine. Blaine was among the early top choices for the selection, as were previous President Grant, Treasury Secretary John Sherman of Ohio, and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont. In spite of the fact that Grant did not effectively advance his nomination, his entrance into the race re-empowered the Stalwarts and when the tradition met in Chicago in June 1880, they in a split second enraptured the representatives into Grant and hostile to Grant groups, with Blaine the most well known decision of the last gathering. Blaine was named by James Frederick Joy of Michigan, yet as opposed to Ingersoll's energizing discourse of 1876, Joy's extensive address was recollected just for its ungainliness. After different hopefuls were selected, the principal tally indicated Grant driving with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; no other applicant had more than Sherman's 93, and none had the required greater part of 379. Sherman's representatives could swing the assignment to either Grant or Blaine, however he wouldn't discharge them through twenty-eight tallies with the expectation that the counter Grant powers would betray Blaine and group to him. In the end, they deserted Blaine, yet rather than Sherman they moved their votes to Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield, and by the thirty-6th ticket he had 399 votes, enough for triumph.
