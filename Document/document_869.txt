"Saratoga" was at first fitted with electrically worked capturing gear planned via Carl Norden that utilized longitudinal wires expected to keep the air ship from being blown over the side of the ship, and transverse wires to ease back the air ship to a stop. This framework was approved to be supplanted by the using pressurized water worked Mk 2 framework, without longitudinal wires, on 11 August 1931. Four improved Mk 3 units were included 1934, giving the ship a sum of eight capturing wires and four obstructions expected to keep airplane from colliding with stopped flying machine on the ship's bow. At the point when the forward flight deck was extended, an extra eight wires were added there to enable flying machine to arrive over the bow if the arrival region at the stern was harmed. The ship was worked with a , flywheel-fueled, F Mk II air ship launch, likewise structured by Norden, on the starboard side of the bow. This sling was sufficiently able to dispatch a flying machine at a speed of . It was proposed to dispatch seaplanes, however was infrequently utilized; a 1931 report tallied just five dispatches of training loads since the ship had been charged. It was expelled some time after 1936.
