A legal request known as the Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry was framed to research the reasons for the impact. Procedures started at the Halifax Court House on 13 December 1917, managed by Justice Arthur Drysdale. The request's report of 4 February 1918 accused "Mont-Blanc"s chief, AimÃÂ© Le MÃÂ©dec, the ship's pilot, Francis Mackey, and Commander F. Evan Wyatt, the Royal Canadian Navy's head analyzing officer responsible for the harbor, doors and against submarine barriers, for causing the crash. Drysdale concurred with Dominion Wreck Commissioner L. A. Demers' supposition that "it was the "Mont-Blanc"s duty alone to guarantee that she maintained a strategic distance from a crash no matter what" given her payload; he was likely affected by neighborhood feeling, which was firmly against French, just as by the "road warrior" style of argumentation utilized by "Imo" legal counselor Charles Burchell. As indicated by Crown counsel W. A. Henry, this was "an extraordinary shock to a great many people", who had expected the "Imo" to be accused for being on the wrong side of the channel. Every one of the three men were accused of homicide and criminal carelessness at a starter hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod, and headed over for preliminary. A Nova Scotia Supreme Court equity, Benjamin Russell, found there was no proof to help these charges. Mackey was released on a writ of "habeas corpus" and the charges dropped. The charges against Le MÃÂ©dec were likewise expelled. This left just Wyatt to confront an excellent jury hearing. On 17 April 1918, a jury cleared him in a preliminary that kept going not exactly multi day.
