Hewett completed the season with 1,047 keeps running for Somerset, making him the main batsman in England to score 1,000 keeps running in province matches. In all out he scored 1,407 five star runs, the most by any batsman, and was third in the novice batting midpoints. He was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by the "Wisden Cricketers' Almanac" in 1893, in which it was guaranteed that "had it been fundamental last August <nowiki>[1892]</nowiki> to put an agent England eleven into the field, Hewett would without a doubt have been given a spot." Under Hewett's captaincy, Somerset won eight, drew three and lost five matches in 1892, completing third in the County Championship, which would remain their most astounding position for more than 100 years, until the region were sprinters up in the challenge in 2001. "The Times" applauded the district's accomplishments amid the year, and saved uncommon acclaim for Hewett; "Somerset's numerous splendid accomplishments, and the fine play of Messrs. Hewett and Palairet specifically, were a stamped highlight of the current year's cricket." After the end of the County Championship, Hewett showed up in three delegate matches, captaining the West to triumph over the East, and showing up under the captaincy of W.G. Elegance for both the South and the Gentlemen v Players.
