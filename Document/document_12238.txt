The Spanish party withdrew from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were encompassed by around 2,000 Itza warriors who endeavored to incapacitate them; the Itzas figured out how to catch another Spaniard and quickly struck off his head. Now around 10,000 Itza toxophilite showed up from kayaks disguised among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur requested his men to flame a volley that slaughtered somewhere in the range of 30 and 40 Itzas. Understanding that they were miserably dwarfed, the Spanish withdrew towards Chuntuki, surrendering their caught partners to their destiny. A Christian Maya musketeer and six different Indians fled toward the beginning of the fight and took news to GarcÃÂ­a that the whole undertaking had been butchered; Zubiaur and the overcomers of his campaign walked once more into the base camp at Chuntuki two days after the fact. UrsÃÂºa later announced that the Spanish detainees were reclaimed to NojpetÃÂ©n where they were altogether murdered; this was additionally affirmed by AjChan sometime in the not too distant future. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the last attack on NojpetÃÂ©n in 1697; AjKÃÂ¼in Kan EkÃÂ¼, the Itza devout cleric, later revealed that he had bound San Buenaventura and his buddy into cross shapes and cut out their souls.
