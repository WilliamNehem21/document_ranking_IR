Frederik Pohl assumed control over the editorship of both "If" and "Cosmic system" in 1961. Gold had an auto collision with adequately serious wellbeing results to keep him from having the capacity to proceed as supervisor. Pohl, who had been irregularly helping Gold with publication obligations for quite a while before the auto crash, is first recorded as supervisor of "If" on the masthead of the November 1961 issue, and as proofreader of "World" for the December 1961 issue, yet he had been going about as manager of the two magazines since in any event midyear. Pohl paid one penny for each word for the narratives he purchased for "If", though "System" paid three pennies for every word, and like Gold, he respected "Universe" as the main magazine of the two, while "If" was some place he could work with new scholars, and attempt examinations and impulses. This formed into a selling moment that a letter from a peruser, Clayton Hamlin, incited Pohl to announce that he would distribute another essayist in each and every issue of the magazine, however he was likewise ready to pull in understood authors. At the point when Pohl started his stretch as editorial manager, the two magazines were working at a misfortune; in spite of "If's" lower spending plan, Pohl thought that it was progressively enjoyable to alter, and remarked that evidently the perusers thought in this way, as well; he had the capacity to make "If" demonstrate a benefit before "Cosmic system", including, "What was a good time for me appeared to be a good time for them."
