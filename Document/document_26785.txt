Most of the episodes featuring Bob have been well received by fans and critics. "Cape Feare" is generally regarded as one of the best episodes of "The Simpsons" and placed third on "Entertainment Weekly"s 2003 list of the show's top 25 episodes. IGN considers it the best episode of the fifth season. In 2007, "Vanity Fair" called it the show's fourth-best episode, because of its "masterful integration of filmic parody and a recurring character". Ben Rayner of the "Toronto Star" listed "Cape Feare", "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" and "Brother From Another Series" among the best episodes of the series, writing "forget "Frasier", these are Kelsey Grammer's best roles." "The Italian Bob" and its writer John Frink won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2007 in the animation category. In December 2009, Robert Canning of IGN ranked the ten episodes to feature Bob that had aired at the time. The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with "Cape Feare" being ranked first. "The Italian Bob" was ranked tenth, with the explanation that "All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episodeÂ â the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate schemingÂ â were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn't nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn't result in a whole lot of laughs." He noted that only "The Italian Bob" and the ninth ranked "Funeral for a Fiend" were "the only ones I'd consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun."
