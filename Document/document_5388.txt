Letters in the Earl of Kincardine's papers demonstrate that William Bruce was estranged abroad in Rotterdam amid the 1650s with his cousin, Alexander Bruce, sibling of the Earl of Kincardine. As Episcopalians, William and Alexander would have looked for asylum from the Puritan Commonwealth set up by Oliver Cromwell. In Rotterdam, they were in contact with Sir Robert Moray, an officer and normal rationalist near Charles II, who at that point lived at Maastricht. William Bruce was a vendor, situated in the Scottish people group in Rotterdam, yet voyaging generally. He claimed a ship with Alexander Bruce and John Hamilton of Grange, and was associated with the exchange of wine, coal and timber between Norway, France, England, Scotland and the Low Countries. He is recorded as having a house and a paramour in La Rochelle. He may have had a child Normand by this paramour, since in 1672 he figures as an observer to the sanctification at Holyrood of a William Bruce, child of Normand Bruce, artisan. Besides, the marriage record of Normand Bruce expresses that he was utilized at Balcaskie. In 1658, William and Alexander voyaged together from Bremen overland to Maastricht to meet Moray. Alexander Bruce and Moray were author individuals from the Royal Society in 1660, and all things considered, engineering included in their talks, especially the new town corridor in Maastricht that Moray had as of late exhorted on.
