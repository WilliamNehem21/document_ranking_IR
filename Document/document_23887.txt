"Cucurbita" species fall into two main groups. The first group are annual or short-lived perennial vines and are mesophytic, i.e. they require a more or less continuous water supply. The second group are perennials growing in arid zones and so are xerophytic, tolerating dry conditions. Cultivated "Cucurbita" species were derived from the first group. Growing in height or length, the plant stem produces tendrils to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground. Most species do not readily root from the nodes; a notable exception is "C.Â ficifolia", and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent. The vine of the perennial "Cucurbita" can become semiwoody if left to grow. There is wide variation in size, shape, and color among "Cucurbita" fruits, and even within a single species. "C.Â ficifolia" is an exception, being highly uniform in appearance. The morphological variation in the species "C.Â pepo" and "C.Â maxima" is so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species.
The typical cultivated "Cucurbita" species has five-lobed or palmately divided leaves with long petioles, with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with various types of trichomes, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each node and are branching in some species. "C.Â argyrosperma" has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of "C.Â pepo" leaves varies widely. "C.Â moschata" plants can have light or dense pubescence. "C.Â ficifolia" leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species may or may not have white spots.
