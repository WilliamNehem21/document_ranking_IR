With Thessalonica verified, Vatatzes swung to Epirus, offering Michael II a marriage union between Michael's oldest child Nikephoros and his own granddaughter Maria. The offer was excitedly acknowledged by Michael's significant other, Theodora Petraliphaina (a niece of Theodore's own better half), and the youthful couple were locked in at Pegae. Michael, who had not relinquished his family's desire, stayed undecided about the Nicaean partnership, and Theodore utilized his impact over his nephew to turn him against it. In this way, in spring 1251, Michael propelled an unexpected assault on Thessalonica. The city opposed effectively, and in spring of the following year Vatatzes afresh crossed into Europe to battle against the Komnenoi Doukai. Theodore with Michael had swung toward the north, catching Prilep and Veles, and when they got updates on Vatatzes' entry, they pulled back to Epirus by means of Kastoria. Vatatzes assaulted and caught Theodore's fortification of Vodena, however before long moved toward becoming hindered in skirmishing in the region of Kastoria. The stalemate was broken when two Epirote commanders, John Glabas and Theodore Petraliphas, surrendered to the Nicaeans, pursued not long after by the leader of Kruja, Golem. This constrained Michael to grapple with Vatatzes, surrendering the fortifications he had caught just as his outstanding possessions in Macedonia, and reconfirming the marriage union with Nicaea. Moreover, Vatatzes expressly requested the giving over of Theodore. The Epirote represetatives met Vatatzes at Vodena, where they offered Theodore and the youthful Nikephoros as prisoners. The last was conceded the title of Despot and before long permitted to come back to Epirus, however Theodore was moved as a detainee to Asia Minor. He passed on not long after, around 1253.
