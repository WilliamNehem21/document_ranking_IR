The tropical banksia is generally a small tree which grows to around or sometimes tall, with a rough stocky trunk, spreading crown, and crooked branches. The dark grey bark is not flaky but tesselated in texture and appearance. Initially covered in reddish hair that wears away, branchlets become smooth and grey with age. The large green leaves are scattered along the stems, and more crowded at the branchlet tips. They are long and wide, obovate in shape with mucronate tips. The dentate (toothed) margins are lined irregularly with long teeth, separated by u-shaped sinuses. The leaves are undulate (wavy) with white undersurfaces, the midrib raised underneath and depressed above. The cylindrical yellow inflorescences (flower spikes), arise from one- to three-year-old branches. Appearing between November and May, they are high and wide. Newly opened flower spikes smell like corn. All flower parts are pale yellow; the perianth is long, including a long limb. After anthesis, the pistil is long. Flower parts soon fall off ageing spikes, which develop into irregular-cylindrical infructescences. The oval follicles are long, high and wide. Pale green and furry when young, they become smooth and pale brown with age. The follicles open spontaneously with maturity. They contain two seeds each, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring in length, the seed is obovate, and composed of a dark brown wide membranous 'wing' and obovate seed proper which measures long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges.
