On 24 April, the NDH made five military direction zones, including Bosnia Command and Adriatic Command, the two of which were at first headquartered in Sarajevo. Every one of the five military directions incorporated a few region directions. Adriatic Command incorporated the regions of Knin and Sinj in the Dalmatian hinterland, and Mostar and Trebinje in eastern Herzegovina. The NDH started to activate warriors for the Home Guard, with six brigades recognized to join Adriatic Command. The contingents were activated from territories outside of eastern Herzegovina, and were to be prepared by 20 May. The forceful activities of the UstaÃÂ¡e fifth segment amid the Axis intrusion made Serb regular citizen pioneers in eastern Herzegovina uncertain about the NDH, and they endeavored to get Italian insurance, and asked the Italians to attach eastern Herzegovina to the neighboring Italian-involved region of Montenegro. A collaborationist "Between time Advisory Committee" of Montenegrin separatists was upholding the foundation of an "autonomous" Montenegrin state, and a comparative panel of dissident Serbs was shaped in eastern Herzegovina. An assignment from that board of trustees landed in Cetinje in Montenegro on 6 May to request Italian insurance. Essentially, an assignment of Muslims from eastern Herzegovina made a trip to Sarajevo, the notable Bosnian capital, to ask the NDH experts to interface eastern Herzegovina to that city.
