Assessments for the quantity of warriors and setbacks at the fight differ generally. A Song source reports that there were 18,000 Song fighters positioned in Caishi, a number that history specialist Herbert Franke thinks about conceivable. Be that as it may, Song gauges for the quantity of Jin troops are likely expanded. One report asserts that 400,000 Jin fighters were available at the fight. This number is dubious, remembering that the Song had just 120,000 warriors battling on the whole front. Tune students of history may have befuddled the all out number of Jin work force sent on the front with the quantity of Jin warriors at Caishi. The swelled figure could have alluded to the quantity of officers that the Jin armed force had before intersection the Huai River toward the Yangtze. The renunciations and losses from smothering rebellions while propelling southward would have contracted that number when the Jin achieved the Yangtze. The "Historical backdrop of Jin", a record composed from the point of view of the Jin, reports Jin losses between one "meng'an" (a Jurchen unit of a thousand fighters) and a hundred men, and two "meng'an" and two hundred men. The "Historical backdrop of Song" reports Jin setbacks numbering four thousand fighters and two leaders of "wanhu" (ten thousand men) rank. A record of the fight by an alternate Song source holds that 24,000 Jin warriors kicked the bucket and that 500 soldiers and five "meng-a" were taken as detainees. An increasingly traditionalist Song source evaluates that the Jin just had 500 officers and 20 ships at Caishi. It isn't sure which of these figures is increasingly exact; Franke trusts that the most secure end that can be drawn is that the quantity of Jin losses was not more noteworthy than four thousand.
