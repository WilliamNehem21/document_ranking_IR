With the height of Palmyra to a colonia around 213Ã¢ÂÂ 216, the city stopped being liable to Roman commonplace governors and assessments. Palmyra consolidated Roman organizations into its framework while keeping a significant number of its previous ones. The chamber remained, and the "strategos" assigned one of two every year chose justices. This "duumviri" executed the new pioneer constitution, supplanting the archons. Palmyra's political scene changed with the ascent of Odaenathus and his family; an engraving dated to 251 depicts Odaenathus' child Hairan I as "Ras" (master) of Palmyra (exarch in the Greek area of the engraving) and another engraving dated to 252 portrays Odaenathus with a similar title. Odaenathus was most likely chosen by the chamber as exarch, which was an unordinary title in the Roman domain and was not part of the customary Palmyrene administration organizations. Regardless of whether Odaenathus' title showed a military or a clerical position is obscure, yet the military job is more probable. By 257 Odaenathus was known as a "consularis", perhaps the "legatus" of the region of Phoenice. In 258 Odaenathus started broadening his political impact, exploiting local unsteadiness brought about by Sasanian animosity; this finished in the Battle of Edessa, Odaenathus' illustrious rise and preparation of troops, which made Palmyra a kingdom.
