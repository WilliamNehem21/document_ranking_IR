Boise National Forest was made on July 1, 1908, from part of Sawtooth National Forest, and initially secured . By the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the U.S. Congress allowed the U.S. President the specialist to set up woods holds out of Public Domain Lands that were liable to transfer (estates, deals, and so on.) regulated by the General Land Office, which had been put under the expert of the U.S. Division of the Interior in 1849. With the entry of the Transfer Act of 1905, woodland saves were exchanged to the U.S. Branch of Agriculture in the recently made U.S. Woodland Service. Present-day Boise National Forest was first secured as a feature of two woodland holds by declarations issued by President Theodore Roosevelt: Sawtooth Forest Reserve (made on May 29, 1905, and developed November 6, 1906) and Payette Forest Reserve (made on June 3, 1905). After woods holds were renamed national backwoods in 1908, Boise National Forest was part from Sawtooth National Forest into an autonomous national timberland. On April 1, 1944, the whole of what was then Payette National Forest was exchanged to Boise National Forest, and at the same time Weiser and Idaho national woodlands were consolidated to restore the present-day Payette National Forest, which is toward the north of Boise National Forest. In 1933 the Boise Basin Experimental Forest was made on of the backwoods close Idaho City to examine the administration of ponderosa pine. The Lucky Peak Nursery was set up in 1959 to create trees for planting on consumed or logged arrives on the national woods of the Intermountain locale.
