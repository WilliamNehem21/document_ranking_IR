Until Owen distributed a conclusive anatomical examination in 1866, early naturalists were dubious whether the affirmative yes (variety "Daubentonia") was a primate, rat, or marsupial. In the late eighteenth century, for instance, the affirmative yes was grouped under the squirrel sort "Sciurus". By accentuating its primate highlights, for example, its postorbital bar, stereoscopic vision, and opposable hallux, over its rat like teeth, Owen showed its partiality with different primates. In 1996, Ankel-Simons exhibited that the shape and plan of the affirmative yes' minute deciduous incisors show that this class has a mutual parentage with the toothcombed primates. Be that as it may, the arrangement of the affirmative yes inside the primates stayed hazardous until in all respects as of late. The karyotype of the yes is observably not the same as that of its nearest relatives, the lorises and the remainder of the lemurs, with a diploid chromosome tally of 2n=30. In view of its life structures, analysts have discovered help for arranging the variety "Daubentonia" as a particular indriid, a sister gathering to all strepsirrhines, and an uncertain taxon inside the primates. In 1931, Schwarz marked the yes as a branch of Indriidae, guaranteeing that all lemurs were monophyletic, though Reginald Innes Pocock had recently set the affirmative yes outside of the lemurs. In that equivalent year, Anthony and Coupin ordered the affirmative yes under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister gathering to the next strepsirrhines. Colin Groves maintained this characterization in 2005 in light of the fact that he was not by any means persuaded the yes affirmative shaped a clade with the remainder of the Malagasy lemurs, regardless of atomic tests that had indicated Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuroidea.
