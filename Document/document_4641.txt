Williams' two different arrivals of 2008 were better gotten. The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was awed with her comic planning in "Dick" and in this way cast her in his directorial debut "Synecdoche, New York", a group test show featured by Philip Seymour Hoffman. It was a film industry bomb and energized pundits, in spite of the fact that Roger Ebert named it the best film of the decade. Two days in the wake of completing work on "Synecdoche, New York", Williams started taping Kelly Reichardt's "Wendy and Lucy", filling the role of a poor and forlorn young lady going with her puppy and searching for business. With a shoestring spending plan of $300,000, the film was shot on area in Portland, Oregon, with a to a great extent volunteer group. Williams had recently isolated from Ledger and was assuaged for the namelessness the task gave. She was satisfied with Reichardt's moderate methodology and related to her character's independence and guts. Sam Adams of "Los Angeles Times" observed Williams' execution to be "astounding for its profundity as well as for its stillness" and Mick LaSalle recognized her for adequately passing on a "lived-in feeling of continually having been near the financial edge".
