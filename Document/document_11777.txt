In JanuaryÃÂ 1975, Caltrans displayed plans to realign SRÃÂ 76 far from Mission Avenue and move it toward the south side of the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One individual from the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League proposed that the expressway be based on the northern side of the waterway, and pursue the stream the whole distance east to I-15. Following worries that the undertaking would be dropped because of absence of state subsidizing, the California Highway Commission (CHC) expressed that the proposition was all the while being considered. The City of Oceanside raised worries about the blockage on Mission Avenue, just as the realignment being a piece of the city ground breaking strategy. After this, toward the beginning of the following year, the CHC chose to keep the proposition, however there were worries that development would be postponed because of the state budgetary emergency. Caltrans expressed a couple of months after the fact that SRÃÂ 76 would be postponed in view of the financing issues and the moderately low dimensions of traffic that would not bolster assembling a road. Following this, State Senator John Stull claimed that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was deliberately deferring the venture by postponing the arrival of the ecological effect report. A request drive started before long, upheld by numerous North County pioneers, except for Bonsall because of worries about a full interstate going through the network.
