On the following Sundayâ1 May 1983â"The Sunday Times" published further stories providing the background to the diaries, linking them more closely to the plane crash in 1945, and providing a profile of Heidemann. That day, when "The Daily Express" rang Irving for a further comment on the diaries, he informed them that he now believed the diaries to be genuine; "The Times" ran the story of Irving's U-turn the following day. Irving explained that "Stern" had shown him a diary from April 1945 in which the writing sloped downwards from left to right, and the script of which got smaller along the line. At a subsequent press conference Irving explained that he had been examining the diaries of Dr Theodor Morell, Hitler's personal doctor, in which Morell diagnosed the as having Parkinson's disease, a symptom of which was to write in the way the text appeared in the diaries. Harris posits that further motives may also have played a partâthe lack of reference to the Holocaust in the diaries may have been perceived by Irving as supporting evidence for his thesis, put forward in his book "Hitler's War", that the Holocaust took place without Hitler's knowledge. The same day Hagen visited the and was told of their findings: ultraviolet light had shown a fluorescent element to the paper, which should not have been present in an old document, and that the bindings of one of the diaries included polyester which had not been made before 1953. Research in the archives also showed a number of errors. The findings were partial only, and not conclusive; more volumes were provided to aid the analysis.
