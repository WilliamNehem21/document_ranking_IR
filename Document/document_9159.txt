In July, a portion of Perot's past activities, including a private examination of the Bush family in the late 1980s, flowed in the media, causing disappointment for the battle. Perot accused the reports for a "Republican research group" and guaranteed that he was cautioned that since he had such a "perfect record they must endeavor to reclassify you and decimate you". Battle authorities attempted to concoct another procedure to battle the negative press, and to end Perot's utilization of speculations on the issues. Perot looked for National Institutes of Health head Dr. Bernadine Healy as his running mate, yet she declined. Then, Perot confronted impediments on the battle field. Amid an Olympia rally, he was drawn nearer by a gay rights gathering, requesting that he address AIDS and gay rights; he before long flipped on the issue and expressed that he would permit gays to serve in the military and in his bureau. Amid a location to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Perot confronted his hardest statistic, and made the indiscretion of alluding to African Americans as "you individuals". It was later uncovered that Perot did not have any desire to show up at the gathering or some other discussion without his supporters. Press advisor Squires had composed a discourse for Perot for the event, yet he rather utilized his own. After the discourse, Perot was worried that individuals from the New Black Panther Party were plotting his death.
