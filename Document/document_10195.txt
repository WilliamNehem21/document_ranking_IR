In late 1833 Etty was charged by Williams-Wynn to paint a picture of two of his seven youngsters. "Getting ready for a Fancy Dress Ball" delineates Williams-Wynn's little girls Charlotte and Mary, sprucing up in extravagant Italian-style ensemble. In spite of the fact that their dress is commonly portrayed as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 account of Etty hypothesizes that components of the outfits were perhaps planned to be Russian, in light of Charlotte's hat. The Italian-style apparel likely speaks to the abnormal state of enthusiasm for Italian culture in mid nineteenth century England. The prominence of the style of music currently known as "bel canto", generally connected with Italy, was at its pinnacle; in like manner, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had turned out to be very mainstream in the period. Etty, who had invested a decent arrangement of energy in Venice and other Italian urban communities, would have been extremely acquainted with Italian apparel plans, and the ensembles worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters intently take after those of ladies in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, for example, 1831's "Window in Venice, During a Fiesta". As craftsmanship history specialist Leonard Robinson calls attention to, in spite of the title the sisters are not in reality appeared for the ball, yet are completely dressed. The style of the work mirrors that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's instructor in 1807Ã¢ÂÂ 08, just as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was an extraordinary admirer and of whose works Etty had regularly made duplicates as an activity.
