Spreckels was at that point in correspondence with American specialists; in January 1883, the Director of the United States Mint, Horatio Burchard, had kept in touch with him clarifying the laws under which the Mint could strike coins for remote governments, and that in spite of the fact that the coins could be struck at the San Francisco Mint, the bites the dust for the coinage would need to be set up at Philadelphia. He requested portrayals from Spreckels, who gave a front-side appearing full-face picture of the lord; this was submitted to Chief Engraver Charles E. Hair stylist in Philadelphia, who rejected it as illogical. Hairdresser prescribed the ruler be appeared in profile, and a reasonable photo was sent to him for use in getting ready models of the proposed coins. When the Mint got Spreckels' bonus as operator, Acting Director Robert E. Preston composed taking note of that the approval called for 12 penny pieces, yet that the Hawaiian law had called for coins indistinguishable in size, weight, and fineness to US coins, and there was no such group struck by the US Mint. He inquired as to whether ten-penny pieces were wanted rather, however no answer was quickly expected, and Barber completed starter structures, including the 12 penny piece.
