In spite of its solid deals, "Last Fantasy XIII" had been scrutinized on a few fronts. Grievances incorporated that the amusement had been excessively direct, had not permitted enough communication with non-player characters, and had not highlighted enough minigames and riddles. The designers expected to address these reactions with the continuation by including the Historia Crux framework, various sidequests from non-player characters, and the gambling club minigame territory. Situations were made progressively explorable and the craftsmen were given more opportunity to incorporate their own thoughts in the amusement's areas, so as to correct the deficiencies of the more fake appearing settings in "Conclusive Fantasy XIII". In spite of the fact that the engineers were unequivocally reacting to the analysis, they saw the progressions and increments as making the spin-off in accordance with what players had trusted "Last Fantasy XIII" would be, as opposed to moving in an opposite direction from the progressions that amusement had conveyed to the arrangement. For the structure of side journeys and some different angles, for example, the plenitude of chocobos and the more open condition, the group drew motivation from Rockstar San Diego's "Red Dead Redemption". The amusement likewise incorporated various endings, which Toriyama alluded to as a first for the arrangement.
