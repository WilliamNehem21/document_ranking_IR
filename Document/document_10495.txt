MacLaren accepted another position with a wine shipper which enabled him to finish a full season in 1903. Wet climate caused numerous troublesome pitches for batting, and MacLaren was frequently the main Lancashire batsman ready to adapt to the conditions. His most elevated profile achievement came when he captained the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's. At the point when his group confronted rout on the last day on a troublesome pitch, he scored 168 not out and imparted an association of 309 to C. B. Sear in under three hours. This innings was later applauded as one of his best. He finished the season with 1,886 keeps running at 42.86, and Lancashire completed fourth. Nonetheless, his prosperity with the bat was eclipsed by debate over the England captaincy. MacLaren initially intended to visit Australia with another private group in the winter of 1903Ã¢ÂÂ 04, yet pulled back over his worries that there was insufficient solid bowling accessible. Baffled with MacLaren, the cricket experts in Melbourne asked the MCC, through Pelham Warner, to arrange their very own group. MacLaren was not offered the captaincyÃ¢ÂÂWarner was picked in June 1903 when Jackson demonstrated inaccessible. Paper bits of gossip proposed that Lord Hawke had an impact in this choice, and that MacLaren's ongoing paid job for Lancashire meant something negative for him. The press favored MacLaren, and Warner was broadly scrutinized; one diary noticed that he was "denounced as an intruder and nothing worth mentioning". The cricket foundation was less thoughtful to MacLaren. After freely wavering over the mid year, he in the end chose not to visit under Warner, whom he saw to be his lesser. The visit demonstrated an incredible accomplishment for Warner, and his group won the Test arrangement.
