In 1985, the French producer Maurice Pialat included a segment of the third development in the completion credits of his motion picture "Police". At the point when the work was later repackaged as a "soundtrack collection", it sold well. Despite the fact that Gorecki's name was highlighted conspicuously on the intro page, the sleeve notes on the back gave valuable little data about the work, and GÃÂ³recki's name showed up in littler sort than those of the fundamental on-screen characters. In the mid-1980s, British mechanical music assemble Test Dept utilized the orchestra as a scenery for video arrangements amid their shows, recasting the ensemble as a vehicle for the band's compassion for the Polish Solidarity development, which GÃÂ³recki additionally bolstered (his 1981 piece "Miserere" was created to a limited extent as a reaction to government resistance of Solidarity worker's guilds). Amid the late 1980s, the ensemble got expanding airplay on US and British traditional radio stations, eminently Classic FM. The fall of socialism spread the prominence of Polish music for the most part, and by 1990 the ensemble was being performed in real urban areas, for example, New York, London and Sydney. A 1991 chronicle with the London Sinfonietta, led by David Zinman and including the soloist Dawn Upshaw, was discharged in 1992 by the Elektra engrave Nonesuch Records. Inside two years, the chronicle had sold in excess of 700,000 duplicates around the world; the account moved to number 6 on the standard UK collection graphs, and keeping in mind that it didn't show up on the US "Announcement" 200, it remained at the highest point of the US established outlines for 38 weeks and remained on for 138 weeks. The Zinman/Upshaw recording has sold over a million duplicates. It presumably considers the smash hit contemporary traditional record ever.
