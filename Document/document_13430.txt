"Divine force of War: Ascension (Original Soundtrack)" was made by Tyler Bates and was discharged on iTunes on March 5, 2013 by SCE and La-La Land Records. It was incorporated as DLC in the "Divine force of War: AscensionÃ¢ÂÂCollector's Edition" and "Exceptional Edition". On October 15, the soundtrack was made accessible for nothing on PSN temporarily. An eminent element of "Ascension"s soundtrack is that it was scored by just a single writer; all the past recreations had various arrangers. Tyler Bates recently scored the also themed film "300" and diversion "Ascent of the Argonauts". Bates said "My objective was to make a sound that upheld the immortal dull period of "Lord of War", while growing the parameters of the 'Sword and Sandals' sort." Although the amusement's story is direct, he moved toward the task as though he were scoring a novel rather than a movie. Bates did not play any of the past recreations and decided not to so as to take the score "to new places without being plainly mindful of the extraordinary music that is symbolic" of the earlier portions. The soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and highlights solo vocal work from Rafe Pearlman and Ciscandra Nostalghia.
