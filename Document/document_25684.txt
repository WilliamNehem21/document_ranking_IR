There were charges of favoritism in purchasing programs. Aubrey's friend Keefe Brasselle, who had bit parts in several movies in the 1940s and 1950s and met Aubrey when they both worked at KNXT, had no experience as a producer. "A 1965 edition of George Raft," said David Susskind, particularly apt as there were also rumors Brasselle had ties to the Mafia. Nevertheless, Aubrey scheduled three shows from Brasselle's Richelieu Productions for the 1964â65 season, all without pilots, still an almost unheard-of practice. (The shows were "The Baileys of Balboa", a sitcom with Paul Ford; the newspaper drama "The Reporter"; and "The Cara Williams Show", a sitcom starring red-head Williams, billed as the next Lucille Ball.) Brasselle would personally supervise "The Reporter", shot in New York City. Costs skyrocketed on Brasselle's showsÂ â after nine episodes, "The Reporter" was $450,000 over budgetÂ â and all three bombedÂ â "The Reporter" running only three months, "Baileys" until April 1965; and "Cara Williams" finishing the season. Aubrey was later asked why he aired three untested programs. "Arrogance, I guess" he responded. In his book "The Other Glass Teat", media critic Harlan Ellison alleges that a Mafia don had put out a contract on Aubrey for beating his daughter during consensual sex at a Las Vegas, Nevada hotel, and that Brasselle demanded the shows in exchange for his using his own Mafia connections to smooth things over.
