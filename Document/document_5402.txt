To win the decision, Whig pioneers chose they needed to assemble individuals the nation over, including ladies, who couldn't then cast a ballot. This was the first occasion when that an American ideological group included ladies in crusade exercises on an across the board scale, and ladies in Tyler's Virginia were dynamic for his sake. The gathering planned to stay away from issues and win through open eagerness, with torchlight parades and liquor powered political revitalizes. The enthusiasm for the battle was extraordinary, with numerous open occasions. At the point when the Democratic press portrayed Harrison as an old trooper, who might divert beside his crusade whenever given a barrel of hard juice to savor his log lodge, the Whigs anxiously seized on the picture, and the log lodge battle was conceived. The way that Harrison lived on a palatial domain along the Ohio River and that Tyler was wealthy were disregarded, while log lodge pictures showed up all over the place, from flags to bourbon bottles. Juice was the favored refreshment of numerous ranchers and tradesmen, and Whigs asserted that Harrison favored that drink of the regular man. Democrats grumbled that the Harrison/Tyler battle's liberal arrangement of hard juice at arouses was empowering intoxication.
