The intensity of the Aksumite Kingdom declined after the sixth century because of the ascent of other local states in the Horn of Africa. Current researchers keep on discussing the personality and provenance of the incredible or semi-amazing figure Gudit (fl. tenth century), a ruler who is generally accepted to have toppled the Kingdom of Aksum. The legend is found in the thirteenth century account of the priest Tekle Haymanot, who assembled recorded compositions accumulated from different Ethiopian places of worship and religious communities. The narrative affirms that, in the wake of being banished from Axum, she wedded a Jewish lord of Syria and changed over to Judaism. The Scottish travel essayist James Bruce (1730Ã¢ÂÂ 1794) was distrustful about the story and trusted she was essentially a Jewish ruler. Carlo Conti Rossini (1872Ã¢ÂÂ 1949) theorized that she was an ethnic Sidamo from Damot, while Steven Kaplan contends she was a non-Christian trespasser and student of history Knud Tage Andersen battles she was an ordinary individual from the Aksumite regal house who intelligently caught the honored position. The last is more in accordance with another legend that claims Dil Na'od, the last ruler of Aksum, kept his girl Mesobe Werq in confinement out of dread of a prediction that her child would oust him, yet she ran off with the aristocrat Mara Takla Haymanot from Lasta who in the long run murdered the Aksumite lord in a duel, took the royal position and established the Zagwe administration. The last stays a standout amongst the most ineffectively comprehended times of Ethiopia's written history. What is known is that the early Zagwe lords were polytheistic, in the long run changed over to Christianity, and governed over the northern Highlands of Ethiopia, while Islamic sultanates occupied the seaside Ethiopian Lowlands.
