Wollstonecraft's epigrammatic mention to Rousseau's "Julie" (1761) connotes her obligation to the novel of reasonableness, a standout amongst the most prevalent types amid the last 50% of the eighteenth century. Alongside other female scholars, for example, Mary Hays, Helen Maria Williams, Charlotte Turner Smith, Mary Robinson, Maria Edgeworth, and Hannah More, Wollstonecraft felt constrained to react to the Rousseauvean ideological tasteful that had come to command British fiction. Sentimental champions, Wollstonecraft researcher Gary Kelly states, "speak to lady built for man: the courageous female casualty of the elegant rake and brave, the ethical ladylike sidekick of the perfect professionalized respectable man, and the mentally and sexually subservient friend of the perfect common man". Wollstonecraft would likewise assault Rousseau in her best-known work, "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman", on account of his sexism in the second piece of "Emile". She reports in the "Ad" (an area like an introduction) of "Mary" that she is putting forth her champion, who is a "virtuoso", as a complexity to characters, for example, Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Rousseau's . Moreover the content is peppered with inferences to famous wistful books, for example, "The History of Eliza Warwick" (1778) and "The Platonic Marriage" (1787), which evaluate their introduction of the champion of ladylike reasonableness. Mary is increasingly much the same as the magnanimous and enterprising courageous women of Bluestocking Sarah Scott's "Millenium Hall" (1762) than to the uninvolved, tearful champions found in most nostalgic books. Discussion concerning the connection among sex and reasonableness proceeded into the mid nineteenth century; Jane Austen, for instance, made it the express focal point of her novel "Sense and Sensibility" (1811).
