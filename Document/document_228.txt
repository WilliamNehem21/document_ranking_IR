Australia had under 15 minutes of batting before the planned close of play. Barnes made an intrigue against the light after the main bundle of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Barnes strolled down the pitch and apparently murmured to umpire Frank Chester in an easygoing tone "Eh, the light!", which purportedly stunned the judge. Amid the past Ashes arrangement in Australia, Barnes had consistently set aside a few minutes squandering requests against the light, which constrained cricket executives to confine the batting group to one intrigue; if this was declined it would be dependent upon the umpires to offer a deferment. In spite of the intrigue against the light, the Australians demonstrated little want to be careful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 keeps running from his two overs. Morris and Barnes effectively arranged the new ball bowling of Edrich and Bedser. They achieved stumps at 17 without misfortune, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six. Barnes had been lucky, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon, and Yardley's choice to put his bowlers Young and Bedser in that district raised astonishment; bowlers will in general come up short on the deftness and reflexes required for such positions. At this stage, following their last part obstruction, England were in a decent position with keeps running on the board if downpour struck medium-term and caused a sticky wicket, driving the Australians to bat in threatening conditions the next day.
