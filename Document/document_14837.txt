The boats of the I Squadron went on a couple of preparing travels amid 9Ã¢ÂÂ 19 January and 27 FebruaryÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron preparing pursued, with an accentuation on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the armada started a noteworthy preparing exercise in the North Sea. The armada at that point traveled through the Kattegat and halted in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The late spring voyage finished on 9 August; the harvest time moves that would regularly have started presently were postponed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British armada ceased in Danzig, SwinemÃÂ¼nde, and Flensburg, where it was welcomed by units of the German Navy; "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the primary German armada were moored at SwinemÃÂ¼nde for the event. The visit's effect was diminished by the continuous Anglo-German maritime weapons contest. Because of the British visit, the 1905 harvest time moves were abbreviated impressively, from 6 to 13 September, and comprised just of activities in the North Sea. The main exercise assumed a maritime barricade in the German Bight, and the second imagined a threatening armada endeavoring to drive the protections of the Elbe. Amid the activities, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" won the Kaiser's "Schiesspreis" (Shooting Prize) for phenomenal gunnery in the I Squadron. In October, the ship was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron. Toward the beginning of December, the I and II Squadrons went on their normal winter journey, this opportunity to Danzig, where they touched base on 12 December. On the arrival trek to Kiel, the armada directed strategic activities.
