In 1928, the ornithologist Gregory Mathews found a 1790 painting by Raper which differed enough from "P. albus" that he named a new species: "P. raperi". Mathews also considered "P. albus" distinct enough to warrant a new genus, "Kentrophorina", due to its wing claw. In 1936, he conceded that "P. raperi" was a synonym of "P. albus". The ornithologist Keith Alfred Hindwood agreed that the bird was an albino "P. melanotus" in 1932, and pointed out that the naturalists Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster (his son) did not record the bird when Cook's ship visited Norfolk Island in 1774. In 1940, Hindwood found the Lord Howe swamphen so closely related to the Australasian swamphen that he considered them subspecies of the same species: "P. albus albus" and "P. albus melanotus" (since "albus" is the older name). Hindwood suggested that the population on Lord Howe Island was white; blue Australasian swamphens occasionally arrived (stragglers from elsewhere have been found on the island) and bred with the white birds, accounting for the blue and partially-blue individuals in the old accounts. He also pointed out that Australasian swamphens are prone to white feathering. In 1941, the biologist Ernst Mayr proposed that the Lord Howe swamphen was a partially-albinistic population of Australasian swamphens. Mayr suggested that the blue swamphens remaining on Lord Howe Island were not stragglers, but had survived because they were less conspicuous than the white ones. In 1967, the ornithologist James Greenway also considered the Lord Howe swamphen a subspecies (with "P. stanleyi" a synonym) and considered the white individuals albinos. He suggested that the similarities between the wing feathers of the Lord Howe swamphen and the takahÄ were due to parallel evolution in two isolated populations of reluctant fliers.
