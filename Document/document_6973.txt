Fillmore had gone through the four months between the race and swearing-in being feted by the New York Whigs and wrapping up undertakings in the controller's office. Taylor had kept in touch with him, promising impact in the new organization; the duly elected president erroneously believed that the VP was a bureau part, which was not valid in the nineteenth century. Fillmore, Seward and Weed had met and come to general concession to how to isolate government employments in New York. Seward, when he went to Washington, reached Taylor's bureau candidates, counselors, and the general's sibling, and a partnership between the approaching organization and the Weed machine was soon under route despite Fillmore's good faith. In return for help, Seward and Weed were permitted to assign who was to fill government employments in New York, with Fillmore given far not exactly had been concurred. Whenever Fillmore, after the introduction, found this, he went to Taylor, which just made the fighting against Fillmore's impact increasingly obvious. Fillmore supporters like Collier, who had selected him at the tradition, were ignored for competitors sponsored by Weed, who was triumphant even in Buffalo. This incredibly expanded the impact of Weed in New York legislative issues, and lessened Fillmore's. As per Rayback, "by mid-1849, Fillmore's circumstance had turned out to be urgent." Despite his absence of impact, he was irritated by office searchers and those with a house to rent or offer him, as there was then no official living arrangement for the VP. He appreciated one part of his office, because of his long lasting adoration for learning: he turned out to be profoundly engaged with the organization of the Smithsonian Institution as a part "ex officio" of its Board of Regents.
