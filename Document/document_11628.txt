While under Phleps' direction, the division carried out numerous violations against regular citizen populace of the NDH, particularly amid Case White and Case Black. These included "consuming towns, slaughter of occupants, torment and murder of caught partisans", thus the division consequently built up an unmistakable notoriety for cold-bloodedness. These charges have been denied by Kumm, among others. All things considered, the divisional requests routinely required the destruction of unfriendly non military personnel populace and records by the "Waffen-SS" themselves demonstrate that these requests were consistently tried. For instance, Himmler's police agent in the NDH, "SS-BrigadefÃÂ¼hrer und Generalmajor der Polizei" Konstantin Kammerhofer, gave an account of 15 July 1943 that units of the seventh SS Division had shot the Muslim populace of Kosutica, around 40 men, ladies, and kids assembled in a "congregation". The division asserted that "brigands" in the town had started shooting, yet the police couldn't find any hints of battle. Such occurrences, which imperiled the arrangement to raise a Muslim SS division, prompted a question among Kammerhofer and Phleps' successor Oberkamp. Himmler requested Phleps to mediate, and he wrote about 7 September 1943 that he couldn't find anything amiss with the shootings in Kosutica and that Kammerhofer and Oberkamp had settled their question. The atrocities carried out by the seventh SS Division turned into the subject of universal contention when Waldheim's administration in the Balkans wound up open in the mid-1980s, amid his fruitful offer for the Austrian administration.
