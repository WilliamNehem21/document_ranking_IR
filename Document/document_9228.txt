In his later years Rhys experienced difficulty keeping control of his children, especially Maelgwn and Gruffydd. In 1189 Gruffydd induced Rhys to detain Maelgwn, and he was surrendered to Gruffydd's keeping at Dinefwr. Gruffydd gave him over to his dad in-law, William de Braose. Gruffydd is likewise said to have convinced his dad to add the lordship of Cemais and its central stronghold of Nevern, held by William FitzMartin, in 1191. This activity was scrutinized by Giraldus Cambrensis, who portrays Gruffydd as "a craftiness and sly man". William FitzMartin was hitched to Rhys' little girl Angharad, and, as indicated by Giraldus, Rhys "had gravely sworn, by the most valuable relics, that his repayment and security ought to be steadfastly kept up". Rhys had additionally attached the Norman lordships of Cydweli and Carnwyllion in 1190. In 1192 Rhys verified Maelgwn's discharge, however at this point Maelgwn and Gruffydd were unpleasant foes. In 1194 Rhys was vanquished fighting by Maelgwn and Hywel, who detained him in Nevern stronghold, however Hywel later discharged his dad without Maelgwn's assent. Giraldus recommends that Rhys' imprisonment in Nevern chÃÂ¢teau was divine retaliation for the dispossession of William FitzMartin. In 1195 two different children, Rhys Gryg and Maredudd, seized Llanymddyfri and Dinefwr, and Rhys reacted by detaining them. Rhys propelled his last battle against the Normans in 1196. He caught various manors, including Carmarthen, Colwyn, Radnor and Painscastle, and vanquished a military driven by Roger de Mortimer and Hugh de Say close Radnor, with forty knights among the dead. This was Rhys' last fight. William de Braose offered terms, and Painscastle was come back to him.
