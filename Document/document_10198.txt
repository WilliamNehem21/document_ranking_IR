"The Shadow of the Glen", in view of a tale around an unfaithful spouse, was assaulted in print by the Irish patriot pioneer Arthur Griffith as "a slur on Irish womanhood". A long time later Synge expressed: "When I was stating "The Shadow of the Glen" a few years back I got more guide than any taking in could have given me from a chink in the floor of the old Wicklow house where I was staying, that let me hear what was being said by the hireling young ladies in the kitchen." This empowered increasingly basic assaults claiming that Synge depicted Irish ladies in an out of line way. "Riders to the Sea" was likewise assaulted by patriots, this time including Patrick Pearse, who criticized it on account of the creator's frame of mind to God and religion. Pearse, Arthur Griffith and other moderate disapproved of Catholics asserted Synge had completed a damage to Irish patriotism by not glorifying his characters. In any case, later faultfinders have assaulted Synge for glorifying the Irish working class excessively. A third one-act play, "The Tinker's Wedding", was drafted around this time, yet Synge at first made no endeavor to have it performed, to a great extent on account of a scene in which a minister is tied up in a sack, which, as he kept in touch with the distributer Elkin Mathews in 1905, would most likely agitated "a great a considerable lot of our Dublin companions".
