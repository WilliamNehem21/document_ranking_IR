After the fizzled dealings, Confederate Attorney General George Davis and Confederate Treasury Secretary George Trenholm surrendered. The remainder of the Confederate bureauÃ¢ÂÂescorted by more than 2,000 cavalrymen under Basil W. Duke and Breckinridge's cousin William Campbell Preston BreckinridgeÃ¢ÂÂwent southwest to meet Taylor at Mobile. Trusting that the Confederate reason was not yet lost, Davis met a gathering of war on May 2 in Abbeville, South Carolina, yet the rangers leaders revealed to him that the main source for which their men would battle was to help Davis' departure from the nation. Educated that gold and silver coins and bullion from the Confederate treasury were at the train station in Abbeville, Breckinridge requested Duke to stack it onto wagons and gatekeeper it as they proceeded with southward. "On the way" to Washington, Georgia, a few individuals from the bureau's escort took steps to take their back pay rates by power. Breckinridge had proposed to hold up until their entry to make the installments, yet to keep away from uprising, he scattered a portion of the assets right away. Two detachments left following being paid; the rest proceeded to Washington, where the rest of the assets were kept in a neighborhood bank.
