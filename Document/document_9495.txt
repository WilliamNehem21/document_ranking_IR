After 830, Egbert had pursued a strategy of keeping up great relations with Mercia, and this was proceeded by ÃÂthelwulf when he progressed toward becoming lord. London was generally a Mercian town, however during the 830s it was under West Saxon control; not long after ÃÂthelwulf's promotion it returned to Mercian control. Ruler Wiglaf of Mercia kicked the bucket in 839 and his successor, Berhtwulf, restored the Mercian mint in London; the two kingdoms seem to have struck a joint issue in the mid-840s, perhaps demonstrating West Saxon help in resuscitating Mercian coinage, and appearing inviting relations between the two forces. Berkshire was still Mercian in 844, yet by 849 it was a piece of Wessex, as Alfred was conceived in that year at the West Saxon imperial bequest in Wantage, at that point in Berkshire. Nonetheless, the nearby Mercian ealdorman, likewise called ÃÂthelwulf, held his situation under the West Saxon lords. Berhtwulf passed on in 852 and collaboration with Wessex proceeded under Burgred, his successor as King of Mercia, who wedded ÃÂthelwulf's little girl ÃÂthelswith in 853. Around the same time ÃÂthelwulf helped Burgred in an effective assault on Wales to reestablish the conventional Mercian authority over the Welsh.
