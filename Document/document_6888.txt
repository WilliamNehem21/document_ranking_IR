They proceeded to clear the major IRB (presently World Rugby) grants in which they were named: Team of the Year, Henry was named Coach of the Year, and initial five-eighth Dan Carter was Player of the Year. New Zealand were assigned for the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year in 2006 for their 2005 execution. The next year they again took the Tri-Nations Series in the wake of winning their initial five matches, three against Australia and two against South Africa. They lost their last match of the arrangement against South Africa. They finished their finish of year visit unbeaten, with record away successes over France, England and Wales. New Zealand were named 2006 IRB Team of the Year and were selected for the Laureus World Sports Award for the second time, while flanker and recently named skipper Richie McCaw was named IRB Player of the Year out of the blue.
