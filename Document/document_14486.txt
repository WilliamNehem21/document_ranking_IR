Philip Lutgendorf, a researcher at the University of Iowa, has expressed that while the subject of the contention between energetic individual love and family obligation might be basic in Hindi film making, with perpetual true to life changes, K. Asif's "intemperate elaboration of the subject stays in a class without anyone else's input." Further, Emperor Akbar battles between his own wants and his obligations to the country. Ashis Nandy noticed that separated from the contention among Akbar and his child, there is likewise an "unwritten collusion" among Akbar and Bahar that exacerbates the issues of Anarkali. He likewise thought it featured the "thought of equity and the idea of unqualified love" to maintain convention. The tune "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" sung by Anarkali meant that her rebellion of societal standards. A noteworthy distinction from the first story is that while the prior Anarakali films dependent on Imtiaz Ali Taj's story finished as catastrophes, K. Asif made a generally upbeat completion in that Akbar offers acquittal to Anarkali by enabling her to escape through a mystery course of passages beneath a bogus base of her jail divider, in spite of the fact that his child is made to endure in trusting her to have died.
