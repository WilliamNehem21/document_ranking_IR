As per the "Domesday Book" in 1086, the present day Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme were a solitary substantial home. Esteemed at ÃÂ£20, it was portrayed as "extensive and critical" and "a wood three alliances [about 9ÃÂ miles] long and half as wide". One of the most punctual proprietors of the property was the Earl of Chester. It was held by a Gamel, a free Saxon, under Hugh d'Avranches, first Earl of Chester, and later turned into the property of the de Chedle family, who took their name from the land they possessed. By June 1294 Geoffrey de Chedle was Lord of the Manor. Geoffrey's relative Robert (or Roger) passed on in the mid 1320s, leaving the bequest to his better half Matilda who held it until her demise in 1326. As there were no male beneficiaries the estate, which was presently worth ÃÂ£30 per annum, was separated between her little girls, Clemence and Agnes. Clemence acquired the southern half (which would later turn into the present day Cheadle Hulme), and Agnes acquired the northern half, (recently Cheadle). The two territories wound up known as "Chedle Holme" and "Chedle Bulkeley" individually. Right away subsequently the Chedle Holme home was partitioned and the part where Hulme Hall is currently arranged ended up known as "Holme", and held by the Vernons. The bequests were reunified on the passing of the remainder of the Vernons in 1476.
