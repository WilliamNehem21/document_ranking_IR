Paul released his first live recording, simply titled "Live", on March 14, 2000. The double-disk included recordings from several shows, as well as previously unreleased studio tracks. Highlights of the year 2000 included Paul singing the National Anthem at Fenway Park, and having his song "The World Ain't Slowing Down" chosen for the theme song in the Farrelly brothers movie "Me, Myself and Irene" starring Jim Carrey and RenÃ©e Zellweger. Both events took place on the same June weekend. In November 2001, Paul was again successful in having a song in a movie when "Sweet Mistakes" was featured in "Shallow Hal" starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black. Paul released his 8th CD, "Sweet Mistakes", a collection of audience-favorites not yet recorded, on November 15, 2001. In January 2002, Paul was named the "FolkWax" Artist of the Year for 2001.
Paul often recites original poetry for his audiences. Some of those poems can be found in "Notes from the Road", a collection of Paul's original poems, lyrics, and journal entries published by Black Wolf Press in May 2002. In her review for "Performing Songwriter", Abby White said, "The book has an intimate, conversational tone, and Paul's childlike drawings, song lyrics and poetry provide commercial breaks to his personal journal entries and vivid recollections of significant events he encounters while touring". As the 21st century began Paul recited his "Millennium Poem", regularly at shows.
