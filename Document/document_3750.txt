The arrangement of the arrangement likewise pays respect to "Stories of the Unexpected", "The Twilight Zone" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". Pemberton and Shearsmith came back to composing progressively ghastly stories, as indicated by the last mentioned, as they "generally feel marginally unfulfilled if [they] compose something that is absolutely comedic, it just feels excessively unimportant and light". Amid the shooting of "Sardines", Shearsmith maintained energy to chip away at "Inside No. 9", saying that "being really busy recording a third arrangement of "Psychoville" would be absolutely discouraging". Pemberton and Shearsmith went for a less complex encounter than "Psychoville", depicting "Sardines" by saying the scene is "just about some great performers in a closet with a decent story". As every scene of "Inside No. 9" includes new characters, the scholars had the capacity to pull in performing artists who may have been reluctant to focus on a whole arrangement. Notwithstanding Pemberton and Shearsmith, "Sardines" featured Katherine Parkinson, Tim Key, Luke Pasqualino, Ophelia Lovibond, Anne Reid, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Anna Chancellor, Marc Wootton, Ben Willbond and Timothy West. West had recently featured in "Stories of the Unexpected", and Shearsmith said that, because of this earlier appearance, "it was an extraordinary gesture" to have West in the scene. "Sardines" has a greater number of characters than some other scene of the main arrangement, and these characters were composed before throwing occurred. Pemberton reviews the fun he had in choosing a cast for the scene, meaning to unite a changed gathering of performers who might function admirably as a gathering.
