Charles Eugene started the development of another royal residence in Stuttgart in 1746 yet informally utilized Ludwigsburg as his home until 1775. The capacity of specific rooms at Ludwigsburg changed as often as possible; changed over the Ordenskapelle to a Lutheran church from 1746 to 1748 for Duchess Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie. Starting in 1757 and enduring into the following year, the suites of the beletage were broadly adjusted by Philippe de La GuÃÂªpiÃÂ¨re. La GuÃÂªpiÃÂ¨re finished the Schlosstheater in 1758Ã¢ÂÂ 59, including a phase, hardware, and the assembly room. A wooden musical show house, decorated with mirrors, was developed in 1764Ã¢ÂÂ 65, found east of the Alter Hauptbau. In spite of the fact that Charles Eugene authoritatively announced Ludwigsburg Palace his living arrangement in 1764, he made no further adjustments after 1770. The royal residence that had facilitated a court that Giacomo Casanova called "the most wonderful in Europe" started a relentless decrease. Charles Eugene kicked the bucket without a real beneficiary in 1793 and was prevailing by his sibling, Frederick II Eugene, who was prevailing by his child Frederick II in 1797. Ludwigsburg Palace had just been Frederick II's mid year living arrangement since 1795, and he kept on utilizing it all things considered with Duchess Charlotte in the wake of wedding her on 18 May 1797.
