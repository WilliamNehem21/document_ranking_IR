In February 1999, the city declared it was consulting with Frank Gehry to plan a proscenium curve and ensemble walled in area for a bandshell, just as a person on foot connect crossing Columbus Drive, and that it was looking for benefactors to cover his work. At the time, the "Chicago Tribune" named Gehry "the most sweltering modeler known to man" in reference to the approval for his Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and they noticed the structures would exclude Mayor Richard M. Daley's trademarks, for example, fashioned iron and regular bloom boxes. Thousand years Park venture director Edward Uhlir said "Blunt is only the front line of the following century of engineering," and noticed that no other draftsman was being looked for. Gehry was moved toward a few times by Skidmore draftsman Adrian Smith for the benefit of the city. His reluctance and refusal to acknowledge the commission was overwhelmed by Cindy Pritzker, the donor, who had built up an association with the modeler when he won the Pritzker Prize in 1989. As per John H. Bryan, who drove raising money for the recreation center, Pritzker lured Gehry in vis-ÃÂ -vis discourses, utilizing a $15ÃÂ million financing duty toward the bandshell's creation. Having Gehry get included helped the city understand its vision of having present day subjects in the recreation; tons of his contribution the "Chicago Sun-Times" announced "Maybe the future has arrived", while the "Chicago Tribune" noticed that "The most praised designer on the planet may before long get an opportunity to carry Chicago into the 21st Century".
