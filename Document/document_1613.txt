Situated outside the triangle close Beta, Delta Trianguli Australis is the fourth-most brilliant star at clear greatness +3.8. It is a yellow goliath of ghastly kind G2Ib-II and lies away. A twofold star, it has a twelfth greatness partner star isolated by 30 arcseconds from the essential. Lying somewhere between Beta and Gamma, Epsilon Trianguli Australis is an optical twofold. The more splendid star, Epsilon Trianguli Australis An, is an orange K-type sub-monster of ghostly kind K1.5III with an evident size of +4.11. The optical partner, Epsilon Trianguli Australis B (or HD 138510), is a white fundamental succession star of otherworldly sort A9IV/V which has a clear greatness of +9.32. Zeta Trianguli Australis shows up as a star of evident size +4.91 and ghastly class F9V, however is really a spectroscopic double with a close partner, most likely a red midget. The pair circle each other once every 13 days. A youthful star, its legitimate movement shows it is an individual from the Ursa Major moving gathering. Particle Trianguli Australis shows itself to be a various star framework made out of a yellow and a white star when seen however a 7.5ÃÂ cm telescope. The more brilliant star has a ghastly sort of F4IV and is a spectroscopic paired whose segments are two yellow-white stars which circle each other each 39.88 days. The essential is a Gamma Doradus variable, throbbing over a time of 1.45 days. The fainter star isn't related with the framework, henceforth the framework is an optical twofold. HD 147018 is a Sun-like star of evident extent 8.3 and ghostly sort G9V, which was found to have two exoplanets, HD 147018 b and HD 147018 c, in 2009.
