North German Lloyd renamed the newly acquired ship "Princess Alice", though the German spelling "Prinzess Alice" was widely used in contemporary press coverage and, often, by the Lloyd themselves. There is some confusion as to who exactly was the namesake of the ship. Edwin Drechsel, in his two-volume work "Norddeutscher Lloyd, Bremen, 1857â1970", reports that the ship was named equally for Princess Alice of Albany and Alice Roosevelt. Princess Alice of Albany was a granddaughter of Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, and the new bride of Prince Alexander of Teck in WÃ¼rttemberg. Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the then-current U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, was nicknamed "Princess Alice" by the press, and had launched the racing yacht of Kaiser Wilhelm II, "Meteor", at Staten Island two years before. William Lowell Putnam gives the namesake as Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the daughter of Queen Victoria.
"Princess Alice" departed her new homeport of Bremen on 22Â March 1904 for her maiden voyage under her new owners. After arriving in New York draped in flags and bunting, her dining room was the site of a press luncheon thrown by Lloyd staff celebrating her first arrival in that city. "Princess Alice" made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to BremenâSuez CanalâFar East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31Â August. "Princess Alice" would continue this patternâsailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season and shifting to the Far East runs for the balance of the yearâthrough 1910.
