In 1951 Solti led at the Salzburg Festival out of the blue, halfway through the impact of FurtwÃÂ¤ngler, who was awed by him. The work was "Idomeneo", which had not been given there previously. In Munich Solti made basic and well known progress, yet for political reasons his situation at the State Opera was never secure. The view continued that a German conductor ought to be in control; tension built, and following five years Solti acknowledged an idea to move to Frankfurt in 1952 as melodic chief of the Frankfurt Opera. The city's musical show house had been wrecked in the war, and Solti embraced to fabricate another organization and collection for its as of late finished substitution. He likewise directed the ensemble shows given by the musical drama symphony. Frankfurt's was a less esteemed house than Munich's and he at first viewed the move as a downgrade, however he found the post satisfying and stayed at Frankfurt from 1952 to 1961, displaying 33 musical shows, 19 of which he had not led previously. Frankfurt, in contrast to Munich, couldn't draw in huge numbers of the main German artists. Solti enrolled many rising youthful American vocalists, for example, Claire Watson and Sylvia Stahlman, to the degree that the house gained the moniker "Amerikanische Oper am Main". In 1953 the West German government offered Solti German citizenship, which, being viably stateless as a Hungarian outcast, he thankfully acknowledged. He trusted he would stay away forever to Hungary, by then under socialist guideline. He remained a German native for two decades.
