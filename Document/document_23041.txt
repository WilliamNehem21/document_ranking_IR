On the morning of 25 October, "HyÅ«ga" was positioned near the light carriers and to protect them with her anti-aircraft guns. Her radar picked up the first of five American airstrikes at a range of at 07:13, but the battleship was not a primary target. Fragments from near misses by bombs damaged the ship's anti-torpedo blister and she developed a 5Â° list that was easily corrected. Despite "HyÅ«ga"s protection, "Chiyoda" was set afire and her engines were disabled. Matsuda ordered the battleship and the light cruiser to tow the crippled carrier, but "HyÅ«ga" was unable to do so and rejoined the main body at 18:30. The American submarine spotted the Fourth Carrier Division at 17:42 and manoeuvered to attack, missing with six torpedoes at 18:43. At 19:00 Ozawa ordered Matsuda to take his ships south to defend "Isuzu" and her escorting destroyers that were attempting to rescue "Chiyoda"s survivors, despite gunfire from a group of four American cruisers. Unable to locate either group of ships, Ozawa ordered Matsuda to reverse course at 23:30 and head for Amami Åshima to refuel. Despite being spotted by American submarines en route, the division arrived safely on 27 October. That same day Ozawa transferred his flag to "HyÅ«ga". After leaving the island the following day, they were unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine before their arrival at Kure on the 29th.
