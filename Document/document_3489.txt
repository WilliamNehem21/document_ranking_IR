Quitter was turning out various plays and acting in his own works and others'. Before long, his unhinged pace made up for lost time with him, and he crumbled in front of an audience in 1926 while featuring in a phase adjustment of "The Constant Nymph" and needed to take an all-encompassing rest, recovering in Hawaii.
