Hewitt was in charge of starting real enhancements in Air Force instruction that occurred somewhere in the range of 1945 and 1953, assuming a key job in the foundation of RAAF College and the presentation of an apprenticeship preparing program. The motivation behind the College was, in Hewitt's words, to "sow the seeds of administration" for future pioneers, making a unique RAAF "esprit de corps". He included that it was "just about an adage that the future RAAF can be no superior to anything the Air Force College". Established at Point Cook in January 1948, RAAF College's debut commandant was Air Commodore Val Hancock, who likewise drafted its first contract. With the help of the Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance, Air Vice Marshal Ellis Wackett, Hewitt built up the Apprenticeship Training Scheme to raise the standard of specialized jobs in the Air Force, presenting it with an across the nation exposure crusade to pull in enlisted people. Its base was the Ground Training School, which opened at Wagga, New South Wales, in mid 1948 to give instruction and specialized preparing to young people matured 15ÃÂ toÃÂ 17. It was renamed RAAF Technical College in 1950 and after that the RAAF School of Technical Training in 1952.
