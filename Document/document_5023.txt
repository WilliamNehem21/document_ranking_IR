John Adair was conceived January 9, 1757, in Chester County, South Carolina, a child of Scottish migrants Baron William and Mary [Moore] Adair. He was instructed at schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, and enrolled in the South Carolina pioneer civilian army at the flare-up of the American Revolutionary War. He was relegated to the regiment of his companion, Edward Lacey, under the direction of Colonel Thomas Sumter and took an interest in the fizzled Colonial ambush on a Loyalist station at the Battle of Rocky Mount and the consequent Colonial triumph at the Battle of Hanging Rock. Amid the British triumph over the Colonists at the August 16, 1780, Battle of Camden, Adair was taken as a captive. He contracted smallpox and was dealt with cruelly by his captors amid his months-long detainment. In spite of the fact that he got away at a certain point, Adair was unfit to achieve wellbeing in light of troubles identified with his smallpox contamination and was recovered by British Colonel Banastre Tarleton after only three days. In this manner, he was discharged by means of a detainee trade. In 1781, he was authorized as a lieutenant in the South Carolina civilian army, and battled in the drawn Battle of Eutaw Springs, the war's last real fight in the Carolinas. Edward Lacey was chosen sheriff of Chester County after the war, and Adair supplanted him in his previous limit as the area's equity of the harmony. He was picked as a representative toward the South Carolina tradition to endorse the U.S. Constitution.
