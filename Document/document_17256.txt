In the summer of 2006, a French translation of "Fun Home" was serialized in the Paris newspaper "LibÃ©ration" (which had previously serialized "Persepolis" by Marjane Satrapi). This translation, by Corinne Julve and Lili Sztajn, was subsequently published by on October 26, 2006. In January 2007, "Fun Home" was an official selection of the AngoulÃªme International Comics Festival. In the same month, the Anglophone Studies department of the UniversitÃ© FranÃ§ois Rabelais, Tours sponsored an academic conference on Bechdel's work, with presentations in Paris and Tours. At this conference, papers were presented examining "Fun Home" from several perspectives: as containing "trajectories" filled with paradoxical tension; as a text interacting with images as a paratext; and as a search for meaning using drag as a metaphor. These papers and others on Bechdel and her work were later published in the peer-reviewed journal "GRAAT" ("Groupe de Recherches Anglo-AmÃ©ricaines de Tours", or Tours Anglo-American Research Group).
