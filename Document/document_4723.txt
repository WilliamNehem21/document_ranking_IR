In the offseason, Steinbrenner looked to sign free specialist outfielder Reggie Jackson, persuaded that he would add punch to the center of the Yankee lineup. Steinbrenner charmed the slugger, taking him to lunch at the 21 Club and strolling with him on Manhattan's walkways as fans shouted to Jackson, encouraging him to turn into a Yankee. Despite the fact that New York did not make the most astounding offer, Jackson marked with the group. Sources record Martin's perspectives on Jackson's marking in an unexpected way: Pennington expressed that Martin was not restricted and disclosed to Steinbrenner he could utilize a correct defender, while Golenbock esteemed Martin ""positively" didn't need Reggie", feeling that Jackson was a lot of a diva, who may defy the administrator's power, and be "harder to deal with than a bull at a rodeo". Falkner composed that while Martin did not consider Jackson to be filling the group's needs, he was not contradicted. Both Martin and Paul expressed that once Bobby Grich was marked by the California Angels, Martin upheld marking Jackson. By and by, Martin was disenchanted by Steinbrenner taking Jackson to acclaimed eateries when he had not welcomed Martin to lunch, despite the fact that the supervisor was spending the offseason in adjacent New Jersey.
