Surviving memoirs of Epaminondas all around depict him as a standout amongst the most gifted officers at any point delivered by the Greek city-states. Indeed, even Xenophon, who neglects to take note of his essence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean battle: "Presently I as far as it matters for me couldn't state that his crusade demonstrated blessed; yet of every conceivable deed of thinking ahead and brave the man appears to me to have left not one fixed." Diodorus is unrestrained in his commendation for Epaminondas' military record: "For I can't help thinking that he outperformed his contemporaries...in aptitude and involvement in the specialty of war. For among the age of Epaminondas were acclaimed men: Pelopidas the Theban, Timotheus and Conon, likewise Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who had a place with a somewhat more established age. Still sooner than these, in the seasons of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, child of Deinomenes, and still others. All the equivalent, on the off chance that you should contrast the characteristics of these and the generalship and notoriety of Epaminondas, you would discover the characteristics controlled by Epaminondas far unrivaled".
