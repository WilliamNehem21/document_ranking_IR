The Round Church is famously related to the "new brilliant church" referenced in a colophon to an Old Bulgarian interpretation of Athanasius of Alexandria's "Discourses Against the Arians". The content says that the interpretation was done on the request of Prince Simeon by Constantine of Preslav and duplicated by Theodore Dox, "at the mouth of the Ticha in the [Byzantine] year 6415 indiction 14 [907ÃÂ AD], where a similar ruler had the heavenly new brilliant church constructed". It is questionable whether the "mouth of the Ticha" alludes to a thin area of the stream, to the Ustie go close to the city, or potentially to a specific area beside the external city dividers and in the immediate region of the Round Church ruins. This issue aside, if "brilliant" is to be taken actually, the source is likewise vague with respect to whether the congregation is the upgraded one among the city's brilliant houses of worship, or the single brilliant one among the new chapels in Preslav. Researcher Stancho Vaklinov considers the recognizable proof of the Round Church as the "new brilliant church" from writing "incontestable", while craftsmanship student of history Nikola Mavrodinov is of the sentiment that it is plausible. Then again, student of history A. P. Vlasto trusts this recognizable proof to be "not sure beyond a shadow of a doubt".
