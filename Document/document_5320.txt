Today, in excess of 1,532 traveler pigeon skins (alongside 16 skeletons) are in presence, spread crosswise over numerous establishments everywhere throughout the world. It has been recommended that the traveler pigeon ought to be restored when accessible innovation permits it (an idea which has been named "de-elimination"), utilizing hereditary material from such examples. In 2003, the Pyrenean ibex ("Capra pyrenaica", a subspecies of the Spanish ibex) was the primary wiped out creature to be cloned back to life; the clone lived for just seven minutes before biting the dust of lung abandons. An obstruction to cloning the traveler pigeon is the way that the DNA of exhibition hall examples has been debased and divided, because of introduction to warmth and oxygen. American geneticist George M. Church has suggested that the traveler pigeon genome can be recreated by sorting out DNA parts from various examples. The subsequent stage is join these qualities into the immature microorganisms of shake pigeons (or band-followed pigeons), which would then be changed into egg and sperm cells, and put into the eggs of shake pigeons, bringing about shake pigeons bearing traveler pigeon sperm and eggs. The posterity of these would have traveler pigeon qualities, and would be additionally reproduced to support interesting highlights of the wiped out species. Resuscitating the traveler pigeon may help ration forest biodiversity in the eastern US.
