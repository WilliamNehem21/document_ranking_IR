The species was generally found in develop or old-development woods in Puerto Rico at all heights, and in openings, bluffs, and other differing territories at lower rises. The species could be found at medium rises in the Guajataca State Forest (until 1910) and the Rio Abajo State Forest (until the 1920s), and at high rises in the Carite State Forest (until the 1930s). Records from the mid 1900s depict the parrots voyaging far from the Luquillo timberland and the Sierra de Cayey towards the primary island's coast to discover nourishment. In the meantime, the species was extirpated from Puerto Rico's littler islandsÃ¢ÂÂCulebra, Vieques and MonaÃ¢ÂÂand wound up confined to five areas: two in karst-limestone zones, two in high montane rainforests and one in mangrove timberland at the foot of the El Yunque National Forest. One of these karst areas, situated in the northwestern piece of Puerto Rico, was distinguished as a safe house for the species. Specifically, an area named "Valle de las Cotorras" (Valley of the Parrots), situated between San SebastiÃÂ¡n and Morovis, was home to a sizable populace. A few amazons made due in little pockets of debased woodland however these demonstrated deficient to help substantial settlements. In the long run their regular natural surroundings was decreased to the Cordillera Central and undisturbed woods regions, and by 1940 they were just to be found in essential backwoods at the Luquillo Mountains in El Yunque National Forest. The species is at present found at heights between . Since the species requires develop woodlands with open-cavity trees for proliferation, it doesn't happen in diminutive person and auxiliary backwoods.
