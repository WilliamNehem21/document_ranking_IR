The session was halted while specialists took care of Ratzenberger. After at first being taken by rescue vehicle to the on-circuit therapeutic focus, he was carried to Maggiore Hospital not long after, the second driver to be conceded there amid the end of the week. The session was restarted roughly 25ÃÂ minutes later, yet a few groupsÃ¢ÂÂincluding Williams and BenettonÃ¢ÂÂtook no further part. Later in medical clinic, it was reported that Ratzenberger had kicked the bucket because of his numerous wounds. His demise denoted the primary Formula One race end of the week casualty since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was murdered. It had been a long time since Elio de Angelis passed on testing a Brabham vehicle at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Teacher Sid Watkins, at that point leader of the Formula One on-track medicinal group, reviewed in his journals Ayrton Senna's response to the news, expressing that "Ayrton separated and cried on my shoulder." Watkins endeavored to convince Senna not to race the next day, asking "What else do you have to do? You have been best on the planet multiple times, you are clearly the speediest driver. Surrender it and how about we go angling." Senna answered, "Sid, there are sure things over which we have no control. I can't stop, I need to go on."
