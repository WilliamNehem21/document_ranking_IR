In the lower levels of organization, there was more uniformity: squadrons of three or five ships were commanded by a "komÄs" or "droungarokomÄs", and each ship's captain was called "kentarchos" ("centurion"), although literary sources also used more archaic terms like "nauarchos" or even "triÄrarchos". Each ship's crew, depending on its size, was composed of one to three "ousiai". Under the captain, there was the "bandophoros" ("banner bearer"), who acted as executive officer, two "prÅtokaraboi" (sing. "prÅtokarabos", "head of the ship"), sometimes also referred to archaically as "kybernÄtes", and a bow officer, the "prÅreus". The "prÅtokaraboi" were helmsmen, in charge of the steering oars in the stern, as well as of the rowers on either side of the ship. The senior of the two was the "first "prÅtokarabos" ("prÅtos prÅtokarabos"). In actual terms, there probably were several of each kind upon each ship, working in shifts. Most of these officers rose from the ranks, and there are references in the "De Administrando Imperio" to first oarsmen ("prÅtelatai") who rose to become "prÅtokaraboi" in the imperial barges, and later assumed still higher offices; Emperor Romanos Lekapenos being the most successful example. There were also a number of specialists on board, such as the two bow oarsmen and the "siphÅnatores", who worked the siphons used for discharging the Greek fire. A "boukinatÅr" ("trumpeter") is also recorded in the sources, who conveyed orders to the rowers ("kÅpÄlatai" or "elatai"). Since the marine infantry were organized as regular army units, their ranks followed those of the army.
