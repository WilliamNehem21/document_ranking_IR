On 8 April 1524, five cantons, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Zug, shaped a coalition, "kick the bucket fÃÂ¼nf Orte" (the Five States) to guard themselves from Zwingli's Reformation. They reached the adversaries of Martin Luther including John Eck, who had discussed Luther in the Leipzig Disputation of 1519. Eck offered to question Zwingli and he acknowledged. In any case, they couldn't concede to the determination of the making a decision about power, the area of the discussion, and the utilization of the Swiss Diet as a court. As a result of the contradictions, Zwingli chose to blacklist the controversy. On 19 May 1526, every one of the cantons sent agents to Baden. Despite the fact that ZÃÂ¼rich's delegates were available, they didn't take an interest in the sessions. Eck drove the Catholic party while the reformers were spoken to by Johannes Oecolampadius of Basel, a scholar from WÃÂ¼rttemberg who had carried on a broad and agreeable correspondence with Zwingli. While the discussion continued, Zwingli was kept educated of the procedures and printed flyers giving his suppositions. It was of little use as the Diet ruled against Zwingli. He was to be prohibited and his compositions were never again to be dispersed. Of the thirteen Confederation individuals, Glarus, Solothurn, Fribourg, and Appenzell just as the Five States casted a ballot against Zwingli. Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and ZÃÂ¼rich upheld him.
