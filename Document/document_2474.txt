Inside the Macedonian republic, some proof from the third centuryBC demonstrates that outside relations were taken care of by the focal government. Albeit singular Macedonian urban communities ostensibly took part in Panhellenic occasions as autonomous elements, in actuality, the giving of "asylia" (sacredness, conciliatory insusceptibility, and the privilege of haven at asylums) to specific urban areas was taken care of straightforwardly by the lord. Moreover, the city-states inside contemporary Greek "koina" (i.e., organizations of city-expresses, the "sympoliteia") complied with the government orders casted a ballot on all in all by the individuals from their group. In city-states having a place with an association or ward, the allowing of "proxenia" (for example the facilitating of outside envoys) was normally a privilege shared by nearby and focal experts. Copious proof exists for the giving of "proxenia" similar to the sole right of focal experts in the neighboring Epirote League, and some proof proposes a similar course of action in the Macedonian district. City-expresses that were aligned with Macedonia issued their own announcements in regards to "proxenia". Remote groups likewise shaped unions with the Macedonian rulers, for example, when the Cretan League marked bargains with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson guaranteeing selection of Cretan soldiers of fortune into the Macedonian armed force, and chose Philip V of Macedon as privileged defender ("prostates") of the class.
