In the mean time, Kantakouzenos and his military stayed outdoors outside Thessalonica, planning to take the city through the guide of his supporters inside the dividers. Apokaukos touched base at the leader of the Byzantine armada to help the Zealots, binding Kantakouzenos in Macedonia among Thessalonica and DuÃÂ¡an's assets. By and by Umur of Aydin provided to Kantakouzenos' with some much needed help with an armada conveying somewhere in the range of 6,000 men, whereupon Apokaukos and his boats fled from the unrivaled Turkish naval force. By and by, a fortified Thessalonica had the capacity to hold out against an attack by Kantakouzenos and Umur. In spite of the fact that he had neglected to take Thessalonica, the nearness of his Turkish partners permitted Kantakouzenos to turn his consideration towards Thrace. In late 1343 he left his child Manuel as legislative head of Berroia and western Macedonia and walked towards Demotika, easing the city and seeing his significant other without precedent for just about two years. On his approach to Demotika, Kantakouzenos had caught various fortifications in Thrace, albeit another attack of Peritheorion fizzled. He caught up with a fruitful crusade that took Komotini and different strongholds in the Rhodope zone. Throughout the following couple of years, the towns and posts of Thrace approached Kantakouzenos' camp one by one, yet at extraordinary expense, as his for the most part Turkish troops over and again ravaged the farmland. The moving tide of the war did not go unnoticed in the contradicting camp. In late 1344, a few noticeable identities surrendered to Kantakouzenos, including John Vatatzes, a general and relative by marriage to both the Patriarch and Apokaukos, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Lazaros, and, above all, Manuel Apokaukos, child of the "megas doux" and legislative leader of Adrianople.
