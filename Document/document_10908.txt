Costumed by Matilda, they visited neighborhood doss-houses in East London, where they performed balance melodies, showing individuals the threats of liquor misuse. Anxious to flaunt his little girl's ability, John verified her unpaid work as a table vocalist at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he filled in as a server. Among the melodies she performed there was "My Soldier Laddie".
