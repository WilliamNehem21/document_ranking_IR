"Galerina marginata" might be confused with a couple of consumable mushroom species. "Pholiota mutabilis" (Kuehneromyces mutabilis) produces natural product bodies generally comparable in appearance and furthermore develops on wood, however might be recognized from "G.ÃÂ marginata" by its stems bearing scales up to the dimension of the ring, and from developing in expansive bunches (which isn't common of "G.ÃÂ marginata"). In any case, the likelihood of disarray is to such an extent that this great eatable species is "not prescribed to those lacking impressive involvement in the recognizable proof of higher growths." Furthermore, tiny examination demonstrates smooth spores in "Pholiota". "G.ÃÂ marginata" might be effectively mistaken for different edibles, for example, "Armillaria mellea" and "Kuehneromyces mutabilis". As to last species, one source notes "Frequently, "G.ÃÂ marginata" looks to some extent like this growth, and it requires cautious and intense forces of perception to recognize the harmful one from the consumable one." "K.ÃÂ mutabilis" might be recognized by the nearness of scales on the stem underneath the ring, the bigger top, which may achieve a distance across of , and fiery or fragrant smell of the tissue. The related "K.ÃÂ vernalis" is an uncommon species and much progressively comparable in appearance to "G.ÃÂ marginata". Examination of infinitesimal attributes is regularly required to dependably recognize the two, uncovering smooth spores with a germ pore.
