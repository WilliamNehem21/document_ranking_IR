"When I Think of You" achieved number one on the Hot 100, turning into Jackson's first single to top the graph, and was guaranteed gold in November, 1990. The collection's fourth single and title track, "Control", achieved its pinnacle position at number five on the Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot Black Singles outline, later ensured gold by the RIAA in November, 1990. "How about we Wait Awhile" achieved the number two position on the Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Black Singles diagram. Clarence Page of the "Chicago Tribune" remarked in a comparable vein to "Terrible", the melody "throw[s] cold water on the interests of youthful love 'before we go excessively far'." Unlike its ancestors, "The Pleasure Principle" did not reach inside the main five of the Hot 100, rather cresting at number fourteen. It did, in any case, become Jackson's fifth number one single on the Hot Black Singles diagram. Every one of the collection's singles barring "We should Wait Awhile" crested inside the main five of the "Announcement" Club Play Singles. "Interesting How Time Flies (When You're Having Fun)" was not discharged as a business single in the United States. Abroad, it crested at number 59 on the UK Singles Chart.
