On May 14, 2017, soon after 7 p.m., a three-caution fire broke out in the unused synagogue after what an observer called a "major blast". The flame was brought leveled out at around midnight by roughly 150 firemen Ã¢ÂÂ who, amid the flame, permitted Rabbi Yehuda Oshry, the child of Ephraim Oshry, to protect the Torah scrolls Ã¢ÂÂ however not before it "to a great extent pulverized" the structure. Albeit still under scrutiny as of Monday May 15, the flame was said to appear "suspicious" because of observation video that demonstrated three youngsters running from the region just before the flame broke out. The flame cut down the roof and dividers of the synagogue, making a heap of rubble. On May 17, three days after the flame, a 14-year-old kid was captured and accused of setting the flame; the kid's two sidekicks were addressed and discharged, despite the fact that they are viewed as observers. The Fire Department's examination concerning how the flame was begun was being held up by the need to introduce bolsters so as to securely enter the structure. By mid-June, the city's Legal Department was all the while researching, and investigators had not charged the kid who had been captured.
