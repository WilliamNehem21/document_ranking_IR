Sporadic fit as a fiddle, Hydrus is circumscribed by Mensa toward the southeast, Eridanus toward the east, Horologium and Reticulum toward the upper east, Phoenix toward the north, Tucana toward the northwest and west, and Octans toward the south; Lacaille had abbreviated Hydrus' tail to make space for this last group of stars he had drawn up. Covering 243 square degrees and 0.589% of the night sky, it positions 61st of the 88 star groupings in size. The three-letter shortened form for the star grouping, as received by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Hyi'. The official heavenly body limits, as set by EugÃÂ¨ne Delporte in 1930, are characterized by a polygon of 12 fragments. In the tropical organize framework, the correct rising directions of these outskirts lie between and , while the declination facilitates are somewhere in the range of Ã¢ÂÂ57.85ÃÂ° and Ã¢ÂÂ82.06ÃÂ°. As one of the profound southern groups of stars, it stays underneath the skyline at scopes north of the 30th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and is circumpolar at scopes south of the 50th parallel in the Southern Hemisphere. In reality, Herman Melville makes reference to it and Argo Navis in Moby Dick "underneath radiant Antarctic Skies", featuring his insight into the southern groups of stars from whaling voyages. A line drawn between the long pivot of the Southern Cross to Beta Hydri and after that all-encompassing 4.5 occasions will stamp a point due south. Hydrus finishes at midnight around 26 October.
