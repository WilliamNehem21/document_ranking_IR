ÃÂedÃÂ¡n furthermore shows up in an assortment of Welsh sources, making him one of only a handful few non-Britons to figure in Welsh custom. Welsh sources call him "Aedan Bradawc", signifying "The Treacherous" or "The Wily". He may have earned this sobriquet after the breakdown of a collusion with Rhydderch Hael, ruler of the close-by Brittonic kingdom of Alt Clut; hatred between them is recalled in the Welsh Triads and somewhere else. Another Triad records ÃÂedÃÂ¡n's host as one of the "Three Faithful War-Bands of the Island of Britain", as they "went to the ocean for their ruler". This may point to a generally lost convention concerning one of ÃÂedÃÂ¡n's ocean undertakings, for example, to Orkney or the Isle of Man. Also, a few Welsh works guarantee a Brittonic family for ÃÂedÃÂ¡n. The "Bonedd GwÃÂ·r y Gogledd" records him as a descendent of Dyfnwal Hen of Alt Clut, however the lineage is highly befuddled ("Gauran" is given as his child, as opposed to father). The Cambro-Latin "De Situ Brecheniauc" and "Cognacio Brychan" guarantee his mom was Luan, little girl of Brychan of Brycheiniog in Wales. In spite of the fact that these families are conflicting and likely questionable, they are outstanding in featuring ÃÂedÃÂ¡n's nearby relationship with the Britons.
