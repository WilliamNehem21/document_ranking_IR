One of the unique features of the AMX-30 was the "Obus Ã  Charge Creuse de 105Â mm ModÃ¨le F1" (Obus G) HEAT projectile and its main gun, the ModÃ¨le F1, a monoblock steel cannon. HEAT warheads suffer when spin stabilized, a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, divided by ball bearings. This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT-round, while the inner shell did not move, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency. The warhead, containing 780Â gram hexolite, could penetrate up to of steel armour and was effective against tanks at up to . As it combined a good accuracy with a penetration that was independent of range, it has been considered an "ideal round" for its day The AMX-30 was also designed to fire the OCC F1 Mle.60 high explosive projectile, the SCC F1 training warhead and the OFUM PH-105 F1 smoke round. The main gun was coupled with a recoil brake, which had a maximum extension of , and could depress to â8 degrees or elevate to 20 degrees. The turret's firepower was augmented by a coaxial M2 Browning machine gun. The tank commander also made use of a anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof. The vehicle carried 50 projectiles, 748 rounds and 2,050 bullets. The tank commander was issued a cupola which offered ten all-around direct-vision episcopes, and a binocular telescope with 10x magnification. The commander was also given an optical full-field coincidence range finder. The gunner was given a telescoping gun sight and two observation periscopes.
