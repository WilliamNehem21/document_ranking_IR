Ghosh recognizes the suggestions to Ray's movies. In one scene, Vidya asks the chief of the visitor house for what good reason there is no high temp water despite the fact that the billboard had asserted "running heated water". The director clarifies that the sign alludes for his errand kid, who hurries to convey heated water in a pot at whatever point required. This insinuates a comparable scene in Ray's "Joi Baba Felunath" (1979). In a meeting with "The Telegraph", Ghosh says that the way Vidya watches out and moves from window to window in the visitor house room is reminiscent of Ray's "Charulata" (1964), where the performer Madhabi Mukherjee appreciates looks at the outside world through the blinds of windows. He additionally recognizes the impact of "Mahanagar" (1963), another Ray film noted for its depiction of Kolkata. As indicated by the chief, he was roused by specific scenes of Ray's "Nayak" (1966) to design the depiction of complex intense subject matters among Vidya and the cop Rana, particularly Rana's amazement within the sight of Vidya. Ghosh communicates his motivation from Ray's "Aranyer Dinratri" (1970) in which Ray "needed the group of onlookers to be inside the vehicle with the four folks constantly. So the camera never leaves the vehicle." Ghosh shot a comparable scene, trusting the group of onlookers would progress toward becoming "like Vidya's kindred traveler."
