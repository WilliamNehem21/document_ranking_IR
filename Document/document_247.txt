The U.S. advance after Cobra was remarkably quick. Between 1 August and 4 August, seven divisions of Patton's Third Army had cleared through Avranches and over the scaffold at Pontaubault into Brittany. The German armed force in Normandy had been diminished to such a poor state by the Allied offensives that, with no prospect of fortification in the wake of Operation Bagration, the Soviet summer hostile against Army Group Center, not many Germans trusted they could now maintain a strategic distance from thrashing. As opposed to arrange his outstanding powers to pull back to the Seine, Adolf Hitler sent an order to von Kluge requesting "a quick counterattack among Mortain and Avranches" ("Unternehmen LÃÂ¼ttich") to "demolish" the foe and reach the west bank of the Cotentin promontory. Eight of the nine Panzer divisions in Normandy were to be utilized in the assault yet just four (one of them deficient) could be soothed from their guarded errands and collected in time. German administrators quickly challenged that such a task was unimaginable given their outstanding assets yet these complaints were overruled and the counter-hostile, initiated on 7 August around Mortain. The second, first SS and second SS Panzer Divisions drove the attack, in spite of the fact that with just 75 Panzer IVs, 70 Panthers, and 32 self-moved weapons between them. Pitifully hopeful, the hostile risk was over inside 24 hours, albeit battling proceeded until 13 August.
