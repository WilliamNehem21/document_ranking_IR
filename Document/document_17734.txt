At the pre-E3 conference of 2005, Nintendo announced "Melee"s sequel, 2008's "Super Smash Bros. Brawl". Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata requested Masahiro Sakurai to be the director of the game after the conference. Although being slower paced than "Melee", the game retains most of the gameplay features of its predecessors while having major gameplay additions, such as a more substantial single-player mode and online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Taking advantage of the Wii's variety of controller options, the game allows the use of the Wii Remote, Nunchuk, GameCube controller, and the Classic Controller. Like "Melee", the game makes references to games and franchises, including those that debuted after the release of "Melee"; for example, Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf's character designs are taken from "" and a "Nintendogs" puppy is present as an Assist Trophy (a new item that summons computer-controlled characters from different games to briefly participate in the fight). Select stages and music from "Melee" are included in the sequel. The fourth and fifth installments, "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS" and "Wii U", were released in 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U respectively. The sixth installment, "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" released in December 2018, for the Nintendo Switch.
