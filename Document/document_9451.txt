In 1985, Brooks dead-warmed with Stockwell in the 100ÃÂ m free-form at the Australian Championships, timing a period of 51.12ÃÂ s. He at that point joined with Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 100ÃÂ m free-form hand-off out of the blue. Rivulets kept up his structure and notwithstanding not shielding his Australian 100ÃÂ m title, was chosen for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came next to Fasala in the 100ÃÂ m free-form in a period of 51.01ÃÂ s. He guaranteed gold in the 4ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ 100ÃÂ m free-form hand-off alongside Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, mooring the group of four in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the arrival flight, he devoured 46 jars of brew and was restricted for a half year after he discussed the occurrence amid a TV meet. In his diaries, Talbot, a non-consumer, refered to Brooks and his Mean Machine colleagues as being one of the greatest defenders of a hard-drinking society that had pervaded the Australian swimming scene at the time. Specifically, he singled out Brooks just like a point of convergence of troublesome action amid his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot considers liquor to be the principle explanation for the breakdown of Australia's remaining in the swimming scene during the 1970s and the ensuing delayed time of universal uncompetitiveness during the 1980s.
