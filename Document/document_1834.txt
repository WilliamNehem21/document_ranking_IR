The principal proposition has turned out to be acclaimed. It states, "When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ stated, 'Apologize,' he willed the whole existence of devotees to be one of contrition." In the initial couple of postulations Luther builds up the possibility of apology as the Christian's inward battle with wrongdoing as opposed to the outer arrangement of sacrosanct admission. Postulations 5Ã¢ÂÂ 7 at that point express that the pope can just discharge individuals from the disciplines he has managed himself or through the congregation's arrangement of atonement, not the blame of transgression. The pope can just report God's absolution of the blame of transgression in his name. In propositions 14Ã¢ÂÂ 29, Luther tested basic convictions about limbo. Theories 14Ã¢ÂÂ 16 talk about the possibility that the discipline of limbo can be compared to the dread and gloom felt by biting the dust individuals. In postulations 17Ã¢ÂÂ 24 he declares that nothing can be conclusively said about the profound condition of individuals in limbo. He denies that the pope has any control over individuals in limbo in theories 25 and 26. In propositions 27Ã¢ÂÂ 29, he assaults that when installment is made, the payer's adored one is discharged from limbo. He considers it to be empowering evil insatiability, and says it is difficult to be sure in light of the fact that just God has extreme power in pardoning disciplines in limbo.
