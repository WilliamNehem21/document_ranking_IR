The RAF actuated 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 to work the 120 Thor rockets. They were situated at 20 old wartime runways with the goal that the legislature did not need to buy new land. Every rocket was provided with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variation of the Mark 28 with a more slender and lighter packaging. While the Thor rocket bases were kept an eye on by the RAF, the warheads were provided under Project E. Each had a USAF authorisation officer. The rockets utilized a double key framework, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Every so often a rocket would be picked for test terminating, for which the rocket and its RAF team would be traveled to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were led between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the first understanding, the USAF paid the expense of support for the rockets for a long time. After a discussion over expenses and advantages, the Air Council settled on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily ought to be ended before the finish of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The rockets were come back to the United States.
