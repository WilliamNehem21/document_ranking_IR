Truth be told, the British armada was unfit to seek after Villaret, having just 11ÃÂ ships still equipped for the fight to come to the French 12, and having various dismasted ships and prizes to secure. Resigning and regrouping, the British groups begin making rushed fixes and verifying their prizes; seven altogether, including the gravely harmed "Vengeur du Peuple". "Vengeur" had been holed by gun discharging from "Brunswick" straightforwardly through the ship's base, and after her surrender no British ship had figured out how to get men on board. This left "Vengeur's" not many staying unwounded team to endeavor to rescue what they couldÃ¢ÂÂan errand made more earnestly when a portion of her mariners broke into the soul room and ended up alcoholic. At last the ship's siphons wound up unmanageable, and "Vengeur" started to sink. Just the auspicious landing of vessels from the unharmed "Alfred" and HMS "Culloden", just as the administrations of the shaper HMS "Rattler", spared any of the "Vengeur's" group from suffocating, these boats taking off about 500 mariners between them. Lieutenant John Winne of "Rattler" was particularly lauded for this dangerous work. By 18:15, "Vengeur" was unmistakably past rescue and just the exceptionally most exceedingly awful of the injured, the dead, and the alcoholic stayed on board. A few mariners are said to have waved the tricolor from the bow of the ship and cried "Vive la Nation, vive la RÃÂ©publique!"
