Mithridates the Great was the leader of Pontus, a huge kingdom in Asia Minor, from 120 to 63 BC. He is recognized as a standout amongst Rome's most imposing and fruitful adversaries who drew in three of the most unmistakable officers of the late Roman Republic: Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey the Great. In an example well-known from the Punic Wars, the Romans clashed with him after the two states' ranges of authority started to cover. Mithridates alienated Rome by trying to grow his kingdom, and Rome as far as concerns her appeared to be similarly sharp for war and the riches and renown that it may bring. Subsequent to vanquishing western Anatolia (present day Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources guarantee that Mithridates requested the killing of most of the 80,000 Romans living there. In the resulting First Mithridatic War, the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla constrained Mithridates out of Greece legitimate after the Battle of Chaeronea and later Battle of Orchomenus yet then needed to come back to Italy to answer the inward risk presented by his adversary Marius; therefore, Mithridates VI was crushed however not annihilated. A harmony was made among Rome and Pontus, however this demonstrated just a transitory break.
