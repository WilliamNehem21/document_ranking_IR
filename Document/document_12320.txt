Blending the regulatory apparatuses of each state and incorporating them into one political and authoritative element was difficult, especially the same number of the consolidated states had a background marked by competition. In the previous Central India Agency, whose royal states had at first been converged into a royal association called Vindhya Pradesh, the competition between two gatherings of states turned out to be bad to the point that the Government of India induced the rulers to consent to a Merger Arrangement revoking the old Covenants of Merger, and assumed direct responsibility for the state as a Chief Commissioner's State. Accordingly, the mergers did not meet the desires for the Government of India or the States Department. In December 1947, Menon proposed requiring the leaders of states to take "down to earth ventures towards the foundation of mainstream government". The States Department acknowledged his recommendation, and executed it through an exceptional pledge marked by the rajpramukhs of the consolidated regal associations, restricting them to go about as sacred rulers. This implied their forces were "accepted" the same as those of the Governors of the previous British areas, along these lines giving the general population of their domains a similar proportion of dependable government as the general population of the remainder of India.
