Greg Garrett, an English educator at Baylor University, saw the tune as a push to "[respond] to developing interests in doing equityÃ¢ÂÂand calling to consideration American disappointments in such manner", taking note of that the routines in South America had been upheld by the United States as a result of their enemy of socialist positions, despite the fact that their strategies were contrary to the fair qualities that "America professes to advocate the world over". Lisa Hand of the "Sunday Independent" noticed the impact of America on the track, commenting, "[it] does not keep itself essentially to the music, yet in addition stretches out to a portion of the verses. Notwithstanding, a long way from being a tribute to the star-radiant standard, the words feature the political lies and ambiguities which exist inside the U.S. 'Moms of the Disappeared' and 'Projectile the Blue Sky' both really investigate the American contribution in South America". Richard Harrington of "The Washington Post" depicted the tune as "a basic regret of incredible magnificence and misery arguing for the acknowledgment that ideological fights about right and left darken the more vital issue of good and bad." Author David Kootnikoff portrayed it as a "[portrait] of the American Dream gone rotten".
