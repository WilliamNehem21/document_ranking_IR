As Lee proceeded with his hostile at Gaines' Mill toward the east, McClellan assumed a latent job, showing no drive and trusting that occasions will unfurl. He kept 66% of his military out of activity, tricked again by Magruder's dramatic diversionary strategies. That night, he chose to pull back his military to a more secure base, well underneath Richmond, on a bit of the James River that was leveled out of the Union Navy. In doing as such, he may have accidentally spared his military. Lee had expected that the Union armed force would pull back toward the east toward its current supply base and McClellan's turn toward the south postponed Lee's reaction for no less than 24 hours. Yet, McClellan was additionally implicitly recognizing that he would never again have the capacity to contribute Richmond, the object of his crusade; the substantial attack mounted guns required would be practically difficult to transport without the railroad associations accessible from his unique supply base on the York River. In a wire to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, covering these occasions, McClellan accused the Lincoln organization for his inversions. "In the event that I spare this military now, I let you know clearly I owe pass to you or to some other people in Washington. You have done your best to forfeit this military." Fortunately for McClellan, Lincoln never observed that provocative explanation (in any event around then) since it was blue-penciled by the War Department telegrapher.
