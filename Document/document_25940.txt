In similar fashion, many leading directors made one or more films for RKO during this era, including Alfred Hitchcock once more, with "Notorious", and Jean Renoir, with "This Land Is Mine" (1943), reuniting Laughton and O'Hara, and "The Woman on the Beach" (1947). RKO and Orson Welles had an arm's-length reunion via "The Stranger" (1946), an independent production he starred in as well as directed. Welles would subsequently call it his worst film, but it was the only one he ever made that turned a profit in its first run. In December 1946, the studio released Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life"; while it would ultimately be recognized as one of the greatest films of Hollywood's Golden Age, at the time it lost more than half a million dollars for RKO. John Ford's "The Fugitive" (1947) and "Fort Apache" (1948), which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again, were followed by "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" (1949) and "Wagon Master" (1950); all four were coproductions between RKO and Argosy, the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C. Cooper. Of the directors under long-term contract to RKO in the 1940s, the best known was Edward Dmytryk, who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable "Hitler's Children" (1943). Shot on a $205,000 budget, placing it in the bottom quartile of Big Five studio productions, it was one of the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year. Another low-cost war-themed film directed by Dmytryk, "Behind the Rising Sun", released a few months later, was similarly profitable.
