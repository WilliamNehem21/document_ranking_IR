Mary Shelley's last full-length book, written in the form of letters and published in 1844, was "Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842 and 1843", which recorded her travels with her son Percy Florence and his university friends. In "Rambles", Shelley follows the tradition of Mary Wollstonecraft's "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" and her own "A History of a Six Weeks' Tour" in mapping her personal and political landscape through the discourse of sensibility and sympathy. For Shelley, building sympathetic connections between people is the way to build civil society and to increase knowledge: "knowledge, to enlighten and free the mind from clinging deadening prejudicesâa wider circle of sympathy with our fellow-creatures;âthese are the uses of travel". Between observations on scenery, culture, and "the people, especially in a political point of view", she uses the travelogue form to explore her roles as a widow and mother and to reflect on revolutionary nationalism in Italy. She also records her "pilgrimage" to scenes associated with Percy Shelley. According to critic Clarissa Orr, Mary Shelley's adoption of a persona of philosophical motherhood gives "Rambles" the unity of a prose poem, with "death and memory as central themes". At the same time, Shelley makes an egalitarian case against monarchy, class distinctions, slavery, and war.
