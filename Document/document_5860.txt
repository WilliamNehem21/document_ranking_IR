While tunes, for example, "Survive" and "Choked out Love" managed subjects of "sexual neurosis and male fear of closeness", the remainder of "Maxinquaye" investigated the mental tolls of the British recreational medication culture, which Reynolds said filled in as a "brief perfect world" for an age of clients who generally came up short on a "productive outlet for its optimism". He felt the collection's spread craftsmanship, highlighting rusting metal surfaces, spoke to the social decay investigated in the music's topics. Precarious drew on Rastafarian thoughts regarding end time for the record, albeit not at all like followers to that development he didn't disassociate himself from "Babylon", or the ruffian characteristics of Western culture, composing verses, for example, "my cerebrum thinks bomb-like/be careful with our craving" on "Hellfire Is Round the Corner". He later told Reynolds, "I'm a piece of this fuckin' clairvoyant pollutionÃÂ ... It resembles, I can be as covetous as you. The molded piece of me says 'no doubt, I'm going to go out and profit, I'm going to lead my very own little kingdom.'" Christgau regarded the collection's melodies "audioramas of somebody who's marked on to work for the wages of wrongdoing and lived to money the check", while O'Hagan said Tricky's "impressionistic composition lyrics" were composed from the freak point of view of the urban glutton: ""Maxinquaye" is the sound of blunted Britain, distrustful and obsessiveÃÂ ... This was the inward city blues, Bristol style".
