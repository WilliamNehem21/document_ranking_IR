Nielsen evaluations for "Crime: Life on the Street" had step by step declined all through the , leaving the show at high danger of dropping when the season finished up. NBC officials requested a few refinements Ã¢ÂÂ including less scene subplots and less camera developments and hop cuts Ã¢ÂÂ before affirming a second season. Official maker Tom Fontana said he was willing "to successfully keep NBC from overlooking us", albeit official maker Barry Levinson said the show would keep up its practical visual style, guaranteeing, "We need a camera that is right around a member in the show." "Crime" was eventually reestablished, however the makers marginally conditioned down the show's depressing visual style and hand-held photography theme, and concentrated more emphatically on single stories instead of different subplots. Fontana stated, "We were trying different things with our initial nine scenes. At whatever point you take a stab at something new, you will in general decide in favor of kicking things off. Be that as it may, we'd preferably have more people viewing, so the hues and lighting are marginally more brilliant, and the camera developments are not as shaking." However, both Levinson and Fontana demanded the progressions were not by any means because of system weight, but instead were transformative improvements for the arrangement.
