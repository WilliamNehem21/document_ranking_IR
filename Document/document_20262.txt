"Oryzomys" is rare in Panama. Panamanian "Oryzomys" were first described by Goldman in 1912, who introduced the name "Oryzomys gatunensis" for a specimen from GatÃºn in the Canal Zone. In 1918, Goldman kept the animal as a separate species, remarking that it was similar to "richmondi", but distinctive in the well-developed ridges along the margins of the interorbital region, the short interparietal bone (part of the roof of the braincase), and the long nasal bones. In 1937, Bole described another species of Panamanian "Oryzomys", "Oryzomys azuerensis" from ParacotÃ©, Veraguas Province. It is a brown form, lacking the reddish tones of nearby populations, and has a broad skull with a short rostrum (front part) and ridges on the interorbital region like those of "gatunensis". Although Goldman recommended to him that "gatunensis" and "azuerensis" both be treated as subspecies of "couesi", Bole described "azuerensis" as a species because it did not seem intermediate between the geographically closest forms, "gatunensis" and "couesi", and was separated by a large gap from the nearest known populations of "O.Â couesi" in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 review of Panamanian mammals, Charles Handley reduced both "gatunensis" and "azuerensis" to subspecies of the marsh rice rat (in which "O.Â couesi" was included at the time), and when "O.Â couesi" was reinstated as a separate species these forms went with it. Specimens from near the type locality of "azuerensis" differ by about 7% in their "Cytb" sequences from other "O.Â couesi", which suggests that they may represent a separate species. However, Hanson and colleagues did not reinstate "azuerensis" as a species, because they could not examine samples of "gatunensis".
