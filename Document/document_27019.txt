On 1 July, the minelayer , escorted by the cruisers "Roon", "Augsburg", and "LÃ¼beck" and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of BogskÃ¤r. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; "Augsburg", "Albatross", and three destroyers made for RixhÃ¶ft while the remainder of the unit went to Libau. "Augsburg" and "Albatross" were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers. Commodore Johannes von Karpf, the flotilla commander, ordered the slower "Albatross" to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled "Roon" and "LÃ¼beck". "Albatross" was grounded off Gotland and "Augsburg" escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged "Roon" before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with "Prinz Adalbert" and "Prinz Heinrich" to support von Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine , which scored a hit on "Prinz Adalbert". The torpedo hit below the conning tower, caused severe damage, and killed ten men. Hopman transferred to the torpedo boat while Michelsen remained aboard "Prinz Adalbert" to oversee the return to port. The ship took on some of water; her draft increased significantly, which prevented her from being able to put into Danzig. She instead had to make the journey back to Kiel for repairs, which she reached on 4 July.
