In March 2001, Aaliyah wrapped up the collection in the wake of having taped her part in "Ruler of the Damned" for four months, which eventually deferred the collection's discharge. In Australia, she likewise completed a photograph shoot for "Aaliyah" with picture takers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. The artist dealt with five pythons at the shoot and built up a liking for snakes, discovering them "hazardous, however very lovely" and delegate of her on the collection. She returned to the snake subject in her music video for "We Need a Resolution" in April and told MTV, "They live in isolation, [and] there are times throughout my life [when] I simply need to be without anyone else's input. There are times I can't make sense of myself. I feel they are exceptionally unpredictable animals, [but] in the meantime, they're provocative, as well. That is the reason they speak to "Aaliyah" entirely well." She portrayed the record as "a great impression of [myself] and the individual [I am] today", saying in a meeting for "Stream" magazine, "I am a youthful grown-up now, and I think this collection demonstrates my development vocally." "Aaliyah" was aced by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles.
