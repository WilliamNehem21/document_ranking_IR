Shelley's excursions to Italy were a route for her to return to recollections of her dead spouse, Percy Shelley, and the kids they had covered there. Moskal contends that Shelley expected to "appease" her survivor blame and Dolan that she expected to recuperate from a harming injury. Shelley expounds on this in "Meanders", utilizing the figure of speech of a journey; she trusts that making a trip to Italy and returning to the scenes of her childhood will fix her of her discouragement, expressing, "Other than all that Rome itself bears of superb to the eye and creative ability, I return to it as the bourne of a devout journey. The fortunes of my childhood lie covered here." Shelley's journey follows in the custom of Chaucer just as the nineteenth-century pattern to visit spas for mending, and like most journey accounts, hers does not relate the adventure home. For Shelley, eventually the most supportive piece of voyaging and visiting spas was seeing the lovely view. In "Meanders", Shelley fights that cooperating with beautiful view can recuperate the body. Both the 1840 and 1842 excursions pursued occasions of sick wellbeing for Shelley and she utilized them as an approach to recuperate both sincerely and physically. She opens "Drifts" by portraying her weakness and trusting that by voyaging her "mind willÃÂ ... recharge the outworn and worn out articles of clothing in which it has for quite some time been dressed".
