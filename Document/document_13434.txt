The State of Missouri, admitted to the Union in 1821 as a feature of the Missouri Compromise, needed a dedicatory coin available to be purchased at the Missouri Centennial Exposition and State Fair, to be held in Sedalia from August 8 to 20, 1921. Enactment for such a half dollar was presented in the Senate by that state's Selden P. Spencer on January 20, 1921, the bill being assigned S. 4893. It was alluded to the Committee on Banking and Currency. The bill was accounted for to the full Senate by Connecticut's George P. McLean on January 25 with an alteration diminishing the approved mintage from 500,000 to 250,000 and a proposal that it pass. VP Thomas R. Marshall, who was managing the Senate, inquired as to whether there was complaint to its section. The Minority Leader, Democrat Oscar Underwood of Alabama, said he didn't think there would be protest, yet that the bill ought to be perused first. Idaho Senator William E. Borah expressed he would question if there was to be talk of it, as the Senate had not had morning business in ten days. Borah inquired as to whether he expected there would be complaint to the bill, and McLean consoled the Idahoan. The bill, as revised, passed the Senate without recorded restriction.
