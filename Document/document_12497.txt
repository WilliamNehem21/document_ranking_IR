Stuart did not escape brutality in the ECAHA. On January 12, 1907, the Wanderers confronted the Ottawa Senators, an amusement the Wanderers at last won 4Ã¢ÂÂ 2. Charles Spittal of Ottawa was portrayed as "endeavoring to part Cecil Blachford's skull", Alf Smith hit Stuart "over the sanctuary with his stick, spreading him out like a carcass", and Harry Smith split his stick crosswise over Ernie "Moose" Johnson's face, breaking Johnson's nose. Stuart was complimented for his activities amid the diversion; it was said that he neither jumped nor countered, even in the wake of bearing the greater part of the hits. At a group meeting on January 18, the Montreal Victorias proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season in light of their activities, however this was voted against and the leader of the alliance, Fred McRobie, surrendered. Whenever the Senators visited Montreal for an amusement, the police captured Spittal, Alf and Harry Smith, prompting $20 fines for Spittal and Alf, and an exoneration for Harry. Indeed, even with the diligent brutality, Stuart helped the Wanderers to an undefeated season; they at that point acknowledged a test from the Kenora Thistles for the Stanley Cup. The Thistles won the arrangement, held in January, however lost a rematch between the groups in March, giving the Cup back to the Wanderers. Stuart took an interest in the two difficulties, and however did not score an objective in any of the four diversions, he was said to have played the best round of his profession in the main round of the arrangement, even with a broken finger. Viewed as the most vital player on the Wanderers, Stuart was said to realize how to play each situation on the ice, and passed his insight into the diversion onto his partners.
