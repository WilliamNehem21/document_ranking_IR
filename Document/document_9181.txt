Byrne Fone, a student of history of homosexuality-related issues, stresses how the lyric and the anecdotal discourse of Giraud and Byron's relationship uncover experiences into nineteenth century British perspectives on homosexuality. To Fone, the sonnet was composed by one who knew Byron and uncovers Byron's homosexuality. Fone likewise contends that the 1833 production of the sonnet was incited by the capture of William Bankes, a gay companion of Byron, and the execution of Henry Nicholls for gay movement. The opening lines of the sonnet notice "disabled Talleyrand", William Beckford and William Courtenay. Fone contends that the references to Beckford and Courtenay are utilized both to discuss the uncalled for treatment of gay men who had carried out no genuine wrongdoing, and to accentuate England's bad faith with regards to sex. The lyric at that point guarantees that England's treatment of gay people powers Don Leon to go to Greece so as to satisfy his wants and be free of scholarly control, which is satisfied when Don Leon can be with Giraud. The anecdotal Giraud, as per Fone, permits Don Leon to break free of the homophobia of England. The lyric, as he calls attention to, attempts to persuade Moore to make reference to Byron's gay wants. Fone finishes up, "It isn't just the sonnet that is a successful assault on homophobic partiality, however the case of the artist himself."
