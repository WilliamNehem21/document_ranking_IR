Not at all like Tilley, who had been the main acting legislative head of the domain, Sebree was very worried about his legitimate status. Formally, he was just commandant of the maritime station then under development, in spite of the fact that the deed of cession of the domain recognized his hypothetical expert to oversee the general population. He was worried that claims could be brought against him or future acting governors until the circumstance was cleared up and made authority by the United States government. To this end, he made a proposal to the United States Congress to amass a board to consider the domain's status and mentioned that an Assistant Secretary of the Navy go to the region to meet with him. The two solicitations were won't. A further case of this uncertainty came in March 1902, when Sebree got requests to surrender direction of the "Abarenda" to give him extra time as commandant and "representative". To these requests, he reacted that regardless he had not been formally made "representative" and that, if he somehow happened to go about as a senator, he ought to be given the best possible accreditations and lawful expert to do as such. The Navy did not react straightforwardly to Sebree's solicitation, yet he was given order of USS "Wheeling" after three months.
