Different audits were increasingly negative. "GameSpot" essayist Jeff Sengstack said the costly spending plan and long generation history "don't really convert into top notch gaming". He complimented the illustrations and music, yet considered "[the game] for the most part unchallenging, the characters frail, the savagery over-the-top, and the content simply weak". Mike Hall of the "Albuquerque Journal" looked at "Phantasmagoria" to huge spending films with multimillion-dollar spending plans and various generation postpones that eventually fizzled, similar to "Cleopatra" and "Waterworld". He said the illustrations were excellent, however the diversion finished too rapidly, the plot was slender and the riddles were too simple to even consider solving. "The Escapist" essayist Brendan Main said the amusement missed the mark regarding its aspiration to change how gamers experienced ghastliness media, and the juxtaposition of genuine on-screen characters on settings that were "common, pixilated toll" was "odd and unflattering". A one-star audit in "The Video Games Guide", distributed in 2013, "presently appears to be minimal in excess of an imperfect, however yearning, trinket". In a 2014 survey, IGN essayist Kosta Andreadis said the diversion's enhancements were as yet powerful, and that "Phantasmagoria" shrewdly assembles tension and recoveries the rough substance for the finish of the amusement. In any case, he said it was at last "less an awful diversion than an awful blood and guts movie" and said the execution, "albeit in fact fascinating, is amazingly ridiculous, loaded with preposterous circumstances, unusual plot turns, odd discourse, and dated ensemble decisions".
