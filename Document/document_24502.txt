Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as ViÃ±es and Cortot were. It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer. From this point he concentrated on composition. His works from the period include the songs "Un grand sommeil noir" and "D'Anne jouant de l'espinette" to words by Paul Verlaine and ClÃ©ment Marot, and the piano pieces "Menuet antique" and "Habanera" (for four-hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the "Rapsodie espagnole". At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie, who was earning a living as a cafÃ© pianist. Ravel was one of the first musicians â Debussy was another â who recognised Satie's originality and talent. Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them "of inestimable value".
In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with FaurÃ©, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with AndrÃ© Gedalge. Both these teachers, particularly FaurÃ©, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer. As Ravel's course progressed, FaurÃ© reported "a distinct gain in maturity... engaging wealth of imagination". Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, ThÃ©odore Dubois, who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook. Consequently, according to a fellow-student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, he was "a marked man, against whom all weapons were good". He wrote some substantial works while studying with FaurÃ©, including the overture "ShÃ©hÃ©razade" and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900. As a former student he was allowed to attend FaurÃ©'s classes as a non-participating "auditeur" until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903.
