"Dilophosaurus" bore a couple of high, slim, and curved (or plate-molded) peaks longitudinally on the skull rooftop. The peaks were shaped essentially by the lacrimal bones and halfway by the nasal bones. The peaks broadened upwards and gave the presence of a cassowary with two peaks. As a particular element, each peak additionally had a finger-like in reverse projection. The upper surface of the nasal bone between the peaks was inward, and the nasal piece of the peak covered the lacrimal part. As just a single example saves the state of the peaks, it is obscure on the off chance that they contrasted in different people. The lacrimal bone had a one of a kind thickened upper edge, where it framed the upper outskirt at the back of the antorbital fenestra. The prefrontal bone framed the top of the circle (eye attachment), and had a L-molded bar that made piece of the upper surface of the circle curved. The circle was oval, and restricted towards the base. The jugal bone had two upwards pointing procedures, the first shaped piece of the lower edge of the antorbital fenestra, and part of the lower edge of the circle. A projection from the quadrate bone into the parallel worldly fenestra (opening behind the eye) gave this a reniform (kidney-molded) diagram. The foramen magnum (the extensive opening at the back of the braincase) was about a large portion of the broadness of the occipital condyle, which was itself cordiform (heart-formed), and had a short neck and a notch as an afterthought.
