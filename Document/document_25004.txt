"September Morn" also inspired several films. A two-reel production by PathÃ©, titled "September Morn", was released in February 1914 and followed the misadventures of a sailor who gets a tattoo of the model. After his girlfriend disapproves, he tries clothing the naked woman with a ripped skirt, but this fails to gain his lover's approval; ultimately, he ends up with a fully clothed nude and the text "Votes for Women" inked on his arm. Meanwhile, "September Mourning", a November 1915 release produced by L-KO, portrayed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions of a young woman in the park, then invading a school for girls. Robert McElravy, reviewing for "Moving Picture World", found the film funny, but considered it to lack plot. A third film, Lois Weber's "Hypocrites", portrayed "The Naked Truth" (an uncredited Margaret Edwards) in a manner similar to Chabas's model.
Several songs inspired by "September Morn" were likewise released. Musicians Frank Black and Bobby Heath penned a song, "September Morn", based on the painting, and Aubrey Stauffer of Chicago published sheet music (for voice and piano) of "", from Gillespie and Tannehill's musical. At Tin Pan Alley, Henry I. Marshall composed two works, a waltz for piano titled "", and a piece for voice and piano titled "", the latter featuring lyrics by Stanley Murphy. Both were published through Jerome H. RemickÂ Â Co. in 1913.
