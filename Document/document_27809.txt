Australia was regarded by swimming analysts as a medal chance, but were not seen as the main threatsâSweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts had the silver medallists in the 100Â m backstroke and breaststroke, Viktor Kuznetsov and Arsens Miskarovs respectively, and their butterflyer Yevgeny Seredin had come fifth in his 100Â m event. Their freestyler Sergey Koplyakov later came fourth in the corresponding 100Â m event. The British boasted Duncan Goodhew, the 100Â m breaststroke gold medallist, and Gary Abraham, who had placed fifth in the 100Â m backstroke. Sweden's butterflyer PÃ¤r Arvidsson and backstroker Bengt Baron had won their respective 100Â m events and their freestyle swimmer Per Holmertz would win silver in the 100Â m a few days later. Their weakest swimmer was the breaststroker Peter Berggren, who came ninth in the 100Â m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Brooks later came seventh in his 100Â m freestyle semifinal and 14th overall after having an asthma attack, and Evans was Australia's only medallist in the corresponding individual event, winning bronze in the breaststroke. Kerry had been eliminated in the 100Â m backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was the Australian champion in the 100Â m freestyle and backstroke but was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer; the nation did not have an entrant in the 100Â m butterfly. Adding to the pressure was Australia's failure to win any gold medals in any sport at the 1976 Olympics. This meant that the public were still awaiting their first gold since the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Coming into the Olympics, Australia was ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries.
