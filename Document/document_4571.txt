"A Many Splendored Thing" was composed by Noel Behn, who progressed toward becoming counseling maker with the arrangement. That scene included a subplot about a man who killed another man over a pen, which was enlivened by a genuine homicide in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in which a 23-year-elderly person shot another man multiple times in a donut shop when the injured individual wouldn't sell the shooter his pen. Since NBC had not settled on whether to recharge "Murder" until after the four scenes disclosed, the screenwriters did not begin chipping away at any contents for the third season until after the second season closed. Thus, once NBC was focused on recharging, the contents must be composed later and the "Murder" makers were not ready to pivot new shows until the fall. Moreover, Fontana was taking a shot at different undertakings, including "Philly Heat", an ABC miniseries about individuals from the Philadelphia Fire Department. A few news sources condemned NBC for not charging Fontana and Levinson to compose back-up contents, which anticipated "Manslaughter" from beginning prior once the show was recharged. Alan Pergament of "The Buffalo News" expressed, "Naturally, Fontana didn't sit by inactively and sit tight for NBC to settle on its choice on "Crime"."
