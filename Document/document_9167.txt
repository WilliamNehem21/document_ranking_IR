The expressions of August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben communicated not just the etymological solidarity of the German individuals yet in addition their geographic solidarity. In "Deutschland, Deutschland ÃÂ¼ber Alles", formally called "Das Lied der Deutschen" (""The Song of the Germans""), Fallersleben called upon sovereigns all through the German states to perceive the binding together qualities of the German individuals. Such other enthusiastic melodies as "Pass on Wacht am Rhein" ("The Watch on the Rhine") by Max Schneckenburger started to concentrate consideration on geographic space, not constraining "Germanness" to a typical language. Schneckenburger expressed "The Watch on the Rhine" in a particular energetic reaction to French statements that the Rhine was France's "common" eastern limit. In the hold back, "Dear mother country, dear country, put your brain to rest/The watch stands valid on the Rhine", and in such other devoted verse as Nicholaus Becker's "Das Rheinlied" ("The Rhine"), Germans were called upon to protect their regional country. In 1807, Alexander von Humboldt contended that national character reflected geographic impact, connecting scene to individuals. Simultaneous with this thought, developments to protect old strongholds and notable destinations rose, and these especially centered around the Rhineland, the site of such a large number of showdowns with France and Spain.
