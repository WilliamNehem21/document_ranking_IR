Her movements additionally carried her into direct contact with the far more awful predicament of other war displaced people, including Jewish refuge searchers who were leaving Romania on board the "Struma". Outcast had its prizes for abstract displaced people, for example, Manning, offering introduction to various societies and "the feeling of a more prominent, past civilisation", as she portrayed in her 1944 audit of British verse.
