Beecham was temporarily absent from the concert hall and opera house between 1920 and 1923, but Coates gave the first performance of "A Song of the High Hills" in 1920, and Henry Wood and Hamilton Harty programmed Delius's music with the Queen's Hall and HallÃ© Orchestras. Wood gave the British premiÃ¨re of the Double Concerto for violin and cello in 1920, and of "A Song Before Sunrise" and the "Dance Rhapsody No. 2" in 1923. Delius had a financial and artistic success with his incidental music for James Elroy Flecker's play "Hassan" (1923), with 281 performances at His Majesty's Theatre. With Beecham's return the composer became, in Hadley's words, "what his most fervent admirers had never envisagedâa genuine popular success." Hadley cites, in particular, the six-day Delius festival at the Queen's Hall in 1929 under Beecham's general direction, in the presence of the composer in his bath-chair. "[T]he cream of his orchestral output with and without soli and chorus was included", and the hall was filled. Beecham was assisted in the organisation of the festival by Philip Heseltine, who wrote the detailed programme notes for three of the six concerts. The festival included chamber music and songs, an excerpt from "A Village Romeo and Juliet", the Piano and Violin Concertos, and premiÃ¨res of "Cynara" and "A Late Lark", concluding with "A Mass of Life".
The "Manchester Guardian" music critic, Neville Cardus, met Delius during the festival. He describes the wreck of the composer's physique, yet "there was nothing pitiable about himÂ ... his face was strong and disdainful, every line graven on it by intrepid living". Delius, Cardus says, spoke with a noticeable Yorkshire accent as he dismissed most English music as paper music that should never be heard, written by people "afraid of their feelin's".
