A reasonable evaluation of the previous ruler wound up conceivable once the risk of his arrival to control was evacuated. Evaristo da Veiga, one of his most exceedingly terrible pundits just as a pioneer in the Liberal Party, left an explanation which, as indicated by history specialist OtÃÂ¡vio TarquÃÂ­nio de Sousa, turned into the predominant view from that point: "the previous ruler of Brazil was not a sovereign of conventional measureÃÂ ... what's more, Providence has made him an amazing instrument of freedom, both in Brazil and in Portugal.

He proceeded: "Portugal, on the off chance that it was liberated from the darkest and belittling oppression ... in the event that it appreciates the advantages brought by delegate government to learned people groups, it owes it to D[om]. Pedro de AlcÃÂ¢ntara, whose uniform, sufferings and penances for the Portuguese reason has earned him in high degree the tribute of national appreciation."
