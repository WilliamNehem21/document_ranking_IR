In the region of Saint-Quentin on 2ÃÂ October, No.ÃÂ 2 Squadron turned into the first AFC unit in Europe to see aeronautical battle when one of its watches connected some German two-seaters, which figured out how to get away. Since the AircoÃÂ DH.5s in the squadron were impeded as contenders by motor issues and low speed, the squadron was utilized for the most part in ground bolster obligations. Amid the Battle of Cambrai that started on 20ÃÂ November 1917, Watt drove his pilots on brave low-level besieging and strafing assaults against adversary fortresses and lines of correspondence. Their misfortune rate achieved 30%, however confidence stayed high. In the wake of visiting the squadron, the Royal Flying Corps' Major General Hugh Trenchard portrayed its aviators as "extremely eminent" while Charles Bean, war journalist and future manager of the "Official History of Australia in the War of 1914Ã¢ÂÂ 1918", remarked on their "amazingly abnormal state of lead and general tone". Six of Watt's officers were granted the Military Cross for heroism amid the fight, inciting General Sir William Birdwood to send him an individual message of salutation on 16ÃÂ December, announcing: "...ÃÂ This is to be sure a heavenly record for your squadron, and one of which I am certain everybody of you should properly be amazingly pleased; I question in the event that it has been beaten anywhereÃÂ ..." By this time, No.ÃÂ 2 Squadron had started changing over to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, however it could accomplish little in the winter a long time because of harsh climate. Watt himself, presently right around forty, was starting to demonstrate the strain of bleeding edge order. Bean discovered him looking "worn" and saw him shuddering even while situated before the wreckage corridor fire.
