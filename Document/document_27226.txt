Asmussen estimated overall game length to be 10 to 20 hours, "depending on how good of a gamer you are." Santa Monica studio director John Hight reassured players that "God of War III" lasts longer than 10 hours: "We've done a lot of play testing on itÂ ... We know, for a really hardcore player, it'll take them longer than it took them to play either of the previous "God of War" games." The finished game script was about 120 pages long, and the number of onscreen enemies increased from 15 in the previous games to a maximum of 50. To light the game, Turtle by Illuminate Labs was used. Head of development Christer Ericson of SCE Santa Monica Studio confirmed that "God of War III" has seamless loading; no loading screens and no hard disk drive installation requirement. SCE America animator Bruno Velazquez said that while the first two "God of War" titles had computer-generated imagery (CGI) cinematics, there would be no true CGI in the third game: "all the cutscenes are created using our in-game engine." A "God of War III" game trailer debuted on Spike's "GameTrailers TV" on February 11, 2010, and Asmussen confirmed that all footage is of gameplay. New camera angles were added; during some major battles the player can still control Kratos while the camera pans away from the fight, and a first-person camera view was used for the final portion of the Poseidon and Zeus boss fights. According to Sony Santa Monica director of technology Tim Moss, "God of War III" used 35 gigabytes (GB) of Blu-ray Disc. "God of War III"s budget was $44Â million USD, and the game had a staff of 132 at the end of its development.
