From the get-go in her life Acton invested some energy in FranceÃ¢ÂÂeither in Paris or the south of the nationÃ¢ÂÂhowever it isn't known when she left England; Hardy thinks of it as likely that she went in 1823. The nourishment antiquarian Elizabeth Ray, writing in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", expresses that Acton voyaged abroad for the benefit of her wellbeing, since she had a frail constitution. It is conceivable that she was pregnant when she left for Paris and that she traveled to another country to have an ill-conceived girl. The sustenance journalists Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish speculate that Acton's kid was raised by Sarah, Eliza's sister. The two see that "there is no proof for this, other than family convention". Solid expels the hypothesis, expressing that Acton did not have a sister called Sarah, not to mention one who was hitched (none of Acton's sisters were hitched); she likewise sees that she has discovered no baptismal or registration record that would represent an offspring of the correct age. While in France Acton had a miserable association with a French armed force officer; it is conceivable there was a commitment, yet in the event that so it was severed. She came back to England, most likely in 1826.
