Overall, Andrew caused about $25.3Â billion in damage in Florida, making it the costliest hurricane to hit the state at the time. Some estimates in Florida put the damage as high as $32Â billion (1992 USD, $ Â USD). Almost all of the damage in Florida was caused by strong winds. Of the 44Â deaths attributed to the storm, 15Â were direct fatalities, while 29Â were indirectly caused by the storm. It was later noted that if Andrew had been slightly larger or had made landfall a few miles further north, it would have significantly affected Miami and Fort Lauderdale, which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll. An analysis by the American Meteorological Society indicated that unlike most hurricanes, wind damage from Andrew was mostly north of the geometric center and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm. Some officials in Florida considered Andrew the worst storm in the state since the Labor Day hurricane in 1935. The storm surge from Andrew caused more than $500Â million in losses to boats and buildings. At the height of the storm, more than 1.4Â million people lost electricity and another 150,000Â were without telephone service. It is estimated that throughout Florida, the storm damaged 101,241Â homes and destroyed approximately 63,000Â others â the vast majority in Dade County â with about 175,000Â people rendered homeless. In addition to homes, the storm damaged or destroyed 82,000Â businesses, of farmland, 31Â public schools, 59Â health facilities/hospitals, 9,500Â traffic signals, of power lines, and 3,000Â watermains. Approximately 20Â million cubic yards (15Â million m) of debris left by the storm were disposed of.
