In any case, enthusiasm for the Cleveland Bay was winding down, because of expanded automation, and the Great Depression of the mid 1930s diminished fares by very nearly a third. There was a short restoration of enthusiasm for the late 1930s in the United States when they wound up famous as establishment stock for seekers. The decrease kept, enlivening after the Second World War; in 1960 the War Office quit offering premiums on stallions, and numerous raisers ended rearing. By 1962, just four thoroughbred stallions were available in the UK. Ruler Elizabeth II spared the breed by buying Mulgrave Supreme, a stallion that was going to be sold to a purchaser in the United States. The stallion was reared to unadulterated and part-reproduced female horses, and inside 15ÃÂ years there were 36ÃÂ purebred stallions in the UK. Sovereign Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, utilized the breed for a long time in global driving rivalries. In the late 1970s, enthusiasm for the breed expanded, and part-reared Cleveland Bays were popular for use as riding ponies, particularly for use as seekers and jumpers. In 1964, a Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred cross contended in show bouncing in the Tokyo Olympics. Another half-reproduced Cleveland Bay vied for the British Olympic group in show seizing the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, while a third was a save mount for the Canadian show bouncing group at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In the late 1960s and '70s, ponies kept on being sent out to numerous nations. Japan, the United States and Australia have kept on bringing in the ponies from England, and in New Zealand goes between Cleveland Bays and local female horses were popular on dairy cattle and sheep stations.
