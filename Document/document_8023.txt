The limit statements of the ÃÂthelstan A sanctions were written in right Old English, so it is far-fetched that he was of remote birthplace. The observer arrangements of the ÃÂthelstan A contracts reliably place Bishop ÃÂlfwine of Lichfield in Mercia in a higher position than his rank justified. Ruler ÃÂthelstan was most likely raised in Mercia, and in Sarah Foot's view he was presumably personal with ÃÂlfwine before King Edward's demise; as ÃÂlfwine vanished from the observer records in the meantime as the ÃÂthelstan A contracts finished, she proposes that he may have been ÃÂthelstan A. Keynes supposes it more probable ÃÂthelstan A was a lord's cleric from Mercia, who gained his learning in a Mercian religious house and regarded ÃÂlfwine as an individual Mercian; that ÃÂthelstan An entered ÃÂthelstan's administration before he progressed toward becoming ruler and was in lasting participation on him. David Woodman additionally considers a Mercian root likely, calling attention to that some Mercian ninth-century sanctions have borrowings from Aldhelm, an essential wellspring of ÃÂthelstan A's style. Woodman additionally advances the elective thought that ÃÂthelstan A had an association with Glastonbury Abbey in Wessex, which seems to have been a focal point of learning as of now, and positively housed huge numbers of the writings which educated ÃÂthelstan A's particular Latin style.
