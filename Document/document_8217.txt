Feeley clarifies that Romantic writer John Keats' "vision of charm and destruction following upon any dealings with "faeries"" advises the novel, as the passing reference to the "chilly slope" clarifies. The enchantment in "Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell" has been portrayed as "stormy and evil" and "a despairing, shocking thing". There are "herds of dark winged creatures, a woodland that experiences childhood in the trenches of Venice, a wide open of depressing fields that must be entered through mirrors, a ghost chime that makes individuals consider all that they have ever lost, a midnight murkiness that pursues an abhorrent man wherever he goes". The setting mirrors this tone, as "dim, mist, fog and wet give the book quite a bit of its frightening, northern environment." According to Nisi Shawl in her audit for "The Seattle Times", the outlines strengthen this tenor: "Shadows fill the representations by Portia Rosenberg, as able as Edward Gorey's for Dickens' 'Depressing House'." Author John Clute dissents, contending that they are "incredibly unseemly" to the tone of the novel. Noticing that Clarke alludes to critical nineteenth-century artists George Cruikshank and Thomas Rowlandson, whose works are "line-commanded, perplexing, scabrous, animation like, savage and interesting", he is baffled with the "delicate and wooden" representations given by Rosenberg.
