At the point when the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Aberdeen, educated of the proposition dismissed by Pakenham, Aberdeen asked the United States to re-open dealings, yet Polk was reluctant except if a proposition was made by the British. With Britain moving towards organized commerce with the annulment of the Corn Laws, great exchange relations with the United States were more vital to Aberdeen than a far off domain. In February 1846, Polk enabled Buchanan to educate Louis McLane, the American diplomat to Britain, that Polk's organization would look positively on a British proposition based around a division at the 49th parallel. In June 1846, Pakenham exhibited an idea to the Polk organization, requiring a limit line at the 49th parallel, with the exemption that Britain would hold all of Vancouver Island, and there would be restricted route rights for British subjects on the Columbia River until the termination of the contract of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1859. Polk and the majority of his Cabinet were set up to acknowledge the proposition, however Buchanan, in an inversion, encouraged that the United States look for control of the majority of the Oregon Territory. Polk regarded Buchanan's turn around connected to his presidential desire.
