The Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from "Final Fantasy" video games into a rock music style, have arranged three pieces from "Final Fantasy X". These are "Fight With Seymour" from their self-titled album, published in 2003, and "Otherworld" and "The Skies Above", both of which can be found on the album "", published in 2004. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his "Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy" concert series. The music of "Final Fantasy X" has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as "20020220 Music from Final Fantasy", a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. An odd note; the unreleased/promo CD-R (Instrumental) version of Madonna's "What It Feels Like For A Girl" done by Tracy Young was used in the blitzball sequences. Additionally, "Swing de Chocobo" was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the "Distant Worlds â Music from Final Fantasy" concert tour, while "Zanarkand" was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the "Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy" concert series. Independent but officially licensed releases of "Final Fantasy X" music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called "dojin music", and on English remixing websites.
