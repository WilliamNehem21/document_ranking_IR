Runestone U 792 (area) is in the Fp style and it is credited to the runemaster Balli. The stone is in dark rock and it gauges in stature and in width. It was initially raised together with a second runestone, with one on each side of the Eriksgata where the street passed a portage, c. west of where the homestead Ulunda is today. The Eriksgata was the way that recently chosen Swedish lords passed when they visited the nation so as to be acknowledged by the neighborhood congregations. The stone was first archived by Johannes Bureus in the seventeenth century, and later around the same time by Johan PeringskiÃÂ¶ld, who believed it to be an amazing stone brought up in memory of a frivolous lord, or war boss, in agnostic occasions. At the point when Richard Dybeck visited the stone, in 1863, it was leaning back significantly, and in 1925, the stone was accounted for to have totally tumbled down at the bank of the stream. It was not until 1946 that the Swedish National Heritage Board organized to have it re-raised. It was brought up in memory of a man (presumably Haursi) by his child, KÃÂ¡rr, and his brother by marriage. Haursi had come back from Greece a rich man, which left his child beneficiary to a fortune.
