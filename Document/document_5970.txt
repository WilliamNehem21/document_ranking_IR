Individuals' responses fluctuated: some depicted themselves as "stunned"; others confessed to being "temperamental" or apprehensive for the remainder of the day. Harold Kittinger, a laborer at the Suntone Factory, stated, "I couldn't care less to tell anybody I was panicked. Be that as it may, I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." One lady speculated that the shaking was a "bomb". Elegance Standerfer recommended the seismic tremor was abrupt, saying, "I was simply frightened to death. My significant other and I were in the house. The Venetian shades started to shake one way, at that point another. At the point when that terrible impact came, he snatched me and we kept running outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had reached an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was shuddering under our feet. I was so terrified. I didn't realize I was terrified." People in the network of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were scared by the shaking. In any case, some did not see the seismic tremor; Jane Bessen said her gathering was "in a carÃÂ ... to Evansville and didn't think about it until we arrived".
