Amid the principal half of the twentieth century "The Relapse" was generally disregarded, alongside other Restoration dramatization, and specialists are questionable about precisely when Vanbrugh's unique again resurged to noticeable quality on the stage and accordingly minimized Sheridan's variant. These specialists presently trust the play may have been first splendidly restored by Anthony Quayle's 1947 creation at the Phoenix Theater, featuring Cyril Ritchard as Lord Foppington and conveyed to Broadway by Ritchard in 1950. A melodic rendition, "Ideals in Danger" (1963), by Paul Dehn and "John Bernard", opened to blended audits. John Russell Taylor in "Plays and Players" lauded the cast, which included Patricia Routledge as Berinthia and John Moffatt as Lord Foppington, however griped that the creation was "brimming with the giggling, posing and sniggering which more often than not remain in for style and modernity in Restoration recoveries." Following Donald Sinden's extraordinary and grant winning execution at the Aldwych Theater in the mid-1960s Vanbrugh's unique play is currently again a most loved of the stage. A 2001 recovery by Trevor Nunn at the National Theater was portrayed by Sheridan Morley as "uncommon, cherishing and splendidly cast." As so regularly with critique on "The Relapse", Morley concentrated on the job of Lord Foppington and its distinctive translations: "Alex Jennings wonderfully acquires the job of Lord Foppington which for a long time or so had a place with Donald Sinden, and for another 20 preceding that to Cyril Ritchard."
