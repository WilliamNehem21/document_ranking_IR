"Herrerasaurus" was initially viewed as a variety inside Carnosauria, which at that point included structures like "Megalosaurus" and "Antrodemus" (the last is equal to "Allosaurus"), despite the fact that "Herrerasaurus" lived a large number of years before them and held different crude highlights. This carnosaurian characterization was changed upon by Rozhdestvensky and Tatarinov in 1964, who arranged "Herrerasaurus" inside the family Gryponichidae inside Carnosauria. That year, Walker distributed a varying conclusion that "Herrerasaurus" rather was aligned with Plateosauridae, despite the fact that it contrasted in having a pubic boot. Walker additionally suggested that "Herrerasaurus" may rather be near "Poposaurus" (presently considered a pseudosuchian) and the anonymous theropod from the Dockum Group of Texas (presently relegated to the rauisuchian "Postosuchus"). In 1985, Charig noticed that "Herrerasaurus" was of unsure characterization, appearing at both "prosauropods" and "carnosaurians". Romer (1966), basically noticed that "Herrerasaurus" was a prosauropod perhaps inside Plateosauridae. In the depiction of "Staurikosaurus", Colbert noticed that there were numerous similitudes between his taxon and "Herrerasaurus", yet grouped them in independent families, with "Herrerasaurus" in Teratosauridae. In 1970, Bonaparte likewise proposed likenesses among "Herrerasaurus" and "Staurikosaurus", and keeping in mind that grouping them both obviously as in Saurischia, he expressed that they seemed like they couldn't be set in a present family. This was additionally upheld by Benedetto in 1973, who named for the taxa the new family Herrerasauridae, which he named saurischians, potentially inside Theropoda yet not in Sauropodomorpha. In any case, in 1977 Galton suggested that Herrerasauridae just included "Herrerasaurus", and observed it to be Saurischian "incertae sedis".
