Volume 28 of the manga reached 17th place in the "USA Today Booklist" in its first week of release in March 2008, only two places short of the record for a manga, held by "Fruits Basket".

In 2010, Viz, the publisher, commented on the loyalty of readers, who reliably continued to buy the manga as the volume count went over 40.
