On the morning of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by Colin Cowdrey, the England chief, that he had been let well enough alone for the group and was rather twelfth man. In his place, England picked a quick bowler to fortify their bowling assault. While the amusement was occurring, Doug Insole, the executive of the England selectors, acquainted D'Oliveira with Isaacs, who offered him warm accommodation on the off chance that he visited South Africa amid the English winter. Profoundly annoyed with his oversight, D'Oliveira came back to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man obligations finished. Oborne proposes that, from a cricketing perspective, the choice to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it might have been associated with the South African nearness at Lord's. The swap for D'Oliveira, Barry Knight, performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, paradoxically, lost all batting structure. From mid-June until August, troubled by the weight over South Africa, he attempted to score, overseeing only 205 keeps running at a normal of 12.81. He kept up his structure as a bowler, yet commentators trusted his opportunity had gone. In July, as a major aspect of a standard methodology, the MCC kept in touch with 30 driving players to inquire as to whether they were accessible to visit South Africa; D'Oliveira was not reached. As per Fraser-Sampson, the possibility that D'Oliveira was not then a standout amongst England's best 30 players was silly; he composes that the selectors should in this manner have known that Vorster would not acknowledge his choice and they had thus chosen not to pick him.
