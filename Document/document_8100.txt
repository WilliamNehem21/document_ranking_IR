She was the last ship of the Sixth Division of the first BS, alongside , and the lead, , the most heterogeneous gathering conceivable as each ship was from an alternate class. The Sixth Division was the starboardmost section of the Grand Fleet as it traveled south to meet with the boats of Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet, at that point connected with their contrary numbers from the German High Seas Fleet in the North Sea. Naval commander Jellicoe, administrator of the Grand Fleet, kept it in cruising arrangement until 6:15ÃÂ p.m. when he requested it to send from section into a solitary line dependent on the port division, each ship turning 90ÃÂ° in progression. This turn made the Sixth Division the nearest dispatches in the Grand Fleet to the ships of the High Seas Fleet and they terminated on each ship as they made their swing to port. This convergence of shoot later ended up known as "Breezy Corner" to the British as the boats were doused by German shell sprinkles albeit none were hit.
