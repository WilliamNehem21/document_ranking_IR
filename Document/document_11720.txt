The Malagasy mountain mouse is a little, mouse-like rat, and very unique in appearance from most different nesomyines. It has a thick, delicate hide, which seems dim darker on the upperparts. The spread hairs (which include a large portion of the hide) are tricolored: for the basal 66% of their length, they are plumbeous dim; the center is ochraceous; and the tip is dull dark colored to dark. The more extended watchman hairs, which are most regular towards the center of the back, are totally dark. The hide of the underparts seems dim dark and isn't forcefully divided from the upperparts. There, the hairs are likewise plumbeous at the bases, yet the tips run from white to yellowish-dark colored. The mystacial vibrissaeÃ¢ÂÂstubbles over the mouthÃ¢ÂÂare medium-sized. The short, adjusted ears are thickly secured with grayish hairs. "Monticolomys" has expansive hindfeet bearing conspicuous cushions and long external digits. There are white hairs on the upper sides of the metapodials and digits, and long ungual tuftsÃ¢ÂÂtufts of hair encompassing the bases of the pawsÃ¢ÂÂare available. The thumb of the forefeet bears a nail, however paws are available on different digits. The long tail is secured with little scales and light dark colored hairs. The tail does not have an unmistakable tuft at the tip, as is available in "Eliurus" and "Macrotarsomys". Females have six mammae.
