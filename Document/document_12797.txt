The eighteenth century saw the beginnings of progress to horticulture on Shapinsay, civility of the Balfour family. The family possessed the bequest of Sound, which secured the western piece of the island. Sound had gone from the Tulloch family to the Buchanan family in the seventeenth century. In 1674, Arthur Buchanan assembled the place of Sound, where Balfour Castle presently stands. His granddaughter wedded James Fea, who is best known for his job in the catch of the Orkney Pirate John Gow. Fea was a supporter of the Jacobite ascending of 1715, and the house was singed by Hanoverian troops in retribution. The domain was procured by Andrew Ross, Stewart Depute in Orkney of the Earl of Morton. Ross' beneficiaries, the Lindsay siblings, sold the home to Thomas Balfour in 1782. Balfour had recently leased the Bu of Burray, an extensive house ranch on another Orkney island, yet had deficient riches to gain the bequest despite the fact that his better half had acquired a heritage on the passing of her privileged sibling. To raise the important assets, Balfour needed to sell his military bonus and acquire from his sibling, John, who was flourishing in India with the East India Company. Once introduced on the island, he fabricated another house, Cliffdale, and established the town of Shoreside, presently known as Balfour. He likewise transformed the nearby horticulture, encasing fields and developing homestead structures.
