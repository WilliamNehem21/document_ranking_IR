Murray before long became acquainted with Petrie, turning into his copyist and artist and creating the illustrations for the distributed report on his unearthings at Qift, "Koptos". Thusly, he helped and urged her to keep in touch with her first research paper, "The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History", which was distributed in the "Procedures of the Society for Biblical Archeology" in 1895. Turning into Petrie's "accepted" however informal aide, Murray started to give a portion of the etymological exercises in Griffith's nonattendance. In 1898 she was designated to the situation of Junior Lecturer, in charge of showing the semantic courses at the Egyptology division; this made her the principal female teacher in antiquarianism in the United Kingdom. In this limit, she went through two days seven days at UCL, dedicating the different days to thinking about her debilitated mother. As time went on, she came to show seminars on Ancient Egyptian history, religion, and language. Among Murray's studentsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ to whom she alluded as "the Gang"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ were a few who proceeded to create noted commitments to Egyptology, including Reginald Engelbach, Georgina Aitken, Guy Brunton, and Myrtle Broome. She enhanced her UCL pay by showing evening classes in Egyptology at the British Museum.
