In October, the I Squadron went on a voyage in the Baltic. Toward the beginning of December, the I and II Squadrons went on their standard winter voyageÃ¢ÂÂthis opportunity to Danzig, where they touched base on 12 December. While on the arrival outing to Kiel, the armada led strategic activities. The armada embraced a heavier preparing plan for 1906 than in earlier years. The boats were busy with individual, division and squadron practices all through April. Beginning on 13 May, real armada practices occurred in the North Sea and kept going until 8 June with a voyage around the Skagen into the Baltic. The armada started its typical summer voyage to Norway in mid-July. The armada was available for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German boats left the next day for Helgoland, to join practices being led there. The armada was back in Kiel by 15 August, where arrangements for the pre-winter moves started. On 22Ã¢ÂÂ 24 August, the armada participated in landing practices in EckernfÃÂ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The moves were stopped from 31 August to 3 September when the armada facilitated vessels from Denmark and Sweden, alongside a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The moves continued on 8 September and kept going five more days.
