In the early morning of 18ÃÂ June, two No.ÃÂ 32 Squadron Beauforts assaulted with bombs and gunfire what they took to be a submarine. "Deloraine" was not exactly from the zone of the RAAF assault, yet did not recognize rehashed endeavors by the air ship to speak with her. The Beauforts announced that they had harmed the submarine and escalated endeavors were made on 19ÃÂ June to find and sink her, with twelve Ansons persistently clearing the region while six Vengeance jump aircraft were held in preparation adjacent. No further sightings were made and it was accepted that the submarine had been harmed by a No.ÃÂ 32 Squadron flying machine yet got away. Maritime student of history David Stevens has composed that the locating made on 18ÃÂ June was most likely mixed up, as "I-174" was at any rate toward the east of where the RAAF assault occurred and the occurrence was not recorded in her war journal. Notwithstanding, different history specialists trust that the Beauforts may have sunk "I-178", which was watching off the east shore of Australia at the time; this submarine vanished some time after 17 June 1943, and the reason for her misfortune has never been affirmed. "I-174" was requested to withdraw from Australian waters on 20 June, and came back to Truk on 1 July. She didn't reach any Allied boats or airplane in the wake of assaulting GP55.
