Richardson's next stage role was in a starry revival of "The School for Scandal", as Sir Peter Teazle, directed by Gielgud in 1962. The production was taken on a North American tour, in which Gielgud joined the cast as, he said, "the oldest Joseph Surface in the business". A revival of "Six Characters in Search of an Author" in 1963 was judged by the critic Sheridan Morley to have been a high-point of the actor's work in the 1960s. Richardson joined a British Council tour of South Africa and Europe the following year; he played Bottom again, and Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice".
For his next four stage productions, Richardson was at the Haymarket. "Father Carving a Statue" (1964) by Graham Greene was short-lived. He had a more reliable vehicle in Shaw's "You Never Can Tell" (1966) in which he played the philosopher-waiter William, and in the same year he had a great success as Sir Anthony Absolute in "The Rivals". The critic David Benedictus wrote of Richardson's performance, "...he is choleric and gouty certainly, the script demands that he shall be, but his most engaging quality, his love for his son in spite of himself, shines through every line." In 1967 he again played Shylock; this was the last time he acted in a Shakespeare play on stage. His performance won critical praise, but the rest of the cast were less well received.
