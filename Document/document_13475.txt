Based on what is known about Edward's character, he could be incautious and inconsistent, as was seen by his activities against Stratford and the clergymen in 1340/41. In the meantime, he was notable for his mercy; Mortimer's grandson was cleared, yet came to have an imperative impact in the French wars, and was inevitably made a Knight of the Garter. Both in his religious perspectives and his interests, Edward was an ordinary man. His most loved interest was the craft of war and, in this, he complied with the medieval idea of good majesty. As a warrior he was successful to the point that one present day military antiquarian has portrayed him as the best broad in English history. He appears to have been surprisingly dedicated to his significant other, Queen Philippa. Much has been made of Edward's sexual lewdness, however there is no proof of any treachery on the lord's part before Alice Perrers turned into his darling, and at that point the ruler was at that point critically ill. This dedication stretched out to the remainder of the family also; as opposed to such huge numbers of his ancestors, Edward never experienced restriction from any of his five grown-up children.
