"Precious stones Are Forever" was distributed on 26 March 1956 by Jonathan Cape with a spread structured by Pat Marriott. Similarly as with the three past Bond books, the principal release of 12,500 duplicates sold out rapidly; the US version was distributed in October 1956 by Macmillan. The epic was serialized in "The Daily Express" paper from 12 April 1956 onwardsÃ¢ÂÂthe first of Fleming's books he had sold to the paperÃ¢ÂÂwhich prompted a general ascent in the offers of the books. From November 1956 offers of "Jewels Are Forever", and Fleming's different books, all rose after the visit of the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, to Fleming's Goldeneye home to recover following the Suez Crisis; Eden's stay was tremendously detailed in the British press. The book got supports in deals in 1962 when Eon Productions adjusted "Dr. No" for the film, and in 1971 when "Jewels Are Forever" was created for the wide screen. In February 1958 Pan Books distributed a soft cover adaptation of the novel in the UK, which sold 68,000 duplicates before the year's end. Since its underlying distribution the book has been issued in various hardback and soft cover releases, converted into a few dialects and has never been no longer available.
