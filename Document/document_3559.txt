After leaving Ladysmith, USÃÂ 8 goes through the networks of Tony, Glen Flora, Ingram (where it meets the northern end of WISÃÂ 73) and Hawkins on out of Rusk County. In Price County, USÃÂ 8 goes through Kennan and Catawba. WISÃÂ 111 ends at its south end on USÃÂ 8 only east of Catawba. USÃÂ 8 meets WISÃÂ 13 at a jewel trade northwest of Prentice and passes north of the city. The thruway goes through Brantwood and enters Lincoln County at Clifford. Further east, USÃÂ 8 crosses Tripoli and McCord and runs north of Tomahawk as it goes through the Lake Nokomis zone. USÃÂ 51 crosses USÃÂ 8 upper east of Tomahawk. USÃÂ 8 transforms upper east into Oneida County and onto a contorting northeasterly arrangement. The interstate goes through Woodboro and grows to a separated roadway into Rhinelander. It converges with WISÃÂ 47 on the southwest side of Rhinelander. WISÃÂ 17 north joins the expressways toward the southeast, making an incorrect path simultaneousness with WISÃÂ 47; along this segment of thruway, eastward USÃÂ 8 is likewise southbound WISÃÂ 47 and northbound WISÃÂ 17 and the other way around. WISÃÂ 17 swings toward the north southeast of there, and USÃÂ 8 and WISÃÂ 47 head eastward out of the Rhinelander territory.
