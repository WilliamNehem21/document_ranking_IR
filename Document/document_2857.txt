They used a variation of an adaptable model called the CTW display, created by the makers and makers of the first show, to make and deliver freely created preschool TV programs in different nations. The Workshop perceived that the creation demonstrate created in the US, which mirrored its needs and culture at the time, filled in as a system for different nations that needed to rehash it. Its inborn adaptability was appealing to makers in different nations, who saw the model as "a methodological methodology that is neither opinionated nor culture-bound" that could be utilized to accomplish distinctive outcomes in various nations.
