Gaga started chip away at her third studio collection, "Artpop", in mid 2012, amid the Born This Way Ball visit; she created the collection to reflect "a night at the club". In August 2013, Gaga discharged the collection's lead single "Acclaim", which achieved number one in Hungary, number four in the US, and number five in the UK. A verse video for "Artpop" track "Atmosphere" followed in October to go with Robert Rodriguez's "Blade Kills", where she plays a professional killer named La Chameleon. The film got commonly negative surveys and earned not exactly 50% of its $33 million spending plan. The second "Artpop" single, "Do What U Want", included vocalist R. Kelly and was discharged soon thereafter, topping the graphs in Hungary and achieving number 13 in the US. Gaga expelled the melody from every single spilling stage in 2019 in the light of claims made against Kelly explicitly manhandling a few ladies; Gaga apologized for consistently teaming up with him. "Artpop" was discharged in November 2013 to blended surveys. Helen Brown in "The Daily Telegraph" condemned Gaga for making another collection about her acclaim and questioned the record's inventiveness, however thought that it was "incredible for moving". The collection appeared on the "Board" 200 outline, and sold more than 2.5 million duplicates worldwide starting at July 2014. "G.U.Y." was discharged as the third single in March 2014 and topped at number 76 in the US.
