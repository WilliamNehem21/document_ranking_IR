UConn began the season solid, winning their initial five amusements. The Huskies effectively won their first amusement 35Ã¢ÂÂ 3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) adversary Hofstra. The second diversion, at Temple, was played as the leftovers of Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12Ã¢ÂÂ 9 in additional time as Donald Brown kept running for a then-profession high 214ÃÂ yards and scored the amusement winning touchdown. Connecticut next retaliated for their misfortune to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45Ã¢ÂÂ 10. Baylor was next on the calendar; the Huskies hauled out the success in a forward and backward diversion, 31Ã¢ÂÂ 28. Connecticut opened Big East gathering play in their next diversion against Louisville. The diversion was not chosen until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson restored a capture attempt for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the final quarter, giving the Huskies a 26Ã¢ÂÂ 21 lead they would not give up. This was the second in a row season where Connecticut won their initial five diversions; before 2007, they had not opened a season so effectively since 1995, when they won their initial six straight. Following the diversion, UConn accomplished their sole positioning of the year, showing up at No.ÃÂ 24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris surveys and No.ÃÂ 23 in the Coaches' survey. Be that as it may, beginning quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke his foot in the Louisville diversion; the Huskies would be compelled to depend on reinforcement Zach Frazer for the following couple of amusements.
