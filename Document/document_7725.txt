While "Niagara" made Monroe a sex image and built up her "look", her second film of the year, the mocking melodic satire "Respectable men Prefer Blondes", set up her screen persona as an "imbecilic blonde". In view of Anita Loos' smash hit novel and its Broadway form, the film centers around two "gold-burrowing" showgirls, Lorelei Lee and Dorothy Shaw, played by Monroe and Jane Russell. The job of Lorelei was initially proposed for Betty Grable, who had been twentieth Century-Fox's most mainstream "blonde sensation" during the 1940s; Monroe was quick overshadowing her as a star who could speak to both male and female gatherings of people. As a major aspect of the film's attention battle, she and Russell squeezed their hand and impressions in wet cement outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in June. "Honorable men Prefer Blondes" was discharged soon after and ended up one of the greatest film industry accomplishments of the year by netting $5.3 million, more than twofold its creation costs. Crowther of "The New York Times" and William Brogdon of "Assortment" both remarked positively on Monroe, particularly taking note of her execution of "Jewels Are a Girl's Best Friend"; as per the last mentioned, she exhibited the "capacity to sex a melody just as point up the eye estimations of a scene by her essence".
