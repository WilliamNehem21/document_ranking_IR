Everton and cosmetics fashioners Michael Westmore, Scott Wheeler, and Jake Garber needed to overhaul the pale white look the Borg had held since "The Next Generation"s second season, conceived out of a requirement for frugal TV structure. "I needed it to seem as though they were [assimilated or "Borgified"] from the back to front as opposed to the outside in," Everton said. Each Borg had a somewhat unique structure, and Westmore planned another one every day to influence it to create the impression that there was a multitude of Borg; in all actuality, somewhere in the range of eight and twelve on-screen characters filled every one of the jobs as the ensembles and cosmetics were so costly to deliver. Foundation Borg were recreated considerably completed mannequins. Westmore contemplated that since the Borg had ventured to every part of the world, they would have absorbed different races other than people. In the TV arrangement, a significant part of the Borg's appearances had been secured by protective caps, yet for "First Contact" the cosmetics craftsman evacuated the head covers and planned absorbed adaptations of commonplace "Star Trek" outsiders, for example, Klingons, Bolians, Romulans, Bajorans, and Cardassians. Each automaton got an electronic eyepiece. The flickering lights in each eye were customized by Westmore's child to rehash a generation part's name in Morse code.
