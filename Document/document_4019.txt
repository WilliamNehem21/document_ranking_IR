Alkan had couple of adherents; in any case, he had critical admirers, including Liszt, Anton Rubinstein, Franck, and, in the mid twentieth century, Busoni, Petri and Sorabji. Rubinstein devoted his fifth piano concerto to him, and Franck committed to Alkan his "Great piÃÂ¨ce symphonique" operation. 17 for organ. Busoni positioned Alkan with Liszt, Chopin, Schumann and Brahms as one of the five biggest authors for the piano since Beethoven. Isidor Philipp and Delaborde altered new printings of his works in the mid 1900s. In the main portion of the twentieth century, when Alkan's name was as yet dark, Busoni and Petri incorporated his works in their exhibitions. Sorabji distributed an article on Alkan in his 1932 book "Around Music"; he advanced Alkan's music in his surveys and analysis, and his Sixth Symphony for Piano ("Symphonia claviensis") (1975Ã¢ÂÂ 76), incorporates a segment entitled "Semi Alkan". The English arranger and author Bernard van Dieren applauded Alkan in an article in his 1935 book, "Down Among the Dead Men", and the writer Humphrey Searle likewise required a restoration of his music in a 1937 paper. The piano player and author Charles Rosen anyway considered Alkan "a minor figure", whose just music of intrigue comes after 1850 as an expansion of Liszt's strategies and of "the operatic procedures of Meyerbeer."
