In 1884, he bolstered Blaine for president, giving extensive totals to the congressperson's ineffective battle against New York Governor Grover Cleveland. Huge numbers of Hay's companions were apathetic about Blaine's office, to Hay's annoyance, and he kept in touch with editorial manager Richard Watson Gilder, "I have never had the capacity to welcome the rationale that prompts some phenomenal individuals at regular intervals since they can't designate the hopeful they want to vote in favor of the gathering they don't lean toward." In 1888, Hay needed to pursue his own recommendation as his favored competitor, Ohio Senator John Sherman, was ineffective at the Republican tradition. After some hesitance, Hay upheld the candidate, previous Indiana congressperson Benjamin Harrison, who was chosen. In spite of the fact that Harrison named men whom Hay upheld, including Blaine, Reid, and Robert Lincoln, Hay was not requested to serve in the Harrison organization. In 1890, Hay represented Republican congressional competitors, tending to a rally of 10,000 individuals in New York City, however the gathering was crushed, losing control of Congress. Roughage contributed assets to Harrison's fruitless re-appointment exertion, to some extent since Reid had been made Harrison's 1892 running mate.
