The "Sovetsky Soyuz"- class ships gave an absolute load of to defensive layer insurance, a marginally more noteworthy load than that of the bigger Japanese "Yamato" class (). Their protective layer was planned to oppose 406ÃÂ mm shells and 500ÃÂ kg bombs, explicitly shells discharged from forward direction somewhere in the range of 35ÃÂ° and 50ÃÂ° from the centerline. This prompted the extremely unordinary circumstance where the defensive layer belt thickened toward the bow to adjust for the narrowing of the ship close to the forward magazines, which must be made up for by thicker shield. The belt was long and secured 57% of the absolute waterline length. It was slanted 5ÃÂ° to build its protection from level direction shells. Over the apparatus spaces it was thick and expanded in ventures until it was thick over the forward magazines. It was over the back magazine. The belt shield was conveyed forward of the magazines at a thickness of and ended in a steeply slanted (30ÃÂ°) transverse bulkhead that diminished to at the lower deck where it was proceeded down to the inward base by a bulkhead. Forward of this bulkhead was a 20ÃÂ mm chip belt that proceeded with right to the bow. The principle defensive layer belt dropped down to the fundamental deck from the upper deck side by side the toward the back turret to diminish weight. This "progression" was ensured by plates. A transverse bulkhead isolated the back turret and the ship's sides. The fundamental piece of the shielded fortress was shut off by a 230ÃÂ mm forward bulkhead and a back bulkhead, both of homogeneous defensive layer. Chip protective layer thick secured the upper bit of the fortification.
