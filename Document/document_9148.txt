For his job as Charley "the Gent", the sibling of Marlon Brando's character in Elia Kazan's "On the Waterfront" (1954), Steiger was named for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Film essayist Leo Braudy composed that the "ceaselessly rehashed pictures of its cab encounter among Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film notorious". The cab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was vigorously scripted, in spite of Brando fuelling the prevalent misconception in his life account that the scene was ad libbed. Brando expressed that seven takes were required on the grounds that Steiger couldn't quit crying, which Steiger observed to be out of line and incorrect. Despite the fact that Steiger held incredible regard for Brando as an on-screen character, he hated him as an individual and oftentimes grumbled amid the creation of Brando's "inclination for leaving the set" following shooting his scenes. Steiger later commented: "We didn't become acquainted with one another by any means. He generally flew solo and I haven't seen him since the film. I do dislike him saying he's only a hooker, and that on-screen characters are prostitutes". Steiger additionally reacted negatively when he discovered that Kazan had been granted a privileged Oscar by the Academy in 1999. In a 1999 meeting with "BBC News", Steiger said he most likely would not have done "On the Waterfront" on the off chance that he had known at the time that Kazan gave the House Un-American Activities Committee with names of entertainers associated with being Communists.
