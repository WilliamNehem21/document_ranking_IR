Niffenegger started composing the novel in 1997; the last scene, in which a matured Clare is hanging tight for Henry, was composed first, since it is the story's point of convergence. The story was initially organized specifically. Reacting to remarks from perusers of early drafts of the composition, Niffenegger revamped the story with the goal that it to a great extent pursued Clare's course of events. The work was done in 2001. With no history of business distribution, Niffenegger experienced difficulty finding intrigued scholarly operatorsÃ¢ÂÂ25 dismissed the composition. In 2002, she sent it spontaneous to the little, San Francisco-based distributer MacAdam/Cage, where it came to Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who turned into Niffenegger's proofreader, "thought it was unfathomable. Directly from the earliest starting point you sense that you are in proficient hands, this is somebody who has a story to advise and who realizes how to tell it." She offered it to David Poindexter, the organizer of the distributing firm, "who read it medium-term and chose to purchase the book". In any case, Niffenegger had gained a specialist at this point, and a few distributing houses in New York City were keen on the novel. The original copy was set available to be purchased and MacAdam/Cage offer US$100,000, by a long shot the biggest aggregate it had ever offered for a book. Albeit another distributer outbid them, Niffenegger chose MacAdam/Cage since they were so committed to her work. Likewise, Niffenegger clarifies that her "very own common tendency is to go little. My experience is in punk musicÃ¢ÂÂI'd generally pick the non mainstream organization over the monster company."
