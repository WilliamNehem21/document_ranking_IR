During the period 1827â40, Mary Shelley was busy as an editor and writer. She wrote the novels "The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck" (1830), "Lodore" (1835), and "Falkner" (1837). She contributed five volumes of "Lives" of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French authors to Lardner's "Cabinet Cyclopaedia". She also wrote stories for ladies' magazines. She was still helping to support her father, and they looked out for publishers for each other. In 1830, she sold the copyright for a new edition of "Frankenstein" for Â£60 to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley for their new Standard Novels series. After her father's death in 1836 at the age of eighty, she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication, as he had requested in his will; but after two years of work, she abandoned the project. Throughout this period, she also championed Percy Shelley's poetry, promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing. By 1837, Percy's works were well-known and increasingly admired. In the summer of 1838 Edward Moxon, the publisher of Tennyson and the son-in-law of Charles Lamb, proposed publishing a collected works of Percy Shelley. Mary was paid Â£500 to edit the "Poetical Works" (1838), which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography. Mary found a way to tell the story of Percy's life, nonetheless: she included extensive biographical notes about the poems.
