Student of history Robert Bartlett has remarked that "one of the biggest vulnerabilities in the entire story of the passing and restoration of William Cragh is the reason Lady Mary [de Briouze] intervened for him", however mediate she did. John of Baggeham, when interrogated regarding her inspiration 18 years after the occasion, could just answer that "Woman Mary had looked for the body of this William, he didn't have even an inkling why". Before the execution she had requested that her significant other extra the two censured men, however he had won't. At that point on hearing that Trahaern ap Hywel was dead, and trusting that Cragh was as yet alive, she by and by asked that he be given over to her, yet de Briouze postponed until he was persuaded that Cragh was likewise dead. At that point "he conceded him [Cragh] to the said woman, for example, he was, and requested him to be brought down from the scaffold". Woman Mary had "an exceptional commitment" to Thomas de Cantilupe, the expired Bishop of Hereford, and in her very own words, after becoming aware of Cragh's passing, "on twisted knee, she asked Saint Thomas de Cantilupe to request that God reestablish life to William Cragh".
