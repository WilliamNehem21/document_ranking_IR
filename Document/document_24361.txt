Following a brief appearance as Beatriz EnrÃ­quez de Arana in the unsuccessful adventure film "" (1992), Zeta-Jones featured as a belly dancer in disguise in a 1992 episode of George Lucas television series "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles". She next took on the part of an aspiring duchess in "Splitting Heirs" (1993), a farcical period drama from the director Robert Young about two children (Eric Idle and Rick Moranis) who are separated at birth. Reviews for the film were negative, though the critic Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" found her to be "very funny". In 1994, Zeta-Jones played the melancholic Eustacia Vye in the television film "The Return of the Native", an adaptation of the novel of the same name (1878) by Thomas Hardy, and the wife of Lloyd Owen's character in the television war drama "The Cinder Path". She was then cast as the eponymous protagonist of the 1995 television biopic "Catherine the Great". In a mixed review, critic Lisa Nesselson of "Variety" found the miniseries to be "brightly colored" but "wooden and hollow", though thought that Zeta-Jones "imparts a certain grace and resolve to her sovereign-in-the-making". Zeta-Jones next starred as the pragmatic girlfriend of Sean Pertwee's character in "Blue Juice" (1995), publicised as Britain's first surf film, which the critic Leonard Maltin described as a "superficial and predictable" production.
