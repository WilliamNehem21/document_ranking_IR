"Kaiser Wilhelm II" partook in an activity in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904, after which she came back to Kiel. She at that point went to the Norwegian city of ÃÂlesund to help with the significant flame that crushed the to a great extent wooden city on 23 January. Squadron practices pursued from 8 to 17 March. A noteworthy armada practice occurred in the North Sea in May, and "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was again present at Kiel Week in June, where she was visited by Britain's King Edward VII, Lord William Palmer, and Prince Louis of Battenberg. In June, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" won the Kaiser's "SchieÃÂpreis" (Shooting Prize) for brilliant gunnery. The next month, the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain, including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July. The German armada left on 13 July, headed for the Netherlands; the I Squadron tied down in Vlissingen the next day. There, the boats were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. The I Squadron stayed in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they withdrew for a journey in the northern North Sea with the remainder of the armada. The squadron halted in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while different units went to different ports.
