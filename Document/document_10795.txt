The opening track, "Airbag", is supported by a beat worked from a seconds-in length recording of Selway's drumming. The band tested the drum track with an advanced sampler and altered it with a Macintosh PC, propelled by the music of DJ Shadow, however confessed to making approximations in copying Shadow's style because of their programming naivetÃÂ©. The bassline stops and begins out of the blue, accomplishing an impact like 1970s name. The tune's references to car crashes and resurrection were roused by a magazine article titled "An Airbag Saved My Life" and "The Tibetan Book of the Dead". Yorke stated "Airbag" about the fantasy of security offered by current travel, and "the possibility that at whatever point you go out and about you could be murdered." The BBC composed of the impact of J. G. Ballard, particularly his 1973 novel "Crash" on the tune's expressive substance. Music columnist Tim Footman takes note of the tune's specialized developments and melodious concerns exhibit the "key Catch 22" of the collection: "the performers and maker are taking pleasure in the sonic potential outcomes of current innovation; the artist, in the interim, is railing against its social, moral, and mental impact.ÃÂ ... It's a logical inconsistency reflected in the way of life conflict of the music, with the 'genuine' guitars arranging an uneasy remain off with the hacked-up, handled drums."
