Amid the evening of 31 July, Leane drove a strike on an Ottoman channel inverse Tasmania Post, which was held by the eleventh Battalion. The assault was provoked by a craving to give the Ottomans the feeling that an endeavor would have been made to break out of the Anzac edge toward the south, while an arrival was arranged at Suvla Bay far toward the north. Leane's power comprised of four gatherings of 50 men, who were to attack the Ottoman channel after the terminating of four mines that had been uncovered to the adversary channel. At first just the northernmost and southernmost of the mines detonated, yet Leane drove out the assault in any case. While the gatherings were covering the separation between Tasmania Post and the Ottoman channel, a third mine detonated, potentially covering a few individuals from one of the attacking gatherings. The fourth mine neglected to detonate. Solid battling happened at certain purposes of the goal channel, yet the Ottomans were steered and the channel was united and correspondence channels driving towards the Ottoman back were blockaded. A few urgent bomb battles happened at the blockades. Work promptly started to change over the mine passages into correspondence channels prompting the recently caught channel. There were some weak counterattacks. At day break, Ottoman big guns started an extraordinary assault of the recently won position. Amid the shelling, Leane was addressing an eyewitness as a foe shell landed. The spectator was beheaded and Leane was injured in the head, yet stayed at his post. The position caught amid this activity ended up known as "Leane's Trench". While catching the channel, the eleventh Battalion had lost 36 slaughtered and 73 injured.
