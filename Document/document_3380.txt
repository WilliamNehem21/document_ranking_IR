English destroyers directed a progression of assaults against the armada, some of which focused "Deutschland". In the skirmish, "Deutschland" and "KÃÂ¶nig" got some distance from the assaulting destroyers, however couldn't make out targets unmistakably enough to draw in them adequately, "Deutschland" shooting just a couple of 8.8ÃÂ cm shells in the fog without impact. Before long, "Pommern" detonated after she was struck by something like one torpedo. Parts of the ship poured down around "Deutschland". In any case, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer powers and achieved Horns Reef by 4:00 on 1 June. The German armada came to Wilhelmshaven a couple of hours after the fact, where the flawless battleships of the "Nassau" and es took up protective positions while the harmed boats and the overcomers of the II Squadron withdrew inside the harbor. Over the span of the fight, "Deutschland" had exhausted just a solitary 28ÃÂ cm shell and five 8.8ÃÂ cm rounds. She had not been harmed in the commitment.
