The California Diamond Jubilee half dollar began with the craving of the San Francisco Citizens' Committee (Angelo J. Rossi, executive), to have a dedicatory half dollar to sell as a pledge drive for a neighborhood festivity in remembrance of the 75th commemoration of California statehood. On January 9, 1925, a bill was presented in the Senate for a silver half dollar and gold dollar remembering the Battle of Bennington and the American Revolutionary War-time frame autonomy of Vermont. The bill passed the Senate after a correction expelled the gold dollar. At the point when the bill was bantered in the House of Representatives on February 16, 1925, California Congressman John E. Raker offered a change to include a coin for the 75th commemoration of California statehood. This was emphatically contradicted by Representative Albert Vestal, executive of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, who expressed that the Bureau of the Mint restricted making "these extraordinary coins". He included that along these lines, Washington Representative Albert Johnson had consented to pull back his bill for a memorial regarding Fort Vancouver, in Washington state. Raker by and by persevered, and his revision passed. Agent Johnson at that point offered a correction to include a Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar to the bill, and to Vestal's dismay, this additionally was received. The bill passed the House of Representatives, and the Senate consented to the House revisions without discussion on February 17.
