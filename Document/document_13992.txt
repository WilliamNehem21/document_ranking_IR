Sir Joseph goes ahead board, joined by his "respecting horde of sisters, cousins and aunties". He relates how he ascended from humble beginnings to be "leader of the Queen's Navee" through diligence, in spite of the fact that he has no maritime capabilities. He at that point conveys an embarrassing exercise in manners, telling the Captain that he should dependably say "on the off chance that you please" subsequent to giving a request; for "A British mariner is any man's equivalent" Ã¢ÂÂ aside from Sir Joseph's. Sir Joseph has created a tune to delineate that point, and he gives a duplicate of it to Ralph. In the blink of an eye a short time later, elated by Sir Joseph's perspectives on uniformity, Ralph concludes that he will pronounce his affection to Josephine. This enjoyments his shipmates, with the exception of Dick Deadeye, who battles that "when individuals need to obey other individuals' requests, equity's not feasible". Stunned by his words, different mariners constrain Dick to tune in to Sir Joseph's melody before they leave, disregarding Ralph on deck. Josephine now enters, and Ralph admits his adoration in wording shockingly smooth for a "typical mariner". Josephine is contacted, yet in spite of the fact that she has discovered Sir Joseph's considerations sickening, she realizes that it is her obligation to wed Sir Joseph rather than Ralph. Masking her actual sentiments, she "haughtily rejects" Ralph's "proffered love".
