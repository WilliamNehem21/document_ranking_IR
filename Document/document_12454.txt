The churchwardens of Biddenden kept on keeping up the yearly dole from the Bread and Cheese Lands. It is recorded that in 1605, the custom that "on that day [Easter] our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread, cheddar, cakes and jumpers barrels of lager, acquired there and drawn" was suspended because of a visit from Charles Fotherby, the Archdeacon of Canterbury, attributable to past services having caused "much issue by reason of some uncontrollable ones, which at such time we can't control without breaking a sweat". In 1645, minister William Horner asserted that the Bread and Cheese Lands were glebe (land planned for the utilization of the ward cleric), and endeavored to assume responsibility for the grounds. The instance of the Bread and Cheese Lands was brought before the Committee for Plundered Ministers, who in the long run found for the philanthropy in 1649. Horner brought the case under the steady gaze of the Court of the Exchequer in 1656 however again without progress, and the philanthropy proceeded to claim the terrains and to work the yearly Easter dole. Witness explanations from these cases notice that the terrains had been given by two ladies "who became together in their bodies", yet don't give any name for the ladies.
