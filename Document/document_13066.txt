In 1840 the writer Friedrich Hebbel composed a lyric in German titled "Composition", its Latin title implying "" (endless rest), the principal expressions of the Mass for the Dead. The lyric opens with a punctuation to a "spirit" in a request, "" (Soul, overlook them not, soul, overlook not the dead). These words seem to resound different hymns, for example, , "Favor the Lord, O my spirit". Hebbel, in any case, inspires an "everlasting rest" that is particularly non-religious: the sonnet offers no supernatural reference, Christian or something else, yet calls for recognition as the best way to keep the dead alive. The primary lines, in which the speaker calls upon the spirit not to overlook the dead, are rehashed in the focal point of the lyric and again at its determination, as a hold back that separates two longer areas of refrain. The first of these areas depicts how the dead, sustained by affection, appreciate a last gleam of life. Interestingly, the last area depicts an alternate destiny for spirits that have been neglected: who are consigned to an unending, barren battle for reestablished presence. The musicologist Katherine FitzGibbon takes note of that the speaker of this story isn't recognized, yet might be "a wonderful storyteller, divine voice, or even the dead".
