In respect to other commonplace mushroom species, the spores of "V.ÃÂ bohemica" are colossal, normally estimating 60Ã¢ÂÂ 80 by 15Ã¢ÂÂ 18ÃÂ ÃÂµm. They are circular, smooth, now and again bended, and seem hyaline (translucent) to yellowish. The spores, which number two (all the more once in a while three) per ascus are trademark for this species. The smooth, curved asci measure 275Ã¢ÂÂ 350ÃÂ ÃÂµm long by 16Ã¢ÂÂ 23ÃÂ ÃÂµm wide. The British-Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller verified that the asci are heliotropicÃ¢ÂÂthey twist toward light. As he noted, "I cut transverse segments however their pilei, inspected these segments under the magnifying lens, and without a moment's delay apparent that in all the hymenial scores and sorrows the asci were bended outwards so their opercula more likely than not confronted the most grounded beams of light to which the closures of the asci has been oppressed in the spots where the organic product bodies built up." This reaction to the boost of light is huge on the grounds that it allows a natural product body to point and later release its asci towards open spaces, consequently expanding the odds that the spores will be scattered by wind. The paraphyses are thick and club-molded, with distances across of 7Ã¢ÂÂ 8ÃÂ ÃÂµm at their tips.
