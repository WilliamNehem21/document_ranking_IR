After an almost four-month delay, "Oblivion" went gold on March 2, 2006, and was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, "Oblivion" shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's "". Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, "We tend to focus on what we can control and not worry about what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." "Oblivion" was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a "Collector's Edition" was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page "Pocket Guide to the Empire", a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of "Oblivion", and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a "garish piece of jewelry".
