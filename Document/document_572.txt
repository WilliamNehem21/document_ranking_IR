It was amid his time as abbot that Foliot composed his answer to Brien FitzCount, one of Matilda's most punctual supporters, talking about the Second Council of the Lateran's considerations on Matilda's motivation. FitzCount, in a letter currently lost, had displayed his explanations behind supporting Matilda, and Foliot's answer put forward a barrier of Matilda's case to the position of authority. Foliot additionally composed that Stephen had "shamed the episcopate" with his conduct in 1139, when the lord captured Roger of Salisbury, the Bishop of Salisbury, and Roger's nephew, Alexander, who was Bishop of Lincoln, just as endeavoring to capture another of Roger's nephews, Nigel, Bishop of Ely. After the capture Stephen constrained the priests to surrender their palaces and mainstream government workplaces. Most students of history see Foliot's letter as solidly supporting Matilda's motivation, albeit one of King Stephen's ongoing biographers, Donald Matthew, guarantees that Foliot's help was tepid, best case scenario, spurred by the area of his monastery in one of Matilda's fortifications. Matthew brings up that Gloucester Abbey owed no military administration in a medieval toll, which permitted Foliot to abstain from picking sides unalterably. Matthew likewise calls attention to that after 1141 Foliot is a signatory to only one of Matilda's sanctions. Foliot did however address Robert of Gloucester's barrier of Matilda's rights, buttressing it with contentions of his own. Robert had contended that the Bible upheld female progression, and cited from Numbers, section 36, which enabled ladies to acquire, yet disallowed them wedding outside their clan. In his answer Foliot guaranteed that Robert had really utilized Numbers, section 27, which had no confinements on the marriage of beneficiaries.
