The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) made portrayals to the request that "Passing on the Rock" could conceivably have adversy affected the examination on similar grounds that Howe had endeavored to defer the communicated. The first was that the program may have been seen by individuals from the examination jury, and could along these lines have made them achieve an end on the shootings before hearing the proof at the investigation. Thinking about this accommodation, the report concurred with the feelings of legal advisors counseled by Thames and the IBA that "Passing on the Rock" was sheltered to be communicated on 28 April 1988. The report thought about that Thames retained conveyance of "Death on the Rock" from Gibraltar and Spain explicitly to address such concerns, however it was generally talked about in British papers (which are broadly sold in the domain) and concentrates later wound up accessible in Gibraltar. The report finished up it was predictable that the substance of "Death on the Rock" would wind up known in Gibraltar, yet that it would not have partial potential members of the jury as, in the creators' conclusion, the program raised one probability, yet did not look to exhibit it as the main conceivable variant of occasions. The second was that the program may have defiled the proof exhibited at the examination, as observers may have been enticed to give false or decorated records for the TV. The report expelled this worry; the creators trusted that every one of the observers gave legit records of what they trusted they saw, and brought up that three had offered articulations to the Gibraltar Police and two had been met by Gibraltarian and British papers before being met for "Death on the Rock".
