Another arrangement called H-1 was uncovered in March 1930, after the Underel Corporation had gained the land close Sixth Avenue. The leases for the recently procured land contained explicit stipulations on how it was to be utilized. Under this new proposition, there would be offices for "TV, music, radio, talking pictures and plays". RCA wanted to construct theaters on the north and south squares close Sixth Avenue, with places of business over the venues' Sixth Avenue sides. The venue doorways would be worked toward the west along Sixth Avenue, and the halls would be situated toward the east, since the city's construction law denied the erection of structures over the assembly rooms of theaters. The conveyance path was wiped out in this arrangement, as it was seen as pointless: the auditoriums would just observe intermittent conveyances. The complex would likewise contain three tall structures in the focal point of each square, including a 60-story working in the inside square for RCA (the present 30 Rockefeller Plaza). Todd recommended that this extensive pinnacle be put on Sixth Avenue on the grounds that the Sixth Avenue Elevated would decrease the estimation of some other properties at the west end of the complex. On Fifth Avenue there would be a short oval-formed retail fabricating, whose top floors would be involved by Chase National Bank workplaces. There would be a court between the oval structure and RCA's structure, and an eatery on the previous. A cross-country transport terminal would be assembled underground to allure occupants who may somehow lease close Penn Station or Grand Central.
