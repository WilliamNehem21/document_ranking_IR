Spaihts was entrusted with investigating uncertain riddles from "Outsider, for example, the Space Jockey. He considered the puzzles of "Outsider" to be outsider in nature, and stated, "every one of the riddles have outsider players: the exoskeleton bad dream andÃÂ ... the massive titan that was known as the 'space jockey'ÃÂ ... How would you make anybody care about occasions between animals like this?" His answer was to connect the outsider puzzles to the past and eventual fate of humankind. He stated: "If that story is by one way or another our own and profoundly enmeshed with the human story, that story changes importance inside our life, things of such hugeness that we think about our very own lives in an unexpected way."

He reminded Scott that in the scene they were talking about, the characters were liable to gravity thus couldn't just buoy. By April 2010, the content was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the content, "we are discussing divine beings and architects. Designers of room. What's more, were the outsiders structured as a type of organic fighting? Or on the other hand science that would go in and tidy up a planet?" In June 2010, Scott declared that the content was finished and prepared for recording.
