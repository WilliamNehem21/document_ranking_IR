Discharged on August 25, 1988, by Elektra Records, "Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All" was acclaimed by music pundits. In a contemporary survey for "Moving Stone", Michael Azerrad said that Metallica's structures are great and called the collection's music "a wonder of correctly directed hostility". "Turn" magazine's Sharon Liveten considered it a "diamond of a twofold record" and found the music both tense and in fact capable. Simon Reynolds, writing in "Tune Maker", said that "different groups would give their eye teeth" for the tunes' riffs and found the collection's thickly confounded style of metal to be unmistakable from the repetitive sound of contemporary shake music: "Everything relies upon absolute dependability and incomparable careful artfulness. It's likely the most sharp music I've at any point heard, in the strict feeling of the word." Borivoj Krgin of "Metal Forces" said that it was the best collection he has heard in view of commonly uncommon generation and musicianship that is more amazing than that of "Ace of Puppets". In a less energetic survey for "The Village Voice", Robert Christgau trusted that the band's arrangements need tune structure and that the collection "goes on longer" than "Ace of Puppets". In 1988, "Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All" was designated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, however questionably lost to Jethro Tull's "Peak of a Knave". In 2007, "Amusement Weekly", named this one of the 10 greatest surprises in Grammy history.
