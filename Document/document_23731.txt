NojpetÃ©n fell to a Spanish assault on 13 March 1697, more than 150 years after the conquest of the rest of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands. The lengthy delay in conquering the PetÃ©n region was due to a combination of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants. During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize. The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of PetÃ©n from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianising efforts of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s crossed PetÃ©n in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the "Aj Kan Ek"') was the overlord of the entire central PetÃ©n region.
