The 1985â86 Blue Devils finished as national runner-up in the 1986 NCAA Tournament to Louisville. That year, Amaker recorded 81 steals, second to Jim Spanarkel at that point in Duke history. He set the career steals record, which stood until Shane Battier broke it in 2001. Amaker also holds the Duke single-year NCAA Tournament record with 18 steals in 1986, which had been a tournament record. That year, he had seven steals in two tournament gamesâagainst Old Dominion in the second round on March 15 and Louisville in the final on March 31. This seven-steal total stood as the single-game NCAA tournament record for seven years until the 1993 NCAA Tournament when Darrell Hawkins had eight for Arkansas against and Grant Hill had eight for Duke against . The seven steals was a championship game record that was tied by Mookie Blaylock in the 1988 NCAA Tournament for Oklahoma against Kansas and was surpassed by Ty Lawson in the 2009 NCAA Tournament for North Carolina against Michigan State. Amaker was selected to the 1986 Division I Basketball Tournament All-NCAA Final Four Team. The 1986 Duke team graduated four of its five starters (Dawkins, Mark Alarie, Jay Bilas and David Henderson), leaving Amaker with an inexperienced supporting cast for his senior season. That year, Amaker was a spokesman against drug and alcohol abuse as part of an NCAA-Fiesta Bowl drug education television program.
