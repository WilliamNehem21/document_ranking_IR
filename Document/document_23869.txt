An earlier version of "Full on Idle", "Title TK"s eighth track, was released on the Amps' "Pacer" in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel "Pacer" was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of "Full on Idle" sound almost the same, but "The Village Voice"s Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. "The Guardian"s Betty Clarke cited the line "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" as an example of "Title TK"s amusing, off-center lyrics. On "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings "Has anyone seen the iguana?" She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." Another line, "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.
