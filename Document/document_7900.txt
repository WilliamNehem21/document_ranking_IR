While his yield secured a wide scope of subjects, he is best known for his commitments to herbal history, scientific classification, natural catalog, and organic delineation. "Organic Latin" (four releases 1966Ã¢ÂÂ 1992), is his best known work, having turned into a standard reference and depicted as both the authoritative handbook for plant taxonomists and a philological masterwork. It was started amid the war years and the primary release was fundamentally a manual for Latin for botanists with no or restricted information of the language, which he depicted as a "do-it-without anyone's help Latin pack" for taxonomists. Afterward, the work advanced into an etymological lexicon, however then Stearn discovered that such a work had just been distributed in the Netherlands before the war. He then kept on extending it with the help of his better half and child, deliberately gathering organic terms from natural writings. It is said that no one but he could have composed this work, which clarifies the deduction of plant names as well as the philological standards associated with framing those names. The work is viewed as in charge of the proceeded with survival of Latin as the most widely used language of natural science. Notwithstanding this original content, he as often as possible got a kick out of the enlightenment that the works of art could add to getting plants and plant legend, for example, his "Five Brethren of the Rose" (1965).
