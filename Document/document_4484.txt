The troops moving toward Quebec's dividers were fundamentally under-prepared. Arnold had no big guns, every one of his men conveyed just five cartridges, more than 100ÃÂ muskets were unserviceable, and the men's attire had been diminished to clothes. Regardless of being dwarfed two to one, Arnold requested the city's surrender. Both agents sent were shot at by British guns, connoting that the interest had been reprimanded. At a gathering of war called by CramahÃÂ© on 16 November, MacLean as the most senior military officer present supported waiting. MacLean expressed that Quebec City had an army of 1, 178 men and had enough sustenance and kindling for both the battalion and the non military personnel populace to last all through the winter. Arnold reasoned that he couldn't take the city by power, so he barred the city on its west side. A stock arranged by Arnold uncovered that more than 100 black powder guns had been so harmed by introduction to the components amid the trek through the ferocity that they were presently futile. On NovemberÃÂ 18, the Americans heard a (false) talk that the British were wanting to assault them with 800ÃÂ men. At a board of war, they chose that the bar couldn't be kept up, and Arnold started to move his men upriver to Pointe-aux-Trembles ("Aspen Point") to sit tight for Montgomery, who had quite recently taken Montreal. Henry Dearborn, who later progressed toward becoming U.S. Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson, was available at the fight and composed his well known diary, " The Quebec Expedition", which sketched out the long and troublesome walk to the fight and the occasions that happened there.
