In mid-1803, the squadron under Captain Henry William Bayntun, consisting of HMS "Bellerophon", , , , and captured the French privateers "Poisson Volant" and . The Royal Navy took both into service. The corvette "Mignonne" and a brig were captured in late June, after which the British patrolled off Cap-FranÃ§ois. On 24 July the squadron, made up of "Bellerophon" and the 74-gun ships HMS "Elephant", and HMS "Vanguard", came across two French 74-gun ships, "Duquesne" and "Duguay-Trouin", and the frigate "GuerriÃ¨re", attempting to escape from Cap-FranÃ§ois. The squadron gave chase, and on 25 July overhauled and captured "Duquesne" after a few shots were fired, while "Duguay-Trouin" and "GuerriÃ¨re" managed to evade their pursuers and escape to France. One man was killed aboard "Bellerophon" during the pursuit. She remained blockading Cap-FranÃ§ois until November, when the French commander of the garrison there, General Rochambeau, approached Loring and requested to be allowed to evacuate his men, which were being besieged by a native Haitian force led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines. To prevent Rochambeau escaping, Loring sent launches from "Bellerophon" and "Elephant" into the Caracol Passage where they cut out the French schooner "DÃ©couverte" on 22â23 November. The French formally surrendered on 30 November and were allowed to evacuate on three frigates, "Surveillante", "Clorinde", and "Vertu", and a number of smaller ships, and were escorted to Jamaica by the squadron.
