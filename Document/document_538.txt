"Irritator" and "Angaturama" are known from the Romualdo Formation, whose stones are dated to the Albian phase of the Early Cretaceous Period, around 110 million years prior. Amid this time, the Southern Atlantic Ocean was opening, shaping the arrangement of circum-Atlantic bowls of southern Brazil and southwestern Africa, however the northeastern piece of Brazil and West Africa were as yet associated. The Romualdo Formation is a piece of the Santana Group and, at the time "Irritator" was depicted, was believed to be an individual from what was then viewed as the Santana Formation. The Romualdo Formation is a LagerstÃÂ¤tte (a sedimentary store that jam fossils in magnificent condition) comprising of limestone solidifications inserted in shales, and overlies the Crato Formation. It is outstanding for saving fossils three-dimensionally in limestone solidifications, including numerous pterosaur fossils. Notwithstanding muscle filaments of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, fish safeguarding gills, stomach related tracts, and hearts have been found there. The development is translated as a seaside tidal pond with sporadic freshwater impact that battled with cycles of transgressing and relapsing ocean levels. The atmosphere of the arrangement was tropical and generally related to the present Brazilian atmosphere. The areas encompassing the development were bone-dry to semi-parched, with the majority of the nearby verdure being xerophytic (adjusted to dry conditions). Cycadales and the terminated conifer "Brachyphyllum" were the most broad plants.
