From the time he had fled to Germany, Meyszner had been occupied with a question in regards to his enrollment in the Nazi Party. He had kept up that the Venice Agreement implied that he and different individuals from the Styrian Home Guard hosted been acknowledged into the Nazi Get-together with renowned low participation numbers relating to the dates of their entrance into the Home Guard. The treasurer of the Nazi Party, Franz Xaver Schwarz, did not acknowledge the Agreement and verified that the individuals from the Styrian Home Guard were not naturally exchanged to the Nazi Party. This turned into an issue when Hitler chose to check the tenth commemoration of his seizure of intensity and entrusted his private secretary and leader of the Nazi Party Chancellery, "Reichsleiter" Martin Bormann, to figure out who ought to be issued one of a carefully predetermined number of Golden Party Badges to stamp the commemoration. Meyszner, who had been prescribed by Himmler, acknowledged that his gathering participation was reflectively resolved to be 1 June 1938 and he was apportioned a gathering number of 6,119,650. In this manner he successfully joined the Nazi Party as late as 1943. Because of these choices, Meyszner did not qualify as an "Adjust KÃÂ¤mpfer" (Old Fighter) and Himmler needed to intercede for the benefit of Meyszner to guarantee he got the identification. Meyszner was one of just five SS men that Himmler regarded deserving of this specific honor.
