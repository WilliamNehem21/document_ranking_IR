Her power plant was completely replaced as were her propellers. New Kampon multi-stage geared turbines were fitted that increased her power from during trials. Each had a high-pressure, a low-pressure, and a cruising turbine coupled to a single shaft. Her boilers were replaced by eight improved oil-burning models of the Kampon Type B (Ro) with a working pressure of at a temperature of . The hull was lengthened by at the stern to reduce drag and she was given another torpedo bulge above the side armor abreast the upper part of the existing bulge to increase her beam and lower her center of gravity as a result of lessons learned from the Tomozuru Incident in early 1934. This raised her standard displacement significantly, from . The extra power and the extra displacement roughly offset each other and her speed increased by less than a knot, up to on trials. Her fuel storage was increased to of fuel oil which increased her endurance to at . The lengthy funnel ducting was replaced by a single downturned starboard funnel modeled on that used by the "Akagi" with a water-cooling system for the exhaust gasses and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gasses to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. The space freed up by the removal of the funnel ducts was divided into two decks and converted into living quarters for the expanded air group. The carrier's complement increased to 1708 crewmembers.
