In the last two hundred years, the maps have been accurate enough for the distance from the ruins to the sea to be measured. The 400Â m (440Â yd) in 1817 had become 320Â m (350Â yd) by 1835, 275Â m (300Â yd) in 1907, and 195Â m (215Â yd) by the end of the 20th century. The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1Â m (1Â yd) per year; and several raised islands or "eyes" have already been lost to the sea as the beach has rolled over the saltmarsh. Landward movement of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven, itself excavated in 1922 because an earlier, more northerly course was overwhelmed between Blakeney and Cley, was becoming blocked increasingly often. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered a number of remedial options. Attempting to hold back the shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550Â m (600Â yd) stretch of river 200Â m (220Â yd) further south was completed in 2007 at a cost of about Â£1.5Â million.
