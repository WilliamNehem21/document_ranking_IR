Taking note of that there is no proof of Wicca existing before the distribution of Murray's books, Merrifield remarked that for those in twentieth century Britain who wished to shape their very own witches' covens, "Murray may have appeared the perfect pixie adoptive parent, and her hypothesis turned into the pumpkin mentor that could transport them into the domain of imagination for which they yearned". The antiquarian Philip Heselton recommended that the New Forest coven Ã¢ÂÂ the most seasoned claimed Wiccan gathering Ã¢ÂÂ was established "around" 1935 by esotericists mindful of Murray's hypothesis and who may have trusted themselves to be resurrected witch-religion individuals. It was Gerald Gardner, who professed to be a start of the New Forest coven, who built up the convention of Gardnerian Wicca and advanced the religion; as indicated by Simpson, Gardner was the main individual from the Folklore Society to "wholeheartedly" acknowledge Murray's witch-faction theory. The couple knew one another, with Murray composing the foreword to Gardner's 1954 book "Black magic Today", in spite of the fact that in that foreword she didn't expressly indicate whether she trusted Gardner's case that he had found a survival of her witch-clique. In 2005, Noble proposed that "Murray's name may be everything except overlooked today in the event that it were not for Gerald Gardner".
