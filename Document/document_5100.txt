This species was first depicted by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1825 from an example gathered on the Guinean coast. He distributed his depiction in the second volume of "Nouveau recueil de planches coloriÃÂ©es d'oiseaux" and portrayed it as "Corvus gymnocephalus", putting it in the crow family "Corvus". The species name is gotten from the Ancient Greek words "gymnos" "bare", and "kephalÃÂ" "head". In any case, just three years after the fact the winged creature was expelled from the family "Corvus" by RenÃÂ© PrimevÃÂ¨re Lesson and set in its very own class, "Picathartes", as it didn't share qualities regular to individuals from "Corvus, for example, a feathered head. This nonexclusive name originates from a mix of the Latin genera "pica" for "jaybird" and "cathartes" for "vulture". Since its underlying portrayal, the picathartes have been set in excess of five unique families, including those of crows (Corvidae), starlings (Sturnidae), Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae), babblers (Timaliidae) and Old World songbirds (Sylviidae). Today the white-necked rockfowl and its nearby relative the dark necked rockfowl are accepted to contain a one of a kind family, Picathartidae. It has likewise been recommended however not for the most part acknowledged that the two rockfowl speak to the leftovers of an old winged creature request. Ongoing DNA examination has demonstrated that Picathartidae and its nearest relatives, southern Africa's rockjumpers and southeast Asia's rail-babbler, structure a clade. The investigation recommends that the rockfowl split from the normal precursor of their clade 44 million years prior. It is trusted that the predecessor of this clade began in Australia and spread to Africa. In spite of the fact that the white-necked rockfowl has no subspecies, it is accepted to frame a superspecies with the dark necked rockfowl, with plumage and facial example being the essential contrasts between the two species.
