At the point when "Chicago Tribune" design commentator Kamin cautioned Trump that his survey of the sign would be negative, Trump reacted "over the long haul, it'll resemble the Hollywood Sign"; planner Smith removed himself from the sign saying "Only for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!" The debate encompassing the sign attracted consideration the national press and worldwide press as it neared culmination and the Associated Press ran a tale about Mayor Emanuel's dissatisfaction in mid-June. As indicated by the Mayor's representative Kelley Quinn, "City hall leader Emanuel trusts this is a structurally classy structure scarred by a compositionally bland sign". Kamin has noticed that piece of the issue is the design conventions of the city: "If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, no one would mindÃ¢ÂÂhowever it is in Chicago, and in a piece of Chicago brimming with incredible structures from the 1920s to the 1960s and ahead". Trump and Reilly both called attention to how unbecoming the earlier "Chicago Sun-Times" building signage was. Because of the disaster, Emanuel started an examination on the best way to modify the tenets to deflect comparative signage discussions later on. A Chicago-based structure firm intended to make and buoy four monster pig expands before the sign as a challenge, yet were ineffective getting US Coast Guard and Chicago Department of Transportation endorsements.
