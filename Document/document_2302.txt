In the book "The Films of Luc Besson", Susan Hayward considered "The Fifth Element" to be a great story of a man "making his break from the clan, demonstrating his masculinity, over-tossing the noxious powers and executing the boss, at last to receive the benefits of security and marriage". Korben's voyage, be that as it may, is under risk from the Mangalores and Zorg, yet in addition from Leeloo, who yields and encourages him just at last, tolerating his affirmation of adoration. The romantic tale inside "The Fifth Element" was viewed as one of the primary stories in the film, and it faces a similar due date as the fundamental storyline. Hayward likewise thought about the issue of natural harm, in so far as waste and contamination are noticeable all through the film.

The film was said to be suspicious of entrepreneur commercialization, in so far as the devices in Zorg's office make an unfortunate fixation of his desire for innovation. The strain among innovation and man is treated as an issue requiring a last goals.
