Mandela's mom took him to the "Incomparable Place" royal residence at Mqhekezweni, where he was depended to the guardianship of the Thembu official, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In spite of the fact that he didn't see his mom again for a long time, Mandela felt that Jongintaba and his significant other Noengland regarded him as their own youngster, bringing up him close by their child, Justice, and little girl, Nomafu. As Mandela went to community gatherings each Sunday with his watchmen, Christianity turned into a critical piece of his life. He went to a Methodist mission school situated alongside the royal residence, where he considered English, Xhosa, history and geology. He built up an affection for African history, tuning in to the stories advised by old guests to the royal residence, and was impacted by the counter settler talk of a meeting boss, Joyi. At the time he all things considered the European colonialists not as oppressors but rather as sponsors who had brought instruction and different advantages to southern Africa. Matured 16, he, Justice and a few different young men made a trip to Tyhalarha to experience the ulwaluko circumcision custom that emblematically denoted their change from young men to men; a short time later he was given the name "Dalibunga".
