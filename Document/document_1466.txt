At the point when the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) Ã¢ÂÂ a parallel authoritative body with the SNC Ã¢ÂÂ was framed in February 1992, Ranariddh was delegated as one of its chamber individuals. He invested energy going among Bangkok and Phnom Penh, and keeping in mind that in Phnom Penh drove endeavors in opening FUNCINPEC party workplaces crosswise over Cambodia. In the meantime, FUNCINPEC started to scrutinize the decision CPP, which struck back with vicious assaults by police against low-level FUNCINPEC authorities. The assaults provoked Ranariddh's nearby helpers, Norodom Sirivudh and Sam Rainsy, to prompt him against enrolling the gathering for the 1993 general races. Be that as it may, the culinary expert de-mission for UNTAC, Yasushi Akashi, urged Ranariddh to keep running in the races. Convinced by Akashi, he enrolled the gathering and the race battle started in April 1993. Ranariddh, just as other FUNCINPEC authorities, wore T-shirts portraying Sihanouk on the battle field. This ostensibly conformed to a race rule by the UNTAC organization not to utilize Sihanouk's name amid the crusade, who presently filled in as the politically impartial leader of the SNC. Casting a ballot occurred in May 1993; FUNCINPEC verified around 45 percent of the legitimate votes, winning 58 out of a sum of 120 parliamentary seats. The CPP would not perceive the decision results and grumbled of appointive extortion.
