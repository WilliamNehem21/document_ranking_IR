In 2001, Evangelical writer Richard Abanes, who has composed a few books contending against new religions and Mormonism, distributed a polemical content that influenced comparative charges to the video: "To harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick". Later releases consolidated correlations and differences between "Harry Potter" and the more unmistakably Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In a meeting with CBN.com, Abanes commented that, "One of the most effortless approaches to know whether a dream book or film has genuine world magick in it is to simply ask a basic inquiry, 'Can my tyke discover data in a library or book shop that will empower them to repeat what they are finding in the film or the book?' If you go to "The Chronicles of Narnia" and "The Lord of the Rings" what you find in, story enchantment and creative energy, it isn't genuine. You can't recreate it. In any case, in the event that you go to something like "Harry Potter", you can discover references to soothsaying, perceptiveness, and numerology. It brings seconds to go into a book shop or library and get books on that and begin examining it, exploring it, and doing it."
