Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) is a little oil board by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Presumably executed between c. 1438Ã¢ÂÂ 40, it portrays the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic church building. Mary is displayed as Queen of Heaven wearing a gem studded crown, supporting an energetic kid Christ who looks at her and holds the neck area of her red dress in a way that reviews the thirteenth century Byzantine custom of the Eleusa symbol ("Virgin of Tenderness"). Tracery in the curve at the back of the nave contains wooden carvings delineating scenes from Mary's life, while an artificial bois mold in a specialty demonstrates her holding the youngster in a comparable posture. Erwin Panofsky sees the work of art made as though the fundamental figures in the board are planned to be the models sprung up. In an entryway to one side, two holy messengers sing songs from a psalm book. Like other Byzantine delineations of the Madonna, van Eyck portrays an amazing Mary, unreasonably substantial contrasted with her environment. The board contains firmly watched light emissions flooding through the church building's windows. It lights up the inside before coming full circle in two pools on the floor. The light has representative importance, implying all the while to Mary's virginal virtue and God's ethereal nearness.
