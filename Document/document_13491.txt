The passing session was part into two one-hour sessions; the first was hung on Friday evening with the second hung on Saturday evening. The quickest time from either sessions tallied towards their last matrix position. Coulthard secured his fourth back to back shaft position, in his Williams, with a period of 1:14.013. He was joined on the first column by partner Hill, who was two-tenths of a second behind. Schumacher was third in the Benetton, edging nearer to the Williams drivers all through both long periods of qualifying by consistently diminishing the downforce on his vehicle. His last run, directly toward the second's end session, compelled Coulthard into leaving the pit path to cover the German. The shaft position man consequently utilized an extra arrangement of smooth tires, implying that out of the designation of seven arrangements of smooth tires as set out by the FIA, he had just two arrangements of fresh out of the box new elastic for the race, though Schumacher had the benefit of three arrangements of new elastic. Slope, worried about beginning from the messy side of the track (the side of the track that is inverse to the hustling line), had just two arrangements of fresh out of the box new tires for the race.
