From November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the Broadway musical "Cabaret" as Sally Bowles, taking over the role from Michelle Williams. Considering it to be "the most nerve-racking thing ever", Stone told the "Entertainment Weekly" magazine that she listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role. "Variety"s Marilyn Stasio was critical of her singing and found her performance "a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy." Both of Stone's 2015 filmsthe romantic comedy-drama "Aloha", and the mystery drama "Irrational Man"were critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics. In Cameron Crowe's "Aloha", she took on the role of an air force pilot alongside Bradley Cooper, and in the Woody Allen-directed "Irrational Man", she portrayed the romantic interest of Joaquin Phoenix's character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for whitewashing the cast, as Stone's character was meant to be of Asian, Hawaiian, and Swedish descent; Stone later regretted the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood. Despite the criticism, she was nominated for Choice Movie Actress â Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards. Stone would also in 2015 star in the music video for Win Butler's single "Anna"
