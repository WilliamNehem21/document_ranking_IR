The "Second Symphony", and "Livre pour orchestre" and the "Cello Concerto" which pursued, were created amid an especially horrible period in LutosÃÂawski's life. His mom kicked the bucket in 1967, and in 1967Ã¢ÂÂ 70 there was a lot of turmoil in Poland. This sprang first from the concealment of the theater generation "Dziady", which started a mid year of dissents; later, in 1968, the utilization of Polish troops to stifle the liberal changes in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the GdaÃÂsk Shipyards strike of 1970Ã¢ÂÂwhich prompted a savage clampdown by the experts, both caused noteworthy political and social pressure in Poland. LutosÃÂawski did not bolster the Soviet routine, and these occasions have been proposed as explanations behind the expansion in hostile impacts in his work, especially the "Cello Concerto" of 1968Ã¢ÂÂ 70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Surely, Rostropovich's very own resistance to the Soviet routine in Russia was simply reaching a crucial stage (he without further ado a short time later pronounced his help for the dissenter Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). LutosÃÂawski himself did not hold the view that such impacts directly affected his music, in spite of the fact that he recognized that they encroached on his inventive world somewhat. Regardless, the "Cello Concerto" was an extraordinary achievement, procuring both LutosÃÂawski and Rostropovich honors. At the work's premiÃÂ¨re with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss gave Rostropovich the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold award.
