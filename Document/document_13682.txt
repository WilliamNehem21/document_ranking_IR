While trying to beat this decrease in her vocation, Mukerji shed pounds and experienced a total makeover. In 2009, she teamed up for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on "Dil Bole Hadippa!", a lighthearted comedy inverse Shahid Kapoor. Mukerji had exclusive requirements from the film in which she played a cricket-fixated Punjabi town young lady taking on the appearance of a man; it was enormously advertised before discharge and had its reality debut at the Toronto International Film Festival. "The Economic Times" faultfinder Gaurav Malani was frustrated with the image and expressed, "Rani Mukherjee concocts a lively exhibition yet her fake wail cry whine do[es] not interest any longer. Likewise after a point you despise imagining the enchanting performing artist as the mustached male player." The film was Mukerji's fourth monetary disappointment in succession. At the point when interrogated regarding her ongoing spate of failures with the Yash Raj Films flag, she expressed, "A performer is here to act and pick extraordinary jobs and contents. I was getting incredible jobs from Yash Raj by then, jobs that any on-screen character would give an arm to do. I remain by those movies paying little mind to their destiny". Soon thereafter, she included as an ability judge for the Sony Entertainment Television unscripted TV drama "Move Premier League". She said that showing up on TV would make her "increasingly open" to the groups of onlookers and help her "gain perceivability" when she was "not doing an excessive number of movies". Mukerji did not show up in 2010.
