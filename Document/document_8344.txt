As per Article 109 of the constitution: "The King "authorizes" and "declares" laws". In Belgium, the regal consent is classified "endorse royale"/"koninklijke bekrachtiging" (Royal Sanction), and is conceded by the King marking the proposed rule. The Belgian constitution requires a hypothetically conceivable refusal of regal approval to be countersignedÃ¢ÂÂas some other demonstration of the rulerÃ¢ÂÂby a pastor capable before the House of Representatives. The ruler proclaims the law, implying that the person in question formally arranges that the law be authoritatively distributed and executed.

As per the Belgian constitution, upon the announcement of the sovereign's inadequacy, the Council of Ministers accepted the forces of the head of state until parliament could control on the King's insufficiency and name an official. The bill was then consented to by all individuals from the Council of Ministers "in the interest of the Belgian People". In a joint gathering, the two places of parliament announced the King equipped for practicing his forces again the following day.
