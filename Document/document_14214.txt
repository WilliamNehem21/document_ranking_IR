The club is related with two altogether different shading plansÃ¢ÂÂwhite and dark (first for all time embraced in 1920), and orange, naval force and white (first utilized in 1973, and worn by the group as of the 2015Ã¢ÂÂ 16 season). Luton for the most part wore a mix of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and dark shorts were first embraced. These hues were held for over 50 years, with the shade of the socks shifting among white and dark, until Luton changed to orange, naval force and white toward the beginning of the 1973Ã¢ÂÂ 74 season. Luton started playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and naval force theme decreased to trim; naval force shorts were embraced in 1984. This palette was held until the 1999Ã¢ÂÂ 2000 season, when the group played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton came back to white shirts and dark shorts; orange was incorporated as trim until 2007. The white, naval force and orange palette supported during the 1980s was brought in 2008, after the consequences of a club survey, yet after a year the hues were changed once more, this opportunity to an overwhelmingly orange strip with white shorts. Naval force shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, naval force shorts and white socks amid the 2015Ã¢ÂÂ 16 season.
