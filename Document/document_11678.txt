Wells Cathedral is an Anglican house of God in Wells, Somerset, England, committed to St Andrew the Apostle and seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, whose royal position or "cathedra" it holds as mother church of the bishopric. Worked somewhere in the range of 1175 and 1490 to supplant a prior chapel on the site since 705, it is decently measured for an English church building. Its expansive west front and extensive focal pinnacle are prevailing highlights in the city and field. It has been designated "undeniably a standout amongst the most lovely" and "most wonderful" of English houses of prayer. Its Gothic design is for the most part in the Early English style of the late 12thÃ¢ÂÂ mid thirteenth hundreds of years, coming up short on the Romanesque work that gets by in numerous different houses of prayer. Building started around 1175 at the east end with the choir. Student of history John Harvey considers it to be Europe's first genuinely Gothic structure, breaking with the last requirements of Romanesque. The stonework of its pointed arcades and fluted wharfs bears articulated moldings and cut capitals in a foliate, "solid leaf" style. Its Early English front with 300 etched figures, is depicted as a "preeminent triumph of the consolidated plastic expressions in England". The east end holds an uncommon measure of antiquated recolored glass. In contrast to numerous houses of God of devout establishment, Wells has many enduring mainstream structures connected to its part of common ordinances, including the Bishop's Palace and the fifteenth century private Vicars' Close. The house of prayer is a Grade I recorded structure.
