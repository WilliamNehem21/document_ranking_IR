"Riven"s story proceeds with where "Myst" and its friend novel, "The Book of Atrus", left off. The player accept the job of the Stranger, the hero of the primary diversion and companion of Atrus (Rand Miller). Atrus knows the antiquated craft of making "connecting books", uncommonly composed books that fill in as gateways to different universes known as "Ages". Atrus needs the Stranger's assistance to free his better half, Catherine (Sheila Goold; voice by Rengin Altay), who is held prisoner in her home Age of Riven, which is gradually crumbling. Her captor is Gehn (John Keston), Atrus' manipulative dad and self-proclaimed leader of Riven. Thirty years sooner, Atrus and Catherine caught Gehn on Riven by expelling the majority of the connecting books that drove out of the Age; the absolute last book to be evacuated, connecting to the Age of Myst, was the one they held to escape Riven. In the conviction that it would be decimated, they let the book fall into the Star Fissure, a fracture driving out of the harmed Age of Riven into a baffling, space-like void. Catherine was later deceived into coming back to Riven by her children, Sirrus and Achenar, whereupon she was kidnapped by Gehn. In the end, the player found the safe Myst book, prompting the occasions in "Myst".
