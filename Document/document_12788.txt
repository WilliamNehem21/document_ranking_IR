Subsequent to going through Delphi, the warrior acquired the venomous blood of a cerberus. In the end, both Circe and the warrior experienced the general, who was uncovered to be the warrior's uncle. The general uncovered that he murdered the warrior's dad since he would not join the general. Circe was then uncovered to be the general's sweetheart who had just supported the warrior so he would achieve the general, who intended to offer the warrior an opportunity to serve him in his warmongering victories. The warrior can't, and Circe offered him with a decision; to serve the general and his men would be saved from Circe's fury, or to murder the general and his men will kick the bucket. The Giver, who pursued the two, reminded the warrior that if he somehow managed to execute the general, who was an individual from his family, the pledge he made to his dad would be broken, yet in the event that he slaughtered Circe, his men would die and the promise he made to secure his men would be broken. The warrior announced that he would not kill Circe and protected the lives of his men. Be that as it may, he deceived the general into drinking from a glass he had subtly loaded up with the cerberus' blood, which executed the general. Circe was dismayed at the warrior's wrathful demonstration and withdrew. Since the warrior slaughtered his very own uncle, the promise he made to his dad was broken. The Giver uncovered himself to be Orkos, the pledge manager of the Furies and the warrior was detained by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned.
