On July 3, Hancock proceeded in his situation on Cemetery Ridge and along these lines endured the worst part of Pickett's Charge. Amid the enormous Confederate ordnance siege that went before the infantry attack, Hancock was unmistakable on horseback in assessing and empowering his troops. When one of his subordinates challenged, "General, the corps officer should not to chance his life that way," Hancock is said to have answered, "There are times when a corps administrator's life does not tally." During the infantry ambush, his old companion, presently Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead, driving a detachment in Maj. Gen. George Pickett's division, was injured and passed on two days after the fact. Hancock couldn't meet with his companion since he had recently been injured himself, an extreme injury brought about by a projectile striking the handle of his seat, entering his internal right thigh alongside wood parts and an expansive twisted nail. Aided from his pony by helpers, and with a tourniquet connected to staunch the dying, he evacuated the seat nail himself and, mixing up its source, commented wryly, "They should be hard up for ammo when they toss such shot as that." News of Armistead's human injuring was conveyed to Hancock by an individual from his staff, Captain Henry H. Bingham. Regardless of his torment, Hancock denied clearing to the back until the fight was settled. He had been a motivation for his troops all through the three-day fight. Hancock later got the thanks of the U.S. Congress for "...ÃÂ his heroic, commendable and obvious offer in that incredible and definitive triumph."
