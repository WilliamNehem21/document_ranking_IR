Wrigley's advancement to acting air bad habit marshal was declared in May 1941, making him just the third individual from the RAAFÃ¢ÂÂafter Richard Williams and Stanley GobleÃ¢ÂÂto achieve this position. In September 1942, he was presented on London to take over from Frank McNamara as AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters. For a period, he was engaged with a pull of-war with Air Marshal Williams over exactly who was in control. Williams, who told Overseas Headquarters at its beginning in December 1941, with McNamara as his appointee, had thusly been delegated as the RAAF's agent to Washington, DC, leaving McNamara responsible for the London office until Wrigley arrived. The Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, was supportive of Williams telling the RAAF workplaces in both the US and UK while Wrigley represented him in London, in spite of Wrigley having been named AOC. Wrigley's journal recorded that when Williams came back to London in October 1942 to go to a gathering, he started "tossing his weight around" and "fascinating to have himself made AOC, and potentially AOCÃÂ inÃÂ C [Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief] of all RAAF units and work force outside Australia and the SW Pacific". Despite the fact that Williams left England in January 1943, the issue was just completely let go in mid-1943, when the CAS, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, prompted Williams that it was unfeasible for him to direction workplaces in both Washington and London.
