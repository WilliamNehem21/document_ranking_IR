In 2005, scientist Paul Barrett brought up that the lamella-like structures of "Gallimimus" did not seem to have been adaptable fibers like those of channel bolstering feathered creatures (as there is no sign of these structures covering or being fell), however were rather increasingly similar to the slight, routinely separated vertical edges in the bills of turtles and hadrosaurid dinosaurs. In these creatures, such edges are believed to be related with herbivorous weight control plans, used to edit extreme vegetation. Barrett proposed that the edges in the bill of "Gallimimus" spoke to a characteristic cast of the inward surface of the snout, showing that the creature was a herbivore that benefited from material high in fiber. The disclosure of numerous gastroliths (gizzard stones) in certain ornithomimids show the nearness of a gastric plant, and in this way point towards a herbivorous eating routine, as these are utilized to pound sustenance of creatures that come up short on the fundamental biting mechanical assembly. Barrett likewise determined that a "Gallimimus" would have required between of nourishment every day, contingent upon whether it had an endothermic or an ectothermic ("warm" or "unfeeling) digestion, an admission which he observed to be unfeasible in the event that it was a channel feeder. He additionally discovered that ornithomimids were inexhaustible in arrangements that spoken to mesic conditions, yet additionally in dry situations where there would be inadequate water to continue an eating routine dependent on channel encouraging. In 2007, scientist Espen M. Knutsen composed that the nose state of ornithomimids, when contrasted with those of present day flying creatures, was steady with omnivory or high-fiber herbivory.
