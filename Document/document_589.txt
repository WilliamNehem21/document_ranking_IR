Finishing his visit with No.ÃÂ 78 Wing in mid-1954, Eaton joined Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch on a worldwide mission to look at potential new contender, plane, transport and preparing airplane for the RAAF. The group's report upheld the F-104 Starfighter as a swap for the CAC Saber, just as atomic skilled British V-plane strike airplane to enlarge Australia's Canberra aircraft, and C-130 Hercules transports to supplant the C-47 Dakota. While the recommendations for V-planes and the F-104 were not taken up, the Australian Government gained the C-130 out of 1958. Portrayed as second just to the General Dynamics F-111C as the "most huge" buy by the RAAF, the Hercules gave the Air Force its first key carrier capacity, which in years to come would give a "help" to Australian powers sent to Malaya, Vietnam, and different pieces of the South-West Pacific. The mission likewise suggested the privately fabricated Vampire T35 as a fly coach for No.ÃÂ 1 Applied Flying Training School; sixty-nine were later conveyed by the de Havilland plant in Bankstown, New South Wales. Eaton filled in as RAAF Director of Operations amid 1955Ã¢ÂÂ 56, and as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Williamtown and Commandant of the co-found School of Land-Air Warfare from March 1957 until February 1959. He was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1959 Queen's Birthday Honors.
