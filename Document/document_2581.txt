Whatever the reason that Renaissance style never wound up prevalent in Sicily, it was surely not obliviousness. Antonello Gagini was halfway through developing the congregation of Santa Maria di Porto Salvo in 1536 in the Renaissance style when he kicked the bucket; he was supplanted by the modeler Antonio Scaglione, who finished the structure in a Norman style. This style appears to have impacted Sicilian engineering nearly up to the season of the 1693 tremor. Indeed, even Mannerism cruised the island by. Just in the engineering of Messina could a Renaissance impact be recognized, incompletely for topographical reasons: inside sight of terrain Italy and the most essential port in Sicily, Messina was in every case increasingly managable to the overall tides of style outside the island. The town's privileged benefactors would frequently approach Florence or Rome to furnish them with a modeler; one precedent was the Florentine Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, who set up the Tuscan styles of engineering and figure there in the mid-sixteenth century. Be that as it may, these impacts remained to a great extent limited to Messina and the encompassing area. It appears to be likely that it was the support of the Roman Catholic Church, expelled from the impacts of Roman style, that stayed traditionalist in design taste.
