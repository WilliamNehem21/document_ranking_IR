Richardson turned down the job of Estragon in Peter Hall's debut of the English language form of Samuel Beckett's "Hanging tight for Godot" in 1955 and later censured himself for passing up on the opportunity to be in "the best play of my age". He had counseled Gielgud, who expelled the piece as garbage, and even in the wake of talking about the play with the creator, Richardson couldn't comprehend the play or the character. Richardson's "Timon of Athens" in his 1956 come back to the Old Vic was generally welcomed, just like his Broadway appearance in "The Waltz of the Toreadors" for which he was designated for a Tony Award in 1957. He finished up the 1950s with two differentiating West End triumphs, Robert Bolt's "Blossoming Cherry", and Graham Greene's "The Complaisant Lover". The previous, a miserable piece about a fizzled and betrayed protection supervisor, kept running for 435 exhibitions in 1957Ã¢ÂÂ 58; Richardson co-featured with three driving women in progression: Celia Johnson, Wendy Hiller and his significant other. Greene's parody was an unexpected hit, running for 402 exhibitions from June 1959. All through practices the cast treated the adoration triangle subject as one of misery, and were amazed to wind up playing to nonstop giggling. Amid the run, Richardson worked by day on another Greene work, the film "Our Man in Havana". Alec Guinness, who assumed the primary job, noticed "the article exercise in upstaging in the last scene among Richardson and NoÃÂ«l Coward", loyally caught by the chief, Carol Reed.
