Endeavors to date it have experienced comparative movements of feeling. In the nineteenth century the board was accepted to be an early work by Jan finished as right on time as c. 1410, in spite of the fact that this view changed as grant advanced. In the mid twentieth century, Ludwig von Baldass set it around 1424Ã¢ÂÂ 29, at that point for an extensive stretch it was viewed as starting from the mid 1430s. Erwin Panofsky gave the primary point by point treatise on the work and put it around 1432Ã¢ÂÂ 34. Be that as it may, following examination from Meyer Schapiro, he amended his supposition to the late 1430s in the 1953 release of his "Initial Netherlandish Painting". A 1970s similar investigation of van Eyck's 1437 "Holy person Barbara" presumed that "Madonna in the Church" was finished after c. 1437. During the 1990s, Otto PÃÂ¤cht made a decision about the work as presumably a late van Eyck, given the comparative treatment of an inside in the 1434 "Arnolfini Portrait". In the mid 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand put it somewhere in the range of 1426 and 1428, guaranteeing it as maybe the soonest surviving marked work affirmed as by Jan.
