Seacology was established in 1991 by ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox in Hawaii utilizing prize cash and counseling expenses coming about because of his endeavors to protect of rainforest outside the town of Falealupo on the island of Savai'i in Samoa. He later recorded these occasions in his book, "Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest". Cox started his work in Samoa in 1973 amid his first Mormon teacher administration, at which time he gained from nearby individuals about the therapeutic properties of the local plants. In the wake of working with neighborhood networks in different rainforests, Cox came back to Samoa in 1984 with his family. His point was to discover a solution for disease, which had killed his mom before that year. As an end-result of the assistance of the neighborhood healers (called "fofo"), Cox offered to share the income produced by his examination with the nearby towns. After some time, his exploration distinguished five new medications, including the helpful operator prostratin, a potential treatment for HIV. Prostratin was confined in a creation produced using the bark of the nearby mamala tree ("Homalanthus nutans") and imparted to him by a healer named Epenesa Mauigoa, who utilized it to treat hepatitis. Cox set up sovereignty understandings to guarantee that the Samoans will partake in the income.
