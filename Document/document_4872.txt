The magazine was not productive, and since Moorcock had not framed an organization to distribute it, he was by and by in charge of its expenses. To get money he had been composing dream books at a fast rate since mid 1968, and from mid 1969 the article work was given to different others, basically Charles Platt and Langdon Jones.

Moorcock endeavored to regroup by diminishing the quantity of pages in each issue, and in light of the fact that he was again compelled to compose as much as he could to win enough to pay "New Worlds"s charges, he turned over practically all article obligations to Charles Platt, however others required with the magazine likewise alternated at the publication work throughout the following couple of issues. Moorcock was ÃÂ£3,000 owing debtors, and in blend with the Arts Council's choice not to recharge their allow he wound up with no alternative however to stop distribution on a month to month plan and orchestrate a quarterly calendar in soft cover design distributed by Sphere. The April 1970 issue, the 200th, was the last that went out to the merchants; one more issue was arranged and presented on endorsers as the 'Exceptional Good Taste Issue' the next March.
