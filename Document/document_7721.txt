Inferences to legitimate issues in "To Kill a Mockingbird", especially in scenes outside of the court, have drawn the consideration of lawful researchers. Claudia Durst Johnson composes that "a more noteworthy volume of basic readings has been amassed by two lawful researchers in law diaries than by all the artistic researchers in scholarly diaries". The opening statement by the nineteenth century writer Charles Lamb peruses: "Attorneys, I assume, were kids once." Johnson takes note of that even in Scout and Jem's youth world, bargains and arrangements are hit with one another by spitting on one's palm, and laws are talked about by Atticus and his kids: is it right that Bob Ewell chases and traps out of season? Numerous social codes are broken by individuals in representative courts: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been banished by society for accepting a dark lady as his custom-based law spouse and having interracial kids; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her dad in discipline for kissing Tom Robinson; by being transformed into a non-individual, Boo Radley gets a discipline far more prominent than any court could have given him. Scout more than once infringes upon codes and laws and responds to her discipline for them. For instance, she will not wear frilly garments, saying that Aunt Alexandra's "obsessive" endeavors to put her in them made her vibe "a pink cotton prison surrounding [her]". Johnson states, "[t]he novel is an investigation of how Jem and Scout start to see the multifaceted nature of social codes and how the setup of connections managed by or set off by those codes falls flat or sustains the occupants of (their) little universes."
