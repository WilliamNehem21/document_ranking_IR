In 2004, scientist Sankar Chatterjee and specialist R. Jack Templin said that littler pterosaurs may have had the capacity to skim-feed. They questioned this was feasible for bigger ones, because of their lesser mobility and flying ability while opposing water. Chatterjee and Templin noticed that skimmers have blunter mouths than pterosaurs like "Thalassodromeus", to coordinate water from the jaw while skimming. In 2007, biophysicist Stuart Humphries and partners addressed whether any pterosaurs would have regularly nourished by skimming and said that such ends had been founded on anatomical correlations as opposed to biomechanical information. The drag experienced by feathered creature bills and pterosaur jaws was hydrodynamically and efficiently tried by making model bills of the dark skimmer, "Thalassodromeus", and the (apparently) non-skimming "Tupuxuara" and towing them along a water-filled trough at different paces. The specialists found that skimming was more vitality exorbitant for skimmers than recently suspected, and skimming would have been unthinkable for a pterosaur gauging more than because of the metabolic power required. They found that much littler pterosaurs, as "Rhamphorhynchus", were not adjusted for skimming. The aluminum gear of the "Thalassodromeus" demonstrate was devastated amid the trial, because of the high and shaky powers applied on it while rapid skimming, providing reason to feel ambiguous about further this encouraging strategy. The creators utilized the jaw tip of "T. oberlii" to show the execution of "Thalassodromeus", since it was allocated to "T. sethi" at the time.
