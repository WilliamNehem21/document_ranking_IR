The fight opened with the Norman bowmen shooting tough at the English shield divider, to little impact. The tough point implied that the bolts either ricocheted off the shields of the English or overshot their objectives and flew over the highest point of the slope. The absence of English toxophilite hampered the Norman bowmen, as there were not many English bolts to be gotten together and reused. After the assault from the toxophilite, William sent the spearmen forward to assault the English. They were met with a torrent of rockets, not bolts but rather lances, tomahawks and stones. The infantry was unfit to drive openings in the shield divider, and the rangers progressed in help. The mounted force likewise neglected to make progress, and a general retreat started, accused on the Breton division to William's left side. Gossip began that the duke had been slaughtered, which added to the perplexity. The English powers started to seek after the escaping trespassers, however William rode through his powers, demonstrating his face and hollering that he was as yet alive. The duke at that point drove a counter-assault against the seeking after English powers; a portion of the English mobilized on a hillock before being overpowered.
