Informal patches have been made by the diversion's fans to address "Bloodlines" specialized issues, and reestablish absent and fragmented substance. In the wake of encountering issues with the primary variants of an informal fix made by Dan Upright, expository physicist Werner Spahl kept fixing the diversion from adaptation 1.2 with consent and directions. The amusement network tried Spahl's patches, giving reports on bugs and spelling mistakes. In spite of the fact that the amusement's multifaceted nature implied that fixing one viewpoint frequently broke another, as work on the patches advanced Spahl started reestablishing expelled and deficient substance in the diversion documents, including journeys, things, weapons, and characters, with fan help to give voice acting, models, and restoring entire dimensions. Spahl reached previous Troika staff for knowledge into their expectations for cut substance. A library zone, for instance, was reestablished after Mitsoda revealed to Spahl just that "it was some way or another associated with a primary character and a Sabbat supervisor, and was intended to resemble this present reality [Los Angeles] library." A fan ventured out to the genuine library to accumulate notes on its format, and co-built up the in-amusement zone with Spahl. Schaffer likewise furnished Spahl with unreleased scores from the diversion. The progressions changed the first diversion so much that Spahl was scrutinized by a portion of the amusement's fans. This brought about two fix forms: an essential variant, fixing the diversion's specialized issues, and an "or more" rendition with the extra substance. Starting at 2016, the amusement has more than 10 years of post-discharge support with the arrival of forms 9.x of the fix, which are likewise incorporated into the rendition of the diversion sold on the GOG.com dispersion administration.
