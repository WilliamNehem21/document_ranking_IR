The largest skulls of "Paraceratherium" are around long, at the back of the skull, and wide across by the zygomatic arches. "Paraceratherium" had a long forehead, which was smooth and lacked the roughened area that serves as attachment point for the horns of other rhinoceroses. The bones above the nasal region are long and the nasal incision goes far into the skull. This indicates that "Paraceratherium" had a prehensile upper lip similar to that of the black rhinoceros and the Indian rhinoceros, or a short proboscis (trunk) as in tapirs. The back of the skull was low and narrow, without the large lambdoid crests at the top and along the sagittal crest, which are otherwise found in horned and tusked animals that need strong muscles to push and fight. It also had a deep pit for the attachment of nuchal ligaments, which hold up the skull automatically. The occipital condyle was very wide and "Paraceratherium" appears to have had large, strong neck muscles, which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches. One skull of "P. transouralicum" has a domed forehead, whereas others have flat foreheads, possibly because of sexual dimorphism. A brain endocast of "P. transouralicum" shows it was only 8 percent of the skull length, while the brain of the Indian rhinoceros is 17.7 percent of its skull length.
