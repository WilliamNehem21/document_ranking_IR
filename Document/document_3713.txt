In the wake of leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante kept on composing and record solo material. He had been doing as such since the age of nine, yet had never thought to be discharging his material to people in general. That was until a few of his companionsÃ¢ÂÂincluding Johnny Depp, Perry Farrell, Gibby Haynes and previous Red Hot Chili Peppers band mate FleaÃ¢ÂÂurged him to discharge the material he wrote in his extra time amid the "Glucose Sex Magik" sessions. Frusciante started taking a shot at finished editions of the melodies he had been composing, and creating them at his home in mid-1992. The creation procedure, notwithstanding, moved toward becoming hampered by his inexorably serious dependence on heroin. "Typically Just a T-Shirt" was recorded as per the pattern in which it shows up, with the last tracks being recorded presently before Frusciante's takeoff from the Chili Peppers. Frusciante's utilization of heroin and cocaine turned out to be progressively outrageous amid the last phases of account in late 1993; he started seeing medications as the best way to "ensure you keep in contact with excellence as opposed to giving the grotesqueness of the world a chance to degenerate your spirit."
