Amid Kratos' ten years of administration to the Olympian Gods, he is sent to the city of Attica to help protect it from the attacking Persian armed force. After effectively executing the Persian King, devastating his military and killing their pet basilisk, Kratos watches the Sun tumble from the sky, diving the world into murkiness. As he battles his way through the city of Marathon, the Spartan observers the dark mist of the Olympian Morpheus spread the land. He hears a frightful woodwind song, which he perceives as a tune once played by his expired girl Calliope. Finding the Temple of Helios, Kratos is entrusted by Athena to locate the missing Sun God, as Morpheus has made huge numbers of the divine beings fall into a profound sleep without light. The Spartan in the long run finds Helios' sister, Eos, who reveals to Kratos that the Titan Atlas has stole her sibling. Eos encourages Kratos to look for the Primordial Fires, which he uses to stir the flame steeds of Helios. The steeds take the Spartan to the Underworld, where he has two experiences with Charon at the River Styx. In spite of the fact that Charon at first thrashings Kratos and expels him to Tartarus, the Spartan returns and annihilates the ferryman.
