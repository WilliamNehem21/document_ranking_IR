Forest exploited his place in Chicago's beginning revolution by winning nine back to back choices to begin his season and by not losing a diversion until a challenge against the Yankees, which he lost as the aftereffect of a shy away. At the time, Grove turned into the second individual from the White Sox to win nine back to back choices to begin a season. The primary pitcher to win nine straight diversions for the group was Lefty Williams in 1917, and the just a single to do it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove almost ended up one of only a handful couple of pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In an amusement against the Yankees, he was one out far from pitching a no-hitter when Joe Gordon came fixing to make something happen. Gordon hit a twofold to left handle that was reasonable by inches, finishing Grove's nearest offered for a Major League no-hitter. Woods completed the season with profession bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete recreations (18). He drove the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, total recreations, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the most youthful pitcher in the group's staff. Woods' own life improved alongside his vocation. On January 8, 1944, he wedded Catherine Sloan, hosting met her at a gathering tossed for the White Sox by her dad, Francis Sloan, eighteen months sooner.
