In the early morning on September 29, the focal point of the sea tempest made landfall on Cedar Key, Florida, with a base focal weight of , and moved inland crosswise over Levy County. The violent wind had a surprisingly tight center, with a range of most extreme breeze, and was going at a quick pace of about . Thus, its evaluated greatest breezes of 125ÃÂ mph (205ÃÂ km/h) were higher than weight alone would recommend. The little however extraordinary sea tempest proceeded with northeastward through northern Florida and southeastern Georgia, and its center contracted further; outside of a tight passageway along the tempest's track, winds were similarly light. At Savannah, Georgia, pneumatic stress fell 15ÃÂ hPa (0.45ÃÂ inHg) in 45 minutes as the tempest focus passed just toward the west around noontime on September 29. The framework debilitated as it sped northward through the Carolinas, however when it achieved the Mid-Atlantic states on the night of September 29, its inexorably quick forward development added to recharged wind viciousness. A band of substantial downpour was seen along and west of the tempest's track from northern North Carolina to southern Pennsylvania, with the heaviest aggregates surpassing . As the tempest progressed into an extratropical twister by right off the bat September 30, its envelope of harming winds extended. The extratropical framework passed west of Washington, D.C., and advanced into focal Pennsylvania, scattering close to the Southern Tier of New York. Its leftovers proceeded into the St. Lawrence Valley, where they converged with another low weight territory.
