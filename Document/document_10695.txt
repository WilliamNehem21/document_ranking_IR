Steve Cotterill was drafted in as Thordarson's substitution before the beginning of the 2002Ã¢ÂÂ 03 season. Cotterill quit in October 2002, after just four months in control, to play the job of Howard Wilkinson's colleague at Sunderland. The club were near divulging George Burley as their new supervisor after Cotterill's flight; be that as it may, a very late charge of heart drove the previous Ipswich director to decay the club's offer. The club acted quickly and Tony Pulis was delegated as Stoke's new chief right away a while later. Pulis avoided assignment with a 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 success over Reading on the last day of the period that kept the club in the First Division. The club's situation in the class was combined in 2003Ã¢ÂÂ 04. Pulis was sacked toward the finish of the 2004Ã¢ÂÂ 05 season, following a difference among himself and the club's proprietors. Dutch chief Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005, just multi day after Pulis was sacked. Boskamp broke the club's move record in marking Sambegou Bangoura for a charge in the district of ÃÂ£1m. Another noteworthy expansion was the marking of Belgium global Carl Hoefkens, who in this manner won the Fans' Player of the Year Award for the 2005Ã¢ÂÂ 06 season. Regardless of his spending on new players, Boskamp's side was conflicting and just a mid-table completion was accomplished. The season was defaced by a fight among Boskamp and the club's chief of football, John Rudge, which heightened to the point where Boskamp took steps to stop. Boskamp left toward the finish of the 2005Ã¢ÂÂ 06 season, in the midst of a takeover by previous director Peter Coates.
