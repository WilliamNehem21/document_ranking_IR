Schmittou had originally been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the Sounds as a Triple-A team, but he refused to go back on his previous promise to partner with the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. Under Manager of the Year Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds finished the first half of the season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks with a 46â25 record. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place Montgomery Rebels, at 51â21. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni, All-Star outfielder and league MVP, led the league with 101Â runs, 34Â home runs, 122Â RBI, and 288Â total bases. Andy McGaffigan was selected as the circuit's top pitcher after he led the league with a 2.38Â ERA. The Sounds also set a league attendance record, which still stands as of the completion of the 2018 season, when a total of 575,676Â fans visited Greer Stadium. Their 97â46 record is the team's all-time best. The 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians in 2001.
