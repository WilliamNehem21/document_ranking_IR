After its disclosure, the Emesa head protector experienced a few ineffective rebuilding efforts. The essential issue was the oxidization of the iron center, which made rankles and breaks in the silver covering. Following revelation, the cap was sent to Paris for reclamation by "MM. AndrÃÂ© pÃÂ¨re et fils"; just light work was completed because of the expectation that the Syrian atmosphere would help moderate the rate of oxidization, and because of constrained assets, yet the head protector kept on falling apart. By 1952, the protective cap was depicted as being fundamentally more harmed than it had been when unearthed, and in critical need of further work. It was in the end taken to the British Museum, where a last rebuilding was done in 1955. This was finished by Herbert Maryon, who, in 1946, had reproduced the Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo head protector. In 1956, a record of the procedure was distributed by Harold Plenderleith, manager of the exhibition hall's exploration lab. Examination observed the silver to be weak, with breaks that had been filled in by a dull halting substance. The iron behind the face veil had rusted, putting further weight on the silver and constraining the airs out by as much as .
