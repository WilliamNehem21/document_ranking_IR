In 2009, Kapoor worked with nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar on "Don't Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight", a book which concentrated on the standards of good dieting propensities. Distributed by Random House Publications, the book was generally welcomed by faultfinders, and sold 10,000 duplicates inside its initial twenty days. A subsequent titled, "Ladies and The Weight Loss Tamasha", was discharged two years after the fact. It tended to the weight reduction concerns and dietary patterns of ladies in different pieces of their life, and included Kapoor in a voice-over for the book recording. In February 2013, Kapoor discharged her personal journal: "The Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva". Co-composed close by Rochelle Pinto, it turned into the principal book to be propelled under the Shobhaa De engraving of Penguin BooksÃ¢ÂÂa lot of arrangement that included superstar journals, aides and memoirs. In a survey distributed by "Mint", Shefalee Vasudev reprimanded the composition style as "excessively blustery" yet further expressed that it is "a very much delivered book, repeating chirpy little post-it notes and diet outlines, punctuated with Bebo's staggering pictures from her private collections to mold magazine covers." Later that year, she worked together with Diwekar for the third time on "The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right", a narrative film about nourishment.
