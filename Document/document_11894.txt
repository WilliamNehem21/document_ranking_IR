"Brisco" was scrutinized right off the bat for the savagery it depicted; intended to be clever, a scene in the pilot in which four scoundrels inadvertently slaughter each other in a crossfire grieved commentators. Cuse demanded that the show was as yet proper for youngsters, saying, "I believe we're aware of viciousness and I think we've attempted to stay away from brutality in the pilot and later on scenes". Part of the way through the season, U.S. Congressperson Byron Dorgan singled out "Brisco" as the most rough show on TV dependent on an investigation at Minnesota's Concordia University, in which understudies viewed 132 hours of system and link programming, amid the seven day stretch of September 28 to October 4, 1993. The understudies counted each demonstration of brutality, and found that "Brisco" had 117 vicious acts for every hour. The investigation regarded "Brisco" more fierce than the film "Beverly Hills Cop", which was additionally seen for the examination. Cuse called the analysis "plainly strange", noticing that just a single scene of the show was seen, in which a fight happens. Each punch and hit was considered a demonstration of viciousness. Cuse stood in opposition to enactment to control TV brutality, saying that lawmakers were "pursuing a bogus goal". He said it was the activity of a show's maker to control the ethical substance of a TV program and the guardians' obligation to screen what their kids watch.
