Veldmeijer and associates allocated the front piece of a mandible gathered from a similar development to "T. sethi" in 2005. They presumed that in spite of the fact that the two examples contrasted in a few subtleties, the distinctions were not sufficiently huge to put together another species with respect to the mandible, and that the new example filled in the hole of Kellner and Campos' "T. sethi" skull remaking. Scientistss Jaime A. Headden and Herbert B. N. Campos authored the new binomial "Banguela oberlii", in light of their reinterpretation of the jaw tip as having a place with a toothless individual from the family Dsungaripteridae, in 2014. The conventional name is Portuguese for "toothless" and the particular name praises private gatherer Urs Oberli, who had given the example to the Naturmuseum St. Gallen (where it is listed as NMSG SAO 25109). Headden and Campos deciphered the tip of "T. sethi" lower jaw as downturned; this and different highlights recognized it from "Banguela". In their 2018 re-depiction of the further-readied "T. sethi" holotype skull, scientistss Rodrigo V. PÃÂªgas, Fabiana R. Costa, and Kellner allocated "B. oberlii" back to "Thalassodromeus" while remembering it as a particular animal varieties, and in this manner made the new mix "T. oberlii". PÃÂªgas and associates likewise dismissed the hypothesis that the lower jaw of "T. sethi" was downturned, and reinterpreted the frontmost bit of the lower jaw to have associated legitimately with the consequent piece (with no hole).
