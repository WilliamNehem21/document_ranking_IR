In the 1999Ã¢ÂÂ 2000 season, Duncan further solidified his notoriety. He found the middle value of 23.2 focuses, 12.4 bounce back, 3.2 helps and 2.2 squares per amusement, earned another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-ups, and was co-MVP with Shaquille O'Neal of the NBA All-Star Game. In any case, the Spurs had a disillusioning post-season. Duncan harmed his meniscus without further ado before the finish of the ordinary season and was unfit to play in even one post-season amusement. Thus, the Spurs were wiped out in the first round of the 2000 NBA Playoffs, losing 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1 to the Phoenix Suns. Regardless, Duncan bounced back in the following season, and with solid ordinary season midpoints of 22.2 focuses, 12.2 bounce back, 3.0 helps and 2.3 squares, earned himself one more pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups. In the 2001 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs dispensed with the Timberwolves 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1, vanquished the Dallas Mavericks 4Ã¢ÂÂ 1, yet then bowed out against the Lakers driven by hotshots Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, losing in four straight diversions. "Sports Illustrated" portrayed the arrangement as a "[m]erciless confuse", and Duncan was scrutinized as "quiet when the Spurs need him most".
