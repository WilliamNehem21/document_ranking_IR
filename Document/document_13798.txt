Albeit red-followed dark cockatoos feed on a wide assortment of local and presented grains, the pillar of their eating regimen is eucalyptus seeds. There is a particular connection between the species and bigger fruited types of gums. These fluctuate crosswise over Australia yet incorporate the marri in Southwest Western Australia, Darwin woolybutt "E. miniata" over the north of the nation, "E. baxteri" in Victoria and the bloodwood species "Corymbia polycarpa" and "C. intermedia" in Queensland. Cockatoos gnaw off branchlets with bunches of seed containers, at that point hold them with their feet while biting and collecting seeds before littering the ground with flotsam and jetsam. Among different seeds and nuts expended are those of "Acacia", "Allocasuarina", "Banksia", "Grevillea" and "Hakea", just as berries, foods grown from the ground creepy crawlies. Cockatoos have adjusted to eating some presented plants, for example, the doublegee ("Emex australis"). There is some proof of utilization of wild radish ("Raphanus raphanistrum"), wild turnip ("Brassica tournefortii") and melon ("Citrullus" or "Cucumis"). Red-followed dark cockatoos have been involved as rural irritations of nut and different yields at Lakeland Downs in Far North Queensland. Here the cockatoos, in herds of up to a few hundred flying creatures, have figured out how to separate the nut plants over the ground level before hauling the peanuts out of the ground by their stems and shelling them. They likewise harm electrical links on turn irrigators.
