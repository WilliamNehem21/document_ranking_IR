Amid the tenth to eighth centuries BCE, the San Juan Basin was involved by Paleo-Indians known as the Clovis culture () and the Folsom convention (8,500 to 7,500). Shot focuses found in the region of Chaco Canyon propose that seekers may have been dynamic in the district as ahead of schedule as 10,000. By 6,000 the Picosa culture had created from inside the Paleolithic populace, as natural changes made the eastbound development of creatures and individuals the Southern Plains, bringing Southwestern and northern Mexican societies into the San Juan Basin. Cynthia Irwin-Williams suggested that the primary human nearness in Chaco Canyon dates to a seeker gatherer society that she named the Oshara Tradition, which created inside the nearby Archaic () Picosa populace. The Oshara involved bits of northwestern New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and focal and southwestern Colorado. They reaped jackrabbits in the bowl as ahead of schedule as 5500. Irwin-Williams isolated the Oshara Tradition into six stages, and amid the Armijo stage (1800 to 800) the Arroyo Cuervo zone east of Chaco Canyon saw the presentation of maize and the utilization of shake covers. She theorized that this period saw the start of regular get-togethers of individuals from around the San Juan Basin, who in the end started to total into bigger social units.
