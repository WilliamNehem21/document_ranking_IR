"Temeraire" features in a number of paintings and prints, the earliest commemorating her role in the battle of Trafalgar. She can be seen at least partially in paintings of the battle by Clarkson Frederick Stanfield, John Christian Schetky, Nicholas Pocock, Thomas Buttersworth and Thomas Whitcombe. A fictionalised depiction of her launch was produced by Philip Burgoyne. Later representations of the retired "Temeraire" were also popular. Though no known contemporary image of her in the prison ship role exists, she was painted while a guardship on the Medway in 1833 by Edward William Cooke, and by William Beatson and J. J. Williams while laid up at Rotherhithe in 1838. More recently she has been the subject of paintings by Geoff Hunt. The most famous painting of "Temeraire" was made by J. M. W. Turner and titled "The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838". Turner depicts "Temeraire" on her last voyage, towed up the Thames by a small black steam tug as the sun sets (or dawns). In choosing his title Turner created an enduring appellation, as previously she had been known to her crew as the "saucy" "Temeraire". Turner presented it for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1839 with an accompanying excerpt, slightly altered, of Thomas Campbell's poem "Ye Mariners of England". The flag which braved the battle and the breeze,<br>no longer owns her.
