In 1918, when Wisconsin initially numbered its highway system, the route of what later became USÂ 141 followed two separate state highways: WISÂ 17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WISÂ 16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became USÂ 141 in Wisconsin were numbered WISÂ 15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WISÂ 38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the state did not have a highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WISÂ 69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WISÂ 38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WISÂ 17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WISÂ 17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WISÂ 57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WISÂ 57 at the state line.
