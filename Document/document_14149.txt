The general population in the closet are awkward, not least due to John's smell. Geraldine goes around mints as Andrew discloses to Mark that he never again has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the "sardine tune", yet Carl irately stops him. Andrew and Geraldine think back about a scout celebration held in the house numerous years prior, however Geraldine recollects that a kid named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed "Little Pip", said Andrew did "awful things", and that the police were included. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by guaranteeing he didn't do anything to Pip and was just showing him how to wash himself. Carl suggests that he and John were not as fortunate as Pip, and John says he can smell carbolic cleanser. There is quiet, and Stuart calls attention to nobody else is searching for them, yet they understand Ian has not yet come back from the washroom. Jeremy says Ian is the individual he was going to get from the station, however when Mark claims Ian is as of now at the gathering, Jeremy uncovers the individual Mark is alluding to isn't Ian. Outside, "Ian" locks the closet and showers it with lighter liquid while singing the sardine melody. Carl acknowledges Ian is really Phillip, and the scene closes with Phillip inclining toward the closet, a lighter in his grasp.
