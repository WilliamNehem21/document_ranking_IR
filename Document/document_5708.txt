Australia rolled out two improvements for the Test at Headingley. Center request batsman Neil Harvey supplanted the harmed opener Sid Barnes, who had crumpled while handling amid the Third Test in the wake of being hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot. Australia declined to supplant Barnes with the save opener Bill Brown, rather picking to utilize bad habit skipper Lindsay Hassett as a temporary opener as opposed to in his standard position in the center request. Harvey had scored an unbeaten 73 and a 95 in the ongoing visit matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire separately. Ron Saggers supplanted first-decision wicket-guardian Don Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test, and he exacerbated the damage amid the match against Middlesex. Previous Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly censured the Australians for selecting to utilize just a single spinner, bringing up that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them amid the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly refered to a further occurrence of an Ashes Test at a similar setting in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had critical accomplishment for Australia. He needed something like one of the two leg spinners, Colin McCool or Doug Ring, to have played close by off spinner Ian Johnson, the main pro spinner to have played in the three going before Tests.
