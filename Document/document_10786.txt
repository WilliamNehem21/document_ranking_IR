The normal firecrest is a little stout feathered creature, long with a wingspan of , and weighs . It has splendid olive-green upperparts with a bronze-hued fix on each shoulder, and whitish underparts washed with caramel dim on the bosom and flanks. It has two white wingbars, a modest dark pointed bill, and tanish dark legs. The head design is striking, with a bruised eye stripe, long white supercilium, and a peak which is brilliant yellow in the female and essentially orange in the male. The genders are fundamentally the same as, aside from the peak shading, despite the fact that the female is somewhat more blunt in plumage and by and large marginally littler. Adolescents have a dark tinge to the more blunt upperparts, and come up short on the hued crown; the other head markings are available, however more blunt than in the grown-up. By their first winter, just the flight and tail quills remain unmoulted, and the youthful winged animals are for all intents and purposes unclear from the grown-ups in the field. This kinglet more often than not jumps with its body held evenly, and its flight is powerless and humming, with incidental speedy equivocal turns.
