The regiment stayed in the Shenandoah Valley until August 1862 when they joined Pope's military and moved south to connect with Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. They arrived the day after the Battle of Cedar Mountain, and joined Pope's military in its retreat from that Confederate triumph. After a progression of minor activities along the Rappahannock, Pope's powers met Jackson's half of Lee's military close Manassas Station. Lee had partitioned his military into wings driven by Jackson and Lt. Gen. James Longstreet and sent Jackson's power to attack Pope's back to cut his supply line. Pope trusted he got an opportunity to devastate the Army of Northern Virginia one half at any given moment, and settled on the choice to assault. Jackson's men struck the primary blow, in any case, and drove off a bit of the Union power. The following day, having taken up a solid protective position along an incomplete railroad, Jackson anticipated Pope's development. Pope obliged him, sending the Army forward against Jackson's lines. The 68th and the remainder of Sigel's corps involved the center of the propelling line. They were unfit to break Jackson's lines, and pulled back. The Cameron Rifles had seen some activity at Cross Keys, yet this was their first experience of wild battling and they cleared themselves well, in spite of the disappointment of the assault.
