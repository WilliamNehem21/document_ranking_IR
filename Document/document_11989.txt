Etty displayed the depiction in February 1828 at the British Institution under the title of "Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love". It quickly met with a tempest of scorn from pundits for the style in which Venus was painted; one of only a handful couple of positive surveys was that of "The New Monthly Magazine", whose faultfinder considered "the figure of Venus is brilliantly drawn and most curvaceously shaded; and the manner by which she stirs love, by unsettling the quills of his wings, is wonderfully envisioned and executed". "The Times" remarked that "the illustration is free and streaming" and "the shading, however rich, is impeccably normal", yet felt that "the subject is, nonetheless, taken care of in a way totally excessively delectable (we may, with incredible legitimacy, utilize a harsher term) for the open eye". "The Literary Gazette" surrendered that the work of art was "appealing, particularly in shading", however considered the artwork's "ampleness" as "a standout amongst the most reprehensible sins against taste", and rebuked Etty's "thoughtless" drawing, seeing that "it is unimaginable that a craftsman who has for such a large number of years, thus unremittingly, examined the living model, can blunder in that regard from need of information". The "Month to month Magazine" griped of Venus' "dour shading and husky shape", just as Etty's "inordinate introduction of [Venus's] figure". "La Belle AssemblÃÂ©e", then, felt that Etty's portrayal of Venus "however a fine curvy lady, isn't, either in matchless quality of excellence, or as per any gotten depiction of the affection motivating goddess, a Venus", and whined that "the shading of the tissue is white".
