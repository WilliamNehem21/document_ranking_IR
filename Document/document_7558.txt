Before the gathering touches base in Pamplona, Jake and Bill take an angling excursion to the Irati River. As Harold Bloom calls attention to, the scene fills in as a break between the Paris and Pamplona areas, "a desert garden that exists outside straight time." On another dimension it mirrors "the standard of American fiction starting with the Pilgrims looking for asylum from English persecution"Ã¢ÂÂ the conspicuous subject in American writing of getting away into the wild, as found in Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, and Thoreau. Fiedler calls the subject "The Sacred Land"; he supposes the American West is evoked in "The Sun Also Rises" by the Pyrenees and given an emblematic gesture with the name of the "Lodging Montana." In Hemingway's composition, nature is a position of asylum and resurrection, as per Stoltzfus, where the seeker or angler picks up a snapshot of amazing quality right now the prey is executed. Nature is where men act without ladies: men fish, men chase, men discover recovery. In nature Jake and Bill don't have to examine the war in light of the fact that their war involvement, incomprehensibly, is ever-present. The nature scenes fill in as contrast to the celebration scenes.
