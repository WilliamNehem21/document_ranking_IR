The Eugenics Wars, first mentioned in "Space Seed", are stated in the "Star Trek Chronology" by Michael and Denise Okuda as taking place between 1992 and 1996. They considered it fortunate that these events did not come to pass in the real world, and noted that the development of the "Botany Bay" in 1996 as an instance of where ""Star Trek" technological predictions have missed by a significant margin". The war itself has been referenced elsewhere in the "Star Trek" franchise. The first mention of the wars following "Space Seed" was in the "" episode "The Infinite Vulcan", in which a cloned version of Dr. Stavos Keniclius, a scientist from that era, clones Spock. Later, during the production of "Doctor Bashir, I Presume?", writer RenÃ© Echevarria, seeking a secret past for Doctor Julian Bashir, noted that coverage of the issue of eugenics in "Star Trek" had been limited to Khan and his followers. Fellow writer Ronald D. Moore decided to link the background of Bashir to genetic engineering. "Encounter at Farpoint" and "Star Trek First Contact" confused matters by saying World War III (otherwise known as The Eugenics Wars) had occurred in the 2050s. When Echevarria wrote that the Eugenics Wars took place 200 years before the "Deep Space Nine" episode "Doctor Bashir, I Presume?", he took the time interval directly from "The Wrath of Khan", failing to factor in the additional century between the events of the original series (and its associated films).
