Monteux wished to proceed with his work in helping youthful conductors: "Leading isn't sufficient. I should make something. I am not an arranger, so I will make fine youthful artists." notwithstanding his classes in Paris and Les Baux during the 1930s he had given private exercises to Igor Markevitch; later private understudies included AndrÃÂ© Previn, Seiji Ozawa, JosÃÂ© Serebrier and Robert Shaw. Previn called him "the kindest, smartest man I can recall, and there was nothing about directing he didn't have a clue." After an execution led by Previn, Monteux said to him, "Did you think the ensemble was playing great? ... I did as well. Next time don't meddle with them." Previn said that he always remembered this guidance. Monteux's best-referred to undertaking as an instructor was the Pierre Monteux School for directors and symphonic performers, held each late spring at his home in Hancock, Maine from 1943 onwards. Universally known graduated class of the school incorporate Leon Fleisher, Erich Kunzel, Lorin Maazel, Neville Marriner, Hugh Wolff and David Zinman. Other Monteux understudies included John Canarina, whose 2003 memoir was the principal full-length investigation of the conductor in English, Charles Bruck, one of Monteux's first students in Paris, who moved toward becoming music chief of the school in Hancock after Monteux's demise, and Emanuel Leplin.
