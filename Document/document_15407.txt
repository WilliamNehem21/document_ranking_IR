In 1844 a French-Swiss botanist by the name of Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle (who created the first Code of Botanical Nomenclature) proposed a division of the genus into three sections based on floral morphology. He placed in the section "Orcheosanthus" those species with purple, deeply bilabiate corollas with 5 sub-equal lobes, a short floral tube, and a large spur not protruding past this tube. He included four species in this section, all of them from Mexico: "P. oblongiloba", "P. orchidioides", P. caudata and "P. moranensis". He excluded "P. macrophylla" on the grounds that it was a "dubious species".
The section "Orcheosanthus" grew as Charles Morren described P. flos-mulionis in 1872, Eugene Fournier added P. sodalium in 1873 and Sander proposed P. bakeriana in 1881. In 1879â1888, however, botanist William Hemsley, after studying multiple specimens in herbariums and in culture, came to the conclusion that all the taxa placed in the section "Orcheosanthus" up to that point belonged to the same single species. Due to doubts as to the identity of the original two species described by H.B.K., Hemsley decided to use the name "P. caudata" for his conglomerate species. This name has been "indiscriminately" applied to members of the complex ever since.
