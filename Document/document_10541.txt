In 1947, Havelock moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to take a situation at Harvard University, where he stayed until 1963. He was dynamic in various parts of the University and of the office, of which he moved toward becoming seat; he embraced an interpretation of and analysis on Aeschylus' "Prometheus Bound" to serve his understudies. He distributed this interpretation, with an all-encompassing analysis on Prometheus and the fantasy's suggestions for history, under the title "The Crucifixion of Intellectual Man" (and after that transformed it back to "Prometheus" when the book was republished during the 1960s, saying that the prior title had "come to appear somewhat self-absorbed"). Amid this time he started his first real endeavor to contend for a division between Platonic or Aristotelian logic and what preceded. His attention was on political reasoning and, specifically, the beginnings of Greek progressivism as presented by Democritus. In his book "The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics", he contended that for Democritus and the dissidents, political hypothesis depended on a comprehension of "the conduct of man in an astronomical and authentic setting": that is, humankind characterized as the writers would characterize itÃ¢ÂÂgauged through its individual activities. Plato and Aristotle were keen on the idea of humankind and, specifically, the possibility that human activities may be established in intrinsic characteristics as opposed to comprising of individual decisions.
