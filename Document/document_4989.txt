In 1795, Florida was exchanged back to Spain which attracted Americans with shabby land. A previous follower to Britain who left South Carolina amid the American Revolutionary War, a grower and slave dealer named Zephaniah Kingsley caught the chance and manufactured a ranch named Laurel Grove close what is currently Doctors Lake, near the west bank of the St. Johns River, south of where Orange Park is today. After three years, Kingsley traveled to Cuba and acquired a 13-year-old Wolof young lady named Anna Madgigine Jai. She turned into his custom-based law spouse, and oversaw Laurel Grove while Kingsley voyaged and directed business. The ranch developed citrus and ocean island cotton ("Gossypium barbadense"). In 1814, they moved to a bigger manor on Fort George Island, where they lived for a long time, and claimed a few different estates and residences in what is today Jacksonville and another on Drayton Island at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later hitched three other liberated ladies in a polygamous relationship; Spanish-controlled Florida permitted interracial relational unions, and white landowners, for example, James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco SÃÂ¡nchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard, Jr.Ã¢ÂÂ early pioneers along the streamÃ¢ÂÂall were hitched to or in extramarital associations with African ladies.
