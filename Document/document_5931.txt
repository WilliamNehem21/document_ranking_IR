One of the more impossible to miss physical highlights of this species is its outside genitalia. The male fossa has a strangely long penis and baculum (penis bone), coming to between his forelegs when erect, with a normal thickness of . The glans reaches out mostly down the pole and is barbed with the exception of at the tip. In examination, the glans of felids is short and spiked, while that of viverrids is smooth and long. The female fossa displays transient masculinization, beginning at about 1Ã¢ÂÂ 2 years old, building up an augmented, barbed clitoris that takes after a male's penis. The developed clitoris is upheld by an os clitoris, which diminishes in size as the creature develops. The females don't have a pseudo-scrotum, however they do discharge an orange substance that hues their underparts, much like the emissions of guys. Hormone levels (testosterone, androstenedione, dihydrotestosterone) don't appear to have an impact in this transient masculinization, as those dimensions are the equivalent in masculinized adolescents and non-masculinized grown-ups. It is theorized that the transient masculinization either lessens inappropriate behavior of adolescent females by grown-up guys, or decreases hostility from regional females. While females of other well evolved creature species, (for example, the spotted hyena) have a pseudo-penis, no other is referred to reduce in size as the creature develops.
