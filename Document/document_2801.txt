We were both tallying the strings and I at long last swung to Lars and stated, 'Fella, that is a bass!' Cliff was up there in front of an audience with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his tremendous mop of red hair. He couldn't have cared less whether individuals were there. He was looking down at his bass, playing." "Whiplash" was the collection's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It includes a quick mood line of straight sixteenth notes played at around 200 beats for every moment. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm quieted system and exact metronomic control.
