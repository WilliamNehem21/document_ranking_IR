The power neglected to hold huge quantities of men after their underlying enrollment terminated, and it reliably missed the mark regarding its built up quality. It achieved a pinnacle of 268,000 men in 1909 when attack alarms provoked a flood in enrollment, yet by 1913 numbers had declined to under 246,000, and the officer corps was almost 20 percent under-bought in. In 1910, 33% of the power had not finished the base dimension of musketry preparing. Just 155,000 territorials finished the full 15-day yearly camp in 1912, and around 6,000 did not go to by any stretch of the imagination. In 1909, approximately 37 percent of the majority were under 20 years of age; in the conclusion of the Inspector-General of the Home Forces, this extent rendered the power too juvenile to possibly be compelling. In 1913, roughly 40,000 territorials were under 19 years of age, the base age at which they could volunteer for administration abroad. Scarcely seven percent of the power had acknowledged the Imperial Service Obligation, truly trading off its suitability as a fortification for the Expeditionary Force. Since the military experts viewed the Territorial Force as frail and saw no an incentive in an assistant that was not subject for remote administration, they organized use on the ordinary armed force, leaving the power equipped with outdated weapons.
