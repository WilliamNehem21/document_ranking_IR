After the war, Berger guaranteed that he had been hesitant to take on this new obligation, and had told Hitler, bringing about a dressing down. He likewise guaranteed that Hitler had instructed him to pulverize put away Red Cross supplies, stop Red Cross investigations, and square the landing of further Red Cross supplies to the camps. Further, he stated that Hitler had needed more shootings of POWs and harsher disciplines. As indicated by Berger, he had discreetly abstained from completing these requests, and even countered an arrangement by the "Luftwaffe" to build up POW focuses in real urban areas, utilizing the POWs as human shields against air assaults. Creators John Nichol and Tony Rennell saw that none of these cases have ever been autonomously confirmed, yet some declaration has disproved Berger's cases. They inferred that most, if not all, of Berger's cases about his activities to help POWs are "extraordinary", and noticed that he didn't raise any of these cases amid his preliminary at Nuremberg after the war, or even in his collection of memoirs. One of only a handful couple of cases that has been confirmed to some degree is his work to ensure the "Prominente", a gathering of high-positioning or generally vital POWs that had been held at Colditz Castle until 13 April 1945. There were an aggregate of 21 "Prominente", including Viscount Lascelles and the Master of Elphinstone, the two nephews of King George VI, and Giles Romilly, a nephew of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Berger masterminded them to be cleared from Colditz and transported south and gave over to progressing U.S. Armed force troops.
