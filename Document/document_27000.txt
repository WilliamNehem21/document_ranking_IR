Kurt Busch's right-front tire exploded, causing him to hit the wall between turns three and four, and the tenth caution was shown on lap 256. Kurt Busch retired from the race because of his crash. He was transported to the infield medical center for a mandatory check-up. Edwards remained in the lead for the lap-262 restart. Earnhardt spun his tires, forcing Kenseth onto the outside lane and Gordon to the inside where he passed Earnhardt. Kenseth moved in front of Earnhardt and then made contact with Gordon, who was sent into the inside backstretch retaining wall, which had no SAFER barrier installed. Gordon's car's radiator flew out from its chassis and into the path of oncoming traffic. Kenseth slid but was able to straighten his car and continue. The final caution was initially waved before a red-flag was shown, stopping the race to allow officials to remove debris from the track. The race resumed 17 minutes later, with Edwards leading Earnhardt and Biffle. Edwards maintained the lead for the remaining two laps to secure his second consecutive win and the ninth of his career. Earnhardt finished second, ahead of Biffle in third, Harvick fourth, and Burton fifth. Ragan, Kahne, Kvapil, Hamlin, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had eleven cautions and nineteen lead changes among nine drivers. Edwards led four times for a total of 86 laps, more than any other competitor.
