By boat, the distance between Dakar and Carabane is , although Ziguinchor is only away. Before the launch of the "Joola", other boats, mostly well-worn ones, made the connection: first "Cap Skirring", then the "Casamance Express", and then "Island Karabane". In January 1991, a brand new ferry went into operation. Like its predecessors, it connected Dakar to Ziguinchor, stopping near Carabane where canoes could reach the island. On September 26, 2002, 180 extra passengers boarded the already overloaded ship at this stop, and a few hours later, the "Joola" sank. For security reasons, the "Joola"'s successor, the "Wilis", stopped calling at Carabane, to the great displeasure of the inhabitants. Tourists became rare after that, and from time to time, inhabitants of the island found it necessary to move to Dakar or Ziguinchor. Significant modifications to the MV "Aline Sitoe Diatta", which replaced the "Wilis" in March 2008, were considered to allow it to stop safely at the island, and the construction of a berth was announced. Souleymane NdÃ©nÃ© Ndiaye, who later became Prime Minister of Senegal, laid the first stone of the berth in July 2008, and the entire construction project was financed by the Senegalese government at an estimated cost of 12 billion West African CFA francs. On April 26, 2014, the MV "Aline Sitoe Diatta" stopped at the Carabane berth for the first time, improving transportation for locals and tourists. , the ferry stops at Carabane four times each week in the middle of its trips between Dakar and Ziguinchor.
