In April 1941, Gibbes was presented on the Middle East as aide of No.ÃÂ 450 Squadron. The next month he exchanged to No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron, which was flying Hawker Hurricanes. In June, subsequent to changing over to P-40 Tomahawks, the squadron initiated activities in the SyriaÃ¢ÂÂ Lebanon Campaign. Gibbes was credited with a likely triumph over a Junkers JuÃÂ 88 close Bierut on 13ÃÂ June. On 11ÃÂ July he asserted his first "slaughter", a Dewoitine D.520 contender of the Vichy French aviation based armed forces, over Aleppo. He partook in its decimation with John Jackson, after which the pair flipped a coin to assume full praise for it, and Gibbes won. In September, No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron exchanged toward the Western Desert Campaign, where it saw activity against German and Italian powers. On 20ÃÂ November, amid Operation Crusader, Gibbes participated in the demolition of a Messerschmitt BfÃÂ 110 with three different pilots, crash arriving back at base with harm to his own flying machine. He had an especially effective day on 25ÃÂ November, when he shot down two Fiat G.50s and harmed three more, just as a Messerschmitt BfÃÂ 109. After five days he crushed a G.50 over Tobruk. On 22ÃÂ January 1942, he cut down a Junkers JuÃÂ 87 and harmed two G.50s. He was elevated to acting flight lieutenant that month.
