An extra 144 spreads were flown compliant with a comprehension among Worden and F. Herrick of Miami, a resigned motion picture executive and a stamp authority. As per a letter writing about the stamp occurrence from NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher to the director of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Clinton P. Anderson, Herrick was a companion of the three space explorers who had masterminded Worden, likewise a stamp gatherer, to purchase a collection loaded with stamps and proposed the space travelers bring covers into space. These eventual split and put aside for certain years, and after that sold. In his book Worden said he had been acquainted with Herrick at lunch by previous race vehicle driver Jim Rathmann, and that Herrick proposed the arrangement. Worden likewise related his request the spreads must be held, unsold and unpublicized, until after the Apollo program had finished, and he had resigned from NASA and the Air Force. "I would not like to do whatever would humiliate either myself or NASA, and I trusted Herrick was on the up and up. It was a colossal failure to understand the situation on my part to confide in this outsider. I was too old to even consider believing in Santa Claus." In his 1972 declaration before the Senate advisory group, Worden depicted Herrick as a companion with whom he had past dealings, and with whom he talked about the likelihood of dedicatory covers. As indicated by a 1978 Justice Department report, before the Apollo 15 flight Herrick prompted Worden that taking spreads to the Moon would be a reasonable venture since they would be important to stamp gatherers.
