Not at all like Andronikos II, who had disbanded the Byzantine armed force and naval force, and who favored priests and educated people, Andronikos III was a fiery ruler who actually driven his powers in military crusades. In 1329, his first crusade against the Ottomans brought about a tragic annihilation at the Battle of Pelekanos, after which the Byzantine position in Bithynia quickly crumbled. Ensuing forays into the Balkans were by and by fruitful in shoring up Andronikos' tottering domain. Thessaly and the Despotate of Epirus, two regions isolated from the Empire after the Fourth Crusade, were reestablished to supreme standard, nearly without carnage in 1328 and 1337 separately. Andronikos III likewise reconstructed an unobtrusive armada, which enabled him to recuperate the rich and deliberately set island of Chios from the Genoese Zaccaria family in 1329 just as to guarantee the loyalty of Andreolo Cattaneo, the Genoese legislative leader of Phocaea on the Anatolian territory. In 1335, be that as it may, Andreolo's child Domenico caught the island of Lesbos with Genoese help. The Emperor drove an armada to recuperate it and Phocaea, and mentioned the guide of the Turkish emirs of Saruhan and Aydin. Saruhan sent troops and supplies, however Aydin's ruler Umur Beg came to meet the Emperor face to face. It was amid this experience Kantakouzenos and Umur built up an enduring dear kinship and partnership.
