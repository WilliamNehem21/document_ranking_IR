When the turret had been hit the commander had requested Q magazine entryways shut and the magazine overwhelmed, the request going to the Transmitting Station beneath the heavily clad deck where Stoker first Class William Yeo was endowed with passing the request on. The magazine was thusly overflowed and bolted up close to the hit. Anyway the cordite pursues which had tumbled from weapon house after the hit were not expelled to wellbeing, and there were as yet prepared charges in the working load. A substantial number of crew members still stayed in the shell room, magazine giving room and working chamber. The flame which was thought to have been put out after the hit on the turret picked up quality and lighted the rest of the cordite charges, setting off a vast blast at 16:28 which executed the turret crew members, the fire of the blast coming to as high as the highest point of the ship's poles. Indeed, even with the safety measures taken close by, the magazine entryways were later observed to be seriously clasped Ã¢ÂÂ just the seawater in the magazine behind it kept the shoot coming to inside. Different boats of the battlecruiser armada were less fortunate; at about a similar time as Harvey's passing, was destroyed by a progression of magazine blasts that asserted 1,013 lives and only minutes after that HMS "Ruler Mary" detonated "like a puffball" in one gigantic segment of dark smoke, killing 1,275 mariners. Hours after the fact amid the principle battlefleet commitment, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood's lead was wrecked with 1,032 lives. Every one of the three boats were lost as the consequence of magazine blasts like the one barely kept away from on "Lion".
