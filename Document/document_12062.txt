The sky bears clear allegorical criticalness and is the focal point of the composition's imagery. Alexander, recognized by the Egyptians and others as a divine force of the sun, discovers his triumph in the sun's beams; and the Persians are directed into the murkiness underneath the sickle moon, an image of the Near East. Considered as far as the composition's contemporary setting, the sun's triumph ecstatic speaks to Christendom's triumph over the Islamism of the Ottomans. Eschatological significance, most likely enlivened by predictions in the Book of Daniel, is instilled in the eminent setting.

Schedel, as well, had determined that the last age of the seven he distinguished was near. It might along these lines be induced that the sky's demeanor of the earth shattering occasion at Issus was expected to be of contemporary pertinence too.
