Miguel Angel Face (orig. Spanish ) is the novel's mind boggling hero. He is presented as the President's private guide; there are numerous references to him as the President's most loved and he is more than once depicted "as wonderful and as evil as Satan". As the plot continues perusers see his battle to stay faithful to the tyrant even with the routine's inexorably awful acts. Heavenly attendant Face is looked with the test of accommodating his situation of intensity among a threatened people with his longing to satisfy a higher good reason. In the expressions of abstract commentator Richard Franklin, he "battles to avow his outright presence and to relate this to a credible self". Heavenly attendant Face's phonetic power frequently mirrors his internal good battle: 'A creature commits no error in its sexual retributions,' he thought. 'We piss youngsters into the memorial park. The trumpets of Judgment DayÃ¢ÂÂgreat, it won't be a trumpet. Brilliant scissors will slice through the persistent stream of kids. We men resemble pigs' tripes loaded down with mincemeat by an evil presence butcher to make hotdogs. Also, when I aced my own inclination in order to spare Camila from my longing, I left a piece of myself unstuffed; that is the reason I feel unfilled, uneasy, furious, sick got in a device. Lady is simply the mincemeat into which man stuffs like a pig's tripes for his very own delight. What indecency'
