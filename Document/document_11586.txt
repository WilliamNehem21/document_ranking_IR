While many "Banksia" species have experienced much ordered change since production, the unmistakable "B.ÃÂ ericifolia" has remained generally unaltered as an animal types idea. Thusly, the species has no ordered equivalent words; it does, be that as it may, have three nomenclatural equivalent words. The principal equivalent word, "Banksia phylicaefolia" Salisb, was distributed by the English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury in his 1796 "Prodromus stirpium in horto promotion Chapel Allerton vigentium". It was planned as a swap name for "B.ÃÂ ericaefolia", however Salisbury gave no motivation behind why such a substitution was important. The name was consequently pointless, and subsequently ill-conceived. The second equivalent word emerged from Otto Kuntze's 1891 test of the name "Banksia" L.f., in light of the fact that "Banksia" J.R.Forst and G. Forst had been distributed before it, for the sort currently known as "Pimelea". Kuntze exchanged all "Banksia" species to the new sort name "Sirmuellera", in the process distributing "Sirmuellera ericifolia" (L.f.) Kuntze. The test flopped, be that as it may; in fact, his whole treatise was broadly dismissed. At long last, in 1905 James Britten mounted a comparable test, proposing to exchange all "Banksia" species into "Isostylis"; "B.ÃÂ ericifolia" L.f. accordingly getting to be "Isostylis ericifolia" L.f. (Britten). This test additionally fizzled.
