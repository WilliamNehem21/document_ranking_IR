Such exchange may clarify the overall consistency of the name the nation over. Roads named Gropecunt Lane are recorded in a few littler market towns, for example, Banbury, Glastonbury and Wells, where a road of that name existed in 1300, routinely referenced in authoritative reports of the time. ParsonsÃÂ Street in Banbury was first recorded as Gropecunt Lane in 1333, and may have been an imperative lane, however by 1410 its name had been changed to Parsons Lane. Grape Lane in Whitby may once have been Grope Lane, or Grapcunt Lane. Gropecunte Lane in Glastonbury, later known as Grope path, presently St Benedicts Court, was recorded in 1290 and 1425 A road called GropeÃÂ Countelane existed in Shrewsbury as of late as 1561, associating the town's two chief commercial centers. At some date unrecorded the road was renamed Grope Lane, a name it has held. In Thomas Phillips' "History and Antiquities of Shrewsbury" (1799) the creator is unequivocal in his comprehension of the cause of the name as a position of "shocking indecency and venery", however Archdeacon Hugh Owen's "Some record of the antiquated and current situation with Shrewsbury" (1808) depicts it as "called Grope, or the Dark Lane". Because of these contrasting records, some neighborhood visit guides ascribe the name to "feeling one's way along a dull and tight lane".
