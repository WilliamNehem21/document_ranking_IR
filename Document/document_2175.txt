The measure of material made NHMUK R3078 the most total sauropod example from the United Kingdom, just tantamount later to the "Rutland Dinosaur" (alluded to "Cetiosaurus") found in 1967. Known locales of the example incorporate the forelimb, hindlimb and vertebral segment. The forelimb comes up short on the manus (hand) and part of the range and ulna, despite the fact that the hindlimb just does not have a couple of bones in the pes (foot) and pieces of the tibia, fibula and ilium. The vertebrae known are four pieces of dorsal vertebrae, the neural spines of the sacrum, numerous foremost caudal vertebrae (tail bones), and a progression of 27 about total vertebrae from the center of the tail with related or verbalized chevrons (ribs along the underside of the tail), despite the fact that the vertebral arrangement isn't constant. A tail tip (NHMUK R1967) from a similar area, however an alternate individual was thought by scientist Alan Charig in 1980 to have a place with "Cetiosauriscus". The task of NHMUK R1967 to "Cetiosauriscus" was viewed as improbable in exchange contemplates by scientistss Friedrich von Huene, Paul Upchurch and Darren Naish as a result of the absence of cover and unsure phylogenetic positions. In 1903, the skeleton was mounted as protected in the British Museum, so it could be all the more effectively contrasted and other mounted sauropods from North America. The mount of "Cetiosauriscus" was put in plain view only before the cast skeleton of "Diplodocus", and was shown with the dorsal vertebrae NHMUK R1984 and some disengaged teeth from a camarasaurid (conceivably referable to "Cetiosauriscus"), making it the main sauropod skeleton mounted in the United Kingdom.
