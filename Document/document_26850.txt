In 1991, Paterson invited freelance studio engineer Andy Falconer to join the Orb. He was closely followed by studio engineer Kris "Thrash" Weston. Steve Hillage, who Paterson had met while DJ-ing in London, also joined as a guitarist. Along with producer Thomas Fehlmann, the Orb completed several additional tracks for their first album, "The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld". At least six studios and twenty outside musicians were used during the three weeks of recording. Falconer's and Weston's technical abilities and Hillage's guitar work allowed the group to craft panoramic sounds portraying aspects of space travel, including the launch of "Apollo 11". "Adventures" sold well in the United Kingdom and received praise for its balance of ambient music, house music, and sampling. Retrospectively, "Adventures" is considered ground-breaking for changing the way musicians view sampling and as a vital work for the genres of ambient and dance music. The completion of "Adventures" saw the departure of Andy Falconer, whose last contribution was to one of the Orb's Peel Sessions. To promote the release of an edited single-disc version for an American release on Mercury Records, the Orb embarked on their first tour of the United States beginning in Phoenix, Arizona, in October 1991.
