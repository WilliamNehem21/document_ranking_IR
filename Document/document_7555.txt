"Strange Tales" incorporated a letters section, titled "The Eyrie", for the vast majority of its reality, and amid Wright's time as proofreader it was typically loaded up with long and point by point letters. At the point when Brundage's naked spreads showed up, a long discussion about whether they were appropriate for the magazine was battled out in the Eyrie, with the opposite sides separated about similarly. For quite a long time it was the most talked about point in the magazine's letter segment. A large number of the creators Wright distributed composed letters as well, including Lovecraft, Howard, Kuttner, Bloch, Smith, Quinn, Wellman, Price, and Wandrei. By and large these letters adulated the magazine, yet infrequently a basic remark was raised, as when Bloch more than once communicated his aversion for Howard's accounts of Conan the Barbarian, alluding to him as "Conan the Cimmerian Chipmunk". Another discussion that was broadcast in the letter segment was the subject of how much sci-fi the magazine ought to incorporate. Until "Stunning Stories" was propelled in April 1926, sci-fi was mainstream with "Odd Tales"' perusers, however after that point letters started to show up requesting that Wright prohibit sci-fi, and just distribute strange dream and repulsiveness. The ace sci-fi perusers were in the greater part, and as Wright concurred with them, he kept on incorporating sci-fi in "Abnormal Tales". Hugh B. Cavern, who sold about six stories to Wright in the mid 1930s, remarked on "The Eyrie" in a letter to a kindred essayist: "No other magazine makes such a point of examining past stories, and telling the writers how their stuff is gotten".
