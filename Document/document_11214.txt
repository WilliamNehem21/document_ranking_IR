Rogers sketched out the solicitation for the foundation of the commission, with four individuals to be delegated by each place of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rodgers and Dallinger needed $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to approve the issuance of memorial coins and stamps. Rogers told the board that the language for the administrative arrangements for the coin had been obtained from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920Ã¢ÂÂ 1921), and helped them to remember other memorial coins that had been issued. At the time, memorial coins were not sold by the administrationÃ¢ÂÂCongress, in approving enactment, assigned an association which had the elite appropriate to buy the coins without needing any proof and distribute them to the general population at a higher cost than normal. A limit of 300,000 coins was mentioned. Dallinger noticed that the administration would cause no cost from the memorial half dollars: it would benefit from the seignorage and could never be called upon to reclaim them, as they would be held by authorities. After the two congressmen showed up, Chairman Luce presented a letter from the Senate Majority Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, demonstrating his help for the bill. Luce announced his own variant of the goals the next day, with his board's suggestion that it pass.
