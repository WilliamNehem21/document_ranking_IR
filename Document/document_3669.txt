The three inward boards contain an ordinary "sacra conversazione", a structure built up in Italy in the last 50% of the fourteenth century with a benefactor holy person showing the contributor, generally stooping, to an enthroned "Divinity or Mother of God". John Ward trusts the rich and complex iconography and emblematic significance van Eyck utilized in his religious boards served to feature the conjunction the craftsman saw between the profound and material universes. In his prior canvases, unobtrusive iconographical featuresÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ alluded to as camouflaged symbolismÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ are normally woven into the work, as "moderately little, out of sight, or in the shadow [details]". These components incorporate the ghost of the Virgin before the benefactor, whose board contains carvings that appear to be intelligent of occasions of his life. In his religious boards after 1436, van Eyck's dependence on iconographical or representative components is enormously diminished. Ward hypothesizes the decreased size of the work or the desires of the chief affected this decision, or he "concluded that he had depleted the most fascinating potential outcomes andÃÂ ... a lot of his painstakingly arranged imagery went undervalued by benefactors or by watchers." According to Jacobs, the work mirrors an arrangement of imagery in so far as great and natural items are compared. This is most apparent in the difference between the monochromatic outside and clear inward boards.
