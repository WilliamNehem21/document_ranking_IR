Not long after the 1940 tradition, Roosevelt depicted Willkie's assignment as a "Gift from heaven to our nation", since it guaranteed that the presidential race would not turn on the issue of help to Britain. Walter Lippmann trusted Willkie's assignment to have been essential to Britain's survival, "second just to the Battle of Britain, the abrupt ascent and designation of Willkie was the unequivocal occasion, maybe opportune, which made it conceivable to rally the free world when [Britain] was nearly prevailed. Under some other administration yet his the Republican party in 1940 would have walked out on Great Britain, causing all who opposed Hitler to feel deserted". Charles Peters composed that "it is questionable that [Willkie's] sway on [the United States] and the world was more noteworthy than that of most men who really held the workplace [of president]. At a pivotal crossroads ever, he represented the correct things at the ideal time." When Georgia Senator Zell Miller, a Democrat, gave the keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention, he encouraged solidarity rather than factional struggle in the War on Terror, and reviewed Willkie's activities, "He gave Roosevelt the basic help he required for a peacetime draft, a disagreeable thought at the time. What's more, he clarified that he would prefer to lose the race than make national security a fanatic crusade issue."
