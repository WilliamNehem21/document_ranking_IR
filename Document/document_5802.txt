The new battery was developed amid 1799 on damp ground a short separation south-east of St Catherine's Church. It took its name from the close-by Coalhouse Point, which was named for a coal wharf that once existed there to serve East Tilbury. The delicate soil caused numerous issues yet the work was finished by July of that year. It was furnished with four 24-pounder (pdr.) gun mounted on crossing carriages, which empowered the heavy weapons specialists to follow targets substantially more effectively than had been the situation with customary battalion carriages. The battery confronted the waterway with a semi-roundabout earthen bulwark on which the firearms were mounted. A walled-off zone to the back encased a sleeping enclosure, magazine and shot oven (for warming shot to set wooden ships ablaze). The entire structure was encompassed by a polygonal water-filled jettison. It was adjusted in 1810 to raise the tallness of the bulwark and to include a little cost magazine where ammo was put away for prompt use. The French did not test the Thames resistances, in spite of an intrusion alarm in 1804, and the battery was relinquished alongside those at Lower Hope Point and Shornemead following Napoleon's last annihilation in 1815.
