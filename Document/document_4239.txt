The Banffshire had four trains, two 0-4-2 tanks, named "Banff" and "Portsoy", worked by Hawthorns of Leith for the line's opening in 1859. The other two trains were 0-4-2 delicate motors, one purchased used from the Scottish Central Railway, having been worked in 1848 by the Vulcan Foundry in Warrington and named "Keith", and a comparative delicate motor worked by Hawthorns. The Morayshire Railway had begun benefits in 1852 with two 2-2-0 motors structured by James Samuel and worked by Neilsons. The trains had demonstrated lacking and were supplanted by two bigger 2-4-0 tank motors. The Great North assumed control over the activity of the Deeside Railway in 1866. Its initial two trains were 0-4-2 tank motors, worked by Hawthorns and touched base in 1854. No. 3, a delicate train, was conveyed in 1854 from Dodds and Son of Rotherham, yet this had mechanical imperfections and was never tasteful. Somewhere in the range of 1857 and 1866 four 0-4-2 delicate trains touched base from Hawthorns; these were like the Banffshire's Nos. 3 and 4; the Deeside likewise purchased the Banffshire's No. 4 out of 1864. One of these trains was given an extensive six-wheeled delicate to enable it to pull the Royal Trains from Aberdeen to ceaselessly. The delicate trains were observed to be shaky at high speeds were altogether pulled back by 1880.
