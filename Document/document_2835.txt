In November 1934, Walker, presently an understudy at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, affirmed with Robert Olds, Claire Chennault, Donald Wilson, Harold George and Robert Webster on the military parts of aeronautics before the Howell Commission on Federal Aviation. All were present or previous teachers at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all with the exception of Chennault were a piece of the Bomber Mafia. They contended for an autonomous aviation based armed forces, in logical inconsistency to Army principle. Walker told the commission: "except if we make a satisfactory and separate Air Force, this next war 'will start noticeable all around and end in the mud'- in the mud and flotsam and jetsam of the decimated enterprises that have pushed us to the edge of total collapse." They were unfit to convince the commission to suggest a free aviation based armed forces, in spite of the fact that it agreed that the Air Corps ought to be allowed more prominent self-sufficiency inside the Army. The commission presumed that "there is sufficient motivation to trust that air ship have now gone a long ways past their previous position as valuable auxiliariesÃÂ ... A satisfactory striking power for use against destinations both close and remote is a need for a cutting edge armed force".
