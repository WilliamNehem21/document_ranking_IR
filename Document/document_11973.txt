In the Orb's initial DJ occasions during the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty performed with three record decks, a tape player, and a CD player which were all blended through an Akai 12-track blender. They utilized their hardware to blend recorded music and audio effect tests into an "interminable sound continuum" for gatherings of people of destroyed artists. Indeed, even after the Orb started creating unique material, they kept a similar example overwhelming model for live acts by suddenly coordinating dark examples into their pre-recorded tracks. Amid limited time visits for "Undertakings Beyond the Ultraworld" and "U.F.Orb", they performed utilizing a computerized sound tape machine and tried different things with other media sources, for example, dubplates. The tape machines held individual harmonies, rhythms, and basslines for every sythesis, enabling the Orb to reprocess them and copy the demonstration of DJ-ing. Individuals could then effectively extemporize with these examples and control them utilizing audio cue racks. Regularly, the Orb had a live performer going with them, for example, Steve Hillage on guitar. Their shows in the mid 1990s would frequently be three hours of semi-ad libbed, ceaseless music highlighting an abundance of activated examples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were scarcely recognizable as the first piece.
