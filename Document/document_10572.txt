Australia advanced rapidly toward the beginning of the pursuit. Barnes took 13 runs, including three limits, from the opening over, bowled by Bedser, while Morris again needed familiarity. In any case, Barnes kept on scoring rapidly, and 24 runs originated from the initial four overs. Yardley endeavored to stop the run-scoring by expediting Young, however Morris hit him for four and the bowler was quickly taken off. The travelers continued relentlessly to 38 from 32 minutes before Bedser bowled Morris for nine; in the wake of bowling a few balls that moved away, Bedser got out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had built up a propensity for attempting to safeguard the ball to the leg side while rearranging towards the off, and was not in a situation to manage a ball that rushed off the pitch. Bradman went to the wrinkle and batted for 12 minutes without getting off the imprint. From the tenth ball he confronted, the Australian captain was out for a duck, again gotten by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser's leg trap. Bradman indicated clear disappointment at enabling himself to be expelled by a similar device in successive innings, and his takeoff left Australia at 48/2. It was the first run through in four visits to England that Bradman had made a duck in a Test.
