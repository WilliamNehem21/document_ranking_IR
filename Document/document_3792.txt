"Banksia ilicifolia" has a strong trunk up to in distance across, and unpleasant, stringy, dark bark which is up to thick. New development happens for the most part in summer. Youthful branchlets are canvassed in hair which they lose following a few years. Leaves develop on stems under two years old, and are masterminded in a dissipated example along the stems albeit swarmed at the apices (branchlet tips). Taking after those of holly, its leaves are a dull gleaming green shading, and differently obovate (egg-molded), elliptic, truncate or undulate (wavy) fit as a fiddle, and long. By and large serrated, the leaf edges have up to 14 thorny "teeth" isolated by expansive v-to u-formed sinuses along each side, albeit a few leaves have edges lacking teeth. The leaves sit on petioles long. The upper and undersurface of the leaves are at first canvassed in fine hairs yet turned out to be smooth with development. Blossoming happens from pre-spring to late-spring. The inflorescences are vault molded blossom heads as opposed to spikes the same number of different banksias, and emerge from stems that are around a year old. No parallel branchlets develop outwards from the hub where the blossom head emerges. The blossom heads measure in breadth, and bear 60 to 100 individual blooms. The inflorescences go through three shading stages, being at first yellow, at that point pink, at that point at long last red, before falling far from the head. One to three follicles create from treated blossoms, and stay implanted in the woody base of the bloom head. Every follicle bears a couple of seeds.
