Immense hordes of local people started running to pay tribute to Long, vowing to contribute work and fund with an end goal to remove the French from Vietnam and introduce Long as the autonomous ruler. At this point, Long was professing to have gotten a letter from Cuong De, which evidently affirmed his regal plummet. Long's adherents saved no cost in adorning Long with regal accessories. They made an emblem recorded "Phan XÃÂ­ch Long HÃÂ²ang ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¿" (Emperor Phan XÃÂ­ch Long) and an imperial seal with a mythical serpent's head with the words "ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¡i Minh QuÃ¡Â»Âc, Phan XÃÂ­ch Long HÃÂ²ang ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¿, ThiÃÂªn tÃ¡Â»Â­" ("Greater Ming State, Emperor Phan XÃÂ­ch Long, Son of Heaven"). The words "ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¡i Minh" were translated as either having self-assertively been replicated from neighborhood Chinese Vietnamese mystery society mottos, or as a vital ploy to summon the names of the Ming Dynasty to engage the Chinese who had emigrated to Vietnam after the fall of the Ming. Long's supporters created a sword with the engraving "TiÃÂªn ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ£ hÃÂ´n quÃÂ¢n, hÃ¡ÂºÂ­u ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ£ loÃ¡ÂºÂ¡n thÃ¡ÂºÂ§n" ("First strike the debased ruler, next the traitorous authorities") and a ring recorded "DÃÂ¢n CÃÂ´ng" ("Popular Tribute"). From that point on, Long introduced himself as the head and marked archives under the imperial title.
