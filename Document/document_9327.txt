The most striking highlights of the skeleton were the amazingly tall, upwardly anticipating neural spines on the neck and front dorsal vertebrae. The neural spines were bifurcated along their whole length, shaping a twofold line. They were roundabout in cross area and decreased towards their tips. The tallest spines could be found on the center piece of the neck, where they came to on the eighth cervical. On the neck, they were bowed in reverse, anticipating over the adjoining vertebra. A comparative stretched neural spine has been portrayed from the neck district of the firmly related "Bajadasaurus" in 2019. Not at all like in "Amargasaurus", this spine was bowed frontwards and widened towards the tips. The last two dorsal vertebrae, the hip, and the chief tail in "Amargasaurus" additionally had prolonged spines; these were not bifurcated but rather flared into an oar formed upper end. The pelvic district was generally wide, based on the long, along the side anticipating transverse procedures of the sacral vertebrae. The forelimbs were to some degree shorter than the rear appendages, as in related sauropods. The greater part of the hand and foot bones were not protected, yet "Amargasaurus" most likely had five digits each as in all sauropods.
