In mid 1873, the naval force made the non military personnel post of Inspector of Naval Bands, with a position of Collegiate Assessor, and named Rimsky-Korsakov. This kept him on the naval force finance and recorded on the list of the Chancellery of the Navy Department yet enabled him to leave his bonus. The writer remarked, "I separated with joy with both my military status and my officer's uniform", he later composed. "From this time forward I was an artist authoritatively and incontestably." As Inspector, Rimsky-Korsakov put forth a concentrated effort with enthusiasm to his obligations. He visited maritime groups all through Russia, administered the bandmasters and their arrangements, assessed the groups' collection, and examined the nature of their instruments. He composed an investigation program for a supplement of music understudies who held naval force partnerships at the Conservatory, and went about as a middle person between the Conservatory and the naval force. He likewise enjoyed a long-standing want to acclimate himself with the development and playing method of symphonic instruments. These examinations provoked him to compose a course book on organization. He utilized the benefits of rank to practice and develop his insight. He examined game plans of melodic works for military band with bandmasters, energized and checked on their endeavors, held shows at which he could hear these pieces, and organized unique works, and works by different writers, for military groups.
