Dowling was selected a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1957 New Year Honors, and finished his term as CNS on 23ÃÂ February 1959. On 23ÃÂ March he took over from Sir Henry Wells as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), a job hinting that of the modern Chief of the Defense Force. He was prevailing as CNS by Vice Admiral Henry Burrell. Joyfully astonished by his arrangement as Chairman of COSC, Dowling wanted to change the position to such an extent that it would practice direction specialist over the administration boss, however in this he was to be frustrated. The position's rank continued as before as the leaders of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and was in charge of putting their perspectives on military issues to the Minister for Defense. Different mishaps amid his residency incorporated the Defense Department's choiceÃ¢ÂÂrepealed after his termÃ¢ÂÂto disband the Fleet Air Arm, and the Federal government's inability to back him when he reported at a SEATO public interview in March 1961 that Australia was set up to mediate militarily in the second Laotian emergency should it become vital. In September 1959, amid the primary Laotian emergency, the Australian government had approved Dowling to submit "an infantry regiment, a squadron of RAAF warriors, air transport, and two RAN destroyers" to help US and SEATO powers, however no mediation occurred.
