There are five species similar in appearance to "G.Â maritimus": "G.Â arenophilus", "G.Â decipiens", "G.Â flavus", "G.Â fulgens" and "G.Â pseudofulgens". "G.Â arenophilus" and particularly "G.Â fulgens" are the most similar. Though "G.Â maritimus" and "G.Â arenophilus" show similarities in their biogeography and ecology, the typically slightly smaller "G.Â arenophilus" differs from "G.Â maritimus" morphologically. While "G.Â maritimus" has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, "G.Â arenophilus" can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with "G.Â maritimus" typically displaying larger warts. Like "G.Â maritimus", "G.Â fulgens" has been recorded growing on sand-dune heathland; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of "G.Â maritimus". However, "G.Â fulgens" requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss. Moreover, there are a number of morphological differences; "G.Â maritimus" mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on "G.Â fulgens" stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on "G.Â maritimus". "G.Â fulgens" var. "luteicystis" is even more distinct from "G.Â maritimus" than the nominate variety. Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different clades within "Gymnopilus", suggesting ecological convergence between "G.Â arenophilus" and "G.Â maritimus", and morphological convergence between "G.Â fulgens" and "G.Â maritimus".
