After a solicitation for help from Lithuania, the League Council required Poland's withdrawal from the zone. The Polish government showed they would consent, yet rather fortified the city with increasingly Polish troops. This provoked the League to choose that the fate of Vilnius ought to be dictated by its inhabitants in a plebiscite and that the Polish powers ought to pull back and be supplanted by a global power sorted out by the League. The arrangement was met with opposition in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which restricted any universal power in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League relinquished designs for the plebiscite. After ineffective recommendations by Paul Hymans to make an alliance among Poland and Lithuania, which was expected as a rebirth of the previous association which both Poland and Lithuania had once shared before losing its autonomy, Vilnius and the encompassing region was formally added by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania assumed control over the KlaipÃÂda Region, the Allied Conference set the boondocks among Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius inside Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian experts would not acknowledge the choice, and formally stayed in a condition of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish final proposal that Lithuania reestablished strategic relations with Poland and hence "true" acknowledged the outskirts.
