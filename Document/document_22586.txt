Porto failed a fourth successive league title by finishing third in the 2013â14 Primeira Liga, and therefore had to contest the following season's Champions League play-off round. They overcame French side Lille to reach the group stage, and won their group ahead of Shakhtar Donetsk, Athletic Bilbao and Belarussian champions BATE Borisov. During this stage, Porto recorded their biggest win in this competition after beating BATE Borisov 6â0 at the EstÃ¡dio do DragÃ£o.<ref name="2014/15-Borisov"></ref> The team then eliminated Basel to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2008â09. Drawn against Bayern Munich, Porto hosted the German champions for the first leg and grabbed a shocking 3â1 win, with goals from Ricardo Quaresma and Jackson MartÃ­nez.<ref name="2014/15-PORBAY"></ref> A week later, in Munich, Porto were eliminated after suffering an all-time club record-matching 6â1 away defeat<ref name="2014/15-BAYPOR"></ref> (tied with the loss to AEK Athens, and 5â0 losses to Hannover 96, PSV Eindhoven, Arsenal, and Liverpool). A runner-up finish in the 2014â15 Primeira Liga earned Porto's fifth consecutive participation in the Champions League group stage in 2015â16. After a positive start, defeats in the last two matches against Dynamo Kyiv and Chelsea relegated the club to that season's Europa League round of 32, where they were knocked out by Borussia Dortmund.
