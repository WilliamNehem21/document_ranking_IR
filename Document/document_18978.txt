Aside from the "Quatermass" serials, Cartier and Kneale collaborated on several one-off dramas, including literary and theatrical adaptations of "Wuthering Heights" (6 December 1953) and "The Moment of Truth" (10 March 1955), as well as Kneale's own "The Creature" (30 January 1955). Of particular note was their collaboration on an adaptation of George Orwell's novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four", originally broadcast on 12 December 1954, regarded as Cartier's most famous work. "The Times"'s review the day after its broadcast noted its "vividness... the two minutes' hate was, for instance, a wonderfully riotious orgy of vindictiveness." The production also attracted considerable controversy. There were questions asked in the House of Commons concerning some of the graphic scenes of horror in the play, and the BBC received several telephone calls threatening Cartier's life if the second live performance, scheduled for 16 December, went ahead. The BBC took these threats seriously enough to assign him bodyguards. Cartier appeared live on television himself to defend the production in a studio debate, and eventually the Board of Governors of the BBC voted that the second performance should go ahead as planned. The production had by this time received the backing of the Duke of Edinburgh, who commented during a speech to the Royal Society of Arts that he and the Queen had watched and enjoyed the first performance.
