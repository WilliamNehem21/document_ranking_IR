On 9 December, she passed back around Cape Horn to return to the Pacific. That day, she anchored in Sholl Bay, with only 160Â t (160Â long tons; 180Â short tons) of coal aboard. "Oberleutnant zur See" (lieutenant at sea) Wilhelm Canaris convinced the Chilean naval representative for the region to permit "Dresden" to remain in the area for an extra twenty-four hours so enough coal could be taken aboard to reach Punta Arenas. She arrived there on 12 December, and received of coal from a German steamer. The "Admiralstab" hoped that "Dresden" would be able to break through to the Atlantic and return to Germany, but the poor condition of her engines precluded this. LÃ¼decke instead decided to attempt to cross the Pacific via Easter Island, the Solomon Islands, and the Dutch East Indies and raid commerce in the Indian Ocean. "Dresden" took on another of coal on 19 January. On 14 February, "Dresden" left the islands off the South American coast for the South Pacific. On 27 February, the cruiser captured the British barque "Conway Castle" south of MÃ¡s a Tierra. From December to February, the German liner had supplied "Dresden" and had accompanied her northward to a final coaling at Juan FernÃ¡ndez Islands just before the cruiser was sunk.
