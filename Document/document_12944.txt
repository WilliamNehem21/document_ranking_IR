David II drove the Scottish armed force to the high ground at Neville's Cross, not exactly a large portion of a mile (800 m) toward the west of Durham and inside sight of Durham Cathedral, where he arranged for the fight to come. Both the Scots and the English organized themselves in three developments, or fights. On the Scottish side, David II assumed responsibility for the second fight, and put John Randolph, the Earl of Moray, accountable for the main fight. Patrick Dunbar, the Earl of March, took direction of the third fight. The contemporary sources are not predictable, however it appears that the Scots framed up in their conventional schiltrons, each fight shaping a rectilinear development. The front positions were outfitted with tomahawks and long lances conveyed by the back positions jutted past them. The knights and other men-at-arms got off and hardened the arrangements, generally at the front. A screen of toxophilite skirmished to the front, and each flank of the military was protected by hobelars and further bowmen. As the fog lifted, it turned out to be evident that the Scots were ineffectively situated, on gotten things started and with their development made troublesome by trench and dividers. They recollected their annihilations at Dupplin Moor and Halidon Hill thus took a cautious position, trusting that the English will assault.
