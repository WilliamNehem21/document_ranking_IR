Since "The Guardian" (formerly "The Manchester Guardian") moved to London in 1964, no major national paper is based in the North, and Northern news stories tend to be poorly covered in the national press. "The Yorkshire Post" promotes itself as "Yorkshire's national paper" and covers some national and international stories, but is primarily focused on news from Yorkshire and the North East. An attempt in 2016 to create a dedicated North-focused national newspaper, "24", failed after six weeks. Across Northern England as a whole, "The Sun" is the best selling newspaper, but the ongoing boycott around Merseyside following the newspaper's coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster has seen the paper fall behind both the "Daily Mail" and the "Daily Mirror" in the North West. In general national readership in the North drags behind that of the South; the "Mirror" and the "Daily Star" are the only national papers with more readers in Northern England than in the South East and London. Local newspapers are the top-selling titles in both the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, although Northern regional newspapers have seen steep declines in readership in recent years. Only seven daily Northern papers have circulation figures above 25,000 as of June 2016: "Manchester Evening News", "Liverpool Echo", "Hull Daily Mail", "Newcastle Chronicle", "The Yorkshire Post" and "The Northern Echo".
