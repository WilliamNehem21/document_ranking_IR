In February 1920, Chauvel was elevated to the substantive position of lieutenant general, back-dated to 31 December 1919. In January 1920, he led a board of trustees to inspect the future structure of the military. The advisory group's suggestions ended up being by difficult to actualize even with protection cuts that were forced in 1920 and 1922. On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was partitioned into two, with Chauvel getting to be first Chief of the General Staff just as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey wound up second Chief of the General Staff. Chauvel likewise filled in as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three administration boss. In November 1929, he turned into the principal Australian to be elevated to the position of general. He endeavored to keep up the Army's structure despite foolhardy government officials aim on cutting consumption. Thus, the Army turned out to be progressively empty, holding the type of a huge power without the substance. At the point when induction was abrogated by Prime Minister James Scullin's administration in 1929, it was surrendered over to Chauvel to endeavor to make the new volunteer framework work. He at long last resigned in April 1930.
