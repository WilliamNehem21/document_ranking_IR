The species was first depicted in the logical writing as "le bolet chicotin" ("Boletus felleus") by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1788. As the vast sort "Boletus" was cut up into littler genera, Petter Karsten moved it in 1881 to "Tylopilus", a class analyzed by its pink spores and adnate cylinders. "T.ÃÂ felleus" is the sort types of "Tylopilus", and the main individual from the variety found in Europe. Equivalent words incorporate "Boletus alutarius", portrayed by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815 and later by Friedrich Wilhelm Gottlieb Rostkovius in 1844, and Paul Christoph Hennings' resulting exchange of Fries' taxon into "Tylopilus", "T.ÃÂ alutarius". Lucien QuÃÂ©let put the taxon in "Dictyopus" in 1886 and after that "Rhodoporus" in 1888, however neither of these genera are perceived today, the previous having been converged into "Boletus" and the last into "Tylopilus". Hereditary examination distributed in 2013 demonstrates that "T.ÃÂ felleus" and many (yet not every single) other individual from "Tylopilus" structure a "Tylopilus" clade inside a bigger gathering casually called anaxoboletus in the Boletineae. Different clades in the gathering incorporate the porcini and "Strobilomyces" clades, just as three different gatherings made out of individuals from different genera including "Xerocomus", "Xerocomellus" and "Boletus badius" and relatives.
