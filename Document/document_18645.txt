No subspecies are recognised currently. Mathews tentatively described a subspecies "carteri" in 1915 from a specimen collected at Broomehill on the basis of darker upperparts and greener cheeks; it was not considered distinct by later authors. There is no known geographical variation; five birds from Esperance had smaller bills and tarsi than individuals from elsewhere in its range, but the sample was too small to draw any conclusions. 
The red-capped parrot is related to other broad-tailed parrots, but relationships within the group had been unclear. In 1938, Australian ornithologist Dominic Serventy proposed that it was the sole survivor of a lineage of eastern Australian origin, with no close living relatives. In 1955, British evolutionary biologist Arthur Cain proposed that the eastern lineage had vanished after being outcompeted by the crimson rosella ("Platycercus elegans"), and that its closest relative was the horned parakeet ("Eunymphicus cornutus") of New Caledonia, which he concluded had adopted a much greener plumage of a wetter climate. A 2011 genetic study including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA found that the red-capped parrot was closely related to the mulga parrot ("Psephotellus varius"), the two lineages having diverged in the Miocene. The combined lineage itself diverging from one giving rise to the hooded parrot ("Psephotellus dissimilis") and golden-shouldered parrot ("Psephotellus chrysopterygius").
