The Allies found and recouped "M-21" on 3 June and "M-14" on 8 June. Albeit both were harmed amid the assault, it was conceivable to amass a total submarine from the two vessels. The inside area of the modified submarine was mounted on a trailer and taken on a visit all through southern New South Wales, Victoria, and western South Australia. The motivation behind the visit was twofold; it enabled Australians to see a Japanese smaller person submarine very close, and was utilized to raise AÃÂ£28,000 for the Naval Relief Fund and different philanthropies. The submarine touched base at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra on 28 April 1943, flying the White Ensign and a satisfying flag. The submarine was initially shown outside the historical center in three separate pieces, yet was moved inside during the 1980s because of substantial vandalism; on one event in 1966, a gathering of college understudies painted it splendid yellow in light of The Beatles' melody "Yellow Submarine." The composite submarine was reestablished and stays in plain view inside the Memorial as a major aspect of a changeless presentation on the assault, beside the recouped wheelhouse of HMAS "Kuttabul".' The conning tower from "M-21" is in plain view at the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Center on Garden Island. Remaining material from "M-21" was dissolved down and made into trinkets following the development of the consolidated vessel.
