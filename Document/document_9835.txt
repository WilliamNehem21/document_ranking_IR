"Astraeus pteridis" is bigger, or more when extended, and regularly has an increasingly articulated areolate example on the internal surface of the beams. It is found in North America and the Canary Islands. "A.ÃÂ asiaticus" and "A.ÃÂ odoratus" are two comparable species known from all through Asia and Southeast Asia, separately. "A.ÃÂ odoratus" is recognized from "A.ÃÂ hygrometricus" by a smooth external mycelial layer with few following soil particles, 3Ã¢ÂÂ 9 wide beams, and a new smell like wet soil. The spore ornamentation of "A.ÃÂ odoratus" is additionally unmistakable from "A.ÃÂ hygrometricus", with longer and smaller spines that frequently combined. "A.ÃÂ asiaticus" has an external peridial surface secured with little granules, and a gleba that is purplish-chestnut in shading, contrasted with the smooth peridial surface and earthy gleba of "A.ÃÂ hygrometricus". The maximum furthest reaches of the spore size of "A.ÃÂ asiaticus" is bigger than that of its increasingly regular relative, running from 8.75Ã¢ÂÂ 15.2ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. "A.ÃÂ koreanus" (once in a while named as the assortment "A.ÃÂ hygrometricus" var. "koreanus"; see Taxonomy) varies from the more typical structure in its littler size, paler natural product body, and more prominent number of beams; minutely, it has littler spores (somewhere in the range of 6.8 and 9ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m in breadth), and the spines on the spores contrast long and morphology. It is known from Korea and Japan.
