"Mughal-e-Azam" mistreats verifiable truth. History specialist Alex von Tunzelmann says that in spite of the fact that the genuine Salim was a substantial shopper of liquor and opium from the age of 18, he was not really a wicked kid, as portrayed in the film. At the point when the film's Salim comes back from his time in the military, he is delineated as a delicate and sentimental saint, as opposed to the genuine Salim, who was archived as a fierce alcoholic who might regularly pound the life out of individuals. The genuine Salim led an insubordination to his dad, attempted to supplant him as head, and had Akbar's companion Abu al-Fazl killed in 1602, however the film credits these activities to his craving to wed Anarkali, which is truly off base. Further, there were likewise inconsistencies in sets, outfits, and music of the film. The Sheesh Mahal, really the regal shower of the ruler, was portrayed in the film as a moving corridor, and a lot bigger. Music and moving styles from the nineteenth century were portrayed, despite the fact that the story happens in the sixteenth century. For instance, "thumri", a semi-established music structure created in the nineteenth century, is received in a move succession in Kathak style, which is a sixteenth century move structure.
