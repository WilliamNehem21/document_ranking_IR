The underlying activity in Jackson's Valley Campaign occurred to their east, yet in June FrÃÂ©mont's power of 15,000 joined the 10,000-man division of Brig. Gen. James Shields to merge on Jackson south of Massanutten Mountain. Jackson was resolved to assault the two Union segments independently and organized portion of his troops to square Shields on the correct side of the mountain, while the other half, instructed by Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, hindered the left side. Jackson's desire was acknowledged when, on June 8, FrÃÂ©mont's military assaulted. FrÃÂ©mont, trusting he was striking Jackson's back, rather assaulted Ewell head-on, and Jackson before long offered his entire power as a powerful influence for the Union troops in the Battle of Cross Keys. The men of the 68th went under concentrated flame out of the blue however were not intensely engaged with the fight, albeit two men were murdered. The fight was an annihilation for the Union, and FrÃÂ©mont's power did not assault once more, being obstructed rather by a little holding power from Ewell's wing. The remainder of Jackson's power at that point swung to assault Shields' military the following day at Port Republic, however FrÃÂ©mont's infantry did not figure in the fight, another Confederate triumph, however his cannons shelled the adversary from long range.
