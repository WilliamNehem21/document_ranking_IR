The characters of Gemini and Teja were displayed on "Vellai" Ravi and Chera respectivelyTamil-Burma repatriates who settled in Bhaktavatsalam province (B.V. State) in Vyasarpadi, North Madras. They were individuals from adversary packs headed by Benjamin and Subbhaiah separately. Their contention started when Benjamin, a DYFI part, scrutinized the unlawful exercises of Subbhaiah who, aside from running a plastics and iron metal business, held kangaroo courts. At the point when their fight formed into a Christian-Hindu clash, they enrolled jobless men and framed posses to take up arms against one another. While Subbhaih's nephew Chera turned into his right-hand man, "Vellai" Ravi turned into Benjamin's helper. Benjamin and Ravi's group murdered Subbaiah in 1991. After a year, Chera's pack struck back by slaughtering Benjamin with the assistance of another group part, Asaithambi. Another hoodlum, Kabilan, joined Chera's pack and they executed in excess of fourteen individuals to retaliate for Subbaiah's homicide. One of the homicides occurred inside the Egmore court in mid 2000 when Chera's posse executed Ravi's helper Vijayakumar, prompting a police crackdown on the hoodlums. Dreading an experience, both "Vellai" Ravi and Chera chose to surrender their lives of wrongdoing and change. The then-DCP of Flower Bazaar, Shakeel Akhter, held the "change function" in February 2001. "Vellai" Ravi and Chera were re-captured under Goondas Act amid the film's pre-generation.
