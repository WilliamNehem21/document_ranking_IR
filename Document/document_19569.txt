The film received positive reviews from critics, particularly for the work of its technical crew. In 2006, W.Â Chandrakanth of "The Hindu" wrote: The greatness of the director lies hereÂ â he successfully reduces all characters to ordinary mortals displaying all the follies of human beings except Ghatothkacha or Krishna. And then he injects into the Yadava household a Telugu atmosphere, full with its simile, imagery, adage, sarcasm and wit. The resultÂ â a feast for the eyes and soul. That is "Mayabazar" for you. Vijaysree Venkatraman wrote for "The Hindu" in 2008 that the "special effects in this summer's Hollywood superhero movies were spectacular, but, for me, the mythological hasn't lost any of its magic", adding, "If watching the genial half-demon polish off a wedding feast single-handedly remains a treat, seeing the greedy duo from the groom's side get whacked alternately by the furniture and the wilful carpet has me in splits". "The Hindu" film critic M.Â L. Narasimham wrote: "Though there were several movie versions in various Indian languages, the 1957 Vijaya Productions' "Mayabazar" is still considered the best for its all round excellence". According to "The Times of India", "With a powerful cast and a strong script, this movie is a stealer. Savitri, NTR [N. T. Rama Rao], ANR [Akkineni Nageswara Rao], SVÂ Rangarao and not to mention Suryakantam add layers to their characters. Of course, the language and the dialogues, simply unbeatable. Some of the scenes are simply hilarious."
