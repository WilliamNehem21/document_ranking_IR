Harmony did not keep going for long, as the political unrest in Baghdad proceeded. In September 941, Ibn Ra'iq accepted yet again the post of "amir al-umara" at the welcome of Caliph al-Muttaqi (r. 940Ã¢ÂÂ 944), yet he was not as incredible as previously. Unfit to stop the development of another strongman, Abu'l-Husayn al-Baridi of Basra, both Ibn Ra'iq and the caliph were compelled to relinquish Baghdad and look for the assistance of the Hamdanid leader of Mosul. The last before long had Ibn Ra'iq killed (April 942) and succeeded him as "amir al-umara" with the "laqab" of Nasir al-Dawla. Al-Ikhshid utilized the chance to reoccupy Syria for himself, joining his powers face to face in June 942, and wandering the extent that Damascus, before coming back to Egypt in January 943. The Hamdanids likewise staked case on Syria in the meantime, however the sources don't record subtleties of their undertakings there. Nasir al-Dawla's situation as "amir al-umara" likewise turned out to be feeble, and in June 943 he was removed by the Turkish general Tuzun. In October, Caliph al-Muttaqi, expecting that Tuzun planned to supplant him, fled the capital and looked for shelter with the Hamdanids. In spite of the fact that Nasir al-Dawla and his sibling Sayf al-Dawla shielded the caliph, they likewise did not face Tuzun's troops, and in May 944 they achieved an understanding that gave Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria to the Hamdanids in return for perceiving Tuzun's ownership of Iraq. Nasir al-Dawla sent his cousin al-Husayn ibn Sa'id to assume control over the Syrian regions apportioned to him in this understanding. The Ikhshidid powers either abandoned or withdrew, and al-Husayn quickly assumed control over the regions of Qinnasrin and Hims.
