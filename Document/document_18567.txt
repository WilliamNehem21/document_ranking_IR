Below Imperial Dam, only a small portion of the Colorado River makes it beyond Yuma, Arizona, and the confluence with the intermittent Gila River â which carries runoff from western New Mexico and most of Arizona â before defining about of the MexicoâUnited States border. At Morelos Dam, the entire remaining flow of the Colorado is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, among Mexico's most fertile agricultural lands. Below San Luis RÃ­o Colorado, the Colorado passes entirely into Mexico, defining the Baja CaliforniaâSonora border; in most years, the stretch of the Colorado between here and the Gulf of California is dry or a trickle formed by irrigation return flows. The Hardy River provides most of the flow into the Colorado River Delta, a vast alluvial floodplain covering about of northwestern Mexico. A large estuary is formed here before the Colorado empties into the Gulf about south of Yuma. Before 20th-century development dewatered the lower Colorado, a major tidal bore was present in the delta and estuary; the first historical record was made by the Croatian missionary in Spanish service Father Ferdinand KonÅ¡Äak on JulyÂ 18, 1746. During spring tide conditions, the tidal bore â locally called "El Burro" â formed in the estuary about Montague Island in Baja California and propagated upstream.
