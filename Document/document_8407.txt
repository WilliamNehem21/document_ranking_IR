In June 1975 Lancaster was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honors. He and his better half teamed up on "The Pleasure Garden" (1977), a background marked by the British greenery enclosure. Albeit incredible gardens, for example, Stowe were given full inclusion, her content and his illustrations did not disregard progressively humble endeavors: "The rural greenery enclosure is the most vital patio nursery of the twentieth century and there is no reason other than obliviousness for utilizing the word 'rural' in a disparaging sense". The next year Lancaster was made a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) by the Royal Society of Arts, a refinement in which his forerunners had incorporated the craftsman and planner Hugh Casson; the typographer Eric Gill; Charles Holden, London Transport's modeler; Barnes Wallis, the wartime engineer; and an innovator draftsman with whom Lancaster had energetically challenged, Sir Basil Spence. There would not be another theater originator RDI until Stefanos Lazaridis in 2003. In 1978 Lancaster endured the first of a progression of strokes, and his wellbeing started a moderate decrease. He structured no more for the theater, drew his last pocket animation for the "Express" in May 1981, and distributed his last accumulation, "The Life and Times of Maudie Littlehampton" the next year.
