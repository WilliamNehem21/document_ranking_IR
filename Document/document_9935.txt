While the heft of the nineteenth Battalion set out for Kololo, a withdrew organization set up a snare position in a recreation center sitting above a road that drove towards the Jinja street. The Tanzanians assaulted two passing Ugandan Land Rovers, executing their three inhabitants. In one of the vehicles the warriors recouped a point by point plan for Kampala's barrier which indicated the contingents and leaders in charge of every division; most had officially scattered. By sunset the nineteenth Battalion had not found the Command Post. Kampala was tranquil and there was no power in the whole city, except for a solitary traffic light. In the end the Ugandan guide guided the unit to a fairway which the troops slice crosswise over to the base of Kololo. By 21:00 the Tanzanians were following private avenues up the slope. Disappointed by his guide's failure to find the Command Post, Msuya chose to swear off the area and set up his very own order post in a relinquished home while his unit burrowed channels and set up barricades. As per him, by 22:00 Kampala was under Tanzanian control. At 23:00 he held a toast with his officers to commend the catch of the city.
