The part from Boulevard to close to the Imperial County line was incorporated into the California Highway Commission spending plan for 1965Ã¢ÂÂ 1966. An expansion from Mountain Springs west to what was then known as Road J-35 was given $3.3ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) in financing by the Highway Commission in May 1965. The area in the middle of this one and the Mountain Springs pass segment was in arranging by that September, and was planned to start the structure stage presently, with the segment stretching out west of Boulevard to pursue. That segment, from Crestwood to Boulevard, was to start development not long after the $3ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) contract was given out in January 1966. The happening to the road from both west and east of Jacumba was anticipated to be a critical occasion ever of town. Bistros and corner stores left business once the road circumvent the town; be that as it may, numerous retirees migrated into the town since the high traffic levels were no more. The naming of the town Boulevard as Manzanita on I-8 signs raised debate and constrained the Division of Highways to cloud the name on the signs until the issue was settled.
