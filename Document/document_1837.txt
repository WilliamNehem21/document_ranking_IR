The Levels are a beach front sand and earth obstruction about above mean ocean level (generally west of the M5 motorway) while the inland Moors can be underneath pinnacle tides and have vast regions of peat. The topography of the zone is that of two bowls for the most part encompassed by slopes, the spillover from which frames waterways that initially wound over the plain yet have now been constrained by embanking and clyces.
