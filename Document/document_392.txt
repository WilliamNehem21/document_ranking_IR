Lody came back to Edinburgh on 17 September, taking the train from King's Cross to Edinburgh. He met a youthful Scottish lady, Ida McClyment, gave her his card and conversed with her some time before going into another carriage to smoke. There he caught a discussion between two men, one obviously a submariner making a trip to the maritime base at Rosyth and the other a mariner who discussed Harwich. Lody later declared his shock at how the two men were "talking in a somewhat free manner, thinking about the present occasions". One of the men discussed the troubles of serving on a submarine, while the other asked Lody: "What nation would you say you are? Are you from the opposite side?" Lody answered, "Indeed, I am an American." They started examining the war and discussed the ongoing sinking of the cruiser HMS "Pathfinder", which had turned into the principal send ever to be sunk by a torpedo terminated by a submarine. The mariner told Lody, "We are going to put out mines as the Germans have done as such. We have a major shock available for the Germans." Lody was not persuaded and, in the wake of shaking hands with the mariner, left the smoking vehicle.
