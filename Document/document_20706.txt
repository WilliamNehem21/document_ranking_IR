Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in MÃ¼hlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: "Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir", BWV 131; the early chorale cantata "Christ lag in Todes Banden", BWV 4 for Easter; "Gott ist mein KÃ¶nig", BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the "Actus Tragicus" for a funeral.
In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the , the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the , ("court capelle" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called "Hunting Cantata", BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) , on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.
