In his second discharge, Khalid Mohammed's wrongdoing show "Fiza", Roshan played Amaan, a guiltless Muslim kid who turns into a psychological militant after the 1992Ã¢ÂÂ 93 Bombay uproars. Roshan showed up in the film to grow his viewpoints as an on-screen character. Co-featuring Karisma Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan, "Fiza" was respectably fruitful in the cinematic world, and Roshan's execution earned him a second designation for Best Actor at the Filmfare service. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama applauded him as the creation's prime resource, complimenting his "non-verbal communication, his style, his demeanors, [and] his general persona." Roshan next showed up in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's activity dramatization "Mission Kashmir" (2000) close by Sanjay Dutt, Preity Zinta, and Jackie Shroff. Set in the valley of Kashmir amid the Indo-Pakistani clashes, the film tended to the themes of psychological oppression and wrongdoing, and was a monetary achievement. Roshan was attracted to his mind boggling job of a young fellow damaged by the revelation that his supportive dad had been in charge of the demise of his whole birth family. As Adarsh would like to think, Roshan "lights up the screen with his attractive nearness. His non-verbal communication, combined with his looks, is certain to win him approvals."
