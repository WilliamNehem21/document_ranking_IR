The discussion over the coinage was as warmed as ever, and the impacts of the frenzy had driven more conservatives to help canceling the coinage arrangements of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. All things being equal, the silverites revitalized their following at a tradition in Chicago, and the House of Representatives bantered for fifteen weeks before passing the cancelation by a significant edge.
