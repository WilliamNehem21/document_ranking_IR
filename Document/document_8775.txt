The species is a productive flowerer, and this, joined with the high outcrossing rates, results in huge seed yield. In one examination, the normal number of seeds created per "B.ÃÂ sessilis" plant was 622, contrasted and a normal of 2 for "B.ÃÂ dallanneyi". This incredibly high fertility can be comprehended as an adaption to ordinary bushfire. Most "Banksia" species can be set in one of two general gatherings as per their reaction to flame: "resprouters" endure fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, all the more once in a while, epicormic buds secured by thick bark; "reseeders" are executed by flame, however populaces are quickly restored through the enlistment of seedlings. "B.ÃÂ sessilis" is a reseeder, however it varies from numerous different reseeders in not being firmly serotinous: most by far of seeds are discharged suddenly in pre-winter, even without flame. The level of serotiny involves some logical inconsistency in the logical writing: it has been treated as "serotinous", "pitifully serotinous" and "non-serotinous". Despite the wording utilized, the monstrous unconstrained seed yield of "B.ÃÂ sessilis" is its essential survival system, and is effective to the point that the species has a notoriety for being a superb colonizer. Be that as it may, this system, together with its moderately long adolescent period, makes it helpless against excessively visit fire.
