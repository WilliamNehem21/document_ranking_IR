At the point when "The Thrill Book" stopped production, Street and Smith had various original copies in stock that had been obtained for the magazine. These were offered to other Street and Smith magazines, for example, "Ocean Stories" throughout the following couple of years. Greye La Spina repurchased her composition to "The Dead Wagon" in 1927 and exchanged it to "Strange Tales". Francis Stevens had sold three serials and three short stories to "The Thrill Book" that stayed unpublished: one of the serials, "Serapion", was distributed in "Argosy" in 1920, yet the destiny of the other two isn't knownÃ¢ÂÂthey may have been before titles for known works of hers. The three short stories are not known to have been distributed somewhere else. In 1940, John L. Nanovic, the manager of "Doc Savage" and "The Shadow", explored the rest of the "Rush Book" compositions, and proposed to Ralston that a couple of stories may be publishable in "Romantic tale Magazine", and furthermore recommended a couple of stories that John W. Campbell may be keen on for "Obscure". The next year Oliphant investigated ten of the original copies and returned them to Nanovic with his proposals. Campbell audited three of them and declined to take any; he likewise declined to take Murray Leinster's "The Great Catastrophe", which had been submitted to "The Thrill Book" and discovered autonomously of Nanovic's survey. Different magazines that considered and dismissed the narratives Oliphant prescribed included "Pieces of information", "Riddle", and "Analyst Story Magazine". The main story from "The Thrill Book's" stock that was utilized from this audit was Clyde Broadwell's "The Speed Demon's Vendetta", which was modified and distributed in "The Avenger" in March 1942 under the alias "Brixton", which Broadwell had utilized for a story he had sold to "The Thrill Book".
