"Soul Reaver" happens inside the anecdotal universe of Nosgoth, where the wellbeing of the land is fixing to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and every column thus is spoken to by a gatekeeper. Before the occasions of "Soul Reaver", the gatekeepers ended up degenerate, and, after Kain executed eight of them, he found he was the last one. Declining to forfeit himself to reestablish the Pillars, he bound Nosgoth to endless rot and continued to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to blockade the land. When of "Soul Reaver"s presentation, the vampires are currently the land's prevailing species and zenith predators, the people have been crushed, and the vampire clans have each asserted a locale of Nosgoth and directed their concentration toward inner issues. Obscure to the vampires, underneath Nosgoth sneaks The Elder God, an old and incredible substance. The Elder God controls the Wheel of Fate, a cycle of resurrection of spirits that circle the Wheel in a circle of fate; notwithstanding, on the grounds that vampires are undying, their spirits don't turn with the Wheel, making the land rot as the Wheel slows down. When that Raziel is restored a very long time after the amusement's opening true to life, Nosgoth is on the precarious edge of breakdown, minimal in excess of a no man's land wracked with upheavals and seismic tremors.
