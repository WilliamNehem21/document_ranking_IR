"Miniopterus aelleni" is known to live from above ocean level in northern and western Madagascar, at on Montagne d'Ambre, northern Madagascar, and from on Anjouan in the adjacent Comoros. On Madagascar, it has been recorded in timberland and collapses karst territories; its appropriation comprehensively covers that of "M.ÃÂ griveaudi" and the two have been found in a similar perch destinations on a few events. On Anjouan, "M.ÃÂ aelleni" is less basic than "M.ÃÂ griveaudi"; there, it is known from four examples just, all gathered in 2006. These originate from two close-by locales: a rough zone almost a waterway and an irritated timberland. These creatures, gathered in late November, were in regenerative condition, with two females pregnant and a third lactating. "M.ÃÂ griveaudi" were reproductively dynamic in the meantime, recommending that the conceptive periods of the two don't vary altogether. Albeit some biological and conduct information has been distributed on "Miniopterus manavi", the acknowledgment of a few obscure animal varieties inside this gathering, more than one of which may happen in some random area, renders the relationship of these information with any of the individual species questionable; be that as it may, types of "Miniopterus" for the most part feed on bugs. Since "M.ÃÂ aelleni" is across the board and happens in many ensured zones on Madagascar, Goodman and associates construed that its preservation status is secure.
