Make-up impacts craftsman Matthew Mungle was in charge of depicting the decay of Mulder's and Miles' bodies. Spotnitz was especially awed with Miles' dissection scene, calling it "something new to do [in the] late phase of the diversion". Since human bodies which have disintegrated in water moved toward becoming "grotesque[ly] ... deformed", Miles' body was "a conditioned down form of what the truth would be." To make the scene, mortar gauzes were utilized to make a cast of the front and back of Ansley's body; these, thus, were utilized to make a fiberglass cast. This was etched over with water earth to make the presence of an enlarged body. A while later, a form of the earth was made and a body suit made with latex. As the undertaking continued, Mungle sent photographs to Carter, who gave last endorsement. In Miles' shower scene, a blend of "red goo", which included strawberry jam, was put on Ansley's skin. Counterfeit skin, made from flimsy bits of urethane, was then set over this blend and warm water was siphoned through to make the fantasy of shedding tissue. Mungle supposedly had just six days to finish the prosthetics for the scene. Mungle later noticed that subsequent to being told what the scene would involve he asked, "on the off chance that we can make sense of something, might we be able to indicate it on TV?" While the studio endorsed the recording, Spotnitz later called the grouping "outrageously realistic"; he was shocked the succession moved beyond edits since it is hard to appear in a PG-appraised film.
