The praemaxillae have seven (tooth attachments) on each side, a similar number found in "Angaturama", "Cristatusaurus", "Suchomimus", and MNHN SAM 124 (alluded to "Spinosaurus"); MSNM V4047, another upper jaw example from "Spinosaurus", had just six. It can't be affirmed whether this lower number of teeth is because of ontogeny; for that, a bigger example measure is vital. An extensive diastema (hole in tooth push) isolates the third tooth attachment from the fourth; this is seen in all different spinosaurids, being littler in "Suchomimus". Another diastema of almost break even with length is found between the fifth and 6th alveolus; this diastema is seen in MNHN SAM 124 and is any longer in MSNM V4047 however is missing from "Suchomimus" and "Cristatusaurus". The maxilla section alluded to "Oxalaia" (MN 6119-V) has two alveoli and a broken third one that incorporates a fractional tooth. Like the praemaxilla, it had protected supplement waterways. It additionally includes a shallow scratch in the center, recommending it was situated close to the (hard nostrils). Little parts inside a portion of the rest of the alveoli demonstrate that not at all like its Early Cretaceous relatives "Suchomimus" and "Cristatusaurus", "Oxalaia" needed on its teeth. Aside from the single, practical tooth in every attachment, there were two substitution teeth, which as indicated by Kellner are "a typical component in sharks or in certain reptiles, yet not in theropods". A cross-area of the teeth demonstrated the ordinary oval shape shown by spinosaurs instead of the parallel pressure of other theropod teeth.
