The main known skull, having a place with the biggest example, measures from the premaxilla at the front to the back of the occipital condyle. The most extensive piece of the skull behind the eyes is just wide in correlation. The skull was like those of different ornithomimosaurs in being low and tight, yet varied in that the nose was increasingly extended. The skull bone dividers were fairly flimsy, about . It had an adjusted, straightened nose, which would have been shrouded by keratin throughout everyday life. The nostrils were turned upwards, and the nasal bone was a restricted lash that reached out up over the eye attachments. The external breadth of the sclerotic rings in the eyes was little, , contrasted with the measure of the skull. The lower worldly fenestrae, openings behind the eyes, were in part stopped by the jugal bones, like "Gallimimus". The jaws were toothless and down-turned, and the lower jaw was exceptionally enormous and profound contrasted with the thin and low upper jaw. The overall size of the lower jaw was nearer to that of tyrannosaurids than to different ornithomimosaurs. The nose was spatulate (flared outwards to the sides) and wide, which is more extensive than the skull rooftop. This shape is like the nose of duck-charged hadrosaurids.
