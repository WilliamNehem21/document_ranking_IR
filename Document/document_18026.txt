"Neptune" was the first British dreadnought with her secondary armament of sixteen 50-calibre BL four-inch (102Â mm) Mark VII guns installed in unshielded single mounts in the superstructure. This change was made to address the problems that plagued the turret-roof locations used in earlier battleships. Notably, the exposed guns were difficult to work when the main armament was in action as was replenishing their ammunition. Furthermore, the guns could not be centrally controlled to coordinate fire at the most dangerous targets. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15Â° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. Four quick-firing three-pounder () Hotchkiss saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 18-inch (450Â mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 18 torpedoes were provided.
