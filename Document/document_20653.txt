The British squadron spotted the Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time â the engagement commenced shortly after dawn), but the Germans were already aware of their presence, "Prinz Eugen"s hydrophones having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with "Hood" engaging "Prinz Eugen", the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on "Hood". "Prinz Eugen" was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit "Hood"s boat deck, between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.
Just before 06:00, while "Hood" was turning 20Â° to port to unmask her rear turrets, she was hit again on the boat deck by one or more shells from "Bismarck"s fifth salvo, fired from a range of approximately . A shell from this salvo appears to have hit the spotting top, as the boat deck was showered with body parts and debris. A huge jet of flame burst out of "Hood" from the vicinity of the mainmast, followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of "Hood", and the last sight of the ship, which sank in only three minutes, was her bow, nearly vertical in the water. A note on a survivor's sketch in the British RN Historical Branch Archives gives as the position of the sinking. "Hood" sank stern first with 1418 men aboard. Only three survived: Ordinary Signalman Ted Briggs, Able Seaman Robert Tilburn, and Midshipman William John Dundas. The three were rescued about two hours after the sinking by the destroyer , which spotted substantial debris but no bodies.
