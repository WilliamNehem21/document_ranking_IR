Present day commentators have associated the novella's subjects of racial division to a fierce scene in Port Jervis' history. On June 2, 1892, an African-American man named Robert Lewis was lynched for purportedly attacking a nearby white lady. On his way to the Port Jervis correctional facility, Lewis was set upon by a crowd of a few hundred white men who hauled him through the town, beat him and draped him from a tree. William Howe Crane lived inside sight of where the lynching occurred and was one of only a handful couple of men, together with the head of police, who endeavored to mediate. In spite of the fact that Stephen Crane was absent, there were nitty gritty records distributed in both the "Port Jervis Gazette" and the "New-York Tribune", and Crane added to the "Tribune" at the time. The "Journal" denoted the day of Lewis' lynching as "a standout amongst the most offensive scenes that was ever sanctioned in Port Jervis", and dissident Ida B. Wells propelled a crusade to examine the homicide just as the across the board hypothesis that Lewis was set up. Of the 1,134 announced lynchings all through the United States somewhere in the range of 1882 and 1899, Lewis was the main dark man to be lynched in New York.
