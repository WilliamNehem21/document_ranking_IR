"Mutsu", named for Mutsu Province, was set down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 1 June 1918 and propelled on 31 May 1920. Financing for the ship had incompletely originated from gifts from schoolchildren. While "Mutsu" was all the while fitting out, the American government called a gathering in Washington, D.C. late in 1921 to hinder the costly maritime weapons contest that was creating between the United States, the United Kingdom and the Empire of Japan. The Washington Naval Conference gathered on 12 November and the Americans proposed to scrap for all intents and purposes each capital ship under development or being fitted out by the taking an interest countries. "Mutsu" was explicitly recorded among those to be rejected despite the fact that she had been appointed half a month sooner. This was unsuitable to the Japanese representatives; they consented to a trade off that enabled them to keep "Mutsu" in return for rejecting the out of date man of war , with a comparative course of action for a few American battleships that were fitting out. "Mutsu" was authorized on 24 October 1921 with Captain Shizen Komaki in direction. Commander Seiichi Kurose expected direction on 18 November and the ship was alloted to the first Battleship Division on 1 December. "Mutsu" facilitated Edward, Prince of Wales, and his confidant and second cousin, Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten, on 12 April 1922 amid the ruler's visit to Japan.
