The 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, were the first to incorporate a challenge in ladies' field hockey. Pre-competition top picks included Australia, the Netherlands and West Germany, yet the American-drove Western blacklist of the Moscow Olympics prompted these groups and others pulling back, leaving just the Soviets in the ladies' hockey occasion. The Soviet and worldwide Olympic specialists filled the holes by welcoming groups from nations that had not qualified. Among the countries welcomed was Zimbabwe, which had turned into a globally perceived nation in April 1980 after seven years of common war. Moscow denoted the southern African country's arrival to the Olympics following 16 years; as Rhodesia it had been avoided from the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Games for political reasons following the generally white government's revelation of freedom from Britain in 1965. The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee got the welcome to send people's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were because of begin. They were shocked absolutelyÃ¢ÂÂthey had not readied hockey groups for the GamesÃ¢ÂÂhowever all things considered consented to send a ladies' squad. No ladies' hockey group speaking to the nation had ever played abroad previously.
