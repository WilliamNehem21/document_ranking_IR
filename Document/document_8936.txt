Prior to 1983, USÃÂ 2 utilized an alternate steering through Manistique and crossed the Manistique River on what is nicknamed the "Siphon Bridge". Worked as a piece of a raceway flume on the stream, the water level is really higher than the street surface. This delivers a siphon impact, giving the extension its moniker. The Manistique Pulp and Paper Company was composed in 1916 and required a dam on the Manistique River to supply their factory. This dam would require an extensive segment of the city to be overflowed, and shallow stream banks implied troubles in any scaffold development. Rather than costly barriers, a solid tank was assembled the long way in the stream bed; the sides of this tank gave man-made banks higher than the common banks. The Michigan Works Progress Administration portrayed the scaffold as having "solid bulkheads, framed by the side ranges of the extension, [that] enable the factory to keep up the water level a few feet over the roadbed." The Manistique Tourism Council expressed: "At one time, the scaffold itself was incompletely upheld by the water that was barometrically constrained under it," and that the extension has been included in "Ripley's Believe It or Not!". The eight-length structure is long.
