The total cost of "Kronan" was estimated at 326,000 silver dalers in contemporary currency, and about half of the cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the armaments. It was therefore in the interest of the Swedish Navy to salvage as many of the cannons as possible. In the early 1660s almost all the guns from "Vasa" had been brought up through greatly improved technology. Commander Paul Rumpf and Admiral Hans Wachtmeister were put in charge of the salvage of "Kronan's" cannons. With the help of diving bells, they were able to raise 60 cannons worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. JuneâAugust) of 1679â86, beginning as soon as the war with Denmark had ended. In the 1960s, diving expert Bo Cassel made some successful descents to "Vasa" with a diving bell made according to 17th-century specifications. In 1986, further experiments were done on "Kronan". The tests proved successful and the conclusion was that the 17th-century operations must have required considerable experience, skill and favorable weather conditions. Though the conditions off Ãland were often difficult, with cold water and unpredictable weather, and required a large crew, the expeditions were very profitable. Historian BjÃ¶rn Axel Johansson has calculated that the total cost for the entire crew for all eight diving seasons was less than 2,000 dalers, the value of one of "Kronan's" 36-pounder guns.
