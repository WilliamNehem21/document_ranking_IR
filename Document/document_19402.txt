On 4 February BÃ¤r led I. "Gruppe" into action against Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers from the 97th and 301st Bomb Group and their Lockheed P-38 Lightning escorts from the 1st Fighter Group. BÃ¤r claimed one B-17. On 15 February BÃ¤r claimed two USAAF Spitfires. The American pilots were possibly Lieutenant Joe Reed and H. E Huntingdon from the 31st Fighter Group. After an uncredited claim on 24 February over a P-40 BÃ¤r accounted for five on two days later. German fighter units claimed 13 against an actual 14 (possible 15) and several more damaged. Seven of the British pilots were unhurt. The following day he was credited with another P-40 in combat with 11 pilots from 4 Squadron SAAF. Records suggest he may have claimed three but was only credited with one.
BÃ¤r and his I. Gruppe of JGÂ 77 operated from Fatnassa, Tunisia, in early March 1943. On 1st or 2 March, BÃ¤r claimed a Spitfire shot down. Then in the evening met Galland, who was making a surprise visit to I./JGÂ 77. Galland was greeted by "Major" Joachim MÃ¼ncheberg, who introduced BÃ¤r to Galland. Thus began a comradeship which outlasted World War II. On 6 March 92 Squadron Spitfires provided cover for 1 SAAF Squadron. They were supported by 601. BÃ¤r spotted their approach and climbed then dived onto the British. BÃ¤r accounted for two SpitfiresâFlight Sergeant Tilston, from 601, was forced to bale out and Flying Officer Mahon from the South African unit was killed.
