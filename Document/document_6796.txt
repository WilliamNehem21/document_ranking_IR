Discharged in June 1968, the collection highlighted a hallucinogenic spread planned by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The first of a few Pink Floyd collection covers structured by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI allowed one of their gatherings to contract originators for a collection coat. The discharge topped at number 9, going through 11 weeks on the UK outline. "Record Mirror" gave the collection a generally speaking ideal survey, however asked audience members to "overlook it as ambient sounds to a gathering". John Peel portrayed a live exhibition of the title track as "like a religious encounter", while "NME" depicted the tune as "long and boringÃÂ ... [with] little to warrant its dull course". On the day after the collection's UK discharge, Pink Floyd performed at the primary ever free show in Hyde Park. In July 1968, they came back to the US for a second visit. Joined by the Soft Machine and the Who, it checked Pink Floyd's first critical visit. In December of that year, they discharged "Point Me at the Sky"; not any more fruitful than the two singles they had discharged since "See Emily Play", it would be the band's last until their 1973 discharge, "Cash".
