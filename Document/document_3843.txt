The Wei (220Ã¢ÂÂ 265) and Jin Dynasty (265Ã¢ÂÂ 420) cartographer and authority Pei Xiu (224Ã¢ÂÂ 271) was the first in China to portray in full the geometric matrix reference for maps that took into account exact estimations utilizing a graduated scale, just as geological rise. In any case, map-production in China had existed since at any rate the 4thÃÂ centuryÃÂ BC with the Qin state maps found in Gansu in 1986. Pinpointed precision of the twisting courses of waterways and nature with scaled separation had been known since the Qin and Han Dynasty, separately, as prove by their current maps, while the utilization of a rectangular matrix had been referred to in China since the Han also. History specialist Howard Nelson expresses that, in spite of the fact that the records of Zhang Heng's work in cartography are to some degree obscure and scrappy, there is sufficient composed proof that Pei Xiu inferred the utilization of the rectangular network reference from the maps of Zhang Heng. Rafe de Crespigny states that it was Zhang who set up the rectangular lattice framework in Chinese cartography. Needham brings up that the title of his book "Flying Bird Calendar" may have been an error, and that the book is all the more precisely entitled "Elevated Map". Antiquarian Florian C. Reiter noticed that Zhang's account "Guitian fu" contains an expression about extolling the maps and records of Confucius of the Zhou Dynasty, which Reiter recommends places maps ("tu") on an equivalent dimension of significance with archives ("shu"). It is archived that a physical topography map was first exhibited by Zhang Heng in 116 AD, called a "Ti Hsing Thu".
