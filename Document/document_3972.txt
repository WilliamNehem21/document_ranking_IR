Soon after Etty joined the RA, four noteworthy addresses on painting were conveyed by John Opie in February and March 1807. In them, Opie said that composition "brings into view the legends, sages, and wonders of the soonest periods, the occupants of the most removed districts, and fixes and propagates the types of the present day; it presents to us the courageous deeds, the striking occasions, and the fascinating instances of devotion, energy and humankind all things considered; and as per the idea of the activity delineated, fills us with honest joy, energizes our extreme aversion of violations, moves us to devotion, or motivates us with raised estimations". Opie rejected Reynolds' custom of romanticizing the subjects of works of art, seeing that he didn't trust "that the tissue of legends is less similar to substance than that of other men". Opie prompted his understudies to give extraordinary consideration to Titian, whose utilization of shading he thought about amazing, exhorting understudies that "shading is the daylight of the craftsmanship, that garments neediness in grins [...] and copies the charms of magnificence. Opie's suppositions established a profound connection on the youthful Etty, and he would hold these perspectives all through his profession.
