"The World Is Not Enough" got primarily positive surveys from music pundits. "Kerrang!" magazine noticed that "Nothing brings a band into the really undying like a Bond topic, and Garbage's consistently prospering VIP will be done no damage at all by this properly rich and symphonic hymn." A "Radio Times" analyst composed that the tune "sounds like Shirley Bassey returned to", while AllMusic's Steve Thomas Erlewine composed that Garbage "expertly modernized the exemplary Bond sound, while turning in a solid melodic tune. A top of the line signature tune". PopMatters considered the tune a "choice Bond subject", after the Shirley Bassey format. In a "Board" survey, Chuck Taylor composed that Garbage was a propelled decision and the tune "rings of universal interest, with the smooth walk, noir-ish guitar line and terrific chorale we have come to expectÃÂ ... the tune's obscurely provocative, electronic feeling is completely with regards to Garbage's particular soundprint. [It is] not just the best 007 subject in ages, it is an extraordinary Garbage track that should excite aficionados of band and Bond alike". IGN positioned "The World Is Not Enough" ninth on its rundown of top 10 James Bond tunes: "Shirley Manson's chattering murmur is an ideal fit for an opening arrangement and her bandmates gel well with Arnold's general symphonics."
