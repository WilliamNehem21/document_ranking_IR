In October 1999, in the year following Tippett's passing, "A Child of Our Time" got an overdue New York Philharmonic debut, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The "New York Times" commentator, Paul Griffiths, communicated some surprise this was the ensemble's first endeavor at the work. As a feature of the festivals for the century of the arranger's introduction to the world in January 2005, English National Opera organized a sensationalized exhibition of the work, coordinated by Jonathan KentÃ¢ÂÂfortuitously, the main execution fell in the seven day stretch of the 60th commemoration of the freedom of the concentration camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in "The Independent", perceived the work's truthfulness yet found the sensation of its radical message entirely unseemly: "Do we truly need to see twelve all around bolstered on-screen characters and artists stripped and drove into a smoking pit so as to comprehend the Holocaust?" Anthony Holden in "The Observer" was progressively positive, remarking that "On the off chance that you should organize a work proposed for show execution ... it is difficult to envision a more successful rendition than Kent's, shot through with overwhelming imagery of which Tippett would without a doubt have affirmed." Nevertheless, Holden found the general outcome "super-serious, swaying between the over-literalistic and the ominous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1Ã¢ÂÂ 8 May) were set apart at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by an exceptional act of "A Child within recent memory", in which the Washington Chorus was coordinated by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.
