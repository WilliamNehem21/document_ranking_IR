A report in "The Field" expressed: "The outcome was a more simple triumph for Mr Spencer Gore than had been normal.". Third-set Heathcote said that Gore was the best player of the year and had a fluctuated administration with a great deal of contort on it. Violence, as indicated by Heathcote, was a player with a fitness for some diversions and had a long reach and a solid and adaptable wrist. His volleying style was novel at the time, a commanding shot rather than congratulatory gesture over the net. Every one of the adversaries who were crushed by Gore on his way to the title were genuine tennis players. His triumph was consequently viewed as a success of the rackets style of play over the genuine tennis style, and of the hostile style of the volley player Ã¢ÂÂ who goes to the net to drive the point, over the benchmark player Ã¢ÂÂ who plays groundstrokes from the back of the court, plan on keeping the ball in play. His volleying diversion was additionally effective on the grounds that the stature of the net at the post Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ft (1.52 m) rather than the cutting edge tallness of 3ÃÂ ft 6 in (1.07 m) Ã¢ÂÂ made it troublesome for his adversaries to pass him by driving the ball down the line. Carnage demonstrated that the genuine tennis players tended to play shots from corner to corner over the center of the net and did as such at such a stature, that made volleying simple.
