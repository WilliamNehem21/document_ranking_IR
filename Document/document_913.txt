Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis, alongside Norah Jones, performed two shows at Lincoln Center's Rose Theater on February 9 and 10, 2009. A 2011 live tribute collection by Nelson and Marsalis highlighting Jones entitled "" was recorded on these two live dates. The collection, which was discharged on March 29, 2011, incorporated a track entitled "Here We Go Again". The vocals on "Here We Go Again" were performed by Jones and Nelson, while instrumental help was given by Marsalis (trumpet), Dan Nimmer (piano), Mickey Raphael (harmonica), Walter Blanding (tenor saxophone), Carlos Henriquez (bass) and Ali Jackson (drums and percussion). The tune, which had a length of 5:10, was masterminded by Andy Farber and performed in a beat and blues 12/8 mix. BBC music analyst Bill Tilland noticed that Jones included her standard thing "style and panache" to this execution. At one show execution, "The New York Times" faultfinder Nate Chinen felt the tune sounded unrehearsed. In spite of the fact that study of this track is inadequate, "Pop Matters" Will Layman takes note of that the collection uncovers "how conclusive and solid Jones sounds while singing with a genuinely real jazz gathering" and how Nelson typically "easily gets through his tunes with high handed effortlessness". In the interim, he adulates the expert authority of Marsalis' quintet. Tilland additionally takes note of that on the collection Marsalis' band "repays satisfactorily for incidental dull vocals."
