In 2004, Charles re-recorded "Here We Go Again" as a two part harmony with American artist lyricist Norah Jones, who grew up tuning in to his music. Amid Jones' "Announcement" meet for her 2010 joint effort collection "...Featuring", which incorporated her "Here We Go Again" two part harmony, she said "I got a call from Ray inquiring as to whether I'd be keen on singing on this two part harmonies record. I jumped on the following plane and I brought my mother. We went to his studio and did it live with the band. I sang it directly alongside Ray, watching his mouth for the expressing. He was extremely sweet and comforted me, which was incredible in light of the fact that I was petrified strolling in there." She noted in one "...Featuring" meet that the main part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added a while later to supplement Charles' console. In a similar meeting, she noticed that she had been allowed the chance to choose a melody from Charles' songbook to execute as a two part harmony and felt that this one gave the best chance to fit as opposed to interchange vocal refrains. On the record, the two artists vocalize, joined by Billy Preston on Hammond organ, who had at one time been the standard organist in Charles' band.
