"Arrival", directed by Denis Villeneuve and based on Ted Chiang's short story "Story of Your Life", ranks among the most acclaimed films of Adams's career. The film is about Louise Banks, a linguist (played by Adams), who experiences strange visions when she is hired by the American government to interpret the language of extraterrestrials. She was drawn to the idea of playing an intellectual female lead and connected with the film's theme of unity and compassion. She watched documentaries on linguistics to prepare for the part. Writing for "The Atlantic", Christoper Orr deemed Adams's performance to be "mesmerizingly open, by turns uplifting and sorrowful", and Kenneth Turan of the "Los Angeles Times" believed that the film was a "showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve". "Arrival" was a commercial success, earning over $200 million against a $47 million budget. Adams received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations in the Best Actress category. Several journalists expressed disappointment over her failure to receive an Oscar nomination for it. Adams played Lois Lane for the third time in "Justice League" (2017), an ensemble film about the titular superheroes. The critic Tim Grierson of "Screen International" commented that despite providing "emotional resonance" to the film, Adams's talents were wasted in a thankless supporting role.
