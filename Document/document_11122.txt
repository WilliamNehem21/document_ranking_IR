Now, as in different recreations, the closure shifts. Deferring too long will result in Yeesha (who is in certainty Sirrus) taking Achenar's crossbow and shooting first him, at that point the Stranger. The silver switch will discharge Yeesha (once more, controlled by Sirrus), who drops an extensive stone on Achenar and the Stranger, and after that shoots the Stranger dead. In the great consummation, the Stranger pulls the golden switch, turning around the mind-exchange process. But since of the age of the Memory Chamber, it ends up flimsy; Achenar advises the Stranger to come back to Dream and set Yeesha's recollections right, while he utilizes the Life Stone to settle the chamber by embeddings it into the chamber's holy place, harming him with its contained dangerous spores. In Dream, the Stranger finds a colossal animal, speaking to Sirrus' Dream-structure, moored to Yeesha's substance and keeping her from coming back to her body; with no soul manage, Sirrus is compelled to stick to Yeesha to abstain from being lost for eternity. He keeps up his grapples by muddling up Yeesha's recollections. The Stranger reestablishes Yeesha's recollections and liberates her from Sirrus' grip; Sirrus' Dream-structure is crushed by the moving influxes of Dream, executing him. The Stranger stirs to discover Achenar, lethally harmed, affirming that the exchange was fruitful; he bites the dust in a matter of seconds a while later. The Stranger at that point comes back to Tomahna to meet with Atrus, who says that Catherine has taken Yeesha to Tay (the "rebel Age" used to empty Catherine's kin in "Riven"), and comments that while his children are gone, his little girl is sheltered.
