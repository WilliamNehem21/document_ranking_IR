Differences between the noblemen and the lord escalated. The nobles, under Simon de Montfort, sixth Earl of Leicester, caught the vast majority of southeast England in the Second Barons' War. At the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Henry and Prince Edward were vanquished and taken prisoner. De Montfort collected the Great Parliament, perceived as the primary Parliament since it was the first run through the urban areas and precincts had sent agents. Edward got away, raised a military and crushed and executed de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Savage retaliation was perpetrated upon the radicals, and specialist reestablished to Henry. With the domain now tranquil, Edward left England to join Louis IX on the Ninth Crusade; he was one of the last crusaders. Louis kicked the bucket before Edward's entry, yet Edward chose to proceed. The outcome was baffling; Edward's little power just empowered him to catch Acre and dispatch a bunch of assaults. Subsequent to enduring a death endeavor, Edward left for Sicily later in the year, never to take an interest in a campaign again. At the point when Henry III passed on, Edward consented to the position of authority; the noblemen swore faithfulness to him despite the fact that he didn't return for a long time.
