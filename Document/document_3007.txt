On 8 March 1944, precisely a half year from their landing, the Jews from the family camp who had touched base in September were altogether gassed without a determination to locate those ready to work. Pestek safeguarded Neumann and her mom by incidentally moving them to an alternate square. Lederer was named square senior (BlockÃÂ¤ltester) of Block 14 inside the family camp soon thereafter. Alfred Cierer, a Czech Jewish industrialist, and his child Jakov Tsur moved in light of the fact that they knew Lederer. Acknowledging he would need to act rapidly to spare Neumann's life, Pestek started to approach other detainee functionaries and offer to enable them to get away. Among them were Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, who denied the offer since they trusted it was a trap, and prompted different detainees not to trust Pestek. Already, a SS man named DobrovolnÃÂ½Ã¢ÂÂan ethnic German from SlovakiaÃ¢ÂÂhad met a Jewish cherished companion at Auschwitz. DobrovolnÃÂ½ offered to enable him to escape however at that point handed him over, bringing about his fierce execution and a reward for the SS man. This and comparable episodes influenced Vrba, Wetzler and different detainees that watchmen couldn't be trusted under any conditions. As indicated by Wetzler, Pestek let him know, "I loathe myself for watching ladies and youngsters be executed. I need to accomplish something to overlook the smell of consuming human fragile living creature and feel a little more clean." Pestek likewise moved toward the Czech Josef Neumann (not a relative of RenÃÂ©e Neumann), a kapo on the "Leichenkommando", which was in charge of the transfer of cadavers; Neumann won't.
