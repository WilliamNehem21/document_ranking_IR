English approach in South Africa was to energize alliance between the British-run Cape Colony and Natal, and the Boer republics, the Transvaal (attached by Britain in 1877) and the Orange Free State. The legislative leader of Cape Colony, Sir Bartle Frere, trusting that the league couldn't be practiced until the local clans recognized British standard, made requests on the Zulu and their lord, Cetewayo, which they were sure to dismiss. As Zulu troops couldn't wed until they had washed their lances in blood, they were energetic for battle. Frere did not reach out to the bureau of what he had done until the final proposal was going to terminate. Disraeli and the bureau reluctantly upheld him, and toward the beginning of January 1879 made plans to send fortifications. Before they could touch base, on 22 January, a Zulu "impi", or armed force, moving with incredible speed and stealth, trapped and pulverized a British place to stay in South Africa in the Battle of Isandlwana. Over a thousand British and frontier troops were executed. Expression of the annihilation did not achieve London until 12 February. Disraeli composed the following day, "the horrendous fiasco has shaken me to the middle". He denounced Frere, yet abandoned him in control, pulling in flame from all sides. Disraeli sent General Sir Garnet Wolseley as High Commissioner and Commander in Chief, and Cetewayo and the Zulus were pulverized at the Battle of Ulundi on 4 July 1879.
