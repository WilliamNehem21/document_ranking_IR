An area of thunderstorms increased near the FSM on SeptemberÂ 15 within the monsoon trough. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, its convection was intermittent around a weak circulation. On SeptemberÂ 18, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), and the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression; however, the two warning agencies were tracking different circulations within the same system, and by SeptemberÂ 19 the circulation JMA was tracking became the dominant system. Shortly thereafter, the agency downgraded the system to a low pressure area after it weakened. The next day, JMA again upgraded the system to a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued a second TCFA when the system had a partially exposed circulation near an area of increasing convection. Late on SeptemberÂ 21, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Changmi to the south of Japan. The next day, Changmi attained peak winds of 85Â km/h (50Â mph). However, the JTWC noted that the system was absorbing dry air and becoming extratropical, and thus did not issue warnings on the storm. Moving northeastward, Changmi became an extratropical cyclone on SeptemberÂ 22, and gradually became more intense until crossing the International Date Line early on SeptemberÂ 25.
