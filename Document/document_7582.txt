On 11 May, BÃÂ¤r was exchanged from IV./JGÃÂ 51 on the Moscow front to assume responsibility for I. "Gruppe" of Gordon Gollob's "Jagdgeschwader" 77 (JGÃÂ 77) flying wing. BÃÂ¤r supplanted Herbert Ihlefeld who had been exchanged. JGÃÂ 77 was entrusted with supporting the hard battling in the Crimean Campaign over the Kerch Strait on the Crimean Peninsula. Driven by the flying pros ("Experten") Gollob and BÃÂ¤r, JGÃÂ 77 assumed control over the air space above Kerch-Taman as Gollob and BÃÂ¤r shot down two and three LaGG-3s individually, raising BÃÂ¤r's triumph aggregate to 93. Shared ill will between the two men, Gollob, a slave driver professional Nazi, and BÃÂ¤r, an enemy of tyrant, guaranteed a serious contention. On 19 May 1942, BÃÂ¤r guaranteed five further ethereal triumphsÃ¢ÂÂincluding a Polikarpov R-5 toward the beginning of the day and four Polikarpov I-16s in a single evening mission: his triumph absolute presently remained at 103. He was the ninth Luftwaffe pilot to accomplish the century mark. That equivalent day, Inspector of Fighters ("General der Jagdflieger") Adolf Galland touched base to investigate BÃÂ¤r's I./JGÃÂ 77 and JGÃÂ 77 outperformed 2,000 triumphs. This flying accomplishment earned BÃÂ¤r a second notice in the day by day "Wehrmachtbericht" on 20 May 1942.
