Real H. Wrigley's 2/fifth Infantry Battalion of Brigadier Stanley Savige's seventeenth Infantry Brigade, fortified by two organizations of Lieutenant Colonel T. G. Walker's 2/seventh Infantry Battalion, presently assumed control over the development. The brigade's assignment was to clear "The Triangle", a guide include made by the convergence of three tracks north of Post 16. Wrigley's power had a long and depleting approach, and a lot of its development forward to its bounce off point had been under Italian shellfire expected for the sixteenth Infantry Brigade. Anticipating its swing to move, the power looked for sanctuary in Wadi Scemmas and its tributaries. Wrigley called a last planning gathering for 1030, however at 1020 he was injured by a shot and his second in order, Major G. E. Sell dominated. At the gathering the forward eyewitness from the 2/second Field Regiment announced that he had lost contact with the weapons and couldn't bring in mounted guns discharge. An injured British tank troop leader likewise detailed that one of his tanks had been thumped out and the other three were out of fuel or ammo. No tank backing would be accessible until these had been recharged. Sell chose that the assault must be done without them.
