USÂ 141 starts at an interchange with I-43 southeast of Green Bay in the suburb of Bellevue. From the terminus at exitÂ 178, USÂ 141 runs north to Main Street, and then northwesterly along Main Street through town. Wisconsin HighwayÂ 29 (WISÂ 29) merges with USÂ 141 at an intersection on the northwest side of Bellevue, and the two highways run concurrently through residential subdivisions. Main Street passes over I-43 and continues to the north and into the city of Green Bay. USÂ 141/WISÂ 29 crosses Baird Creek and runs along the banks of the East River. At the intersection with Monroe Avenue, WISÂ 29 turns south, joining WISÂ 54/WISÂ 57 while USÂ 141 continues westward on Main Street to cross the Fox River on the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge. On the west side of the river, the highway follows Dousman Street for a block before turning north along Broadway Avenue for four blocks. From there, the highway follows Mather Street west to Velp Avenue. USÂ 141 follows that street northwesterly and parallel to I-43 on the north side of Green Bay. This area is mostly residential with some businesses immediately on either side. In the suburb of Howard, USÂ 141 merges onto the USÂ 41 freeway via the interchange at exitÂ 170. USÂ 41/USÂ 141 has an interchange for I-43 just south of the Duck Creek crossing.
