The significance of Emily's association with Susan has broadly been ignored because of a point of view previously advanced by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's long-term special lady, who lessened Susan's job in Emily's life because of her own poor association with her sweetheart's better half. In any case, the idea of a "merciless" SusanÃ¢ÂÂas advanced by her sentimental opponentÃ¢ÂÂhas been addressed, most particularly by Susan and Austin's enduring youngsters, with whom Emily was close. Numerous researchers translate the connection among Emily and Susan as a sentimental one. In "The Emily Dickinson Journal" Lena Koski stated, "Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express solid homoerotic sentiments." She cites from a significant number of their letters, incorporating one from 1852 in which Emily broadcasts, "Susie, will you in reality return home next Saturday, and be my own once more, and kiss meÃÂ ... I trust in you so much, and feel so enthusiastic for you, feel that I can't pause, feel that now I should have youÃ¢ÂÂthat the desire afresh to see your face once more, makes me feel hot and hot, and my heart pulsates so fastÃÂ ... my dear, so close I appear to you, that I hate this pen, and sit tight for a hotter language." The connection among Emily and Susan is depicted in the film "Wild Nights with Emily".
