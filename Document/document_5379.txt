In the lower dimensions of association, there was greater consistency: squadrons of three or five boats were instructed by a "komÃÂs" or "droungarokomÃÂs", and each ship's chief was designated "kentarchos" ("centurion"), albeit artistic sources additionally utilized progressively age-old terms like "nauarchos" or even "triÃÂrarchos". Each ship's group, contingent upon its size, was made out of one to three "ousiai". Under the skipper, there was the "bandophoros" ("pennant conveyor"), who went about as official officer, two "prÃÂtokaraboi" (sing. "prÃÂtokarabos", "leader of the ship"), in some cases likewise alluded to obsoletely as "kybernÃÂtes", and a bow officer, the "prÃÂreus". The "prÃÂtokaraboi" were helmsmen, accountable for the controlling paddles in the stern, just as of the rowers on either side of the ship. The senior of the two was the "first "prÃÂtokarabos" ("prÃÂtos prÃÂtokarabos"). In real terms, there likely were a few of every sort upon each ship, working in movements. The vast majority of these officers ascended from the positions, and there are references in the "De Administrando Imperio" to first rowers ("prÃÂtelatai") who rose to progress toward becoming "prÃÂtokaraboi" in the magnificent freight boats, and later expected still higher workplaces; Emperor Romanos Lekapenos being the best model. There were additionally various masters ready, for example, the two bow rowers and the "siphÃÂnatores", who worked the siphons utilized for releasing the Greek fire. A "boukinatÃÂr" ("trumpeter") is likewise recorded in the sources, who passed on requests to the rowers ("kÃÂpÃÂlatai" or "elatai"). Since the marine infantry were composed as normal armed force units, their positions pursued those of the military.
