Paparrigopoulos lauds Demosthenes' energy, yet reprimands him as being silly. As indicated by this scrutinize, Demosthenes ought to have comprehended that the old Greek states could just endure bound together under the authority of Macedon. In this way, Demosthenes is blamed for misconceiving occasions, adversaries and openings and of being unfit to anticipate Philip's inescapable triumph. He is censured for having exaggerated Athens' ability to restore and challenge Macedon. His city had lost the greater part of its Aegean partners, though Philip had combined his hold over Macedonia and was ace of tremendous mineral riches. Chris Carey, an educator of Greek in UCL, presumes that Demosthenes was a superior speaker and political administrator than strategist. All things considered, a similar researcher underscores that "realists" like Aeschines or Phocion had no rousing vision to equal that of Demosthenes. The speaker requested that the Athenians pick what is simply and good, before their very own wellbeing and conservation. The general population favored Demosthenes' activism and even the severe annihilation at Chaeronea was viewed as a value worth paying in the endeavor to hold opportunity and impact. As indicated by Professor of Greek Arthur Wallace Pickarde, achievement might be a poor measure for making a decision about the activities of individuals like Demosthenes, who were propelled by the perfect of political freedom. Athens was asked by Philip to forfeit its opportunity and its majority rules system, while Demosthenes yearned for the city's brightness. He tried to restore its jeopardized qualities and, in this manner, he turned into an "instructor of the general population" (in the expressions of Werner Jaeger).
