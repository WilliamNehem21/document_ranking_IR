As indicated by oral custom, copyists utilized obsidian pieces or little shark teeth, probably the hafted devices still used to cut wood in Polynesia, to woodwind and finish the tablets and after that to etch the glyphs. The glyphs are most regularly made out of profound smooth trims, however shallow hair-line trims are likewise found. In the closeup picture at right, a glyph is made out of two sections associated just barely line cut; this is an average tradition for this shape. A few specialists, including Barthel, trust that these shallow cuts were made by obsidian, and that the writings were cut in a two-organize process, first portrayed with obsidian and after that extended and completed with a ragged shark tooth. The rest of the hair-line trims were then either blunders, structure traditions (as at right), or ornamental embellishments. Vertical series of chevrons or capsules, for instance, are normally associated with hair-line trims, as can be seen over and over in the closeup of one end of tablet B underneath. Nonetheless, Barthel was informed that the last educated Rapanui lord, Nga'ara, outlined out the glyphs in sediment connected with a fish bone and afterward engraved them with a shark tooth.
