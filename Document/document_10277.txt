Louis Ayres, an individual from the Fine Arts Commission, and James Earle Fraser, a previous part, saw the models before they were sent, and did not support of them. Ayres kept in touch with Moore on July 15, expressing that the plans were fair, yet that it was not by any stretch of the imagination Fry's blame, as the Sesquicentennial Commission had directed the structures. Moore wrote to Mint Director Grant on the eighteenth, taking note of the issue, and transferring a recommendation from Ayres, that draws be endorsed by the Mint before the craftsman invested energy and exertion on making mortar models, and that Fry be permitted to make structures based on his very own preference. Regardless of this, Fry formally submitted photos of his models on August 9. When the Mint had set up that Fry had the expert to act, O'Reilly sent them to the Fine Arts Commission for its decision. On September 5, Moore answered, dismissing the models on a few grounds. The Fine Arts Commission scrutinized the decision of Allen, disliked the lettering, questioned the incorrect spelling of Bennington as "Bennigton", and had confused the landmark with the one raised for the Battle of Lake Champlain, and accordingly felt that there was an issue in regards to significance. On September 11, the administrator of the Sesquicentennial Commission, John Spargo, wrote to Grant, calling attention to the mistake and emphatically shielding the decisions of Allen and the landmark. He composed again on the fifteenth, this time straightforwardly to Moore, "your bonus has contacted the pride of the Vermonter there, with a somewhat harsh hand."
