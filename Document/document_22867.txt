Reverend JÃ³zsef ÃliÃ¡s, head of the Good Shepherd Mission in Hungary, said he had received the report by late April or early May from GÃ©za SoÃ³s, a Hungarian Foreign Ministry official and leading member of the Hungarian Independence Movement, a resistance group. Bauer believes that Kastner (or possibly Otto Komoly, leader of the "Vaada") gave SoÃ³s the report. ÃliÃ¡s's secretary, MÃ¡ria SzÃ©kely, translated it into Hungarian and prepared six copies. These copies made their way to several Hungarian and church officials, including MiklÃ³s Horthy's daughter-in-law, Countess Ilona Edelsheim-Gyulai. Braham writes that this distribution occurred before 15 May.
Kastner's reasons for not distributing the report further are unknown. Vrba argued until the end of his life that Kastner withheld it in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the "Vaada" and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. As the VrbaâWetzler report was being written, Eichmann had proposed to the "Vaada" in Budapest that the SS trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but Kastner collected donations to pay the SS to allow over 1,600 Jews to leave Budapest for Switzerland on what became known as the Kastner train. In Vrba's view, Kastner suppressed the report in order not to alienate the SS.
