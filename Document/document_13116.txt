It was broadly realized that Brown wanted race to the U.S. Senate when his gubernatorial term lapsed in 1896. The main Democratic possibility to succeed Brown as senator were his old adversaries, Cassius M. Mud, Jr. what's more, Parker Watkins Hardin, and Brown trusted he would require his inevitable successor's help to verify the Senate situate. Having effectively distanced Hardin and his free silver partners, Brown tossed his help to Clay. Family disaster would before long expel his enthusiasm for the race, be that as it may. On OctoberÃÂ 30, 1894, Brown's high school girl Susan kicked the bucket of tuberculosis. A couple of months after the fact, his child, Archibald Dixon Brown, separated from his better half; it was in this way found he had been carrying on an extramarital undertaking. Following up on an unknown tip, his sweetheart's better half found the couple at a whorehouse in Louisville; drawing his gun, he shot his significant other and Archibald Brown, slaughtering them both. Of the arrangement of family disasters, Governor Brown kept in touch with Clay, "I will not be a possibility for the Senate. The cataclysms of my kids, which have as of late come to pass for, have totally unfitted me for the challenge. My despondency is severe to the point that, similar to a dark vampire of the night, it appears to have sucked dry the very corridors and veins of my desire." Clay proceeded to lose the assignment to Hardin. Dark colored would not support Hardin, and the broke Democratic gathering looked as the Republicans chose William O. Bradley, the gathering's first-historically speaking legislative leader of Kentucky. Regardless of Brown's announced absence of enthusiasm for the Senate situate, he got one vote amid the wild 1896 Senate race to supplant Senator J. C. S. Blackburn.
