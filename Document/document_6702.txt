Vital was disappointed with the content, so its head of creation Dawn Steel asked Nicholas Meyer, the author and chief of "", to help modify it. Meyer never read the before content, thinking it futile to do as such since the substance had no intrigue to the studio. He and Bennett split the errand of imagining the plot between them. Bennett composed the primary quarter of the story, up to the point where the group returns in time. Meyer composed the story's center part, occurring on twentieth century Earth, and Bennett took care of the closure. After 12ÃÂ days of composing, Meyer and Bennett joined their different bits. In this variant, Gillian Taylor remains on 1986's Earth and pledges to guarantee the survival of the humpback whale in spite of the Catch 22 it could make. Meyer favored this "righter closure" to the film variant, clarifying "the end in the motion picture takes away from the significance of individuals in the present assuming the liability for the biology and counteracting issues of things to come by accomplishing something today, as opposed to taking into account the dream wants of having the capacity to be transported so as to the close idealistic future." Meyer and Bennett cut out Krikes and Meerson's concept of having the Klingon Bird-of-Prey fly over the Super Bowl and the indication that Saavik stayed on Vulcan since she was pregnant with Spock's kid.
