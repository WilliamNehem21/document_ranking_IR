After the 18-year Puritan organize boycott was lifted at the Restoration of the government in 1660, the dramatic existence of London reproduced itself rapidly and richly. Amid the rule of Charles II (1660Ã¢ÂÂ 1685), dramatists, for example, John Dryden, George Etherege, Aphra Behn, and William Wycherley composed comedies that triumphantly reassert noble predominance and eminence after the long periods of white collar class influence amid Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth. Mirroring the air of the Court, these plays commend a way of life of arousing interest and success, particularly victory that served to mortify the spouses of the London white collar classes and to vindicate, in the sexy field, the minimization and outcast endured by royalists under Cromwell. Charles' own enthusiasm for the stage fed Restoration show, and his most supported squires were writers, dramatists, and men of mind, for example, John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset, and William Wycherley. Wycherley had no title or riches, yet had by 1675 previously prescribed himself by two generally welcomed comedies and had been admitted to the internal circle, sharing the discussion and some of the time the escorts of Charles, who "was incredibly partial to endless supply of his mind". In 1675, at age 35, he drummed up some excitement with "The Country Wife", welcomed as the bawdiest and wittiest play yet observed on the English stage.
