Stop 2 landed, shaped up into a breadth line and walked cautiously toward the north close by a dry riverbed. As obscurity fell, similarly as they went to an extending in the riverbed, they were all of a sudden terminated upon by a concealed enemy. Every one of the four men dropped to the ground to abstain from being hit. The Canadian spear corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he gave as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and circumspectly pushed ahead. A dim figure all of a sudden kept running over the troopers' viewable pathway, among Lamb and the riverbed, and from a separation of around 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a furious, uncertain burst of discharge. Mortally injured by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb bumbled, drooped to the ground and lay face-down in a pile. One of the shots left through the back of his body, crushing the radio he had been conveying. He kicked the bucket in a split second. In the interim, the frameworks ahead ran quick into Stop 1, driven by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were altogether slaughtered in the resulting fire battle. Taylor's stick continued no losses. At the point when the fight was finished, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and held up alongside Lamb's dormant body throughout the night until it could be emptied by helicopter to the neighborhood emergency clinic at Chipinga. The demise was authoritatively recorded as "executed in real life", with no reference to cordial flame.
