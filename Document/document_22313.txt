Bede's account indicates that CÃ¦dmon was responsible for the composition of a large oeuvre of vernacular religious poetry. In contrast to Saints Aldhelm and Dunstan, CÃ¦dmon's poetry is said to have been exclusively religious. Bede reports that CÃ¦dmon "could never compose any foolish or trivial poem, but only those which were concerned with devotion", and his list of CÃ¦dmon's output includes work on religious subjects only: accounts of creation, translations from the Old and New Testaments, and songs about the "terrors of future judgment, horrors of hell, â¦ joys of the heavenly kingdom, â¦ and divine mercies and judgments." Of this corpus, only his first poem survives. While vernacular poems matching Bede's description of several of CÃ¦dmon's later works are found in London, British Library, Junius 11 (traditionally referred to as the "Junius" or "CÃ¦dmon" manuscript), the older traditional attribution of these texts to CÃ¦dmon or CÃ¦dmon's influence cannot stand. The poems show significant stylistic differences both internally and with CÃ¦dmon's original "Hymn", and there is nothing about their order or content to suggest that they could not have been composed and anthologised without any influence from Bede's discussion of CÃ¦dmon's oeuvre: the first three Junius poems are in their biblical order and, while "Christ and Satan" could be understood as partially fitting Bede's description of CÃ¦dmon's work on future judgment, pains of hell and joys of the heavenly kingdom, the match is not exact enough to preclude independent composition. As Fritz and Day have shown, indeed, Bede's list itself may owe less to direct knowledge of CÃ¦dmon's actual output than to traditional ideas about the subjects fit for Christian poetry or the order of the catechism. Similar influences may, of course, also have affected the makeup of the Junius volume.
