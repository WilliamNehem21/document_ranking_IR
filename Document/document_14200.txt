MacLaren's eulogy in "The Times" expressed that he was "one of the remarkable opening batsmen ever". As a batsman, he had a notoriety for beauty, however his system depended on scoring runs securely. He constantly endeavored to catch the activity in an amusement. Batting with his head marginally raised, he moved his bat back bizarrely far, which gave the ability to his shots, and specifically his drives. He scored runs rapidly, principally through his capacity to score from great length balls. When playing a shot, he either ventured ideal forward or moved far back in the batting wrinkle and having hit the ball, he finished the bat, frequently holding his posture for impact. These characteristics, and his snappy footwork, made him compelling on troublesome batting pitches. A standout amongst his most very respected shots was the snare. In later years, Cardus depicted the shot: "To see MacLaren snare a quick ballÃÂ ... from the front of his face, was in those days an encounter which excited me like gallant verse; he didn't simply snare the ball, he expelled it from his essence." Cardus, for whom MacLaren was a childhood legend, composed productively about him in later years; he called one such paper on MacLaren "The Noblest Roman", and passed judgment on him among the best of all batsmen. Gideon Haigh recommends: "If at any point a cricketer was the making of a solitary author, it is MacLaren, the radiant magnificence with which he is related owed in expansive degree to his young helper Neville Cardus." MacLaren was likewise an exceptionally capable defender, at first in the outfield yet later at slip.
