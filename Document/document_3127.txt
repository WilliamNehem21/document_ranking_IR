Following three years being developed, the amusement was advancing gradually, and it was obscure when it would be done. Activision set a progression of due dates for the venture's advancement to guarantee Troika would have adequate time to successfully test the diversion, however these achievements were more than once expanded, and "Bloodlines" in the end kept running over spending plan. In 2003 Activision interceded, requesting that the amusement be prepared for discharge in the following couple of months, and notwithstanding propelling more cash to Troika to finish its work on "The Temple of Elemental Evil" for Atari, liberating the Troika group to take a shot at "Bloodlines" solely. Activision in the long run issued a final offer that the undertaking be done inside months, on September 15, 2004. Troika conveyed a form of "Bloodlines" on the required date; because of its scale, the amusement experienced three weeks of testing. Activision chose that the diversion was reasonable for discharge, however was will undoubtedly retain "Bloodlines" until after the introduction of "Half-Life 2" in November 2004. Troika persuaded Activision to utilize the postponement to subsidize further improvement; the extra spending plan was insufficient to pay the majority of Troika's staff, and a few representatives worked unpaid to finish the venture. This rendition experienced an additional three weeks of testing to turn into the last discharge code; the diversion was as yet incomplete when Activision constrained its discharge. "Bloodlines" inventive executive Jason Anderson accused Activision, saying that the distributer took the amusement from Troika without giving enough time to test and clean it. Then again, Boyarsky safeguarded Activision for supporting Troika as the venture surpassed its financial plan and calendar. Amid the almost four years of advancement, Anderson assessed that the group stayed at work past 40 hours for everything except two months.
