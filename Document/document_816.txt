Of the 314 staff on board "Voyager" at the season of the impact, 14 officers, 67 mariners, and 1 regular citizen dockyard specialist were murdered, including Stevens and everything except two of the extension group. A Royal Commission into the occasions of the crash was held in 1964, and found that while "Voyager" was fundamentally to blame for fail to keep up a compelling post and familiarity with the bigger ship's area, "Melbourne"s connect team was likewise to blame, for neglecting to alarm "Voyager" and not taking measures to maintain a strategic distance from the impact. Robertson was presented on the preparation base Ã¢ÂÂ a move that he and the Australian media saw as commensurate to a downgradeÃ¢ÂÂhowever surrendered. The Royal Commission and its fallout were inadequately taken care of, and following weight from people in general, media, and government officials, joined with disclosures by "Voyager"s previous official officer that Stevens may have been unfit for order, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This is the main time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a solitary episode. The second commission found that Stevens was therapeutically unfit for direction and that a portion of the discoveries of the main Royal Commission were along these lines dependent on mistaken suspicions. Robertson and different officers of "Melbourne" were cleared of fault for the occurrence.
