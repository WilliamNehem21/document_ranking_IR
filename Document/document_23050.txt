The Australian raven was first described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, when they reported George Caley's early notes on the species from the Sydney district. Its specific epithet "coronoides" "crow-shaped" is derived from the Greek "corone"/ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ½Î· "crow" and "eidos"/ÎµÎ¯Î´Î¿Ï "shape" or "form". The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the carrion crow ("C. corone") of Europe, though they noted it was larger with a longer bill. They did not give it a common name. The location where the type specimen was collected is not recorded, but thought to be in the Parramatta district. Christian Ludwig Brehm described "Corvus affinis" in 1845, later determined to be this species. In his 1865 "Handbook to the Birds of Australia", John Gould recognised only one species of corvid in Australia, "Corvus australis", which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Johann Friedrich Gmelin's 1788 name, which predated Vigors and Horsfield's description. In 1877 Richard Bowdler Sharpe recognised two species, but recorded that the feather bases of the type specimen of "C. coronoides" were white. He named "C. coronoides" as the "crow" and "C. australis" (as "Corone australis") the "raven". Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant corrected this in 1912 after re-examining the type specimen, clarifying the species as "C. coronoides" (raven, and incorporating little and forest ravens) and "C. cecilae" (Torresian crow).
