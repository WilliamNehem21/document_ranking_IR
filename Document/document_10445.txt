He before long presumed that the new magazine would need to incorporate some republished stories nearby the first material. The financial backing did not allow Hersey to pay rates that would pull in top-quality journalists, nor even to republish the best-known accounts of the caring he was searching for, and he was compelled to utilize moderately obscure creators, for example, Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. Hersey appropriated a "Notice to Writers" that depicted what he was searching for: "odd, unusual, mysterious, strange talesÃÂ ... spiritualist happenings, strange undertakings, accomplishments of leger-de-principle, mysticism, et ceteraÃÂ ... On the off chance that you have a thought which you have considered too odd to even think about writing, excessively abnormal or unusual, let us see it." This did not confine the entries to dream or sci-fi, and thus Hersey got (and printed) a wide range of fiction, including puzzles, experiences, and romantic tales, however it might be that he just did not get enough great quality sci-fi and dream to fill the magazine. Hersey later reviewed that the notice did not acquire numerous usable compositions: "because of the notification in the authors' magazines, I got a thousand original copies however had the capacity to purchase just ten!"
