The shiny new light cruiser had been disabled before in the fight and was enduring an onslaught from the German light cruisers and when Beatty's battlecruisers lingered out of the fog at 12:37ÃÂ p.m. At this point, "New Zealand" had fallen behind the three more up to date and quicker battlecruisers and was not in position to altogether partake in the fight. "Strassburg" had the capacity to dodge fire by covering up in the fogs, however "CÃÂ¶ln" stayed obvious and was immediately disabled by the British squadron. Before the German ship could be sunk, Beatty was diverted by the unexpected appearance of the older light cruiser off his starboard bow. He swung to seek after, yet "Ariadne" was set ablaze after just three salvos terminated from under . At 1:10, Beatty turned north and made a general flag to resign. Soon after turning north, the battlecruisers experienced the disabled "CÃÂ¶ln", which was sunk by two salvos from "Lion". Amid the fight, "New Zealand"s commander, Lionel Halsey, wore the MÃÂori piupiu over his uniform, setting a convention pursued for the length of the war. Two days after the fight, "New Zealand" was exchanged back to the first BCS, when the battlecruiser touched base from the Mediterranean.
