Amid the Evacuation of Greece, "Imposing" if air spread for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron was compelled to dump on 2 May before the transporter came back to Alexandria the following day. She put to ocean on 6 May to give air spread to the guards associated with Operation "Tiger". On the morning of 8 May, a couple of Fulmars professed to have shot down a couple of Z.1007s hunting down the armada; one Fulmar neglected to return. Later that evening, the contenders shot down four German Heinkel He 111 aircraft at the expense of one Fulmar compelled to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar slammed due to non-battle causes amid the day. The following day a couple of Fulmars from 806 Squadron severely harmed a Ju 88 observation plane that crash-arrived at its base in Sicily. As the armada and the Tiger guard moved toward Alexandria on 11 May, a couple of Fulmars assaulted an arrangement of Ju 88s, harming one plane; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the ocean. Huge numbers of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable amid the task and "Imposing" was unfit to give air spread until they were fixed.
