The board found that joined OPC powers, driven by Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and other USAF officers, had neglected to incorporate helicopters into airplane activities in the TAOR. An Eagle Flight officer later affirmed that he had been told by the CTF's head of staff, a USAF officer, that the military Black Hawk unit was not viewed as a component of OPC. In this manner, the CTF staff, under the heading of Colonel James Rusty O'Brien, USAF, had not attempted to organize the U.S. Armed force Black Hawk missions into the every day ATOs. Truth be told, neither O'Brien nor his forerunners had built up a system for imparting data on Black Hawk missions to the Combined Forces Air Component (CFAC). The MCC officer, Colonel Thompson, had by and by called O'Brien the evening of 13 April to inform him concerning the following day's Black Hawk mission into northern Iraq, a mission that had been explicitly and by and by endorsed by Pilkington before that day. O'Brien or his staff evidently did not endeavor to convey explicit data on this mission to the AWACS or F-15 contender units at Incirlik, the CFAC, the ground-based mission executive, or to the "Duke" on board the AWACS.
