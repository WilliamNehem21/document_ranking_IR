Rodents, similar to every single placental warm blooded animal with the exception of primates, have only two kinds of light responsive cones in their retina, a short wavelength "blue-UV" type and a center wavelength "green" type. They are along these lines delegated dichromats; be that as it may, they are outwardly delicate into the bright (UV) range and in this way can see light that people can not. The elements of this UV affectability are not in every case clear. In degus, for instance, the midsection reflects more UV light than the back. In this way, when a degu stands up on its rear legs, which it does when frightened, it opens its midsection to different degus and bright vision may fill a need in imparting the caution. When it remains on every one of the fours, its low UV-reflectance back could help make the degu less unmistakable to predators. Bright light is bounteous amid the day yet not during the evening. There is a vast increment in the proportion of bright to unmistakable light toward the beginning of the day and night sundown hours. Numerous rodents are dynamic amid dusk hours (crepuscular action), and UV-affectability would be profitable at these occasions. Bright reflectivity is of questionable incentive for nighttime rodents.
