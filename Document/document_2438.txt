In May 1967 Leigh was practicing to show up with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee's "A Delicate Balance" when her tuberculosis repeated. Following half a month of rest, she appeared to recuperate. The evening of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as normal at their Eaton Square level to perform in a play, and he returned home just before midnight to locate her sleeping. Around 30 minutes after the fact (at this point 8 July), he entered the room and found her body on the floor. She had been endeavoring to stroll to the restroom and, as her lungs loaded up with fluid, she crumbled and choked. Merivale first reached her family and later had the capacity to achieve Olivier, who was accepting treatment for prostate malignant growth in a close-by emergency clinic. In his collection of memoirs, Olivier depicted his "appalling anguish" as he quickly made a trip to Leigh's living arrangement, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier offered his regards, and "stood and appealed to God for pardoning for every one of the shades of malice that had jumped up between us", before aiding Merivale make memorial service courses of action; Olivier remained until her body was expelled from the level.
