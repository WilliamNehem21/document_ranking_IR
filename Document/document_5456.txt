Warm fronts mark the situation on the Earth's surface where a moderately warm assortment of air has uprooted colder air. The temperature increment is situated on the equatorward edge of the inclination in isotherms, and exists in more extensive low weight troughs than is the situation with virus fronts. Warm fronts move more gradually than do the virus fronts since virus air is denser, and harder to uproot from the Earth's surface. This causes temperature contrasts crosswise over warm fronts to be more extensive in scale. The warm air mass supersedes the virus air mass and temperature changes happen at higher elevations before those at the surface. Mists in front of the warm front are for the most part stratiform and precipitation slowly increments as the front methodologies. Haze can likewise happen going before a warm front entry. Clearing and warming is generally fast after the section of a warm front. On the off chance that the warm air mass is precarious, blending of the warm sodden air will create rainstorms that are implanted among the stratiform mists in front of the front, and after frontal section, thundershowers may proceed. On climate maps, the surface area of a warm front is set apart with a red line of half circles pointing toward movement.
