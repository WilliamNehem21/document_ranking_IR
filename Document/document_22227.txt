The largest building of the Dairi was the "Throne Hall" or , a building reserved for official functions. It was a rectangular hall measuring approximately 30Â m (98Â ft) east to west and 25Â m (82Â ft) north to south, and situated along the median north-south axis of the Dairi, overseeing a rectangular courtyard and facing the ShÅmeimon gate. A tachibana orange tree and a sakura cherry tree stood symmetrically on both sides of the front staircase of the building. The courtyard was flanked on both sides by smaller halls connected to the Shishinden, creating the same configuration of buildings (influenced by Chinese examples) that was found in the aristocratic shinden style villas of the period. 
The Shishinden was used for official functions and ceremonies that were not held at the Daigokuden of the ChÅdÅ-in complex. It took over much of the intended use of the larger and more formal building from an early date, as the daily business of government ceased to be conducted in the presence of the emperor in the Daigokuden already at the beginning of the ninth century. Connected to this diminishing reliance on the official government procedures described in the "RitsuryÅ code" was the establishment of a personal secretariat to the emperor, the "Chamberlain's Office" or . This office, which increasingly took over the role of coordinating the work of government organs, was set up in the , the hall to the south-west of the Shishinden.
