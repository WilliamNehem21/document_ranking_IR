Scheer quickly arranged another raid into the North Sea, yet the harm to "Seydlitz" postponed the task until the finish of May. The II Battle SquadronÃ¢ÂÂhaving the weakest ships engaged with the fight, and under-quality attributable to the nonattendance of , guarding the mouth of the Elbe, and , exhausted and expelled from dynamic administrationÃ¢ÂÂwas situated at the back of the German line. Presently before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group experienced the British first Battlecruiser Squadron under the order of David Beatty. The restricting boats started a big guns duel that came about the annihilation of , soon after 17:00, and , not exactly 30 minutes after the fact. At this point, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British boats toward the principle body of the High Seas Fleet. After understanding that the German armada was coming into range, Beatty turned his boats back toward the Grand Fleet. Scheer requested the armada to seek after the withdrawing ships of the British fifth Battle Squadron at top speed. "Deutschland" and the other pre-gunboats were essentially slower than the battleships, and rapidly fell behind. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had touched base on the scene and stood up to Scheer with noteworthy numerical predominance. The German armada's mobility was seriously hampered by the nearness of the pre-gunboats; if Scheer requested a quick turn towards Germany, he would need to forfeit the slower ships to make great his break.
