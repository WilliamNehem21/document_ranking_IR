In spite of the arrangement troubles, the Boston Red Sox in the end marked Matsuzaka. The group paid roughly $103.1ÃÂ million altogether, including the exchange charge and contract, to procure the pitcher. Kurkjian trusts that with charges and gets this high, little market groups couldn't bear to contend with vast market groups for the rights to consult with some posted Japanese players. Kurkjian accuses the posting framework's utilization of a visually impaired offering framework as the reason for Matsuzaka's "crazy offer." He additionally hypothesizes that Matsuzaka's high offered sum swelled the offers for Kei Igawa who was posted two weeks after the fact, propagating the issue further. In the wake of winning the exchange rights to Igawa, Yankees' general administrator Brian Cashman told columnists that "the posting framework, obviously with what occurred this winter, may not really be the best framework". Kurkjian claims that other MLB officials as of now trust that a customary free specialist structure, where the most astounding bidder wins, would be superior to the present framework. Cashman and Yankees group president Randy Levine met with NPB group authorities in mid 2007 to talk about the posting framework, in addition to other things. These gatherings did not result in any quick changes.
