Another significant impact in his work was the ascent of enthusiasm for vernacular engineering. When Douglas moved to Chester, the highly contrasting recovery utilizing half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to fuse this style in his structures in Chester and somewhere else. The high contrast recovery did not begin in Chester, yet it became Chester's forte. The primary Chester engineer engaged with the recovery had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this class was the rebuilding of a shop in Eastgate Street in the mid 1850s. Other early Chester planners associated with the restoration were T.ÃÂ A.ÃÂ Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be grown for the most part by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Some portion of Douglas' soonest work for the Grosvenor family, the passage hotel to Grosvenor Park, utilized half-timbering in its upper story; this is the principal known use by Douglas of high contrast. Other vernacular themes were taken from before styles of English engineering, specifically, the Tudor style. These incorporate tile-hanging, pargetting and gigantic block ribbed smokestack stacks. In this style, Douglas was impacted by the planners Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas likewise utilized vernacular components from the landmass, particularly the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.
