Analysis of "Cavern Story 3D" reverberated that of the WiiWare variant. Numerous commentators forewarned that the graphical update does not legitimize the $40 introductory value point, particularly with less expensive or free forms of the diversion accessible through download administrations. Ward protected the discharge, getting fulfillment from the amusement's accessibility as a physical cartridge. Holmes applauded the dynamic camera framework and new designs, contrasting them with exemplary Disney films. He believes this discharge to be the "best form of the diversion, [but] not really the authoritative adaptation". Jane Douglas of GameSpot felt that the 3DS Circle Pad was an agreeable fit for the diversion's control plot. Audrey Drake of IGN noticed that the 3D impact made it hard to recognize certain stages among foundation and closer view, a grumbling shared by Douglas. Simon Parkin of the UK "Official Nintendo Magazine" was increasingly basic, refering to absence of detail in the 3D models and a too-dim shading palette. Japanese magazine "Famitsu Weekly"s four commentators scored it 7, 7, 8, and 8 points out of 10 to a sum of 30 out of 40 points, showing normal audits. This form was named for Best Adventure Game at the 2011 "Nintendo Power" Awards.
