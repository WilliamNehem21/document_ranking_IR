The dromons that Procopius describes were single-banked ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger ("parexeiresia"), these extended directly from the hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks ("elasiai") were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast ("histos" or "katartion"), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern ("prymnÄ"), which also housed a tent ("skÄnÄ") that covered the captain's berth ("krab(b)at(t)os"). The prow ("prÅra") featured an elevated forecastle ("pseudopation"), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade ("kastellÅma"), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around the sides of the ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles ("xylokastra") on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur ("peronion") was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.
