"Kill Tracks" found unforeseen consideration after the Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present secured "Box Elder" all alone 1990 EP, "Brassneck". The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been acquainted with "Kill Tracks" by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present spread is not the same as the first in that the line "that I needed to get the fuck out of this town" was changed to "that I needed to get directly out of this town". The "Container Elder" spread got radio airplay from persuasive English plate racer John Peel, which produced attention for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither individual from Pavement knew about the spread until Kannberg was educated of it. Kannberg recollected that "I was somewhat frantic. I had no clue that individuals could do that, so I was altogether insulted." However, his feeling of the spread and its noteworthiness later transformed: "It was cool to the point that some band from the UK needed to cover this darken, awfully recorded tune. At the time I most likely never valued the full degree of how them covering the melody helped Pavement, particularly in the UK, however it truly did, and I'll generally be appreciative to them for that."
