There have been various endeavors to translate the "rongorongo" content of Easter Island since its disclosure in the late nineteenth century. Likewise with most undeciphered contents, huge numbers of the proposition have been whimsical. Aside from a segment of one tablet which has been appeared to manage a lunar schedule, none of the writings are comprehended, and even the date-book can't really be perused. It isn't known whether "rongorongo" straightforwardly speaks to the Rapa Nui language Ã¢ÂÂ that is, on the off chance that it is a genuine composition framework Ã¢ÂÂ and oral records report that specialists in a single classification of tablet were unfit to peruse different tablets, proposing either that "rongorongo" is certainly not a brought together framework, or that it is proto-composing that requires the peruser to definitely know the content. There are three genuine impediments to decipherment, accepting that "rongorongo" is composing: the modest number of residual writings, containing just 15,000 neat glyphs; the absence of setting in which to translate the writings, for example, representations or parallels to writings which can be perused; and the way that the advanced Rapa Nui language is vigorously blended with Tahitian and is probably not going to intently mirror the language of the tabletsÃ¢ÂÂparticularly on the off chance that they record a specific register, for example, mantrasÃ¢ÂÂwhile the few outstanding instances of the old language are intensely confined in kind and may not relate well to the tablets either.
