The episodes of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" were recorded, but for many years it was thought the recordings had not been preserved. At the time of the broadcasts, pre-recorded shows were frowned upon by advertisers and audiences. However, in 1988, Michael Barson, who worked in the United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress discovered that the scripts for twenty-five of the twenty-six episodes had been submitted to the Office, where they had been placed in storage. Nobody was aware that they still existed and their copyrights had not been renewed. This meant that "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" had fallen into the public domain. The scripts were published that same year by Pantheon in a book titled "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show", edited by Michael Barson and with an interview with Perrin. In October 1988, "Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel" scenes were broadcast for the first time since the show went off the air in 1933 when National Public Radio, a non-profit media organization that provides content to public radio stations around the United States, aired an 18-minute recreation of "Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel" in markets such as Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, using Washington, D.C.-based Arena Stage actors to perform the Chico and Groucho lead roles from the published scripts. Years later, three recordings of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" were found, including a five-minute excerpt of Episode 24 and a fifteen-minute recording of Episode 25. A complete recording of Episode 26 exists and was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005.
