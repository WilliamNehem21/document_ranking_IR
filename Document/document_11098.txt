On 15 February 1921, the Red Army attacked Georgia. Abkhazia was attacked two days after the fact. Eshba and Lakoba came back to Abkhazia before the intrusion and shaped a Revolutionary Committee (Revkom) in anticipation of a Bolshevik government. Sukhumi, the capital, was caught on 4 March. With battling in Georgia proceeding, the Revkom, who did not hope to be the sole expert over Abkhazia, exploited the perplexity and moved to pronounce Abkhazia a free republic. They sent a wire to Moscow requesting guidance on the most proficient method to continue, and proposed joining the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, however Sergo OrdzhonikidzeÃ¢ÂÂa main Bolshevik and the pioneer of the Caucasus Bureau (Kavbiuro)Ã¢ÂÂ rejected the thought. Therefore, on 31 March 1921, it proclaimed that "at the desire of laborers another Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia is conceived." This made Abkhazia an ostensibly free republic with the comprehension on both the Abkhaz and Georgian sides that in the end Abkhazia would join the recently framed Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (Georgian SSR). Up to that point it was viewed as being totally disengaged from Georgia and was treated all things considered. The Georgian Revkom, the administering body of the Georgian SSR, invited Abkhazia in a message on 21 May 1921, and said the type of relations ought to be settled amid the main Workers' Congresses of the two republics.
