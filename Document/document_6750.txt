In 1997, Andrew Motion condensed the basic view on "To Autumn": "it has regularly been called Keats' 'generally ... untroubled lyric' [...] To enlist the full power of its accomplishment, its pressures must be felt as strong and requesting." Following in 1998, M. H. Abrams clarified, To Autumn' was the last work of imaginative result that Keats finished [...] he accomplished this celebratory ballad, with its quiet passive consent to time, brevity and mortality, when he was controlled by a hunch [...] that he had himself under two years to live". James Chandler, likewise in 1998, called attention to that "If "To Autumn" is his most prominent bit of composing, as has so regularly been stated, it is on the grounds that in it he apparently set himself the most goal-oriented test of his short vocation and figured out how to meet it." Timothy Corrigan, in 2000, guaranteed that To Autumn' might be, as different pundits have brought up, his most prominent accomplishment in its capacity [...] to recover the English vernacular as the easygoing articulation of ordinary experience, getting to be in this his most outside sonnet even in the entirety of its rustic appeal." around the same time, Thomas McFarland put "To Autumn" with "Tribute to a Nightingale", "Tribute on a Grecian Urn", "The Eve of St. Agnes" and "Hyperion" as Keats' most noteworthy accomplishment, together hoisting Keats "high in the positions of the incomparable producers of world writing". In 2008, Stanley Plumly expressed, "history, successors, everlasting status are seeing 'Tribute to a Nightingale,' 'Tribute on a Grecian Urn,' and 'To Autumn' as three of the most anthologized verse ballads of awful vision in English."
