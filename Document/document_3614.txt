The bill of the example is dark with a yellowish tip, and the cere is additionally dark, with quills on the upper side, nearly to the nostrils. The legends are bare, and the upper piece of the head is dingy dark. The remainder of the head is for the most part earthy dark. The plumes of the scruff and the neck are marginally bifurcated and have a dim green gleam, the last with coppery reflections. The quills of the neck are extended (here and there alluded to as passion), and a portion of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots close to the tips. The majority of the plumes on the upperparts and wings are dull darker or caramel dark with a dim green shine. Practically these plumes have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are practically whitish on a portion of the scapular plumes, ambiguous and dim on the essential quills. The underside of the wings is dark with browner flight quills, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The bosom is earthy dark with a swoon green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dull green sheen, caramel dark on the underside, with a restricted, cinnamon-shaded band toward the end. This varies from the rust-shaded tail-tip evidently appeared in the illustration claimed by Lever, and Latham's own outline. The legs are little and slim, have long toes, vast hooks, and a relatively short bone structure, while the Nicobar pigeon has shorter paws and a more drawn out bone structure.
