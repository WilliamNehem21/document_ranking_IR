Oliver states that Trump had frequently threatened to file lawsuits against various people, but had never actually filed these lawsuits, and has settled lawsuits filed against him about his never-completed condominium developments despite Trump's claim that he never settles any of his legal disputes. He says that Trump was also sensitive about the size of his fingers due to a 1988 "Spy" feature piece that criticized him as a "short-fingered vulgarian." The now-defunct magazine's editor, E. Graydon Carterâwho discussed the story in a November 2015 "Vanity Fair" articleâsaid that after the article was published, Trump would send envelopes enclosed with photos of himself at various times, with all of the pictures highlighting his fingers with a circular gold Sharpie to dispute the claims.
Oliver next calls Trump inconsistent in the political views that he expressed during and prior to his campaign, saying that "he's been pro choice "and" pro life; he's been for "and" against assault weapon bans; in favor of both bringing in Syrian refugees "and" deporting them out of the country." Oliver states that during a phone-in interview on "Fox & Friends," Trump had advocated killing families of suspected terrorists as part of his strategy to defeat ISIS, which would constitute a war crime under the laws of the Geneva Convention.
