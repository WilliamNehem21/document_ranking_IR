The white-bellied ocean falcon was first portrayed by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, in spite of the fact that John Latham had made notes on the species in 1781, from an example got in February 1780 at Princes Island off the westernmost cape of Java amid Captain Cook's last voyage. Its particular name is gotten from the Ancient Greek "leuko-" 'white', and "gaster" 'tummy'. Its nearest relative is the little-realized Sanford's ocean hawk of the Solomon Islands. These structure a superspecies, and as is normal in other ocean hawk superspecies, one (the white-bellied ocean falcon) has a white head, rather than the other species' dull head. The bill and eyes are dull, and the claws are dim yellow as in all Southern Hemisphere ocean hawks. Both these species have probably some dim colouration in their tails, however this may not generally be plainly noticeable in the white-bellied ocean falcon. The nucleotide successions of the cytochrome b quality of the two ocean birds were among those investigated in a recent report. In spite of the fact that they contrast extraordinarily in appearance and biology, their hereditary uniqueness of 0.3% shows that the progenitors of the two structures may have wandered as of late as 150,000 years prior. The investigation creators infer that in spite of the fact that the hereditary dissimilarity is increasingly reliable with subspecies, the uniqueness in appearance and conduct warrants the two being held as independent species. Mitochondrial succession of the cytochrome b locus varies in all respects somewhat from that of Sanford's ocean bird recommending a moderately ongoing uniqueness after New Guinea-based white-bellied ocean falcons colonized the Solomon Islands.
