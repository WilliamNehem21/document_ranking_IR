Sackville-West and Nicolson discovered Sissinghurst in April 1930, after Dorothy Wellesley, their close neighbor and a previous admirer of Sackville-West's, saw the domain available to be purchased. They had turned out to be progressively worried about infringing advancement close to their property Long Barn, close Sevenoaks, Kent. Their idea on Sissinghurst was acknowledged on 6 May and the stronghold and the homestead around it were purchased for ÃÂ£12,375, utilizing just Sackville-West's cash as opposed to Nicolson's. The property was altogether. The house had no power, running water, or depletes, and the patio nursery was in disorder. Anne Scott-James noticed their "planting legacy" as "a forest of nut-trees, some apple trees, a quince [and] a tangle of [old roses]". The physical resources on the site were "four structures of delightful smooth block, some portion of a canal [and] different fine dividers". Clearing the ground took just about three years, however by 1939 the patio nursery was to a great extent total, except for the White Garden. Nicolson was in charge of the structure and design, while Sackville-West, at the leader of her group of plant specialists, embraced the planting. Simon Jenkins, the building author, depicts Nicolson's plan as "post-Picturesque, a greenery enclosure not as an impersonation of nature but rather as impersonation of a house", and recommends his reasoning was greatly impacted by Lawrence Johnston's patio nursery at Hidcote. Sackville-West's methodology was plant-focused, inside the imperatives of her better half's arrangement, "bounty, even indulgence and abundance, inside limits the very pinnacle of straight seriousness".
