Commander James Dick diminished Hickley on 22 January 1916. The armada withdrew for a voyage in the North Sea on 26 February; Jellicoe had proposed to utilize the Harwich Force to clear the Heligoland Bight, however awful climate anticipated tasks in the southern North Sea. Therefore, the activity was limited toward the northern end of the ocean. Another breadth started on 6 March, however must be surrendered the next day as the climate became unreasonably extreme for the escorting destroyers. The evening of 25 March, "Vanguard" and the remainder of the armada cruised from Scapa Flow to help Beatty's battlecruisers and other light powers striking the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. When the Grand Fleet moved toward the region on 26 March, the British and German powers had just withdrawn and a solid storm undermined the light art, so the armada was requested to come back to base. In April the ship was exchanged to the fourth Battle Squadron. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet led a show off Horns Reef to divert the Germans while the Russian Navy re-laid its cautious minefields in the Baltic Sea. The armada came back to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refueled before continuing south in light of insight reports that the Germans were going to dispatch an attack on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet touched base in the region after the Germans had pulled back. On 2Ã¢ÂÂ 4 May, the armada led another exhibition off Horns Reef to keep German consideration concentrated on the North Sea.
