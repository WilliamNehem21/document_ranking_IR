The claim missed the recording due date of January 1, 1993. The speaker of the Florida House of Representatives appointed a gathering to inquire about and give a report by which the impartial case bill could be assessed. It took them about a year to do the exploration, including meetings, and composing. On December 22, 1993, history specialists from Florida State University, Florida A&M University, and the University of Florida conveyed a 100-page report (with 400 pages of joined documentation) on the Rosewood slaughter. It depended on accessible essential records, and meetings for the most part with dark overcomers of the occurrence. Because of the media consideration gotten by occupants of Cedar Key and Sumner following documenting of the case by survivors, white members were disheartened from offering meetings to the students of history. The report utilized a taped depiction of the occasions by Jason McElveen, a Cedar Key occupant who had since passed on, and a meeting with Ernest Parham, who was in secondary school in 1923 and chanced upon the lynching of Sam Carter. Parham said he had never talked about the occurrence since he was never inquired. The report was titled "Archived History of the Incident which Occurred at Rosewood, Florida in January 1923". Gary Moore, the insightful writer who composed the 1982 story in "The St. Petersburg Times" that revived the Rosewood case, reprimanded obvious mistakes in the report. The authorized gathering withdrew the most genuine of these, without open exchange. They conveyed the last report to the Florida Board of Regents and it turned out to be a piece of the authoritative record.
