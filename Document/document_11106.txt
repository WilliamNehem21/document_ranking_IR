The unearthing uncovered proof of the flame of 1236, including slag, charcoal, consumed boards and a consumed wooden bowl. It is imagined that the flame presumably began in the timber-assembled kitchens at the intersection of the west and south ranges, and after that spread to the religious structures and church. The greater part of the wood in the structures, including the goods and rooftops, would have been pulverized, in spite of the fact that the brick work dividers remained generally flawless. The real fixes required gave an open door for the augmentation of the congregation by the expansion of new houses of prayer to both of the transepts, and its repair in a way much more terrific than beforehand. The order had been gravely harmed in the flame and its arcade was revamped on the past establishments. The new arcade was of "high caliber and finely fashioned development". Dark colored and Howard-Davis express that the kitchens were remade on a similar site and it creates the impression that they were reconstructed in timber once more. Unearthings have discovered proof of a second ringer foundry in the northwest of the cloister grounds. The date of this is dubious yet Greene proposes that it was worked to cast another ringer to supplant the first one that was harmed in the fire. Later in the 13thÃÂ century another house of prayer was added toward the north transept. Convenience for visitors was built toward the southwest of the devout structures.
