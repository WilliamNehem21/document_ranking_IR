Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the scene five stars out of five. In his survey, he expresses that "'The Stolen Earth' completes a fine employment in weaving parts from the present arrangement, previous colleagues, and Davros together." He composed that he respects Graeme Harper's course of the scene where Sarah and Jack get the consistent "Eradicate!" transmission from the Daleks and expressed that "Harper's work ... is deserving of the extra large screen as far as its stunning visual components." He complimented the giving of Michael Brandon a role as General Sanchez, and communicated trust that Sanchez had endure the Dalek assault since he could be "the new Brigadier assume that UNIT so frantically needs". Rawson-Jones thought Briggs, as the voice of the Daleks, completed a "radiant occupation with Dalek Caan's insane lingo, originating from an extremely creative and striking move by author Russell T Davies to influence this Dalek to go doolally". He commended Bleach's execution as Davros, for his "controlled, evil vocals" that "magnificently inspire the splendid however disturbed mentality of the Dalek maker". After shutting, he lauded Davies for being "a specialist at conveying stunning finales that give each season a feeling of union and up the stakes to practically unendurable dimensions", and imagined that coordinating the scene's quality would be an "intense assignment".
