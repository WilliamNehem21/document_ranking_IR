McWhorter perceives that a great part of the purpose behind Angelou's style was the "remorseful" idea of her composition. At the point when Angelou expressed "Confined Bird" toward the finish of the 1960s, one of the important and acknowledged highlights of writing at the time was "natural solidarity", and one of her objectives was to make a book that fulfilled that measure. The occasions in her books were long winded and created like a progression of short stories, yet their plans did not pursue an exacting sequence. Rather, they were set to accentuate the subjects of her books, which incorporate prejudice, personality, family, and travel. English writing researcher Valerie Sayers has stated that "Angelou's verse and composition are comparative". They both depend on her "immediate voice", which interchanges unfaltering rhythms with syncopated examples and utilizations likenesses and similitudes (e.g., the confined flying creature). As per Hagen, Angelou's works were affected by both regular abstract and the oral conventions of the African-American people group. For instance, she referenced more than 100 artistic characters all through her books and verse. What's more, she utilized the components of blues music, including the demonstration of declaration when talking about one's life and battles, amusing modest representation of the truth, and the utilization of regular illustrations, rhythms, and pitches. Angelou, rather than relying on plot, utilized individual and chronicled occasions to shape her books.
