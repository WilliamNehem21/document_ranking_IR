The choice to dispatch "Awesome Novels" was taken somewhat in light of the fact that there were a considerable number book-length works that perusers needed to see republished. Gnaedinger remarked that "Everybody appears to have understood that despite the fact that [the] set-up of five to seven stories with two serials running, was exceptionally attractive, that the not insignificant rundown of books would need to be speeded up some way or another". At the point when "Awesome Novels" was propelled, "Acclaimed Fantastic Mysteries" was partially through serialization of "The Blind Spot", by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint, with the third scene showing up in the May/June 1940 issue. As opposed to finish the serialization, Gnaedinger chose to print the novel completely in the main issue of "Awesome Novels", guaranteeing that perusers of "Acclaimed Fantastic Mysteries" would likewise procure the new magazine. After "Incredible Novels" stopped distribution in 1941, "Well known Fantastic Mysteries" changed its arrangement, and started distributing a total novel in each issue, as opposed to a few stories and a couple of serials running simultaneously. Normally there were additionally short stories, however every so often an especially long novel would seem alone in the issue: this occurred, for instance, with the February 1942 issue, which contained Francis Stevens' "The Citadel of Fear", and no other fiction.
