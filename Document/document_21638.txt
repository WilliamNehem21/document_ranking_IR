The fungus has been shown to provide a protective effect against heavy metal toxicity when associated with the host "Pinus sylvestris", preventing copper accumulation in the needles, and protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic basis of this adaptationâintriguing to researchers investigating the bioremediation potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associatesâare contained in the genome sequence of "S.Â luteus", published in 2015.
"Suillus luteus" fruit bodies are sometimes infested with larvae, though not nearly as often as "S.Â granulatus" or "B.Â edulis". Damage from maggots is much more common in warmer months, and rare late in the season with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70â95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies "Mycetophila fungorum", "Pegomya deprimata", and "Pegohylemyia silvatica". In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species "Folsomia candida".
