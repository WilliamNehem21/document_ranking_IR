In December 2004, Kentucky's Registry of Election Finance, the organization that implements the state's battle account laws, enlisted Farmer's sister, Rhonda F. Dim, who had recently filled in as seat of her sibling's effort for agribusiness magistrate. Vault seat John Rogers kept up that Gray was contracted without anyone else merits, and Gray guaranteed to recuse herself from any work that may include her sibling's future battles. The next May, "The Kentucky Post" distributed passages from an email from Dick Murgatroyd, Fletcher's vice president of staff, to Transportation Cabinet authorities approaching them to get a new line of work for Farmer's brother by marriage, Jamie Gray; the email demonstrated that Murgatroyd was in charge of securing positions for both James and Rhonda Gray. Dim was later employed as a regulatory authority in the Transportation Cabinet. Rancher denied any association in the procuring choices past submitting proposals for the two applicants. In July, Murgatroyd was prosecuted on 19 checks of abusing the state's legitimacy framework by making politically propelled contracts, including that of Jamie Gray. A transportation official affirmed in September that Farmer had declined one occupation for Gray in light of the fact that the compensation was excessively low and had arranged a higher pay hands on Gray in the end got. Rancher called the cases "ridiculous" and "just false".
