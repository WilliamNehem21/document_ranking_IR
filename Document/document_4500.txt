She cruised from Alexandria on 6 November, escorted by the war vessels , and "Valiant", two light cruisers, and 13 destroyers, to give air spread to another guard to Malta. As of now her air assemble was fortified by a few of "Eagles"s Gloster Sea Gladiators enhancing the contenders of 806 Squadron just as torpedo aircraft from 813 and 824 Squadrons. The previous air ship were conveyed "...as a perpetual deck park..." and they shot down a CANT Z.501 seaplane two days after the fact. Soon thereafter seven Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 medium planes were blocked by three Fulmars, which professed to have shot down one aircraft and harmed another. In all actuality, they intensely harmed three of the Italian air ship. A Z.501 hunting down the armada was shot down on 10 November by a Fulmar and another on the eleventh. A trip of nine SM.79s was captured soon thereafter and the Fulmars professed to have harmed one of the planes, despite the fact that it really neglected to come back to base. Three extra Fulmars had been flown on board from "Ark Royal" a couple of days sooner, when the two bearers were close Malta; that conveyed its quality up to 15 Fulmars, 24 Swordfish, and two to four Sea Gladiators. Three Swordfish slammed soon after take-off on 10 and 11 November, presumably because of fuel tainting, and the upkeep crew members went through throughout the day difficultly depleting the majority of the fuel tanks and refilling them with clean petroleum. This left just 21 flying machine accessible for the assault.
