During 1918, "Australia" and the Grand Fleet's other capital ships on occasion escorted convoys travelling between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent the period from 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron to support minelayers. From 8 March on, the battlecruiser tested the capabilities of aircraft launched from platforms mounted over 'P' and 'Q' turrets. "Australia", along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. The 2nd BCS sailed again on 25 April to support minelayers, then cover one of the Scandinavian convoys the next day. Following the successful launch of a fully laden Sopwith 1Â½ Strutter scout plane on 14 May, "Australia" started carrying two aircraftâa Strutter for reconnaissance, and a Sopwith Camel fighterâand operated them until the end of the war. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea between 25â26 June and 29â30 July. During September and October, "Australia" and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney.
