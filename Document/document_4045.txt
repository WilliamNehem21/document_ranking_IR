MÃÂ¼ller was not without help in the press. A publication in "The Times" on 29 October 1860 called him "nothing more nor not exactly the best Sanscrit researcher on the planet." It contrasted the circumstance with the 1832 decision, when there had additionally been a decision between the best researcher (Wilson) and a decent researcher "who was held to have made the most Christian utilization of the blessing" (William Hodge Mill). Williams, it stated, showed up as "the University manÃÂ ... , the man "adequately" met all requirements for the post, and, most importantly, as the man in whose hands, it is murmured, the interests of Christianity will be impeccably sheltered." His proposition not to show history, logic, folklore or near philology "appears to strip the subject exceptionally exposed" and would, it thought, leave the post as "an unfilled seat." It expressed that MÃÂ¼ller "best responses to the terms of Colonel Boden's establishment." His field of studyÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the most established time of Sanskrit literatureÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "must be the key of the entire position", while Williams was just acquainted with the later, "less real, and less holy" compositions. The article finished by saying that Oxford "won't pick the less learned competitor; at all occasions, it won't acknowledge from him this is the genuine standard of a sound Christian race."
