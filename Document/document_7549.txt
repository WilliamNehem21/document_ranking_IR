In the meantime, Hubbard was all the while building up Scientology's principles. A Scientology memoir expresses that "free of authoritative obligations and supported by the primary Sea Org individuals, L. Ron Hubbard presently had room schedule-wise and offices to affirm in the physical universe a portion of the occasions and places he had experienced in his adventures down the track of time." In 1965, he assigned a few existing Scientology courses as private, repackaging them as the first of the exclusive "OT levels". After two years he reported the arrival of OT3, the "Mass of Fire", uncovering the mysteries of a huge calamity that had happened "on this planet, and on the other seventy-five planets which structure this Confederacy, seventy-five million years back". Scientologists were required to embrace the initial two OT levels before figuring out how Xenu, the pioneer of the Galactic Confederacy, had transported billions of individuals to Earth and exploded them with nuclear bombs, following which their damaged spirits were stuck together at "embed stations", mentally conditioned with false recollections and inevitably wound up contained inside people. The disclosure of OT3 was said to have taken a noteworthy physical toll on Hubbard, who reported that he had broken a knee, an arm, and his back over the span of his examination. After a year, in 1968, he uncovered OT levels 4 to 6 and started conveying OT instructional classes to Scientologists on board the "Regal Scotman".
