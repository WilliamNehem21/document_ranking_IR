At 4:11Â p.m. a torpedo fired by "Moltke" passed under "Princess Royal". Those aboard the British ship saw the torpedo's track, but incorrectly concluded that a U-boat was positioned on the opposite side of the British line (away from the German battlecruisers) and was firing towards both groups of ships. This false impression was compounded by reports of a periscope sighting by the destroyer . By this time, the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 4:12 and 4:15, closing the range. This manoeuvre exposed "Lion" to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and the smoke from multiple successful hits caused "Derfflinger" to lose sight of "Princess Royal" and switch targets to at 4:16. By 4:25, the range was down to and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, "Queen Mary" was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded. At 4:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later, they sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer's battleships, but did not report this to the fleet for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north.
