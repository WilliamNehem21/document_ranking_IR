Asturias obscures the partition among dream and reality all through , making it one of the novel's most unmistakable topics. Latin American author and faultfinder Ariel Dorfman takes note of that the blending of dream and the truth is mostly a consequence of Asturias' incessant utilization of allegorical language. This complex decision is reflected in the substance of the story itself, which recommends that a critical impact of oppressive power is the obscuring of dreams and reality. Dorfman additionally noticed that the President is continued by dread, which further hazy spots the qualification among the real world and dream. This dread gifts him the willful or automatic help of others, empowering the President to practice his orders. Dorfman states that the President's utilization of dread lifts his commands to legends.
