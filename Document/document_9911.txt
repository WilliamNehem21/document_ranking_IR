Forty-four seconds after Moosally's structure, Lieutenant Buch announced that Turret Two's correct weapon was stacked and prepared to shoot. After seventeen seconds, he detailed that the left weapon was prepared. A couple of moments later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's inside firearm room, answered to Ziegler over the turret's telephone circuit that, "We have an issue here. We are not prepared yet. We have an issue here." Ziegler reacted by declaring over the turret's telephone circuit, "Left firearm stacked, great job. Focus weapon is having a little inconvenience. We'll fix that." Mortensen, observing Turret Two's telephone circuit from his situation in Turret One, heard Buch affirm that the left and right weapons were stacked. Lawrence at that point got out, "I'm not prepared yet! I'm not prepared yet!" Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's driving insignificant officer abruptly gotten out, "Mort! Mort! Mort!" Ziegler yelled, "Goodness, my God! The powder is seething!" At this time, Ziegler may have opened the entryway from the turret officer's stall in the back of the turret into the inside firearm room and hollered at the team to get the breech shut. About this equivalent time, Hanyecz shouted via telephone circuit, "Gracious, my God! There's a glimmer!"
