Having left Ukraine in September 1922, Quisling and Asja came back to Kharkov in February 1923 to drag out guide endeavors, with Nansen portraying Quisling's work as "completely fundamental." Quisling found the circumstance much improved and, with no crisp difficulties, discovered it a more exhausting excursion than his last. He did anyway meet Maria Vasiljevna Pasetchnikova (), a Ukrainian over ten years his lesser. Her journals from the time "show a blooming relationship" amid the mid year of 1923, notwithstanding Quisling's marriage to Asja the prior year. She reviewed that she was inspired by his familiar order of the Russian language, his Aryan appearance, and his thoughtful mien. Quisling obviously wedded Pasetchnikova in Kharkov on 10 September 1923, albeit no legitimate documentation has been found. Quisling's biographer, Dahl, trusts that more then likely the second marriage was never official. In any case, the couple carried on just as they were hitched, and praised their wedding commemoration. Not long after the wedding, the guide mission arrived at an end and the trio left the Ukraine, and from the late spring of 1923 onwards they intended to go through a year in Paris. Maria needed to see Western Europe; Quisling needed to get some rest following episodes of stomach torment that had kept going all winter.
