Hammocks are often the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river and are dominated by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern live oaks ("Quercus virginiana"). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee ("Psychotria"), white indigoberry ("Randia aculeata"), poisonwood ("Metopium toxiferum") and saw palmetto ("Serenoa repens"). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughsâwhich often form the shape of a teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around themâbut they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind ("Lysiloma latisiliquum") and gumbo-limbo ("Bursera simaruba"), rarely grow higher than because of wind, fire, and climate.
The plant growth around the hammock base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks is an ideal habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and amphibians (such as the American green tree frog, "Hyla cinerea"), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls ("Strix varia"), woodpeckers, northern cardinals ("Cardinalis cardinalis"), and southern bald eagles ("Haliaeetus leucocephalus") nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include black bears ("Ursus americanus floridanus"), red foxes ("Vulpes vulpes"), minks ("Neovison vison"), marsh rabbits ("Sylvilagus palustris"), gray foxes ("Urocyon cinereoargenteus"), white-tailed deer ("Odocoileus virginianus"), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther ("Puma con color corgi").
