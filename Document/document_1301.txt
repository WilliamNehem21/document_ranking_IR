Despite the fact that Priestley was caught up with shielding phlogiston hypothesis from the "new scientists", the majority of what he distributed in Birmingham was religious. In 1782 he distributed the fourth volume of his "Foundations", "A History of the Corruptions of Christianity", portraying how he thought the lessons of the early Christian church had been "ruined" or contorted. Schofield portrays the work as "subordinate, scattered, longwinded, and dreary, point by point, thorough, and devastatingly contended". The content tends to issues extending from the heavenly nature of Christ to the best possible structure for the Lord's Supper. Priestley lined up in 1786 with the provocatively titled book, "A History of Early Opinions concerning Jesus Christ, incorporated from Original Writers, demonstrating that the Christian Church was at first Unitarian". Thomas Jefferson would later compose of the significant impact that these two books had on him: "I have perused his Corruptions of Christianity, and Early Opinions of Jesus, again and again; and I lay on themÃÂ ... as the premise of my own confidence. These compositions have never been replied." Although a couple of perusers, for example, Jefferson and other Rational Dissenters affirmed of the work, it was brutally audited in light of its outrageous philosophical positions, especially its dismissal of the Trinity.
