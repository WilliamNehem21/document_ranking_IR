In the wake of charging in 1901, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" joined her sister sends in the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet). After her sister steered into the rocks and must be docked for fixes, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" supplanted her as the I Squadron leader, which was directed by Prince Heinrich, the sibling of Wilhelm II. She held this post until 24 October, when "Kaiser Friedrich III" came back to support. Meanwhile, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was available for the Kiel Week cruising regatta in June and the commitment of a landmark at the "Marineakademie" (Naval Academy) in Kiel. Toward the finish of July, she drove the squadron on a journey to Spanish waters, and keeping in mind that docked in CÃÂ¡diz, they rendezvoused with the "Brandenburg"- class war vessels coming back from East Asian waters. The I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August, however the late landing of the "Brandenburg"s deferred the investment of the I Squadron in the yearly pre-winter armada preparing. The moves started with activities in the German Bight, trailed by a fake assault on the fortresses in the lower Elbe. Gunnery drills occurred in Kiel Bay before the armada steamed to Danzig Bay, where the moves finished up on 15 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and the remainder of I Squadron went on their ordinary winter voyage to Norway in December, which incorporated a prevent at Oslo from 7 to 12 December.
