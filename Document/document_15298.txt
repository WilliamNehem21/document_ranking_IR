Bridport gave instructions as he withdrew for "Alexandre", "Formidable" and "Tigre" to be taken under tow by HMS "Prince", HMS "Barfleur" and HMS "Prince George" respectively. The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only "Queen Charlotte" had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; "Queen Charlotte" and "Colossus" had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively. Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at Carnac on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren. Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Spencer, but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.
