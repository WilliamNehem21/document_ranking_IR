A public hearing on Legislative Route 279 and on the Ardath Road connection to La Jolla was held on NovemberÂ 15, 1961. At the hearing, there were concerns expressed regarding destruction of vegetation. City and state officials indicated that the Soledad Freeway would be constructed in the northern part of the canyon to minimize environmental damage. On NovemberÂ 9, 1966, the I-5 interchange with Ardath Road opened at the western end of what would become SRÂ 52. The original goal was to connect the interchange with San Clemente Canyon Road, which served as a predecessor to SRÂ 52; plans were to widen the road to four lanes and designate it as SRÂ 52. The connecting ramps were not opened that day because the aluminum guard rails had not been delivered on time. Estimates indicated that each resident of La Jolla would save 80Â hours per year by using Ardath Road. A ramp from southbound I-5 to westbound Ardath Road was never completed because of a hairpin turn that would be necessary due to the towering cliff on the west side of I-5 that Ardath Road ascends as it continues to La Jolla. On NovemberÂ 18, San Clemente Canyon Road was connected to I-5 when the aluminum guard rails arrived and were subsequently installed. San Clemente Canyon Road was not fully opened until 1967. That year, citizens expressed opposition to the construction of the Soledad Freeway because some wanted the land to be used for a park, and did not view the freeway as "necessary."
