"Psilocybe pseudoaztecorum", found in India, varies from "P.ÃÂ aztecorum" in the morphology of the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia. The trademark filamentous neck present in the cystidia of "P.ÃÂ aztecorum" is missing in "P.ÃÂ pseudoaztecorum". "P.ÃÂ pseudoaztecorum" had been recently depicted by K.ÃÂ Natarajan and N.ÃÂ Raman as "P.ÃÂ aztecorum", however they distributed the taxon with another name after counsel with GuzmÃÂ¡n. New examples of "P.ÃÂ aztecorum" take after "P.ÃÂ pelliculosa", however this last species is discovered just in the Pacific Northwest locale of the United States and Canada. Like "P.ÃÂ aztecorum", the tops of the South African species "P.ÃÂ natalensis" additionally dye to almost white when dried. The firmly related "P.ÃÂ baeocystis" additionally fades in shading to white when dry. Found in northwest North America from British Columbia to Washington and Oregon, "P.ÃÂ baeocystis" has more slender cheilocystidia than "P.ÃÂ aztecorum" (commonly estimating 20Ã¢ÂÂ 32 by 4.4Ã¢ÂÂ 6ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m) and its pleurocystidia, when present, are discovered just close to the gill edge. "P.ÃÂ quebecensis", known just from Quebec, Canada, has pleurocystidia estimating 12Ã¢ÂÂ 25 by 5Ã¢ÂÂ 10ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. Despite the fact that the phylogeny of the species including segment "Aztecorum" isn't known with conviction, GuzmÃÂ¡n has recommended that "P.ÃÂ aztecorum" was the predecessor of "P.ÃÂ baeocystis" in northwestern North America and of "P.ÃÂ quebecensis" in northeastern North America.
