Merchandise has been modeled after Naruto, including keychains, and action figures. In the 2009 Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards, Junko Takeuchi won Best Voice Actress (Japanese) for her work as Naruto. Naruto was placed sixth in IGN's Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie stating that although: "Naruto actually isn't the most popular character in his own series most of the time," he is "the engine that powers the franchise." In the 2011 "Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition", he was noted as the twenty-ninth best character appearing in video games. While working for CyberConnect2 in the making of the ".hack" games, character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto used Naruto as a model for ".hack"s protagonist, Kite. Shortly afterwards, CyberConnect2 started developing the "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja" games although Sadamoto recalls he was unaware this fact. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama also participated in the 2012 Paris Marathon while cosplaying as Naruto to celebrating the release of a new video game. Matsuyama also said that Naruto's Rasenshuriken was his favorite technique in the entire series due to its sounds as well as how the character executes it. In 2014, IGN listed him as the second best "Naruto" character when the series ended. Theatergoers for the "Boruto" film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Naruto and Boruto's images. In a Japanese TV special from August 2017, Naruto was voted as the 13th "strongest hero" from the Heisei Era. Additionally, in 2017 Charapedia poll, Naruto ranked 9th most ideal Prime Minister in anime series. For the upcoming 2020 Summer Olympics, Naruto's image is being used as a character to represent the event.
