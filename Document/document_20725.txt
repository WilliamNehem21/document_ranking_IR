Trials continued into 1894, and while conducting forced draft tests in Strander Bucht on 16 February 1894, the ship suffered the worst machinery accident in the history of the "Kaiserliche Marine". One of the main steam valves from the starboard boilers exploded, killing forty-four men in the boiler room and injuring another seven. The cause of the explosion was a defect in the construction of the valve. Prince Henry, aboard the nearby transport ship "Pelikan", immediately ordered the ship to come to "Brandenburg"s aid, and took off the dead and wounded men. "Brandenburg" then put into Wiker Bucht, and was later towed to Kiel, where she entered the "Kaiserliche Werft" (Imperial Shipyard) for repairs. The accident caused a minor political incident after the press criticized Wilhelm II for failing to send Prince Henry to the funerals for the sailors. Additionally, "Vizeadmiral" Friedrich von Hollmann, the State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (Imperial Naval Office) stated before the "Reichstag" (Imperial Diet) that "such accidents could occur again and again", which increased parliamentary resistance to further increases in naval budgets; this led to an initial rejection of funds for the first armored cruiser, . Admirals Eduard von Knorr and Hans von Koester criticized the comment, forcing Hollmann to publicly apologize.
