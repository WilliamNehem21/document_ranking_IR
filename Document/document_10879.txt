"Banksia sphaerocarpa" is one of five firmly related "Banksia" species that have profoundly strange blossom nectar. While other "Banksia" species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is light yellow at first, yet bit by bit winds up darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green adhesive inside one to two days of emission, and inevitably turning into "a practically dark, coagulated knot sticking to the base of the blooms". It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980; he credited it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars. Taking note of that a significant number of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts, he theorized that they help the plant by fixing environmental nitrogen, which is then washed off the blossom heads by downpour, and consumed by the proteoid root tangle. This implied advantageous interaction was explored by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, yet no proof of nitrogen fixing was found. Further examination by Markey and Lamont in 1996 proposed that the discolouration isn't brought about by cyanobacteria or different microorganisms in the nectar, however is somewhat "a synthetic marvel of plant cause". Their examinations demonstrated that the nectar had abnormally elevated amounts of sugar and free amino acids, however three of these species, including "B.ÃÂ sphaerocarpa", have since been appeared to have typical nectar sugar sytheses.
