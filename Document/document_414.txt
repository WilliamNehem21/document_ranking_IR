Sound Transit suspended anticipating the Portage Bay passage in 2000 after it got development offers that were $171 million higher than anticipated, accused on a focused work market and soil testing that showed that a more profound passage was required. Looked with spending issues and further timetable deferrals, Sound Transit conceded development of the fragment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while reexamining arrangement alternatives. The options were limited to two choices in mid 2002: a passage under the Ship Canal at University Bridge with a solitary station at Northeast 45th Street; and a passage under the Montlake Cut and stations close Husky Stadium and at Northeast 45th Street. A Sound Transit think about decided the Montlake course was the most financially savvy, and the University of Washington embraced it as the least troublesome to its exploration structures. In 2004, the Sound Transit Board affirmed this course, including an underground station at Husky Stadium with an underground person on foot association with the grounds, as the new favored arrangement for the Link light rail venture. The $1.9 billion "College Link" venture, with the Husky Stadium station as the northern end, got last endorsement from Sound Transit and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in 2006.
