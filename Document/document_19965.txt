From 1996 to 1999, the church was restored with the help of sponsors EnergoPol, a Polish company, and Renovabis, a German association for Roman Catholic churches. The Russian government provided funds towards the conclusion of the project. Reconstruction took place initially under the direction of Polish companies PKZ and Budimex, who completely restored the faÃ§ade and roof. From September 1998, Father Andrzey Stetskevich and Jan Tajchman, architect and restorer from ToruÅ, Poland, jointly oversaw the work; they had previously headed the restoration of the Catholic Assumption Cathedral in St. Petersburg. (Stetskevich later rose to become vicar general of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow.) The interior fittings and the new altar were built by Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian experts. Companies in Moscow carried out all the internal and external marble work. The church furnishings were produced, under the direction of Vladimir Mukhin, by students from the St. Petersburg renovating school. Stained glass for the faÃ§ade's rose window were made in ToruÅ, other windows were produced by Tolotschko, a Belarusian company from Hrodna. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was ceremonially reopened on 12Â December 1999 and was reconsecrated by the Secretary of State of the Roman Curia, Angelo Cardinal Sodano. The cathedral incorporates a library, the editorial office of the Russian Catholic magazine "The Catholic MessengerâThe Light of the Gospel" (Russian: ÐÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð»Ð¸ÑÐµÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð²ÐµÑÑÐ½Ð¸Ðº â Ð¡Ð²ÐµÑ ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð³ÐµÐ»Ð¸Ñ) as well as the local office for the Caritas charity.
