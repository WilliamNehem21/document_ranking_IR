Tilley's first errand in his new job was to arrange a deed of cession with the nearby powers to guarantee a formal and serene exchange of control to the United States. With the apportioning of Samoa, two territorial governments stayed on Tutuila which had been subjected to an administration on the western, German-controlled island of Upolu. Both of these legislatures were good toward the cession. The occupants of the island of Tau and the volcanic doublet of Ofu-Olosega (together known as Manu'a) toward the east were politically isolated from Tutuila. On March 12, 1900, Tilley made a trip to Tau to meet with the neighborhood ruler Tui ManuÃÂ»a Elisala. Eventually, the ruler consented to surrender some sway to the United States, however would not think about full cession. The deed of cession was marked on April 17, 1900 and recorded Manu'a as a feature of the United States' new domain, however without the mark of its delegate. In it, Tilley was named Acting Governor; the domain did not have an official senator until the title was given to Governor Edmund Beardsley Underwood in 1905. Manu'a did not consent to sign the deed until 1904, subsequent to arranging concessions from the United States.
