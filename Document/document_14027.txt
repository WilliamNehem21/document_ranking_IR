Loaned (2003) and Shimizu (1996) both recommend that the Malaysian comic industry started to blast after Lat joined the calling on a full-time premise in 1974. Loaned further dangers that the visual artist calling was made progressively decent in Malaysia by the honor to Lat in 1994 of a "datuk" title (identical to a knighthood). Presented on Lat by the Sultan of Perak, the title was Malaysia's most noteworthy acknowledgment of the visual artist's effect on his compatriots and his commitments to the nation. Prior to Lat's development, Malaysian cartooning was to a great extent neglected by general society, in spite of the well known works of Raja Hamzad and Rejabhad. Lat's triumphs indicated Malaysians that they could flourish and prevail as visual artists, and propelled them to seek the cartooning calling for potential professions. A few more youthful specialists imitated his style with expectations of catching equal prizes. Zambriabu and Rasyid Asmawi replicated the unmistakable three circle noses and hairdos of Lat's characters. Others, for example, Reggie Lee and Nan, consolidated Lat's point by point "topical and elaborate methodologies" in their works. Muliyadi named Lat the "Father of Contemporary Malaysian Cartoons", for being the principal Malaysian visual artist to accomplish worldwide acknowledgment and for improving the business' picture in their nation.
