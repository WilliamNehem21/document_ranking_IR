In 2014, "Edge" magazine described "Secret of Mana" as "one of the high points of the 16bit era". A writer for the magazine noted that, 20 years after "Secret of Mana"s release, its reputation as a SNES action RPG had been surpassed only by that of "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past". Review aggregator site GameRankings lists the game as the 13th-highest rated SNES game. In 1996, "Super Play" ranked "Secret of Mana" eighth on its list of the best 100 SNES games of all time. It took 42nd place on "Nintendo Power" magazine's 2006 "Top 200 Nintendo Games of All Time" list, and the magazine called it the 86th best game on a Nintendo system. IGN's "Top 100 Games" list ranked the game at number 48 in 2005, number 49 in 2006, and number 79 in 2007, and their 2017 "Top 100 RPGs" list had it as number 7. In 2006, "Famitsu"s "All Time Top 100" audience poll ranked it number 97. "Secret of Mana" was an influential game in its time, and its influence continued into the 2010s. Elements such as its radial ring menu system, described by "Edge" as "oft-mimicked", were borrowed by later games such as "The Temple of Elemental Evil". Its cooperative multiplayer gameplay has been mentioned as an influence on "Dungeon Siege III".
