In spite of the Vansant assault, shorelines along the Jersey Shore stayed open. Sightings of huge sharks swarming off the shoreline of New Jersey were accounted for via ocean commanders entering the ports of Newark and New York City yet were rejected. The second significant assault happened 45ÃÂ miles (72ÃÂ km) north of Beach Haven at the retreat town of Spring Lake, New Jersey. The injured individual was Charles Bruder, 27, a Swiss chime commander at the Essex and Sussex Hotel. Bruder was killed on Thursday, July 6, 1916, while swimming 130ÃÂ yards (120ÃÂ m) from shore. A shark bit him in the stomach area and separated his legs; Bruder's blood turned the water red. In the wake of hearing shouts, a lady informed two lifeguards that a kayak with a red structure had overturned and was coasting exactly at the water's surface. Lifeguards Chris Anderson and George White paddled to Bruder in a raft and acknowledged he had been chomped by a shark. They pulled him from the water, however he seeped to death while in transit to shore. As per "The New York Times", "ladies [were] terrified [and fainted] as [Bruder's] ravaged bodyÃÂ ... [was] brought shorewards." Guests and specialists at the Essex and Sussex and neighboring inns fund-raised for Bruder's mom in Switzerland.
