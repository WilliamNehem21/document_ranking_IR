Commenting on the band's objectives for the "Distrustful Android" music video, Yorke said that, "When it came time to make the video for that melody, we had loads of individuals saying, 'Definitely, incredible, we can have another video like "Road Spirit", all touchy and dark and dim.' Well, no. We had some good times doing this melody, so the video should make you giggle. That is to say, it ought to be wiped out, as well." Magnus Carlsson, Swedish maker of the energized arrangement "Robin", was appointed by the band to make the video. Radiohead were aficionados of the show, and associated with the Robin character; Jonny Greenwood portrayed him as "warm" and "helpless", while Yorke conceded that he discovered Robin "a remarkable defenseless character, but at the same time he's savagely pessimistic and very extreme and would dependably get up once more." At first Carlsson tried to take a shot at a video for "No Surprises" and was dubious about how to approach "Distrustful Android". In the end he conceived a situation to the band's preferring after he secured himself his office for more than 12 hours to gaze out of the window, while tuning in to the melody on rehash while writing down visual thoughts. As Carlsson did not approach the verses at the time, the idea for the video depended completely on the melody's sound. As indicated by Yorke, the band "intentionally didn't send Magnus the verses" since they "didn't need [the video] to be excessively strict."
