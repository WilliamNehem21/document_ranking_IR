On 25Ã¢ÂÂ 26 September, "Oldenburg" and the remainder of I Squadron secured a development led by the II "FÃÂ¼hrer der Torpedoboote" (Leader of Torpedo Boats) to the Terschelling Bank. Scheer led another armada activity on 18Ã¢ÂÂ 20 October toward the Dogger Bank, however again they neglected to discover British powers. For most of 1917, "Oldenburg" was allocated to watch obligation in the German Bight. Amid Operation Albion, the land and/or water capable strike on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, "Oldenburg" and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to obstruct any conceivable British endeavor to mediate. On 28 October the four boats touched base in Putzig Wiek, and from that point steamed to Arensburg on 29 October. On 2 November the task was finished and "Oldenburg" and her sisters started the voyage back toward the North Sea. A last unsuccessful armada foray occurred on 23Ã¢ÂÂ 24 April 1918. Scheer had planned to catch a British caravan to Norway and demolish the escorting war vessels. Amid the activity, the battlecruiser "Moltke" endured mechanical issues and must be towed back to port. "Oldenburg" took the ship close by, and the principle body of the armada swung back to Germany while Hipper looked futile for the escort. German knowledge had inaccurately put the date for the booked escort on 24 April, and following a few hours of pointless steaming, Hipper turned for port too. By 18:37, the armada was outside the Jade and "Moltke" had been sufficiently fixed to enable her to enter port under her own capacity.
