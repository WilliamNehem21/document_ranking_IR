Theramenes was a focal figure in four noteworthy scenes of Athenian history. He showed up on the scene in 411 BC as one of the pioneers of an oligarchic upset, yet, as his perspectives and those of the overthrow's different pioneers wandered, he started to restrict their manages and led the pack in supplanting the limited government they had forced with an all the more extensively based one. He filled in as a general for quite a while after this, however was not reelected to that office in 407 BC. After the Battle of Arginusae, in which he filled in as a trierarch, he was allocated to save Athenian mariners from sinking ships, however was kept from doing as such by a tempest. That episode incited an enormous furore at Athens, in which Theramenes needed to excuse himself from duty regarding the fizzled salvage; the discussion finished in the execution of six officers who had directed at that fight. After the Athenian thrashing at Aegospotami in 405 BC, Theramenes masterminded the terms by which Athens surrendered to Sparta. He at that point turned into an individual from the limited oligarchic government, known as the Thirty Tyrants, that Sparta forced on its crushed adversary. As he had in 411 BC, Theramenes before long collided with the more outrageous individuals from that administration; his dissents against the rule of dread the Thirty actualized drove the main oligarchs to plot his destruction; he was reprimanded before the oligarchic get together, and afterward, when that body seemed hesitant to rebuff him, struck him from the list of residents and executed him without preliminary.
