Lyrical themes explored on "Christ Illusion" deal with terrorism, warfare and religion, drew criticism from conservative groups. It includes a depiction of the September 11 attacks from the viewpoint of one of the terrorists ("Jihad"), and a portrayal of a soldier's experience of post-traumatic stress ("Eyes of the Insane"). The song "Cult" revolves around King's perception of flaws in American religion, while "Consfearacy" has been described as a "government hating song".
Critical reaction to the album's lyrical content was mixed. Thom Jurek of "Allmusic" felt the "dark, unrelentingly twisted-as-fuck lyrics reflect a singular intensity," and praised the band for connecting their anti-religion stance with a belief that religion has underscored many wars throughout history. However, "Rolling Stone"s Chris Steffen mourned that it had become "downright painful to hear Tom Araya â at 45 years old! â continue to belt out the band's increasingly self-parodying, anti-religious lyrics," and singled out lyrics such as "Religion's a whore" and "I've made my choice: six six six!" as over the top. Jamie Thomson of "The Guardian" wrote that the album left "no blasphemy... unuttered", while Peter Atkinson of "KNAC.com" observed that "when not fixating on religion, the band revisit their other favorite subject â war â in surprisingly familiar terms," and remarked that Slayer had sunk "to the level of God-repelling dunderheads Deicide." He concluded the review with the opinion that "It's dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again from "God Hates Us All" â and once you've titled something "God Hates Us All," haven't you made your point enough already?"
