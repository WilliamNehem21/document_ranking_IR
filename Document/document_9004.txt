Beatty requested his battlecruisers to make all viable speed to get the Germans before they could get away. "New Zealand" and "Dauntless" were the slowest of Beatty's boats, and step by step fell behind the more up to date battlecruisers. Notwithstanding this, "New Zealand" had the capacity to start shooting at "BlÃÂ¼cher" by 9:35, and kept on drawing in the protected cruiser after the other British battlecruisers had changed focuses to the German battlecruisers. After around 60 minutes, "New Zealand" had thumped out "BlÃÂ¼cher"s forward turret, and "Unstoppable" started to flame on her too at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells punctured the German ship's reinforced deck and detonated in an ammo room four minutes after the fact. This began a flame amidships that demolished her two port turrets, while the blackout harmed her motors with the goal that her speed dropped to , and stuck her directing rigging. At 10:48, Beatty requested "Unyielding" to assault her, however the mix of a flagging mistake by Beatty's banner lieutenant and overwhelming harm to Beatty's leader "Lion", which had thumped out her radio and sufficiently made smoke darken her flag halyards, caused the remainder of the British battlecruisers, incidentally under the direction of Rear Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in "New Zealand", to believe that that flag connected to them. Accordingly, they got some distance from Hipper's primary body and connected with "BlÃÂ¼cher". "New Zealand" shot 147 shells at "BlÃÂ¼cher" before the German ship overturned and sank at 12:07 in the wake of being torpedoed by "Arethusa". Commander Halsey had again worn the piupiu over his uniform amid the fight, and the absence of harm to "New Zealand" was yet again credited to its good karma properties.
