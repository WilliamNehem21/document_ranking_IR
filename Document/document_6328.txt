The Rodrigues rail was a flightless rail with brilliant dark plumage, maybe spotted with white. Its nose and legs were red, and it had a red, exposed region (or wattle) around its eyes. Its accurate size is obscure, however it was about the measure of a chicken, and fairly littler than the related red rail. Subfossil remains display a substantial variety in size, which may reflect sexual dimorphism. The skull of the Rodrigues rail was somewhat prolong, raised toward each path, and was long and wide. The skull had a limited, long frontal area, in any event width. The mouth fluctuated enormously fit as a fiddle; a few examples had short and practically straight noses, and others had any longer noses (up to 33% longer) that were conspicuously bended. It is obscure whether this was identified with the general size of an individual fledgling or to sexual dimorphism. The culmen of the nose was practically straight over the nostril, and the nasal bone was marginally longer than the head. The bill was up to long, the lower jaw up to long, and at its most prominent profundity. The scapula (shoulder bone) was long, the humerus ran from , and the ulna from . The pelvis was extensive and emphatically worked in extent to the measure of the fledgling, was long, wide at the front, and wide at the back. The femur extended from long, the tibia from , and the metatarsus was long.
