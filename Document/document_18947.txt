It is not clear for which companies Shakespeare wrote his early plays. The title page of the 1594 edition of "Titus Andronicus" reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes. After the plagues of 1592â3, Shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at The Theatre and the Curtain in Shoreditch, north of the Thames. Londoners flocked there to see the first part of "Henry IV", Leonard Digges recording, "Let but Falstaff come, Hal, Poins, the restÂ ... and you scarce shall have a room". When the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled The Theatre down and used the timbers to construct the Globe Theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the Thames at Southwark. The Globe opened in autumn 1599, with "Julius Caesar" one of the first plays staged. Most of Shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the Globe, including "Hamlet", "Othello," and "King Lear".
After the Lord Chamberlain's Men were renamed the King's Men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new King James. Although the performance records are patchy, the King's Men performed seven of Shakespeare's plays at court between 1 November 1604, and 31 October 1605, including two performances of "The Merchant of Venice". After 1608, they performed at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre during the winter and the Globe during the summer. The indoor setting, combined with the Jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed Shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices. In "Cymbeline", for example, Jupiter descends "in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The ghosts fall on their knees."
