The catamount chases creatures of various sizes, and modifies its chasing strategies in like manner. With little creatures, for example, rodents (counting squirrels), feathered creatures, fish including little sharks, and creepy crawlies, it chases in regions known to be plenteous in prey, and will lie, hunker, or stand, and trust that unfortunate casualties will meander close. It at that point jumps, getting its prey with its sharp, retractable paws. For marginally bigger creatures, for example, geese, rabbits, and bunnies, it stalks from spread and holds up until prey goes inside before surging in to assault. Less usually, it benefits from bigger creatures, for example, youthful ungulates, and different carnivores, for example, fishers (basically female), foxes, minks, martens, skunks, little mutts, and trained felines. Wildcats are viewed as the major savage risk to the jeopardized challenging crane. Wildcats are additionally infrequent seekers of domesticated animals and poultry. While bigger species, for example, cows and ponies, are not known to be assaulted, wildcats do show a risk to littler ruminants, for example, sheep and goats. As per the National Agricultural Statistics Service, wildcats executed 11,100 sheep in 2004, including 4.9% of all sheep predator passings. Be that as it may, some measure of wildcat predation might be misidentified, as catamounts have been known to rummage on the remaining parts of domesticated animals murders by different creatures.
