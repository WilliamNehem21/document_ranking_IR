In November 1959, following twelve years as an expert performer, Ray Charles marked with ABC Records, following the lapse of his Atlantic Records contract. As indicated by Will Friedwald in "A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers", "His initial four ABC collections were all essentially committed to standards..." In the 1960s, he encountered hybrid accomplishment with both mood and blues and down home music. Since Charles was marked to ABC as a cadence and blues artist, he chose to hold up until his agreement was fulfilled for its three-year restoration before exploring different avenues regarding down home music, in spite of the fact that he needed to do as such sooner. With the help of ABC official Sid Feller, he accumulated a lot of blue grass melodies to record, in spite of the desires of ABC. The arrival of his 1962 blue grass collections "Present day Sounds in Country and Western Music" and its follow-up "Current Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2" expanded the intrigue of his music to the standard. Now, Charles started to bid more to a white group of onlookers. In 1962 he established his very own record mark, Tangerine Records, which ABC-Paramount advanced and conveyed.
