The spread picture was shot in April 1997 at Stocks House in Hertfordshire, the previous home of Victor Lownes, leader of the Playboy Clubs in the UK until 1981. It demonstrates the band remaining outside the inn encompassed by different props; in the middle is a Rolls Royce skimming in a pool. Picture taker Michael Spencer Johns said the first idea included shooting each band part in different areas around the globe, yet when the cost demonstrated restrictive, the shoot was moved to Stocks House. Spencer commented that the shoot "declined into mayhem", including that "by 8ÃÂ pm, everybody was in the bar, there were schoolkids everywhere throughout the set, and the lighting group couldn't begin the generator. It was Alice in Wonderland meets Apocalypse Now." Critics have attempted to peruse into the determination of the spread props, however Johns said Gallagher just chosen things from the BBC props store he thought would look great in the image. Two props thought about were an inflatable globe (planned as a praise to the sleeve of "Certainly Maybe") and the Rolls Royce, recommended by Arthurs. The discharge date in every area was recognized on the timetable imagined on the sleeve; Harris said the dating "[encouraged] fans to trust that to purchase a duplicate on the day it showed up was to partake in some sort of authentic occasion."
