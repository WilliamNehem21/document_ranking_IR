A significant part of the additional nearby extending in Death Valley that is in charge of its lower profundity and more extensive valley floor is brought about by "left" parallel strike-slip development along the Garlock Fault south of the recreation center (the Garlock Fault isolates the Sierra Nevada go from the Mojave Desert). This specific blame is pulling the Panamint Range westbound, causing the Death Valley graben to slip descending along the Furnace Creek Fault framework at the foot of the Black Mountains. The stones that would turn into the Panamint Range may have been stacked over the stones that would turn into the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Under this understanding, as the Black Mountains climbed, the Panamint/Cottonwood Mountains slid westbound off of them along low-point ordinary blames, and beginning around 6 Ma, the Cottonwood Mountains slid northwest off the highest point of the Panamint Range. There is likewise some proof that the Grapevine Mountains may have slid off the Funeral Mountains. Another translation of the proof is that the Black and Panamint Mountains were once next to each other and were pulled separated along typical flaws. These typical flaws, in this view, are steep close to the surface yet turned out to be low edge at profundity; the mountain squares pivoted as they slid to make the tilted mountains seen today.
