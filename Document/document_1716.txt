The substance of the top comprises of various infinitesimally unmistakable layers of tissue. The fingernail skin of the top (known as the pileipellis) is between 8Ã¢ÂÂ 10ÃÂ ÃÂµm thick, and is made of a free "textura intricata", a kind of tissue in which the hyphae are sporadically entwined with unmistakable spaces between them. The fingernail skin hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with dissipated unnoticeable cystidia estimating 40Ã¢ÂÂ 55 by 3.5Ã¢ÂÂ 5.5ÃÂ ÃÂµm. These cystidia situated in the top (pileocystidia) are tube shaped, dainty walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, once in a while with formless soiled darker material covering the dividers. Underneath the fingernail skin layer is a zone 54Ã¢ÂÂ 65ÃÂ ÃÂµm thick, made of all around inexactly laced, flimsy walled hyphae, 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ ÃÂµm in thickness, with clips at the septa. Beneath this is a zone 208Ã¢ÂÂ 221ÃÂ ÃÂµm in thickness, in which the thickly compacted hyphae, 3Ã¢ÂÂ 8ÃÂ ÃÂµm in width, have swollen, gelatinized dividers, and regularly pretty much a vertical introduction. This thusly is trailed by a layer 520ÃÂ ÃÂµm in thickness, shaped of freely entwined hyphae, 2Ã¢ÂÂ 8ÃÂ ÃÂµm in width, some of which have dainty dividers with cinches at the septa, while others have to some degree thickened gelatinized dividers. The tissue of the top has a layer of upstanding hyphae bowing into a lower layer of joined hyphae with distances across of 2.5Ã¢ÂÂ 8ÃÂ ÃÂµm. The substance of the gills is like that of the lower top.
