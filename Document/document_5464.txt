Down home Music Television named "Climate and Water" one of its ten most loved twang collections of the year, saying, "At the nexus of twang, nation and pop, this beguiling trio promptly prevail upon such various gatherings of people in show. Fortunately, their triumphant identity means this circleÃ¢ÂÂeven with a few despairing, yet melodic, tunes. Not in vain bobbed Dylan and Willie Nelson pick them to open their mid year voyage through small time ballparks." The Greencards were the opening represent Dylan and Nelson on their 2005 summer visit. Kym Warner credits Gary Paczosa, an architect who chipped away at "Climate and Water", with helping them get the chance to visit with Dylan and Nelson. Paczosa had recently filled in as a designer on accounts for Alison Krauss, Nickel Creek and Dolly Parton. "He makes the best-sounding acoustic records on the planet", as per Warner. All through 2005 they visited broadly with Dylan and Nelson, and thereafter visited with Tommy Emmanuel. Amid the late spring fragment of the 2005 visit with Nelson and Dylan, Warner needed to have the chance to get Dylan's feedback about music and performing. Be that as it may, Warner did not get the chance to invest much energy alone with Dylan amid their time out and about together. Dylan later told Warner toward the finish of the visit, "You'll be fine starting now and into the foreseeable future."
