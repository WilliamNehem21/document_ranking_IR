Amid the Red Scare, he was disparaging of endeavors to allow unlawful wiretap proof in government courts and endeavors to decrease the insurances against self-implication conceded by the Fifth Amendment. By the by, he wouldn't strip Joseph McCarthy, the main figure in the Red Scare, of his significant Senate board chairmanships, alerted that "a considerable lot of the individuals who harshly restrict Senator McCarthy require similar strategies that they accuse him of."

He likewise contradicted the Submerged Lands Act and the Mexican Farm Labor charge, the two of which were bolstered by the Eisenhower organization. He reproved Eisenhower's arrangement of Albert M. Cole, an open rival of open lodging, as Federal Housing Administrator and restricted a large number of the agrarian changes proposed by Eisenhower's Agriculture Secretary, Ezra Taft Benson.
