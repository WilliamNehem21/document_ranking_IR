There were little enclaves of Mi'kmaq in and around the bays of Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth shore. Legitimately inverse to Pier 9 on the Halifax side sat a network in Tufts Cove, otherwise called Turtle Grove. The settlement, going back to the eighteenth century, had been a subject of debate since white pioneer landowners needed to evacuate the Mi'kmaq inhabitants. In the years and months going before the blast, the Department of Indian Affairs had been effectively endeavoring to drive the Mi'kmaq to surrender their territory, yet this had not happened when of the blast. The flame on board "Mont-Blanc" drew the consideration of numerous spectators on the two sides of the harbor. The physical structures of the settlement were destroyed by the blast and tidal wave. An exact Mi'kmaq loss of life is obscure; records demonstrate that nine bodies were recouped, and the settlement was not reconstructed in the wake of the catastrophe. The Halifax Remembrance Book records 16 individuals from the Tufts Cove Community as dead; not all the dead recorded as in Tufts Cove were Indigenous. Survivors were housed in a racially isolated structure under commonly poor conditions and in the end scattered around Nova Scotia.
