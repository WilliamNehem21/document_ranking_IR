With plentiful supplies of Eisenhower dollars, the Federal Reserve had no compelling reason to arrange any in 1973, and none were struck for course. The 1973 and 1973-D were the principal Eisenhower dollars struck for incorporation in mint sets, and were, in principle, just accessible that way. Numerous 1973 and 1973-D are known in flowed condition, prompting theory that the 230,798 pieces which were accounted for dissolved after the Mint neglected to sell the same number of mint sets as foreseen, were in actuality discharged into course. John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, refering to a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C. Cahoon, which expressed that each of the 1973 Eisenhower dollars from unsold mint sets were dissolved. The 1973-S was struck for incorporation in base-metal evidence sets, just as for the standard "blue Ikes" and "darker Ikes". Offers of the part-silver pieces plunged to a sum of just shy of 2.9 million. The coin was struck again for course in 1974, was incorporated into mint sets and evidence sets, and was accessible in confirmation and uncirculated silver clad from San Francisco. Congress requested that a portion of the cash from the closeout of 1974-S silver pieces be utilized to help Eisenhower College in Seneca Falls, New York. Mint piece authorities felt that this set a terrible point of reference, yet about $9 million was paid to the school somewhere in the range of 1974 and 1978; yet, in spite of the implantation of cash, the school shut its entryways in 1982.
