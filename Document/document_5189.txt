One translation of the point of view of Rix is that she was an orientalist, in the sense utilized by scholarly Edward Said. Nonetheless, Hoorn contends that she and her sister were to a noteworthy degree counter-orientalist: they focussed on the basic idea of human experience instead of social articulations of distinction and they looked to depict regular daily existence in Tangier as they thought that it was, as opposed to introducing summed up perspectives on the orient. Her works additionally mirrored the pioneer enthusiasm for the observational: in utilizing the brilliant light of north Africa to help draw out the structures and shapes that establish up visual connections. Elaborately, Rix's Moroccan works of art have been portrayed as the "most unique, level and post-impressionistic of her profession". Regardless of whether this mirrored the impact of Matisse isn't known Ã¢ÂÂ in spite of the incidents of their Tangier visits, it isn't sure that they really met. Rix was one of the primary Australians to paint post-impressionist scenes, spoken to by works, for example, "Men in the Market Place, Tangier" (1914) and "Perspective on Tangier" (1914), created at the season of a second visit to the city. Such works showed the advancement of Rix's style at the time: free brush strokes, a palette bound to a couple of low-keyed hues, and an accentuation on shadow and light, influencing both the general impression made by the image and the treatment of individual figures.
