Sherman was reelected in 1856, crushing his Democratic rival, Herman J. Brumback, by 2,861 votes. The Republican possibility for president, John C. FrÃÂ©mont, conveyed Ohio while losing the national vote to the Democrat, James Buchanan. At the point when the 35th Congress amassed in December 1857, the counter Nebraska allianceÃ¢ÂÂpresently formally the RepublicansÃ¢ÂÂhad lost control of the House, and Sherman wound up in the minority. The sectional emergency had additionally extended in the previous year. In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its choice in "Dred Scott v. Sandford", holding that Congress had no capacity to avert bondage in the regions and that blacksÃ¢ÂÂregardless of whether free or subjugatedÃ¢ÂÂcouldn't be residents of the United States. In December of that year, in a decision boycotted by free-state partisans, Kansas embraced the expert bondage Lecompton Constitution and appealed to Congress to be conceded as a slave state. Buchanan asked that Congress take up the issue, and the Senate endorsed a bill to concede Kansas. Sherman criticized the Kansas bill in the House, bringing up the proof of misrepresentation in the races there. A portion of the Northern Democrats united with a consistent Republican assembly to vanquish the measure. Congress consented to a trade off measure, by which Kansas would be conceded after another submission on the Lecompton Constitution. The electorate rejected servitude and remained a region, a choice Sherman would later call "the defining moment of the subjugation debate".
