Hathor's sexual side was found in some short stories. In an enigmatic section of a Middle Kingdom story, known as "The Tale of the Herdsman", a herder experiences a furry, creature like goddess in a swamp and responds with fear. On one more day he experiences her as a naked, charming lady. Most Egyptologists who contemplate this story think this lady is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and risky or kindhearted and sexual. Thomas Schneider deciphers the content as inferring that between his two experiences with the goddess the herder has accomplished something to appease her. In "The Contendings of Horus and Set", a New Kingdom short tale about the question between those two divine beings, Ra is vexed subsequent to being offended by another god, Babi, and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor opens her private parts to Ra, making him snicker and get up again to play out his obligations as leader of the divine beings. Life and request were believed to be subject to Ra's action, and the story suggests that Hathor turned away the lamentable results of his inaction. Her demonstration may have lifted Ra's spirits halfway on the grounds that it explicitly stirred him, despite the fact that why he giggled isn't completely comprehended.
