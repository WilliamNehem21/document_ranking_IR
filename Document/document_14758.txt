In spite of the fact that Nielsen came to form for the most part at the piano, he just made straightforwardly for it once in a while over a time of 40 years, making works regularly with a particular style which impeded their universal acknowledgment. Nielsen's own piano method, a reverberation of which is most likely safeguarded in three wax barrels stamped "Carl Nielsen" at the State Archives in Aarhus, appears to have been fair. Checking on the 1969 chronicle of works by the musician John Ogdon, John Horton remarked on the early pieces: "Nielsen's specialized assets scarcely measure up to the greatness of his plans", while describing the later pieces as "real works which can stand examination with his symphonic music". The counter sentimental tone of the "Symphonic Suite", Op. 8 (1894) was portrayed by a later pundit as "nothing not exactly a held clench hand straight even with all settled melodic tradition". In Nielsen's words, the "Chaconne", Op. 32 (1917) was "a huge piece, and I think viable". It isn't just motivated by crafted by Bach, particularly the chaconne for solo violin, yet in addition by the virtuoso piano plans of Bach's music by authors, for example, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Likewise on a substantial scale, and from that year, is the "Subject and Variations", Op. 41, in which commentators have observed the impacts of Brahms and furthermore of Max Reger, of whom Nielsen had before kept in touch with a companion "I feel that the open will be absolutely unfit to get a handle on Reger's work but I am much more thoughtful towards his endeavors than towardsÃÂ ... Richard Strauss".
