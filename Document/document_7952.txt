Khan and Gupte initially met in school. Khan has said that he appreciated Gupte's capacities as a performing artist, author, and painter. Three years before the film's discharge Gupte conveyed Khan to the task as a maker and performing artist. Gupte himself was to coordinate, however the primary week's dailies were an incredible disillusionment to Khan, who "lost confidence in Amol and his ability of interpreting on screen what he had so flawlessly composed on paper". Khan was very nearly pulling back his investment in the movie due to these "innovative contrasts", however Gupte kept him locally available by venturing down as executive. In spite of Khan's case, Gupte lashed out saying that after the wrap-up gathering, Khan reported that he was the executive of the movie, in spite of Gupte going about as chief. Had it been important to contract an outsider, creation would have been deferred for 6Ã¢ÂÂ 8ÃÂ months as the new executive arranged for the film. Quick to keep Safary as IshaanÃ¢ÂÂthe performing artist may have matured a lot for the part had generation been deferredÃ¢ÂÂKhan assumed control over the job of executive. "Taare Zameen Par" was Khan's first involvement in the double job of performer and chief. He has conceded that the change was testing, expressing that while he had for a long while been itching to coordinate a film, it was an obscure area for him. Gupte stayed on set, "controlling [Khan] and, on occasion, notwithstanding remedying [him]".
