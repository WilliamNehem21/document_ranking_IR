Despite the fact that Harper was viewed as a smart and proficient clergyman by friends and columnistsÃ¢ÂÂa 1965 report in "The Economist" called him "by a long shot the best cerebrum" in the Rhodesian CabinetÃ¢ÂÂhis perspectives were frequently seen as excessively reactionary. He drove a phalanx of far-right voices inside the RF requiring "a type of political politically-sanctioned racial segregation" in Rhodesia, and keeping in mind that the partisan loyalty was progressive headway of dark political portrayal, Harper called for the end of such moves, yet for the nullification of dark MPs by and large. He in this way progressed toward becoming something of an impediment to an Anglo-Rhodesian settlement. In fact, when Smith brought a working report once more from the HMS "Tiger" converses with Wilson in October 1966, it was Harper who driven resistance to the terms in Cabinet, adding to its definitive dismissal. Harper viewed himself as to have been neglected when Smith gave the workplace of Deputy Prime Minister (which had been empty since UDI) to the more moderate Wrathall the month prior to the "Tiger" meeting. The South African paper "Kick the bucket Beeld" revealed in December 1966 that the RF's conservative was ready to expel Smith for Harper, however this did not happen.
