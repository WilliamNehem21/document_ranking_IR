Two men sitting tight for a trip to Chennai at the Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar take part in discussion. One is a business executive, Anbarasu, who inclines toward the curtailed name A.Aras, and the other is a scarred and twisted communist, Nallasivam, nom de plume Nalla. At the point when the flight is dropped because of overwhelming precipitation, Aras at first suspects Nalla is a fear based oppressor and advises the specialists, just to find that he was mixed up. With the downpour flooding the city, the two men are compelled to share a space throughout the evening. Both need to come back to Chennai: Aras to be available at his wedding, and Nalla needs to convey a 3,200,000 check, as of late granted to him after he won a court case, to a gathering of association laborers. Following a horrendous night, and no desire for a flight, the two men take a transport to load up the Coromandel Express train. Aras' pack gets stolen in transit abandoning him with just his charge card, which nobody acknowledges. Utilizing his common sense, Nalla over and over safeguards Aras out of inconvenience while Aras takes a stab at getting away from him at each crossroads, just to finish up with him once more. While hanging tight for the train at the Ichchapuram railroad station, Nalla starts to reveal to Aras his story.
