In mid 1944 No.ÃÂ 73 Wing was chosen to help the US Army's Admiralty Islands battle. The first Cavalry Division started to arrive on the islands on 29ÃÂ February, and the wing moved to Momote Airstrip on Los Negros Island in March 1944. No.ÃÂ 79 Squadron ended up operational there with 24 air ship on the 29th of the month. From Momote, the squadron flew ground assault forays in help of US troops until Japanese opposition stopped. No Japanese flying machine were experienced all through this task. Before the finish of April, No.ÃÂ 79 Squadron's fundamental job was to escort Allied dispatching, however flying was hampered by a deficiency of extra parts. The squadron's boss, Squadron Leader M.S. Bott, was slaughtered in a mishap on 16ÃÂ April. Transportation escort watches proceeded in May, yet challenges keeping up the Spitfires diminished the squadron to only two operational flying machine with another 12 anticipating fix. Because of a lack of air ship the squadron's flying exercises were restricted to preparing forays among August and October, and flying machine accessibility kept on being an issue until late November. On 9ÃÂ November, two Spitfires fruitlessly endeavored to capture three Japanese A6M warriors which had assaulted Hyane Harbor; while the Japanese power had been followed by Allied radar for 25 minutes before the assault, the Spitfires were mixed simply after the bandits had left the region. No.ÃÂ 79 Squadron in this manner kept up a three-flying machine watch over Los Negros amid light hours until 22ÃÂ November. After two days the squadron was discharged from tasks in front of moving to Darwin in northern Australia to be re-furnished with increasingly current Mark VIII Spitfires.
