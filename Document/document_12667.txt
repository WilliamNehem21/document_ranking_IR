Warelwast served the lord as an emissary to Pope Urban II in 1095, when the ruler was looking to have the recently selected Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury, expelled from office. He visited the pope with another imperial agent, Gerard, with requests to perceive Urban as pope as an end-result of Anselm's testimony, in any event as indicated by Eadmer, an Anselm factional. The two agents voyaged in all respects rapidly, as they didn't leave before 28ÃÂ February 1095 and were back in England by 13ÃÂ May 1095. Eadmer asserted that the represetatives should gain a pallium, the image of an ecclesiastical overseer's power, for the ruler to provide for his new decision as diocese supervisor. Be that as it may, despite the fact that the lord may have taught his emissaries to endeavor to verify these articles, he was presumably ready to arrange and to agree to less. The two representatives came back with an ecclesiastical legate, Walter of Albano, who acknowledged the lord's acknowledgment of Urban however would not permit Anselm's affidavit. The ruler did in any case figure out how to verify acknowledgment of his regal rights in the congregation, and a concession that no ecclesiastical legates or correspondences would be sent without his endorsement. It likely could be that the ruler dependably viewed Anselm's testimony as impossible.
