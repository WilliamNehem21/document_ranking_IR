The bay bolete was first named as "Boletus castaneus" Ã "badius" (i.e. a subspecies of "Boletus castaneus") by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818. Fries later renamed it as a variety of "Boletus castaneus" in 1828, before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work "Elenchus Fungorum". The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its taxonomic history: "Rostkovites" by Petter Karsten in 1881; "Viscipellis" and "Ixocomus" by Lucien QuÃ©let in 1886 and 1888, respectively; and "Suillus" by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In 1931, Edouard-Jean Gilbert reclassified it in the genus "Xerocomus", and many sources still list it thus. Review of "Xerocomus" strongly suggested it was polyphyletic, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap distinguishes the species from others classified in "Xerocomus", and hence it was left in "Boletus" until Alfredo Vizzini placed it in its own genus in 2014. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that "Imleria badia" is related to "B.Â pallidus" and "B.Â glabellus"; the three species form a clade known informally as the "badius" clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the "Tylopilus", porcini (= "Boletus" "sensu stricto") and "Strobilomyces" clades, as well as two other groups composed of members of various genera including "Xerocomus" (the taxa designated as "Xerocomus" species in this clade are not "Xerocomus" species and require new taxonomic designations) and "Xerocomellus".
