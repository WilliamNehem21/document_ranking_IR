In 1965, the eighth Earl of Antrim (another companion from Ulster) and other Irish friends requested of the House of Lords, contending that the privilege to choose delegate peers had never been formally abrogated. The House of Lords ruled against the Irish friends. Ruler Reid, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, put together his decision with respect to the Act of Union, which expressed that agent peers sat "with respect to Ireland." He contemplated that, since the island had been separated into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, there was no such political element called "Ireland" which the delegate companions could be said to speak to. Master Reid expressed, "A statutory arrangement is impliedly canceled if a later authorization finishes a condition of things the continuation of which is basic for its activity." interestingly, Lord Wilberforce, another Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, differ that a noteworthy order, for example, the Act of Union could be revoked by suggestion. He contended rather on the premise that the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922Ã¢ÂÂwhich was quiet on the race of agent peersÃ¢ÂÂcanceled the posts of Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Clerk of the Crown in Ireland. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland was in charge of calling decisions of agent peers, and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland was in charge of sending peers their polls. Since these workplaces had been annulled; Lord Wilberforce contended against any component by which Irish friends could be chosen. Here as well, the candidates lost.
