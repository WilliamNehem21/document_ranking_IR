Amid his time with the Royal Engineers, McNeile saw activity at the First and Second Battles of YpresÃ¢ÂÂhe was gassed at the second fightÃ¢ÂÂand the Battle of the Somme. In 1916 he was granted the Military Cross and was referenced in dispatches; in November that year he was gazetted to acting major. From 1 April to 5 October 1918, he told a brigade of the Middlesex Regiment and was elevated to acting lieutenant-colonel; the researcher Lawrence Treadwell sees that "for a designer to order an infantry regiment wasÃÂ ... an irregularity". eighteenth Battalion, Middlesex Regiment under McNeile saw activity for the rest of his order, and were associated with battling amid the Hundred Days Offensive in the St. Quentin-Cambrai area in September 1918; amid the year, he was again referenced in dispatches. On 2 October 1918 he broke his lower leg and was quickly hospitalized, which constrained him to give up his order of the regiment on 4 October. He was on healing leave when the war finished in November 1918. Over the span of the war, he had spent an aggregate of 32 months in France, and had likely been gassed more than once. His abstract yield from 1915 to 1918 represented in excess of 80 gathered and uncollected stories. His siblingÃ¢ÂÂlikewise in the Royal EngineersÃ¢ÂÂhad been murdered prior in the war.
