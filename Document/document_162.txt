For the duration of the day, the Australian and British mounted guns shot on German gathering regions east and south of the railroad line. About 16:00, cautioning was gotten of a conceivable German assault north of the AlbertÃ¢ÂÂ Amiens street, so Gellibrand prompted the 46th Battalion, at that point available for later, that they may be expected to join with an organization of Medium Mark A Whippet tanks to help repulse the estimate assault. About this time, a light sprinkle started to fall, and the assault never came. 30 minutes after this notice, Germans of III/230 RIR upheld by components of I and II/230 RIR, were seen sifting into houses on the southern edges of Albert in the 48th Battalion part. Mounted guns was coordinated into this region, which drove the Germans out once more. By 17:00, German troops could be seen pulling back east out there. At this point, the troops of the twelfth Brigade had been "moving, walking and battling for three days and three evenings nearly without rest", and were in a condition of depletion. Expanding precipitation into the night tried more uncertain. Taking all things together, nine assaults were mounted by the Germans on the railroad line amid the day, and everything except the short infiltration into the 47th Battalion division were beaten off, in spite of the fact that the guarding troops had endured critical setbacks in doing as such. As per Deayton, the protective inadequacies of the forward positions along the railroad line were self-evident.
