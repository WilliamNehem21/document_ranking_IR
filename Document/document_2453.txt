A few phylogenetic investigations distributed amid the 2000s bolstered a cozy connection among "Pseudoryzomys" and two different oryzomyines with decreased or missing mesoloph(id)s, "Lundomys" and "Holochilus". The terminated genera "Noronhomys" and "Carletonomys", depicted in 1999 and 2008 individually, were additionally perceived as individuals from the gathering. In 2006, a wide morphological and atomic phylogenetic investigation of Oryzomyini gave further help to the connection between "Holochilus", "Lundomys", and "Pseudoryzomys". Inside this gathering, morphological information bolstered a closer connection among "Holochilus" and "Lundomys" to the rejection of "Pseudoryzomys", yet DNA arrangement information supported a grouping among "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys" to the prohibition of "Lundomys"; among all oryzomyines, this was the main situation where connections which got solid help from morphological and DNA succession information clashed. Together, the three genera structure some portion of an extensive gathering of oryzomyines ("clade D"), which contains several different species. A few of those showcase a few adjustments to life in the water, being mostly amphibian, as do "Pseudoryzomys" and its relatives. Morphological information demonstrate that the family "Oryzomys" is the nearest relative of the gathering that incorporates "Pseudoryzomys", however DNA arrangement information from the atomic IRBP quality did not bolster this relationship; concurrent adjustments towards a semiaquatic way of life may clarify the morphological help for a connection among "Oryzomys" and the other three genera.
