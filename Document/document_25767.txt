Janensch based his description of "B. brancai" on "Skelett S" (skeleton S) from Tendaguru, but later realized that it comprised two partial individuals: SÂ I and SÂ II. He at first did not designate them as a syntype series, but in 1935 made SÂ I (presently MB.R.2180) the lectotype. Taylor in 2009, unaware of this action, proposed the larger and more complete SÂ II (MB.R.2181) as the lectotype. It includes, among other bones, several dorsal vertebrae, the left scapula, both coracoids, both sternals (breastbones), both humeri, both ulnae and radii (lower arm bones), a right hand, a partial left hand, both pubes (a hip bone) and the right femur, tibia and fibula (shank bones). Later in 2011, Taylor realized that Janensch had designated the smaller skeleton SÂ I as the lectotype in 1935.
In 1988, Paul published a new reconstruction of the skeleton of "B. brancai", highlighting differences in proportion between it and "B. altithorax". Chief among them was a distinction in the way the trunk vertebrae vary: they are fairly uniform in length in the African material, but vary widely in "B. altithorax". Paul believed that the limb and girdle elements of both species were very similar, and therefore suggested they be separated not at genus, but only at subgenus level, as "Brachiosaurus (Brachiosaurus) altithorax" and "Brachiosaurus (Giraffatitan) brancai". "Giraffatitan" was raised to full genus level by George Olshevsky in 1991, while referring to the vertebral variation. Between 1991 and 2009, the name "Giraffatitan" was almost completely disregarded by other researchers.
