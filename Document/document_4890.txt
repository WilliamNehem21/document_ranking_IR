As indicated by Bede, further teachers were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a pallium for Augustine, blessings of sacrosanct vessels, vestments, relics, and books. The pallium was the image of metropolitan status, and meant that Augustine was in association with the Roman papacy. Alongside the pallium, a letter from Gregory guided the new ecclesiastical overseer to appoint twelve suffragan religious administrators at the earliest opportunity, and to send a cleric to York. Gregory's arrangement was that there would be two metropolitan sees, one at York and one at London, with twelve suffragan clerics under every diocese supervisor. Augustine was additionally taught to exchange his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury, which never occurred, maybe in light of the fact that London was not part of ÃÂthelberht's space. Additionally, London remained a fortress of agnosticism, as occasions after the passing of ÃÂthelberht uncovered. London around then was a piece of the Kingdom of Essex, which was controlled by ÃÂthelberht's nephew SÃÂ¦bert of Essex, who changed over to Christianity in 604. The student of history S. Brechter has recommended that the metropolitan see was for sure moved to London, and that it was just with the deserting of London as a see after ÃÂthelberht's passing that Canterbury turned into the archiepiscopal see, negating Bede's form of occasions. The decision of London as Gregory's proposed southern archbishopric was likely because of his comprehension of how Britain was managed under the Romans, when London was the foremost city of the territory.
