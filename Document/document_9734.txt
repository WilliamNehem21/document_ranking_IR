The other contender for the rarest from that mint is the 1861-D, with an expected mintage of 1,000 and maybe 45 to 60 known. Two sets of bites the dust were delivered from Philadelphia to Dahlonega on December 10, 1860; they touched base on January 7, 1861, two weeks before Georgia casted a ballot to withdraw from the Union, as the American Civil War started. Compelled from Governor Joseph E. Dark colored, state local army verified the mint, and sooner or later, little amounts of dollars and half falcons were delivered. Records of what number of coins were struck and when have not endure. Since passes on break in time, and every one of the mints were provided with them from Philadelphia, instituting couldn't last, and in May 1861, coins and supplies staying at Dahlonega were swung over to the treasury of the Confederate States of America, which Georgia had by then joined. Gold coins with a complete assumed worth of $6 were set aside for test. Typically, they would have been sent to Philadelphia to anticipate the next year's gathering of the United States Assay Commission, when they would be accessible for testing. Rather, these were sent to the underlying Confederate capital of Montgomery, Alabama, however what was finished with them there, and their definitive destiny, are obscure. The uncommonness of the 1861-D dollar, and the relationship with the Confederacy, make it particularly prized.
