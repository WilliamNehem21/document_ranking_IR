Starting with a second-place complete at Euro 1980, the 1980s and the mid 1990s are commonly considered as Belgium's first brilliant age. Instructed by Guy Thys, they accomplished their spot in the 1980 last with an unbeaten record in the gathering stage; in the last, they barely lost the title to West Germany with the score 1Ã¢ÂÂ 2. Beginning with the 1982 World Cup, and consummation with the 2002 World Cup, the national group met all requirements for six back to back World Cup end stages and for the most part advanced to the second round. Amid this period, administrators Guy Thys, Paul Van Himst and Robert Waseige each guided a Belgian determination past the first round. Notwithstanding getting individual FIFA acknowledgments, the group achieved the semi-finals of the 1986 World Cup. In the wake of achieving the Euro 1980 last, they were fruitless at consequent European Championships, with early exits from their appearances in 1984 and in 2000. Amid the late 1990s, they played three well disposed competitions in Morocco, Cyprus and Japan, sharing the 1999 Kirin Cup with Peru in the last mentioned. The best abilities of the Belgian group amid this brilliant age were resigned from worldwide football by 2000. Amid the World Cup in 2002, Belgium crushed Russia and tied with co-has Japan and Tunisia to come to the round of 16.
