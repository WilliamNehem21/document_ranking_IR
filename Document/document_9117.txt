His years at Glasgow left a blemish on history that can be contrasted positively and any past or future religious administrator. Jocelin charged his namesake Jocelin of Furness, a similar man who had composed the "Life of St. Waltheof", to compose a "Real existence of St. Kentigern", an undertaking even more fundamental on the grounds that, after 1159, the Papacy guaranteed the privilege to consecrate holy people. Kentigern, or Mungo as he is famously known, was the holy person customarily connected with the see of Glasgow, and his status hence pondered Glasgow as a congregation and faction focus. There had just been a house of prayer at Glasgow before Jocelin's episcopate. The possibility that the religious foundation before Jocelin was essentially a little church with a bigger Gaelic or British devout foundation has been undermined by researchers. Jocelin did, however, extend the church building essentially. As the "Account of Melrose" reports for 1181, Jocelin "radiantly augmented the congregation of St Kentigern". Be that as it may, more work was made for the manufacturers when, at some point between the years 1189 and 1195, there was a fire at the house of God. Jocelin in this manner needed to commission another remaking exertion. The new house of prayer was committed, as indicated by the "Annal of Melrose", on 6 July 1197. It was worked in the Romanesque way, and albeit little gets by of it today, it is thought to have been impacted by the house of God of Lund, the diocese supervisor of which had blessed Jocelin as minister.
