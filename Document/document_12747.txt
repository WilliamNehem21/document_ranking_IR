Ruler Edward, on his deathbed, left the crown to his brother by marriage Harold Godwinson, the child of Earl Godwin. Stigand played out the memorial service administrations for Edward. Norman scholars guaranteed that Stigand delegated Harold as ruler in January 1066. This is for the most part thought to be false publicity, as it was to William's greatest advantage to depict Harold as uncanonically delegated. In the event that Harold was inappropriately delegated, at that point William was just asserting his legitimate legacy, and not dismissing a legitimate lord. The Bayeux Tapestry portrays Stigand at Harold's royal celebration, despite the fact that not really setting the crown on Harold's head. The English sources guarantee that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, delegated Harold, while the Norman sources guarantee that Stigand did as such, with the contention between the different sources most likely following to the post-Conquest want to criticize Harold and delineate his crowning ritual as inappropriate. Ebb and flow verifiable research has demonstrated that the service was performed by Ealdred, inferable from the discussion about Stigand's position. In any case, one history specialist, Pauline Stafford, speculates that the two diocese supervisors may have blessed Harold. Another student of history, Frank Barlow, writing in 1979, felt that the way that a portion of the English sources don't name who blessed Harold "tip(s) the parity for Stigand".
