Bowen has portrayed Tippett as "an author within recent memory", one who connected with the social, political and social issues of his day. Arnold Whittall sees the music as encapsulating Tippett's rationality of "at last hopeful humanism". As opposed to overlooking the brutality of the twentieth century, says Kemp, Tippett picked through his attempts to look for "to protect or redo those qualities that have been debased, while in the meantime never dismissing the contemporary reality". The key early work in this regard is "A Child of Our Time", of which Clarke expresses: "[t]he expressions of the oratorio's end outfit, 'I would know my shadow and my light, So will I finally be entire', have turned out to be sanctioned in critique on TippettÃÂ ... this [Jungian] articulation solidifies an ethic, and tasteful, vital to his reality view, and one which underlies all his content based works". Suspicious commentators, for example, the musicologist Derrick Puffett have contended that Tippett's art as a writer was lacking for him to manage the assignment that he had set himself of "transmut[ing] his own and private miseries intoÃÂ ... something all inclusive and unoriginal". Michael Kennedy has alluded to Tippett's "openÃ¢ÂÂeyed, even innocent point of view toward the world", while tolerating the specialized modernity of his music. Others have recognized his imaginative inventiveness and his eagerness to embrace whatever means or strategies were important to accommodate his goals.
