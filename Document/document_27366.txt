Alonso lapped consistently in the low 1:19 range, setting the new fastest lap of the race on lapÂ 41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12Â seconds. RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop for the second time on lapÂ 43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of understeer over the team radio, made his second stop on lapÂ 46, two laps ahead of RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lapÂ 51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lapÂ 52, RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, braked late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the racing line as RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen left the track at the run-off area. RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.
