On 25â26 September, "Oldenburg" and the rest of I Squadron covered an advance conducted by the II "FÃ¼hrer der Torpedoboote" (Leader of Torpedo Boats) to the Terschelling Bank. Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18â20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank, though again they failed to find British forces. For the majority of 1917, "Oldenburg" was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During Operation Albion, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, "Oldenburg" and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on 29 October. On 2 November the operation was completed and "Oldenburg" and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23â24 April 1918. Scheer had intended to intercept a British convoy to Norway and destroy the escorting battleships. During the operation, the battlecruiser "Moltke" suffered mechanical problems and had to be towed back to port. "Oldenburg" took the ship in tow, and the main body of the fleet turned back to Germany while Hipper searched in vain for the convoy. German intelligence had incorrectly placed the date for the scheduled convoy on 24 April, and after several hours of fruitless steaming, Hipper turned for port as well. By 18:37, the fleet was outside the Jade and "Moltke" had been repaired enough to allow her to enter port under her own power.
