Ellet's meetings to generate new ideas with his men raised a few thoughts that could empower a line to be suspended over the canyon; these included terminating cannonballs with the line joined, towing it over the stream with a steamer, and binds it to a rocket that would then be propelled over the chasm. At last the extension engineer picked a thought propelled by Benjamin Franklin's try different things with a kite. It was like fifteenth century creator Leonardo da Vinci's arrangement to traverse a hole. Ellet likewise accepted the open door to produce attention for his task. Sorting out a kite-flying challenge, he offered $5 to any kid who flew a kite over the chasm and verified the kite string to the opposite side. Young people from close-by towns ran in to take an interest. Not at all like the different young men who flew their kites from the United States side of the chasm, 16-year-old Homan Walsh crossed the stream by a ship upstream and strolled to the Canadian side of the extension site to dispatch his kite. He nearly prevailing on his first endeavor; his kite flew crosswise over yet slammed barely shy of the shore. In the wake of resting a few days at a companion's home, Walsh at long last got his kite over the chasm and verified its line to a tree.
