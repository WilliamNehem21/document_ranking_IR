The Duino Elegies () are a gathering of ten funeral poems composed by the Bohemian-Austrian artist Rainer Maria Rilke (1875Ã¢ÂÂ 1926). Rilke, who is "broadly perceived as a standout amongst the most melodiously extreme German-language artists," started composing the funeral poems in 1912 while a visitor of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855Ã¢ÂÂ 1934) at Duino Castle, close Trieste on the Adriatic Sea. The lyrics, 859 lines in length altogether, were committed to the Princess upon their distribution in 1923. Amid this ten-year term, the requiems moped deficient for extended lengths of time as Rilke experienced much of the time serious wretchednessÃ¢ÂÂsome of which was brought about by the occasions of World War I and being recruited into military administration. Beside brief scenes of writing in 1913 and 1915, Rilke did not come back to the work until a couple of years after the war finished. With an unexpected, recharged motivationÃ¢ÂÂwriting in a berserk pace he depicted as an "unlimited tempest, a typhoon of the soul"Ã¢ÂÂ he finished the gathering in February 1922 while remaining at ChÃÂ¢teau de Muzot in Veyras, in Switzerland's Rhone Valley. After their distribution in 1923 and Rilke's demise in 1926, the "Duino Elegies" were immediately perceived by pundits and researchers as his most imperative work.
