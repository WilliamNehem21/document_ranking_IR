The whole waterway exists in the almost level Pamlico porch, giving it a general inclination of per mile (km); it is one of the flattest significant streams on the landmass. Its vicinity to the sea in the lower bowl influences its ascent and fall with tides and saltiness. Tides consistently influence water levels as far south as Lake George; when joined with extraordinary breezes, the waterway's tidal impacts can stretch out to Lake Monroe away and have once in a while achieved Lake Harney. Tides normally raise the waterway level about at Jacksonville, diminishing some to at Orange Park where the stream augments, and expanding back to at Palatka as it limits. Because of tidal impacts, release estimations in the lower bowl are frequently incorrect. Nonetheless, the evaluated rate of release between the Ocklawaha River and the focal point of Jacksonville ranges from every second. The nontidal release at the mouth at Mayport midpoints every second, except with tides it surpasses every second, and following overwhelming downpours joined with tides can top every second. More distant upriver, the release rate ranges from every second close Lake Poinsett to every second close DeLand. The intersection of various springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River makes the normal release increment by every second between Lake Harney and DeLand, speaking to the best yearly normal increment of streamflow along the St. Johns.
