The molars are slightly more high-crowned (hypsodont) than in most oryzomyines, and many of the accessory crests are reduced, but they are sharply distinct from the highly derived, hypsodont molars of "Holochilus". The main cusps are located opposite each other and have rounded edges. The enamel folds do not extend past the midlines of the molars. The mesoloph, an accessory crest on the upper molars that is usually well-developed in oryzomyines, is present but short on the first and second upper molar; it is much more reduced in "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys". The corresponding structure on the lower molars, the mesolophid, is present on the first and second molars in "Lundomys", but absent in both "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys". Another accessory crest, the anteroloph, is present, though small, on the first upper molar in "Lundomys", but entirely absent in both other genera. As in "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys", the anterior cusp on the first lower molar, the anteroconid, contains a deep pit. Each of the three upper molars has three roots; unlike in both "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys", the first upper molar lacks an accessory fourth root. The first lower molar has four roots, including two small accessory roots located between larger anterior and posterior roots. The second molar has either two or three roots, with the anterior root split into two smaller roots in some specimens.
