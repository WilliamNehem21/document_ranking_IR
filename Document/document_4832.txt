"Prison Siege" was motivated by earlier pretending amusements, for example, "Baldur's Gate" and the "Ultima" arrangement, however basically by "Diablo", which Taylor appreciated for having an encounter that "focused on activity" that players could hop into without first looking into the ongoing interaction subtleties and settings. Taylor needed to extend that idea into a streamlined, vivid, and activity overwhelming pretending amusement that expelled regular components of the class that he discovered exhausting, disappointing, or moderate. Taylor additionally needed to make the ongoing interaction itself less difficult than contemporary pretending amusements, to speak to a more extensive gathering of people. Keeping that in mind, he asked Hallford to create an account that was additionally quick and streamlined; he had him compose a point by point backstory for the amusement, which would not be displayed to players but rather would illuminate and move the designers, leaving the in-diversion content controlled to keep players drew in with the activity. Hallford portrayed the way toward composing for the amusement as like other diversion ventures, other than a more noteworthy accentuation on curtness, however he has said that he was brought onto the undertaking a lot later than he typically is, which implied that he needed to make a story that filled in as a foundation to the set pieces that had just been created. The plot of the diversion was planned by Taylor to be subordinate to the ongoing interaction; keeping that in mind, he was unconcerned that his general story bend was considered, even by the advancement group, to be fairly a banality, as he felt that venturing to vanquish an "extreme shrewdness" was rousing to players. Taylor and Hallford examined creating a "Prison Siege" novel to investigate Hallford's story, however it never worked out as intended.
