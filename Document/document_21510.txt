An eastward moving deep-wave trough intensified as it moved through the eastern United States. This caused Carol to accelerate as it turned to the north and north-northeast. On AugustÂ 30, the hurricane again strengthened to reach Category 2 status while located 180Â miles (290Â km) east of Savannah, Georgia. Early on AugustÂ 31, Carol passed very near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with reconnaissance aircraft intensity estimates from 75â125Â mph (120â200Â km/h). The hurricane continued north-northeastward with a forward motion of up to 39Â mph (63Â km/h), and Carol intensified further to make landfall on eastern Long Island a Category 3 hurricane with peak winds of 111Â mph (185Â km/h). After quickly crossing Long Island Sound, the hurricane made landfall again near Groton, Connecticut. Carol had maintained its small structure and well-defined eye, and observers on both eastern Long Island and Groton, Connecticut reported blue skies and light winds as the eye passed overhead, followed by strong hurricane force winds. The landfall intensity was based on a pressure of recorded in Groton, Connecticut. Ninety percent of homes in the Groton Long Point area were destroyed by the storm surge and winds in Hurricane Carol. Carol quickly lost tropical characteristics while crossing into inland eastern Massachusetts, and became extratropical over southwestern New Hampshire, late on AugustÂ 31. The powerful extratropical storm continued northward, before losing its identity after entering Canada, over southern Quebec.
