After the mid-day break, England added six rushes to be 35/4, preceding Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker. The debutant Watkins came in, having earned a notoriety in Glamorgan's match against Australia for snaring. He made a few endeavors at the shot in his innings of 16 balls. He endeavored a snare shot from a short ball and missed before being hit on the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer, having attempted to snare the ball downwards in an irregular way similar to a tennis serve. He was then rejected without scoring in the wake of playing over the line and being caught leg before wicket by Johnston for a duck to leave England at 42/6. For his inconveniences, Watkins likewise gathered a wound from the hit to the shoulder, which repressed his bowling later in the match. Lindwall then evacuated Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Young, all yorked by swinging conveyances in about two runs, as England tumbled from 45/6 to 47/9. This got Hollies at No. 11 to go with Hutton, who at that point hit the main limit of the innings, hurling Lindwall for a straight drive back over his head. The ball nearly went for six, landing barely shy of the limit. The innings finished at 52 when HuttonÃ¢ÂÂwho never seemed disturbed by the bowlingÃ¢ÂÂleg looked Lindwall and was gotten by wicket-guardian Don Tallon, who got the ball one-gave at full stretch to one side. Lindwall portrayed the catch as a standout amongst the best he had ever observed, while O'Reilly called it "remarkably great".
