Following the "Pioneer Zephyr" 9900, two indistinguishable trainsets, 9901 and 9902, were incorporated and put with administration as the "Twin Cities Zephyr" among Chicago and Minneapolis - St. Paul in April 1935. The four vehicle set 9903 entered administration as the "Imprint Twain Zephyr" between St. Louis and Burlington, Iowa in October 1935. On May 31, 1936, the trainsets of the "Pioneer Zephyr" and the "Imprint Twain Zephyr", 9900 and 9903, were exchanged to another Chicago-Denver administration called the "Advance Denver Zephyr" on a 16 hour timetable. They were supplanted a half year later by two new ten-vehicle trains, pulled by power units 9906 and 9907, named the "Denver Zephyr". The six vehicle sets 9904 and 9905 supplanted 9901 and 9902 on the Twin Cities keep running in December 1936. Around then, the 9901 was reassigned to another administration, the "Sam Houston Zephyr", running between Ft. Worth and Houston by means of Dallas on trackage together claimed by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific. This was the principal streamlined train in Texas, and was joined about a year later by the "Texas Rocket" on substitute planning. The 9902 initiated the "Ozark State Zephyr", a joint task with the Alton Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City, where it was joined by the 9904 on interchange timing about a year later. The remainder of the great "Breezes," 9908, entered administration as the "General Pershing Zephyr" between Kansas City and St. Louis in 1939, supplanting the less roomy 9902 set. The 9904 set kept on giving interchange timing on this course over the Show Me State, however had its unique name of "Imprint Twain Zephyr" reestablished, regardless of never again working through Samuel Clemens' main residence of Hannibal.
