Andreas GrÃÂ¼nschloÃÂ dissects the Xenu message in "The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements", inside the setting of a dialog on UFO religions. He describes the content as "Scientology's mystery folklore (contained particularly in the OT III lessons)". GrÃÂ¼nschloÃÂ calls attention to that L. Ron Hubbard, "additionally composed a sci-fi story called "Revolt in the Stars", where he shows this generally arcane anecdote about the antiquated ruler Xenu as a customary sci-fi novel". GrÃÂ¼nschloÃÂ sets, "due to the associations between a few themes in Hubbard's books and explicit Scientology lessons, one may see Scientology as one of the uncommon occasions where sci-fi (or dream writing for the most part) is identified with the fruitful development of another otherworldly development." Comparing the combination between the two classifications of Hubbard's sci-fi composing and Scientology creation fantasy, GrÃÂ¼nschloÃÂ expresses, "Despite the fact that the sci-fi books are of an unexpected sort in comparison to other 'techno-consistent' revelations of Hubbard, they are profoundly valued by members, and Hubbard's abstract yield in this domain (counting the most recent motion picture, "Front line Earth") is likewise all around advanced by the association." Writing in the book "UFO Religions" altered by Christopher Partridge, GrÃÂ¼nschloÃÂ watches, "the eagerness for ufology and sci-fi was developed in the developmental period of Scientology. For sure, even the exceptionally arcane story of the intergalactic ruler XenuÃÂ ... is connected by Hubbard in the style of a straightforward sci-fi novel".
