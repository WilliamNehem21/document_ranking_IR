There are five species comparative in appearance to "G.ÃÂ maritimus": "G.ÃÂ arenophilus", "G.ÃÂ decipiens", "G.ÃÂ flavus", "G.ÃÂ fulgens" and "G.ÃÂ pseudofulgens". "G.ÃÂ arenophilus" and especially "G.ÃÂ fulgens" are the most comparable. However "G.ÃÂ maritimus" and "G.ÃÂ arenophilus" show similitudes in their biogeography and biology, the commonly somewhat littler "G.ÃÂ arenophilus" varies from "G.ÃÂ maritimus" morphologically. While "G.ÃÂ maritimus" has a top shrouded in fibrils with little scales, "G.ÃÂ arenophilus" can in some cases be totally smooth, and spore ornamentation varies, with "G.ÃÂ maritimus" regularly showing bigger moles. Like "G.ÃÂ maritimus", "G.ÃÂ fulgens" has been recorded developing on sand-hill heathland; further, the spores are comparable in appearance to those of "G.ÃÂ maritimus". In any case, "G.ÃÂ fulgens" requires soil wealthy in peat and must develop among greenery. Additionally, there are various morphological contrasts; "G.ÃÂ maritimus" mushrooms are bigger and thicker, there are never stays of the halfway shroud on "G.ÃÂ fulgens" stems, the state of the highest point of the spores varies between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are altogether bigger on "G.ÃÂ maritimus". "G.ÃÂ fulgens" var. "luteicystis" is much increasingly particular from "G.ÃÂ maritimus" than the designate assortment. In spite of the likenesses between the three species, the three have been appeared to be in changed clades inside "Gymnopilus", recommending natural intermingling among "G.ÃÂ arenophilus" and "G.ÃÂ maritimus", and morphological union among "G.ÃÂ fulgens" and "G.ÃÂ maritimus".
