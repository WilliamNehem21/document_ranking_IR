Albeit well known when chosen, Desha's notoriety was harmed by two debates amid his term. The first was his job in the ouster of Horace Holley as leader of Transylvania University. While the religious moderates on the college's board contradicted Holley on the grounds that they thought of him as excessively liberal, Desha's resistance was essentially founded on Holley's fellowship with Henry Clay, one of Desha's political foes. After Desha sharply reviled Holley in a location to the governing body in late 1825, Holley surrendered. Desha's notoriety endured a further shot after his child, Isaac, was accused of homicide. In part in light of Desha's impact as representative, two blameworthy decisions were toppled. After the more youthful Desha ineffectively endeavored suicide while anticipating a third preliminary, Governor Desha issued an exculpation for his child. These debates, alongside an improving economy, moved Desha's political adversaries to triumph in the administrative decisions of 1825 and 1826. They nullified the purported "Desha court" over Desha's veto, finishing the court debate. In a last demonstration of resistance, Desha took steps to won't clear the representative's house, in spite of the fact that he eventually submitted without episode, surrendering the governorship to his successor, National Republican Thomas Metcalfe. At the lapse of his term, he resigned from open life and at last passed on at his child's home in Georgetown, Kentucky, on October 11, 1842.
