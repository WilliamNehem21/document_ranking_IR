Schumacher driven by 66 to 29 by the midpoint of the period. At the French Grand Prix, Frank Williams brought back Nigel Mansell, for the French, European, Japanese and Australian Grands Prix with Coulthard doing most of the 1994 season. Mansell earned roughly ÃÂ£900,000 for every one of his four races, while Hill was paid ÃÂ£300,000 for the whole season, however Hill's situation as lead driver stayed unchallenged. Slope returned into dispute for the title in the wake of winning the British Grand Prix, a race his dad had never won. Schumacher was excluded from that race and restricted for two further races for surpassing Hill amid the development lap and overlooking the resulting dark banner. Four additional triumphs for Hill, three of which were in races where Schumacher was prohibited or precluded, took the title fight to the last occasion at Adelaide. At Schumacher's first race since his boycott, the European Grand Prix, he recommended that Hill (who was eight years his senior) was not a world-class driver. In any case, amid the penultimate race at the Japanese Grand Prix, Hill took triumph in front of Schumacher in a downpour splashed occasion. This put Hill only one point behind the German before the last race of the period.
