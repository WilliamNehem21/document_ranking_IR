The main skeleton (holotype MACN-CH 894) was uncovered in 1984 by an endeavor driven by Argentinian scientist JosÃÂ© Bonaparte. This campaign likewise recuperated the unconventional sharp sauropod "Amargasaurus". It was the eighth campaign inside the task named "Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America", which began in 1976 and was supported by the National Geographic Society. The skeleton is very much saved explained (still associated together), with just the back 66% of the tail, a significant part of the lower leg, and the rear feet being annihilated by enduring. Amid fossilization, the skull and particularly the gag were pounded along the side, while the premaxilla were pushed upwards onto the nasal bones. Therefore, the upward ebb and flow of the upper jaw is falsely overstated in the holotype. The skeleton had a place with a grown-up individual, as demonstrated by the combined sutures in the braincase. It was discovered lying on its correct side, appearing run of the mill demise present with the neck bowed back over the middle. Abnormally, it is protected with broad skin impressions. In perspective on the hugeness of these impressions, a second undertaking was begun to reinvestigate the first unearthing site, prompting the recuperation of a few extra skin patches.
