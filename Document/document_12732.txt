By the 1922 season, Hornsby was viewed as a major star, having driven the class in batting normal, hits, copies, and runs batted in various occasions. Thus, he looked for a three-year contract for $25,000 per season. In the wake of consulting with Cardinals the board, he made due with a three-year, $18,500 contract ($ today), which made him the most generously compensated player allied history to that point. On August 5, Hornsby set another NL record when he hit his 28th grand slam of the period off of Jimmy Ring of the Philadelphia Phillies. From AugustÃÂ 13 through SeptemberÃÂ 19, he had a 33-diversion hitting streak. Hornsby set National League records in 1922 with 42ÃÂ home runs, 250 hits and a .722 slugging rate (still the most noteworthy ever for players with 600+ at-bats). His .401 batting normal was the most noteworthy in the National League since 1897. He won the first of his two Triple Crowns that year, and he drove the association in RBIs (152), on-base rate (.459), pairs (46), and runs scored (141). His 450ÃÂ total bases in 1922 remain the National League single-season record. On resistance, Hornsby drove all second basemen in putouts, twofold plays, and handling rate. His batting execution that year was, and still is, one of the best in MLB history, and his 42 grand slams are as yet the most ever for a .400 hitter.
