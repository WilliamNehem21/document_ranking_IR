Other remains of similar animals were found throughout the late 19th century and 20th century. Another well-preserved skeleton from the slightly older Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada, was named "T. warreni" by William Parks in 1926. This skeleton had notable differences from "T. neglectus", and so Charles M. Sternberg placed it in a new genus, "Parksosaurus", in 1937. Sternberg also named an additional species, "T. edmontonensis", based on another articulated skeleton, this time including a partial skull (NMCÂ 8537), and drew attention to the genus' heavy build and thick bones. Due to these differences from the regular light hypsilophodont build, he suggested that the genus warranted its own subfamily, Thescelosaurinae. "T. edmontonensis" has, since Peter Galton's 1974 review, generally been considered a more robust individual (possibly the opposite sex of the type individual) of "T. neglectus". However, Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of "Thescelosaurus" and regarded the specimen as of uncertain placement within the genus. The other point of contention regarding "T. edmontonensis" is its ankle, which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted, but which was regarded by William J. Morris (1976) as truly different from "T. neglectus".
