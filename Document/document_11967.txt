As per David E. E. Sloane, "most American pundits thought that it was more earnestly to disregard the coarseness of the book and its treatment of the work issue." A commentator for "Artistic World" in January 1884 called "The Bread-Winners" an "oily, slangy, rancid bookÃÂ ... frightful from the absolute initial step". "The Dial", the next month, applauded the writer's utilization of language however esteemed the book "a silly tissue of occurrences" populated by two arrangements of "misrepresented sorts", one awful, the other preposterous. "Landmass", likewise in February 1884, recommended that "the reactions overall are extreme, and evenhandedly along these lines, the book being, with all its brilliancy, fickle and sad." The "Springfield Republic" proposed that the writer had "no feelings past the circles of riches and refinement", from which "the workingman is either a deadly hoodlum, or a silly hoodwink, or a stolid, benevolent day laborer, while the man of riches is, essentially, a refined, developed legend, attractive, in vogue, entrancing". A letter in "The Century Magazine" regarded the novel "a bit of pretentiousness imported from England... It is just untruthful... to proceed with the attestation that worker's guilds are for the most part controlled and strikes begun by fomenters, intrigued just for what they make out of them".
