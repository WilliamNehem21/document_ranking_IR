The issue of checking the quantity of answers for various kinds of Apollonius' concern has a place with the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of answers for every one of the ten sorts of Apollonius' concern is given in TableÃÂ 1 above. Be that as it may, extraordinary courses of action of the given components may change the quantity of arrangements. For representation, Apollonius' concern has no arrangement in the event that one circle isolates the two (FigureÃÂ 11); to contact both the strong given circles, the arrangement circle would need to cross the dashed given circle; yet that it can't do, on the off chance that it is to contact the dashed circle extraneously. On the other hand, on the off chance that three given circles are all digression at a similar point, at that point "any" hover digression at a similar point is an answer; such Apollonius issues have an unending number of arrangements. In the event that any of the given circles are indistinguishable, there is moreover a limitlessness of arrangements. On the off chance that just two given circles are indistinguishable, there are just two particular given circles; the focuses of the arrangement circles structure a hyperbola, as utilized in one answer for Apollonius' concern.
