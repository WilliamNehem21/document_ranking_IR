When Bachelot and Short arrived in Honolulu in May 1837, they spent only 13 days on the island. Notwithstanding the agreement he had signed with French Naval Captain Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars that allowed French citizens to live on the island, King sought to deport the priests. Bachelot and Short were confined to the ship on which they had arrived, the "ClÃ©mentine", on . However, the "ClÃ©mentine"'s captain, Jules Dudoit, refused to transport them from Hawaii. Dudoit, a British citizen of French descent, met with Charlton, the British consul, and they publicly protested the priests' confinement. Their efforts to secure freedom for the priests to live on the island were unsuccessful until the British naval vessel HMS "Sulphur" and the French frigate the "La VÃ©nus" arrived in Honolulu on . The ships were commanded respectively by Edward Belcher and Dupetit Thouars, who each tried to convince the authorities to allow the priests to return to the island. After negotiations proved futile, they blockaded the harbor, boarded the "ClÃ©mentine", and brought Bachelot and Short ashore. The "La VÃ©nus" sent 300 sailors to escort them from the harbor to the French mission. King agreed to allow the priests to stay in Honolulu until they could find a ship to transport them elsewhere, under the condition that they refrain from proselytizing.
That year, Bachelot, who suffered from a form of rheumatism, became very sick. By NovemberÂ 1837, he had recovered sufficiently to leave Hawaii. He purchased a ship and sailed toward Micronesia, intending to work on a mission. Bachelot's health significantly worsened after leaving Hawaii and he died at sea on December 5, 1837. He was buried on an islet off the coast of Pohnpei. In 1838, a small chapel was built near his grave.
