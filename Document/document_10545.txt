Questioning the legitimacy of Mukhtar's cases, a gathering of Alid partisans from Kufa went to Mecca looking for confirmation from Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. He answered in a vague way that he was happy with anybody whom God uses to render retribution on foes of the group of the prophet. They deciphered this as affirmation of Mukhtar's cases and came back to go along with him. To prevail upon the heretofore unpersuaded Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar, a powerful Alid factional and leader of the Nakhai clan, Mukhtar gave him a letter, which he guaranteed was composed by Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. In it, Ibn al-Hanafiyyah apparently considered himself the Mahdi and encouraged Ibn al-Ashtar to help Mukhtar. Subsequent to communicating a few questions, Ibn al-Ashtar in the long run went along with him. The letter was likely manufactured, and Ibn al-Hanafiyyah appears to have had no inclusion in the revolt. He endured the utilization of his name, in any case, and did not object to Mukhtar's exercises. In any case, when he needed to visit his devotees in Kufa, he was discouraged by gossip, coasted by Mukhtar after hearing this news, that the genuine Mahdi would not kick the bucket whenever struck by a sword.
