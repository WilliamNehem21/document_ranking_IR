"Moms of the Disappeared" keeps running for 5:14 (5ÃÂ minutes, 14ÃÂ seconds). It is played in like manner time in a key of A. The tune starts with the sound of downpour hitting a rooftop, which blurs in over the initial fourteen seconds close by the bass and a handled drum circle beat by Mullen which resounds out of sight. Thirty-two seconds into the tune, Mullen's drums enter, playing a sporadic beat each four to five seconds. At the fifty-second imprint the drums play an increasingly standard beat, and the Edge's guitar, joined by Eno's synthesizer, enters. The principal refrain starts at 1:28, and presents the harmony movement of AÃ¢ÂÂ EÃ¢ÂÂ FmÃ¢ÂÂ DÃ¢ÂÂ A, which is played in the stanzas. At 2:41 Eno's consoles enter, and the tune starts to pursue a DÃ¢ÂÂ A harmony movement, while Bono starts falsetto vocals. The second stanza at that point starts at 3:01. The verses end at 3:37, and the melody comes back to the harmony movement of DÃ¢ÂÂ A. The amicability progressively develops in volume until 4:33, so, all things considered the melody goes into a coda; the consoles go to a completion and the guitar comes back to playing A notes before blurring throughout the following eight seconds close by the bass. The synthesizer, drums, and drum circle close the tune, becoming dim gradually in the course of the last thirty-one seconds.
