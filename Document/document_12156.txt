In 1942, the Manhattan Project was endeavoring to develop the primary nuclear bombs. This would require generation offices, and by June 1942 the task had achieved the phase where their development could be thought about. On 25 June, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee thought on where they ought to be found. Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer prescribed that the diverse assembling offices be worked at a similar site so as to disentangle security and development. Such a site would require a significant tract of land to oblige both the offices and lodging for the a huge number of laborers. The plutonium handling plant should have been from the site limit and some other establishment, on the off chance that radioactive parting items got away. While security and wellbeing concerns proposed a remote site, despite everything it should have been close wellsprings of work, and available by street and rail transportation. A gentle atmosphere that enabled development to continue during the time was attractive. Landscape isolated by edges would lessen the effect of unintentional blasts, yet they couldn't be so steep as to confound development. The substratum should have been firm enough to give great establishments, however not all that rough that it would obstruct unearthing work. It was evaluated that the proposed plants would require access to 150,000 kW of electrical power and of water every moment. A War Department approach held that, when in doubt, weapons offices ought not be found west of the Sierra or Cascade Ranges, east of the Appalachian Mountains, or inside of the Canadian or Mexican fringes.
