Soon after her marriage to Hurley, Lloyd went to Bournemouth to recover from depletion. Inside days she was back performing in London music corridors. From the beginning of the new century, music lobby artistes and theater directors had been in argument about working conditions, a decrease in pay and livens, and an expanded number of matinÃÂ©e exhibitions. The main huge fracture was a 1906 strike, started by the Variety Artistes' Federation. The next year, the Music Hall War started, which saw the Federation battle for more opportunity and better working conditions for the benefit of music-corridor entertainers. Albeit well sufficiently known to direction her very own charges, Lloyd bolstered the strike, went about as a picket for the strikers and offered liberally to the strike support. To raise spirits, she frequently performed on picket lines and partook in a gathering pledges act at the Scala Theater. Amid one exhibit, she remembered somebody endeavoring to enter and yelled, "Let her through, young ladies, she'll close the music corridor quicker than we can." The artist was Belle Elmore, later killed by her significant other, Dr. Crippen. The question finished later that year with a goals comprehensively positive to the entertainers. In 1909, Lloyd showed up at the Gaiety Theater in Dundee where a faultfinder for "The Courier" noticed "Her brilliant grin and captivating nearness has a lot to do with her prevalence, while her tunes are of the infectious style, maybe not what a Dundee group of onlookers knows about, yet at the same time entertaining and of an appealing style."
