The verses to "Scents Like Teen Spirit" were frequently troublesome for audience members to unravel, both because of their nonsensicality and on account of Cobain's slurred, throaty performing voice. This issue was aggravated by the way that the "Don't worry about it" collection liner notes did exclude any verses for the melodies beside chose expressive sections. This unimaginableness added to the early opposition from radio stations towards adding the melody to their playlists; one Geffen advertiser reviewed that individuals from shake radio advised her, "We can't play this. I can't comprehend what the person is stating." MTV ventured to set up a form of the video that incorporated the verses running over the base of the screen, which they circulated when the video was added to their overwhelming turn plan. The verses for the collectionÃ¢ÂÂand some from prior or exchange variants of the tunesÃ¢ÂÂwere later discharged with the liner notes of the "Lithium" single in 1992. American shake faultfinder Dave Marsh noted remarks by circle racers of the time that the tune was "the 'Louie' of the nineties" and expressed, "As 'Louie', just more in this way, 'Teenager Spirit' uncovers its insider facts reluctantly and after that frequently incongruously." Marsh, endeavoring to translate the verses, felt in the wake of perusing the right verses from the melody's sheet music that "what I envisioned was significantly better (in any event, all the more satisfying) than what Nirvana really sang," and included, "To top it all off, I don't know that I find out about [the meaning of] 'Scents Like Teen Spirit' presently than before I plunked down for the official adaptation of the certainties."
