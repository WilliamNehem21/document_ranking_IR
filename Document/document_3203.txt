The primary national challenge, the FA Cup, had recently been commanded by novice clubs from special foundations, for example, Wanderers and Old Etonians. Anyway the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the main triumph by a common laborers group, Blackburn Olympic. Right now polished methodology was not allowed. Clubs from urban territories in the north were solid promoters of the training, however the southern beginner groups and the FA experts were immovably contradicted. Despite the fact that not at first a promoter of polished skill, McGregor came to support its presentation. By 1885 the issue took steps to part the FA when a gathering of clubs, overwhelmingly from Lancashire, declared their goal to leave and frame an adversary British Football Association if polished methodology was not acknowledged. A crisis FA gathering was brought accordingly. Speaking to Aston Villa, McGregor talked for polished methodology, the main representative from the Midlands to do as such, and was one of only a handful couple of agents to concede that his club had been paying players. Despite the fact that not as frank as more grounded advocates, for example, Preston North End's William Sudell, McGregor was all around regarded. The gathering finished with the FA tolerating polished methodology, albeit each club was allowed just to pay players who had been conceived or lived for somewhere around two years inside six miles of its home arena.
