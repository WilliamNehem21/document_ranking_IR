Philip I and Antiochus XI most likely dwelled in Cilicia amid Seleucus VI's rule. In 94 BC, not long after their sibling's demise, Philip I and Antiochus XI stamped jugate coins with their pictures on the front-side. The antiquarian Alfred Bellinger proposed that their base of activities was a seaside city north of Antioch, however as indicated by the numismatist Arthur Houghton, Beroea is a more grounded competitor in light of the fact that the city's rulers were Philip I's partners. All the jugate coins were stamped in Cilicia; the arrangement with the most various enduring examples was presumably issued in Tarsus, making it the conceivable base of tasks. Antiochus XI was depicted before his sibling, showing that he was the senior ruler. Getting their authenticity from Antiochus VIII, the siblings were portrayed on the coins with misrepresented barbed noses like their dad. Greek lords did not utilize regnal numbers, which is an advanced practice; rather, they utilized designations to separate themselves from comparably named rulers. On his coins, Philip I utilized the designations Philadelphus (kin adoring) and Epiphanes (the superb, or celebrated). The siblings planned to retaliate for Seleucus VI; as indicated by the fourth century essayist Eusebius, they sacked Mopsuestia and annihilated it.
