The victors of Wakefield were joined by Margaret's military and they walked south, pillaging settlements afterward. They freed Henry in the wake of overcoming the Yorkist armed force of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, in the Second Battle of St Albans and kept plundering on their approach to London. The city of London would not pave the way for Henry and Margaret because of a paranoid fear of being plundered. The Lancastrian armed force was shy of provisions and had no sufficient way to recharge them. At the point when Margaret discovered that Richard of York's oldest child Edward, Earl of March and his military had won the Battle of Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire and were walking towards London, she pulled back the Lancastrians to York. Warwick and the leftovers of his military walked from St Albans to join Edward's men and the Yorkists were invited into London. Having lost guardianship of Henry, the Yorkists required a defense to proceed with the defiance to the ruler and his Lancastrian devotees. On 4 March, Warwick announced the youthful Yorkist pioneer as King Edward IV. The decree increased more prominent acknowledgment than Richard of York's prior case, as a few nobles contradicted to giving Edward's dad a chance to rise the position of authority saw the Lancastrian activities as a double-crossing of the lawfully settled Accord.
