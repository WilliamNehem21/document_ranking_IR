Every one of the 18 sections of the novel utilizes its own scholarly style. Every section likewise alludes to a particular scene in Homer's Odyssey and has a particular shading, craftsmanship or science and real organ related with it.

In any case, as Terrence Killeen calls attention to this mapping was created after the novel had been composed and was not something that Joyce counseled as he composed the novel.
