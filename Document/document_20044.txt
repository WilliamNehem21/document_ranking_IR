Cladistic analysis of morphological characters suggest that "Pennatomys" is most closely related to a clade, the "Nectomys" subclade, that includes members of "Aegialomys", "Amphinectomys", "Nectomys", "Sigmodontomys", "Melanomys", "Megalomys" (another Antillean rice rat), and possibly "Nesoryzomys". However, the exact position of "Pennatomys" was poorly resolved because of missing data. Turvey and colleagues placed "P.Â nivalis" as the only member of its own genus because of its distinctive characters and the absence of evidence for close relationships with any other oryzomyine genus. "Pennatomys" probably belongs to a subgroup of Oryzomyini known as "clade D". This clade contains a number of species only occurring on islandsâincluding members of "Aegialomys", "Megalomys", "Nesoryzomys", "Noronhomys", "Oryzomys", and "Pennatomys". Turvey and colleagues suggested that this is related to the high proportion of semiaquatic species in clade Dâmost other oryzomyines are forest dwellers. As a whole, Oryzomyini includes over a hundred species in about thirty genera. It is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, which encompasses hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas. However DNA analysis demonstrated a sister-taxa relationship with "Megalomys" as an endemic Lesser Antillean radiation within clade D, and also showed that the different island populations showed a high degree of genetic differentiation from each other.
