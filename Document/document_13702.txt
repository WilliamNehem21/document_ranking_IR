The "national armies" were joined to the "Waffen-SS", and battled on the Eastern Front in 1942 and mid 1943. Unfit to supplant their misfortunes, a large portion of the survivors were consolidated into "SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland", approved by Hitler toward the finish of 1942. The three regiments of the new division were shaped utilizing overcomers of the "Freikorps Danemark", Legion "Niederlande" and Legion "Norwegen", enhanced by exchanges from "SS-Division Wiking", newcomers from the involved West European nations, and Reich Germans. Army "Flandern" was separated and utilized as substitutions in various "Waffen-SS" developments. While Weale states that they were for the most part persuaded by against socialism, the history specialist George C. Stein sees that few of the "national army" initiates were spurred by "political or ideological optimism", yet were rather roused by such factors as a craving for experience, better sustenance, the eminence of the uniform, and individual conditions. As indicated by Stein, Berger had no hallucinations about the thought processes of his West European volunteers, however paid minor lip administration to the possibility that they joined the "counter socialist" cause out of vision. Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the "Waffen-SS". In any case, by mid-1942 onwards, the "Waffen-SS" confronted expanding troubles with these "Germanic" initiates, particularly because of the approach of incorporating them into "skillet Germanic" developments, for example, "SS-Division Wiking". For instance, Norwegian enlisted people started mentioning their discharge from obligation, and toward the start of 1943, almost the whole Finnish contingent of that division requested to be discharged from their administration commitments.
