It was not the primary index of whores to be coursed in London. The "Meandering Whore" kept running for five issues somewhere in the range of 1660 and 1661, in the early (and recently liberal) long periods of the Restoration. Purportedly a report of the capital's sex exchange and more often than not ascribed to John Garfield, it records roads in which whores may have been found, and the areas of whorehouses in regions like Fleet Lane, Long Acre and Lincoln's Inn Fields. The "Meandering Whore" joins exchange between "Magdalena, a Crafty Whore, Julietta, an Exquisite Whore, Francion, a Lascivious Gallant, and Gusman, a Pimping Hector", with the admonition that it was scattered just so honest society may maintain a strategic distance from such individuals. Another production was "A Catalog of Jilts, Cracks and Prostitutes, Nightwalkers, Whores, She-companions, Kind Women and other of the Linnen-lifting Tribe", imprinted in 1691. This indexes the physical characteristics of 21ÃÂ women who could be found about St Bartholomew-the-Great Church amid Bartholomew Fair, in Smithfield. Mary Holland was clearly "tall, elegant and attractive, short of her favors", yet could be placated "at an expense of ÃÂ£20". Her sister Elizabeth was more affordable, being "not interested in Money yet a Supper and Two Guineas will entice her".
