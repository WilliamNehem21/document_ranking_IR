Hewett was instructed at Harrow School, won a Blue at Oxford in 1886 and played for Somerset from 1884. As a conflicting center request batsman he had little effect amid this period. All things being equal, he was delegated commander of Somerset in 1889. Throughout the following two years, his authority and exhibitions as an opening batsman were instrumental in the region recapturing top notch status and admission to the County Championship in 1891. He remained Somerset skipper for a further three seasons, generally opening the batting with Lionel Palairet. In 1892, they shared an organization of 346 for the main wicket, of which Hewett scored 201. The stand remains the district's most noteworthy first-wicket organization. In that season, Hewett made 1,405 keeps running at a normal of more than 35, and was named as one of the "Five Batsmen of the Year" by "Wisden". Britain did not play any Test coordinates at home in 1892, or else Hewett would presumably have won a Test top; rather his most astounding honor was being chosen to play for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's in 1894. A contradiction about whether play should happen on a soaked contribute the match against the Australians in 1893 prompted Hewett's takeoff from Somerset toward the finish of that season.
