In spite of the fact that obviously Siward was duke by 1033, he may have accomplished the position to some degree prior. His antecedent Erik of Hlathir last showed up in the chronicled sources in 1023, leaving a ten-year hole amid which Siward could have taken the position. In spite of the fact that William of Malmesbury attested that Erik was driven back to Scandinavia, Scandinavian custom immovably kept up he kicked the bucket in England. Antiquarian William Kapelle trusted that Erik stopped to be lord in or not long after 1023, and that Carl child of Thurbrand was designated hold or high-reeve ("heahgerefa") for the ruler in Yorkshire. Carl held this position, it was contended, even after Siward was introduced as baron a couple of years after the fact, however from that point on he went about as a delegate to the lord instead of to the ruler. Richard Fletcher stayed rationalist on the point, despite the fact that he argueed that Erik more likely than not been dead by 1028. Timothy Bolton, despite the fact that dismissing Kapelle's contention concerning Carl child of Thurbrand, trusted Erik passed on c. 1023 and that the earldom may have stayed empty for a period. Bolton contended that Cnut left the earldom of Northumbria vacant and seems to have given it little consideration until the most recent long periods of his rule, and another northerner Ealdred child of Uhtred rose to control in the political vacuum.
