While such analysis of Detzner's undertakings may have been expelled as post-bellum antagonism, in 1929, Detzner's attestations went under progressively genuine attack. Two of the German evangelists in the Finschhafen District, Christian Keyser (likewise spelled Kayser or Keysser) and Otto Thiele, asserted Detzner had not spent the war wandering the wilderness, one stage in front of the Australians, yet had been under the Mission's security the whole time. Keyser's extra allegations were especially explicit: Detzner had appropriated his very own logical perceptions. Keyser's cases conveyed some weight. He had distributed a lexicon of the KÃÂ¢te language, and was a dependable master on New Guinean tongues, and the German-based creole dialects that had emerged in New Guinea; he was additionally a "genuine" pioneer and globe-trotter, having lived from 1899ÃÂ to 1920ÃÂ among the mountain people groups of the island. In 1913, Keyser climbed the Saruwaged Massif; through the span of his 21ÃÂ years in New Guinea, he had recognized many new plant and creature species, and had kept up a standard correspondence with the German Geographical Society in Berlin. Ernst Mayr, a rising star in ornithology, had caught wind of Detzner from Australians on an examination outing to New Guinea. In Germany, amid a gathering with Keyser, they examined Detzner's cases, and Mayr lost no time in communicating the disparity to his logical contacts in Europe and the United States.
