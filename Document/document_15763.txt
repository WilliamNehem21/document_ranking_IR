Manuela SÃ¡enz is the General's long-time lover, his last since the death of his wife, 27Â years earlier. Her character is based on SimÃ³n BolÃ­var's historical mistress DoÃ±a Manuela SÃ¡enz de Thorne, whom BolÃ­var dubbed "the liberator of the liberator" after she helped save him from an assassination attempt on the night of September 25, 1828. GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez's fictional portrait stimulated a reassessment of this historical figure, who is increasingly seen, according to Venezuelan historian Denzil Romero, "not just as a mistress but as the intelligent, independent, forceful woman she was". In the novel, she is described as "the bold QuiteÃ±a who loved him but was not going to follow him to his death". The General leaves Manuela SÃ¡enz behind, but throughout the novel he writes to her on his journey. She also attempts to write letters to him with news of the political situation, but the mail carriers have been instructed not to accept her letters. Like the historical figure on whom she is based, the fictional Manuela SÃ¡enz is married to Dr. James Thorne, an English physician twice her age. The historical Manuela SÃ¡enz left Thorne after BolÃ­var wrote declaring his undying love for her. In the novel she is characterized as astute and indomitable, with "irresistible grace, a sense of power, and unbounded tenacity".
