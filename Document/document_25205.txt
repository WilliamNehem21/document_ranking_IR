The rainbow pitta is in length, and weighs . Females weigh , slightly more on average than males, which weigh . It typically stands upright while looking for food or resting, with the legs slightly bent, and the body held at a 60â70Â° angle. It moves around by hopping. Its head, neck, breast, and upper belly are velvet black, its upperparts are olive-green, and its lower belly and are scarlet red. The wings are green with a golden sheen and have a shining blue patch on the lesser , and the flight feathers and underwing are black. The tail is olive-green with a black base and the sometimes have a silvery-blue band across them. It has a black bill, pink legs, brown eyes and a chestnut stripe along each side of its crown. Many individuals display the pitta family's characteristic dark streaks, which can be arrow-shaped or stripes, through the middle of the feathers of the upper part of the body; examination of study skins have found around 60% of rainbow pittas have them. This varies somewhat regionally, as birds from Darwin were found to have none. Uniquely in the pitta family the streaks are not dusky or blackish but are instead bronze-coloured in this species.
