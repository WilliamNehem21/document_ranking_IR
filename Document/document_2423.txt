Perceiving the need to widen his allure past western Kentucky, Barkley opened his crusade in the focal Kentucky town of Danville on February 19, 1923. He utilized the motto "Christianity, Morality, and Good Government", and he and Cantrill Ã¢ÂÂ partners in the House Ã¢ÂÂ consented to cease from individual assaults. Because of Percy Haly's effect on Barkley and Barkley's very own appreciation for Woodrow Wilson, he impugned the impact of the coal, hustling, and railroad confides in state legislative issues. "Woodrow Wilson drove the evildoers and corruptionists out of New Jersey, Governor Pinchot is driving them out of Pennsylvania, and on the off chance that I am chosen Governor of Kentucky I guarantee to drive them out of Frankfort," he proclaimed. As opposed to his standard inclination for low duties, he pushed an assessment on coal stores. Notwithstanding diminishing the coal trust's political impact, he trusted the expanded income, which would to a great extent be produced by out-of-state coal purchasers, would result in lower property assesses on ranchers. Companions in the Anti-Saloon League persuaded him that forbidding parimutuel wagering would disable the dashing trust. Numerous Catholics and Protestants Ã¢ÂÂ outstandingly those subsidiary with the Louisville Churchmen's Federation Ã¢ÂÂ favored restriction and contradicted parimutuel wagering on religious grounds, and supported Barkley's office, yet Bingham, regularly a Beckham partner, was moderate to underwrite him. Like Bingham, "Lexington Herald" editorial manager Desha Breckinridge had made the parimutuel wagering framework, and Barkley's positions were sufficient to persuade him to back Cantrill, regardless of the way that Breckinridge for the most part detested Cantrill.
