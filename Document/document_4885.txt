Albeit at first a Persian vassal, AlexanderI of Macedon cultivated cordial political relations with his previous Greek adversaries, the Athenian and Spartan-drove alliance of Greek city-states. His successor PerdiccasII () drove the Macedonians to war in four separate clashes against Athens, pioneer of the Delian League, while invasions by the Thracian ruler Sitalces of the Odrysian kingdom compromised Macedonia's regional trustworthiness in the upper east. The Athenian statesman Pericles advanced colonization of the Strymon River close to the Kingdom of Macedonia, where the provincial city of Amphipolis was established in 437/436BC so it could give Athens an unfaltering supply of silver and gold just as timber and pitch to help the Athenian naval force. At first Perdiccas II did not make any move and may have even respected the Athenians, as the Thracians were adversaries to them two. This changed because of an Athenian partnership with a sibling and cousin of PerdiccasII who had opposed him. In this manner, two separate wars were battled against Athens somewhere in the range of 433 and 431BC. The Macedonian lord struck back by advancing the insubordination of Athens' partners in Chalcidice and along these lines prevailed upon the vital city of Potidaea. Subsequent to catching the Macedonian urban communities Therma and Beroea, Athens blockaded Potidaea however neglected to conquer it; Therma was come back to Macedonia and quite a bit of Chalcidice to Athens in a harmony settlement handled by Sitalces, who furnished Athens with military guide in return for obtaining new Thracian partners.
