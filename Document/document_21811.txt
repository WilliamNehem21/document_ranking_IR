In 1975, Steiger portrayed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in Carlo Lizzani's "Last Days of Mussolini", which received a positive critical reception. He appeared in Claude Chabrol's French picture "Innocents with Dirty Hands", playing the role of Louis Wormser, the wealthy alcoholic husband of Romy Schneider's character Julie Wormser. It was poorly received by critics, and Steiger found the director, whom he had admired, a bitter disappointment. He was highly critical of Chabrol's lack of communication and aloofness from the production, and preference for playing chess on set instead of talking through scenes. Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" dismissed it as "little more than a soap opera", writing: "The performances are of a pieceâuniformly atrocious. Mr. Steiger surpasses his own earlier records for lumbering busyness. Within his first few minutes on screen he (1) gets drunk, (2) whines, (3) pleads for understanding, (4) weeps and (5) goes to bed alone."
Later that year, Steiger starred as an Irish Republican Army terrorist who plans to blow up the Houses of Parliament in Don Sharp's British thriller "Hennessy". John Simon of "New York Magazine" wrote: "This fellow Hennessy, as played by Rod Steiger, is about as interesting and likable as a Guy Fawkes dummy."
