The troll shark has an unmistakably long and level nose, looking like a sword sharp edge. The relative length of the nose diminishes with age. The eyes are little and need defensive nictitating films; behind the eyes are spiracles. The huge mouth is illustrative fit as a fiddle. The jaws are entirely protrusible and can be stretched out nearly to the finish of the nose, however regularly they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35Ã¢ÂÂ 53 upper and 31Ã¢ÂÂ 62 lower tooth lines. The teeth in the fundamental piece of the jaws are long and limited, especially those close to the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely furrowed the long way. The back teeth close to the edges of the jaw are little and have a smoothed shape for squashing. Much individual variety of tooth length and width happens, with respect to whether the teeth have a littler cusplet on each side of the fundamental cusp, and in regards to the nearness of toothless holes at the symphysis or between the primary and back teeth. The five sets of gill cuts are short, with the gill fibers inside incompletely uncovered; the fifth pair is over the beginning of the pectoral blades.
