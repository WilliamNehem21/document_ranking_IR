Kanaka Dasa (whose original name was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509Ã¢ÂÂ 1609) of Kaginele (in present day Haveri area) was a plain and otherworldly searcher, who as indicated by recorded records originated from a group of Kuruba (shepherds) or "beda" (seekers). Under the support of the Vijayanagara ruler, he composed such vital compositions as "Mohanatarangini" ("River of Delight", 1550), written in commitment to King Krishnadevaraya, which portrays the account of Krishna in "sangatya" meter. His different celebrated compositions are "Narasimhastava", a work managing brilliance of God Narasimha, "Nalacharita", the account of Nala, which is noted for its portrayal, and "Hari Bhaktisara", an unconstrained composition on dedication in "shatpadi" meter. The last composition, which is on "niti" (ethics), "bhakti" (dedication) and "vairagya" (renunciation), keeps on being a prominent standard book of learning for kids. A special metaphorical lyric titled "Ramadhanya Charitre" ("Story of Rama's Chosen Grain") which commends ragi over rice was wrote by Kanaka Dasa. In this sonnet, a squabble emerges between ragi, the sustenance grain of poor people, and rice, that of the rich, with respect to which is prevalent. Rama chooses that ragi is unrivaled in light of the fact that it doesn't decay when safeguarded. This is one of the most punctual lovely articulations of class battle in the Kannada language. Notwithstanding these works of art, around 240 melodies composed by Kanaka Dasa are accessible.
