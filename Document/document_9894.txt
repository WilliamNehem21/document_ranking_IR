The battling before long declined into man-on-man battle; Seydlitz himself battled like a trooper, accepting an extreme injury. He requested his last 18 squadrons, as yet holding up at the Janus, into the fight. The second charge struck the French mounted force at a sideways point. The "mÃÂªlÃÂ©e" floated quickly southward, past the Allied infantry. Some portion of the Allied save, which had turned out to be trapped between the principle sections, was removing itself by degrees and trying to make up for lost time with the remainder of the hold segment away to one side, however the breadth of steeds and Allied infantry maneuvered them into the battling. The Allied hold mounted guns demonstrated futile; got amidst the infantry sections, it couldn't convey to help any of the imperiled Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau slope held up in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who got away from the cannons and the horsemen ran fast into a hail of black powder gun shoot from Prince Henry's infantry. Endeavored French counterattacks broke down into disarray. The vast majority of the Allied mounted force units in front were crushed by the underlying charge and a large number of them trampled over their very own men attempting to escape. The field was covered with riderless steeds and horseless men, injured, passing on and dead. This piece of the move made around 30 minutes.
