Sea tempest Debbie is the most dominant tornado on record to strike Ireland in September, and conceivably the main tropical twister on record to ever strike Britain and Ireland while still tropical. The fourth named tempest of the 1961 Atlantic typhoon season, Debbie started from a very much characterized tropical unsettling influence that was first recognized in late August over Central Africa. Following commonly westbound, the framework got off the shoreline of Senegal on SeptemberÃÂ 5 into the Atlantic Ocean. At this point, it was assessed to have turned into a hurricane, yet forecasters did not issue warnings on the framework until two days after the fact. Late on SeptemberÃÂ 6, Debbie went through the southern Cape Verde Islands as a solid typhoon or insignificant tropical storm, bringing about a plane accident that executed 60ÃÂ people in the islands. When clear of the islands, information on the tempest ended up inadequate, and the status of Debbie was unsure over the accompanying a few days as it followed west-northwestward and later northward. It was not until a business carrier captured the tempest on SeptemberÃÂ 10 that its area turned into certain. The next day, Debbie strengthened and achieved its pinnacle power as a CategoryÃÂ 3 tropical storm on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂ Simpson sea tempest scale, with greatest breezes of 120ÃÂ mph (195ÃÂ km/h).
