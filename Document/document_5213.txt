"U2 3D" generation included the primary 3D various camera setup and was shot utilizing each computerized 3D camera and recording deck in presence. The team had two days to set up the shooting hardware before each show, which required running optical fiber links and connecting an electrical generator to supply control at every setting. The taping hardware comprised of nine custom-fabricated 3D rigs. The task's expansive scale incited 3ality Digital to work with executive James CameronÃ¢ÂÂtheir main rival at the time. 3ality utilized their own 3flex TS1 camera rigs for taping, notwithstanding five Fusion 3D rigs, planned by Cameron and camera administrator Vincent Pace. An aggregate of 18 Sony CineAlta HDC-F950 cameras were utilized for recording, with two cameras on each apparatus. The cameras were fitted with Zeiss computerized long range focal points, making "U2 3D" the principal 3D film gave utilizing a long range focal point. One of the Fusion 3D camera apparatuses was utilized as a Spydercam and turned into the primary 3D ethereal camera. The cameras on each apparatus were separated eye-remove separated to make a 3D impact in after creation. Utilizing a pillar splitter mounted to the camera rig, one camera shot through a 50/50 reflect, while the other shot the picture reflected from that reflect. Each apparatus gauged a normal of . The majority of the show film was shot with twin-camera setups, aside from the two Melbourne gives, where a solitary CineAlta camera with a Steadicam was likewise used to catch close-ups. The cameras caught top quality video onto HDCAMÃÂ SR recording decks, which empowered the team to catch a whole show.
