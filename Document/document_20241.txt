A cottage industry of academic research has built up around "Maus", and schools have frequently used it as course material in a range of fields: history, dysfunctional family psychology, language arts, and social studies. The volume of academic work published on "Maus" far surpasses that of any other work of comics. One of the earliest such works was Joshua Brown's 1988 "Of Mice and Memory" from the "Oral History Review", which deals with the problems Spiegelman faced in presenting his father's story. Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory called "Family Pictures: "Maus", Mourning, and Post-Memory", later expanded into a book called "Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory". Academics far outside the field of comics such as Dominick LaCapra, Linda Hutcheon, and Terrence Des Pres took part in the discourse. Few approached "Maus" who were familiar with comics, largely because of the lack of an academic comics traditionâ"Maus" tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective. In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on "Maus" called "Considering "Maus": Approaches to Art Spiegelman's "Survivor's Tale" of the Holocaust". "Maus" is considered an important work of Holocaust literature, and studies of it have made significant contributions to Holocaust studies.
