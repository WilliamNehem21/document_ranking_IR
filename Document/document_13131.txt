In May 1914, the francophile Watt left Egypt with his plane and took up work at the BlÃÂ©riot production line and runway in Buc, outside Paris. Terminated by the generally held conviction that Britain would avoid an European clash, Watt offered his administrations and his plane to the French government on 2ÃÂ August, the day France proclaimed war on Germany. This signal was invited and he joined the Aviation Militaire segment of the Foreign Legion as a pilot. Despite the fact that he was positioned a conventional fighter, his partners in Bleriot Squadron No.ÃÂ 30 alluded to him as ""Capitaine"" in yielding to his past status in the Australian Militia. Presented on Maurice Farman Squadron No.ÃÂ 44 in April 1915, he earned the Legion of Honor identification after he and his spectator crash-arrived in a dead zone and prevailing with regards to advancing back to French lines with important insight under exceptional flame from German positions. Before long a short time later, Watt was granted the Croix de GuerreÃ¢ÂÂwith palm leaves by and by exhibited by General JoffreÃ¢ÂÂand elevated to the temporary position of chief. As an outsider, be that as it may, he was not qualified to order a French unit. Watt constantly announced his antipodean association while serving France, painting a kangaroo on the nose of his plane, which he named "Advance Australia". Considered a simple kind, he once acquainted himself with a British pilot with the words "I am an Australian and I haven't got any habits".
