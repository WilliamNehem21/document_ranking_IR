Exceedingly bottomless, the dark colored move edge is found over the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern Anatolia. It is similarly broadly dispersed crosswise over northern North America, stretching out north to Alaska, where it has been gathered from tundra close Coldfoot in the inside of the state. In southwestern Greenland, "P. involutus" has been recorded under the birch species "Betula nana", "B. pubescens" and "B. glandulosa". The mushroom is progressively regular in coniferous woods in Europe, but at the same time is intently connected with birch ("Betula pendula"). Inside forest, it inclines toward wet spots or boggy ground, and maintains a strategic distance from calcareous (white) soils. It has been noted to develop close by "Boletus badius" in Europe, and "Leccinum scabrum" and "Lactarius plumbeus" in the Pacific Northwest area of North America. There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous forest, normally under plantings of white birch ("Betula papyrifera") in urban regions. It is one of few parasitic animal categories which flourish in "Pinus radiata" ranches planted outside their regular range. An investigation of contaminated Scots pine backwoods around Oulu in northern Finland found that "P.ÃÂ involutus" turned out to be progressively plenteous in increasingly dirtied regions while different species declined. Discharges from mash plants, manure, warming and traffic were in charge of the contamination, which was estimated by sulfur levels in the pine needles.
