Researcher Ken Balcomb has widely contemplated executioner whales since 1976; he is the examination scholar in charge of finding U.S. Naval force sonar may hurt executioner whales. He considered executioner whales from the Center for Whale Research, situated in Friday Harbor, Washington. He was likewise ready to think about executioner whales from "his home patio roosted above Puget Sound, where the creatures chase and play in summer months". In May 2003, Balcomb (alongside other whale watchers close to the Puget Sound coastline) saw strange conduct shown by the executioner whales. The whales appeared "upset and were moving aimlessly, endeavoring to lift their heads free of the water" to get away from the sound of the sonars. "Balcomb affirmed at the time that peculiar submerged pinging clamors identified with submerged receivers were sonar. The sound began from a U.S. Naval force frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) removed, Balcomb said." The effect of sonar waves on executioner whales is possibly perilous. Three years preceding Balcomb's disclosure, examine in the Bahamas demonstrated 14 hooked whales appeared on the shore. These whales were stranded on the day U.S. Naval force destroyers were actuated into sonar work out. Of the 14 whales stranded, six of them passed on. These six dead whales were contemplated, and CAT outputs of two of the whale heads demonstrated draining around the mind and the ears, which is steady with decompression affliction.
