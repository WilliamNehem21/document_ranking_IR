If the Euclidean algorithm requires "N" steps for a pair of natural numbers "a"Â >Â "b"Â >Â 0, the smallest values of "a" and "b" for which this is true are the Fibonacci numbers "F" and "F", respectively. More precisely, if the Euclidean algorithm requires "N" steps for the pair "a"Â >Â "b", then one has "a"Â â¥Â "F" and "b"Â â¥Â "F". This can be shown by induction. If "N"Â =Â 1, "b" divides "a" with no remainder; the smallest natural numbers for which this is true is "b"Â =Â 1 and "a"Â =Â 2, which are "F" and "F", respectively. Now assume that the result holds for all values of "N" up to "M"Â âÂ 1. The first step of the "M"-step algorithm is "a"Â =Â "q""b"Â +Â "r", and the Euclidean algorithm requires "M"Â âÂ 1 steps for the pair "b"Â >Â "r". By induction hypothesis, one has "b"Â â¥Â "F" and "r"Â â¥Â "F". Therefore, "a"Â =Â "q""b"Â +Â "r"Â â¥Â "b"Â +Â "r"Â â¥Â "F"Â +Â "F"Â =Â "F",
which is the desired inequality.
This proof, published by Gabriel LamÃ© in 1844, represents the beginning of computational complexity theory, and also the first practical application of the Fibonacci numbers.
