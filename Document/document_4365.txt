The student of history R. A. Markus proposes that the purpose behind the clashing guidance is that the letter to ÃÂthelberht was composed first, and sent off with the returning evangelists. Markus contends that the pope, in the wake of reasoning further about the conditions of the mission in Britain, at that point sent a subsequent letter, the "Epistolae advertisement Mellitum", to Mellitus, at that point "in transit" to Canterbury, which contained new directions. Markus considers this to be a defining moment in minister history, in that coercive transformation offered approach to influence. This customary view that the "Epistola" speaks to an inconsistency of the letter to ÃÂthelberht has been tested by George Demacopoulos who contends that the letter to ÃÂthelberht was basically intended to empower the ruler in profound issues, while the "Epistola" was sent to manage simply commonsense issues, and along these lines the two don't negate one another. Vegetation Spiegel, an author on Anglo-Saxon writing, recommends that the topic of contrasting the Anglo-Saxons with the Israelites was a piece of a transformation methodology including continuous advances, including an expressly proto-Jewish one among agnosticism and Christianity. Spiegel considers this to be an expansion of Gregory's perspective on Judaism as somewhere between Christianity and agnosticism. In this manner, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be raised to what could be compared to Jewish practices, at that point after that organize was achieved they could be conveyed totally up to Christian practices.
