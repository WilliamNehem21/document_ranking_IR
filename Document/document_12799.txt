St James' was the locus of numerous eminent occasions all through the twentieth century, including weddings and memorial services of popular, noteworthy or infamous individuals, visits from scholars and senior priests, and when required, administrations for the Lutheran people group. At the wedding of artist Gladys Moncrieff and Tom Moore on 20 May 1924, the group in the boulevards close-by was large to the point that traffic was conveyed to a halt, a few ladies fell and two were so severely harmed they were taken to emergency clinic. At the time Moncrieff was showing up in "The Merry Widow" and came back to the phase the evening of her wedding. St James' was spoken to in the opening services of the Sydney Harbor Bridge by a buoy as the congregation building. The congregation was "pressed to the entryways" when the seventh minister, W.F. Wentworth-Sheilds, directed at the "amazing memorial service" of Walter Liberty Vernon in 1914. In 1950, four thousand individuals were accounted for to have lined the roads after the State burial service at St. James' of the principal Minister for Sweden in Australia, Constans Lundquist, who kicked the bucket all of a sudden at the Swedish Legation in Sydney. Dubious previous Governor-General, Sir John Kerr had a private burial service and commemoration administration in St James' in 1991 as opposed to a State memorial service in view of his tumble from support as the consequence of his choice to sack the Whitlam government in 1975. Conveying the lesson at St James' amid an ecumenical occasion on 14 October 1993, Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed gratitude toward Australians for supporting the battle against politically-sanctioned racial segregation.
