Brownlee turned into the area's main moderator on asset inquiries in October 1921. In spite of the fact that early endeavors at achieving understanding were hampered by the reluctance of the Maritime territories to consent to the important protected changes except if their own yearly sponsorships were expanded, dealings between the common and government proceeded irregularly all through the 1920s. Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King once in a while seemed open to Alberta's requests, yet never completely consented to them. A conceivable clarification for this is found in a 1924 letter from Alberta Liberal Party pioneer John R. Boyle to King, clarifying that the UFA was probably going to lose the following commonplace decision to Boyle's Liberals "except if something remarkable occurs. That uncommon thing which Greenfield needs to happen presently is acquiring from you the regular assets on the double." Despite this letter, the sides appeared to be near understanding in mid 1925: at a January gathering Alberta acknowledged on a basic level a government offer of three years of proceeding with endowment after the exchange of asset rights. After a comprehensive arrangement of gatherings among Brownlee and the bureaucratic advice, the understanding returned to the legislatures for endorsement. As Greenfield and Brownlee communicated their fretfulness with bureaucratic inaction, an intergovernmental meeting was met in May. The gathering continued at a relaxed pace into June, after which King reported that his bureau might want the mid year to think about the understanding in more noteworthy detail. The Albertans returned home in nauseate.
