The "Second Symphony", and "Livre pour orchestre" and the "Cello Concerto" which followed, were composed during a particularly traumatic period in LutosÅawski's life. His mother died in 1967, and in 1967â70 there was a great deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production "Dziady", which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the GdaÅsk Shipyards strike of 1970âwhich led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. LutosÅawski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the "Cello Concerto" of 1968â70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). LutosÅawski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the "Cello Concerto" was a great success, earning both LutosÅawski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's premiÃ¨re with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.
