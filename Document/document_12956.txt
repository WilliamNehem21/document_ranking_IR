"Prinzregent Luitpold" was available amid the primary fight by the German armada into the North Sea, which occurred on 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ November 1914. No British powers were experienced amid the activity. A second activity pursued on 15Ã¢ÂÂ 16ÃÂ December. This fight was the inception of a system embraced by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the administrator of the High Seas Fleet. He proposed to utilize the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's IÃÂ Scouting Group to assault British beach front towns to bait out parts of the British Grand Fleet where they could be obliterated by the High Seas Fleet. At an early stage 15ÃÂ December the armada left port to assault the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. That night, the German fight armada of nearly twelve gunboatsÃ¢ÂÂincluding "Prinzregent Luitpold" and her four sistersÃ¢ÂÂand eight pre-battleships came to inside of a separated squadron of six British war vessels. In any case, conflicts between the adversary destroyer screens in the haziness persuaded von Ingenohl that he was looked with the whole Grand Fleet. Compelled from Kaiser WilhelmÃÂ II to abstain from taking a chance with the armada pointlessly, von Ingenohl severed the commitment and turned the fight armada back toward Germany.
