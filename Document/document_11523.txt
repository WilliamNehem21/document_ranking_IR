As the Marines framed into a horseshoe-formed line around Hill 123, Tamura's unit started a progression of frontal attacks on the slope, energizing the seat from Hill 80 and up from underneath the east side of the edge. Under the light of parachute flares dropped by something like one Japanese floatplane, the Marines spurned the initial two assaults by Tamura's men. Tamura's troops raised a "regimental" firearm to the highest point of Hill 80 out of a push to flame it straightforwardly at the Marines. This firearm, which "could have turned the tide for the Japanese," be that as it may, was debilitated by a broken terminating pin. At midnight, amid a short break in the battling, Edson requested Parachute Companies B and C to progress from behind Hill 123 to fortify his left flank. With fixed pikes, the Paramarines cleared forward, murdering Japanese officers who had overwhelm the Marine lines and were evidently getting ready to move up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the slope. Marines from different units, just as individuals from Edson's direction staff, including Major Bailey, took ammo and explosives enduring an onslaught to the Marines around Hill 123, who were running fundamentally low. Said Marine member Captain William J. McKennan, "The Japanese assault was practically steady, similar to a downpour that dies down for a minute and afterward pours the harderÃÂ ... When one wave was cut down Ã¢ÂÂ and I mean cut down Ã¢ÂÂ another tailed it into death."
