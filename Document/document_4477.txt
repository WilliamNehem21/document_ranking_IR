He made wearing tweed, Homburg caps and Norfolk coats trendy, and promoted the wearing of dark ties with supper coats, rather than white tie and tails. He spearheaded the squeezing of pant legs from side to side in inclination to the now ordinary front and back wrinkles, and was thought to have presented the high quality turn-down shirt neckline, made for him by Charvet.

He was not an overwhelming consumer, however he drank champagne and, at times, port.
