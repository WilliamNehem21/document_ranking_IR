On 12 August 1981, of Trafford ParkÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ alongside Salford QuaysÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ were proclaimed an Enterprise Zone by the UK government, trying to support new improvement inside the bequest. The new status did little to turn around the recreation center's fortunes be that as it may; amid a 1984 House of Commons banter, Member of Parliament for Stretford, Tony Lloyd, portrayed the zone's decay as "staggering and sad". The objective had been to make 7,000ÃÂ new occupations over 10ÃÂ years, yet by 1986 just 2,557 had been made, not by any means enough to make up for the continuous activity misfortunes brought about by terminations inside the recreation center.

Of the four redevelopment plans attempted by the partnership one, Wharfside, included of the eastern end of the recreation center just as a major aspect of the ship trench docks and the territory around Manchester United F.C's. Old Trafford football ground toward the east of the Bridgewater Canal. The aim was to assemble "a leader site" containing renowned settlement for workplaces, shops, and "greetings tech" ventures, benefiting from the territory's nearness to Manchester downtown area and reflecting the prior accomplishment of the redevelopment at close-by Salford Quays.
