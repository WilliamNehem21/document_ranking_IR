War craftsman Alfred Munnings was sent to France in mid 1918 as an official war craftsman with the Canadian Cavalry Brigade. The Canadian Forestry Corps welcomed Munnings to visit their work camps in France in the wake of seeing a portion of his work at the central command of General Simms, the Canadian delegate. He created illustrations, watercolors, and canvases of their work, including "Draft Horses, Lumber Mill in the Forest of Dreux" in 1918. Forty-five of his artistic creations were shown at the Canadian War Records Exhibition at the Royal Academy, a large number of which highlighted ponies in war. Various different specialists made works that highlighted the steeds of World War I, incorporating Umberto Boccioni with "Charge of the Lancers" and Terence Cuneo with his celebrated after war painting of the sparing of the firearms at Le Cateau amid the Retreat from Mons. Amid World War I, craftsman Fortunino Matania made the famous picture "Farewell Old Man" that would be utilized by both British and American associations to bring issues to light of the enduring of creatures influenced by war. The work of art was joined by a sonnet, "The Soldiers Kiss", that additionally underscored the predicament of the pony in war.
