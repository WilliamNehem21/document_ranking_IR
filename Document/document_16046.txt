All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to the nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The root system of the suckering forms of "Banksia marginata" in Victoria and South Australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root, and an extensive system of thick lateral roots below the surface. During the winter months, segments around in length develop vegetative buds capable of forming suckers. Clusters of fine proteoid roots up to long arise from these lateral roots.
The response of "Banksia marginata" to fire is variable. In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions, plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed. They are serotinous, storing their seed in old cones, forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire. A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances (generally or less), with those closest to the parent plant faring the best. In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and also eastern south Australia, it grows as a low shrub which suckers (shoots growing from lateral roots) after fire. Plants do not appear to live longer than 25 years; after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent. A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of "Banksia marginata" plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire. There is anecodotal evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region. Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self-select to be more flammable; "Banksia marginata" tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily, and fire would spread easily through it.
