In August 1934, the Bassendean Road Board connected to the Lands Department to change the segment of the PerthÃ¢ÂÂ Guildford street inside its locale to Great Eastern Highway. The office denied the solicitation, thinking that most traffic destined for Midland utilized The Causeway and went on the south side of the Swan River, and that accordingly the PerthÃ¢ÂÂ Guildford street ought not be a piece of the primary roadway. Notwithstanding this misfortune, the Perth Road Board sorted out a nearby government meeting to consider renaming the street from Perth to Guildford. The issue was viewed as essential, as losing the name toward the south side of the waterway would occupy traffic far from the old built up focuses toward the north. The rectifying of perilous twists and the substitution of an old extension among Bassendean and Guildford were likewise to be considered. The meeting, hung on 7 September 1934, was gone to by delegates of the Perth, Bayswater, Bassendean, and Guildford street sheets, and the Midland Junction Council. Guildford and Midland Junction were as yet contradicted to the renaming, however the others were strong. Movements that passed included presenting a rename proposition to the state government, asking the administration to develop another scaffold at Bassendean, and moving toward the legislature to have the street pronounced a primary street.
