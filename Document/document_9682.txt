The revised fresco has been viewed as "classicizing" the picture of the "condottieri", with the "land verde" system giving the arrogance of an equestrian bronze statue. The steed's extents depend freely upon those endorsed by Alberti in "De equo animante", which thus depends on the mysterious "Sonetto del Cavallo Perfetto"; in any case, from multiple points of view the steed leaves drastically from Alberti's optimal of an agreeable and "flexible" animal in the style of Leonello d'Este's landmark to NiccolÃÂ² III d'Este, "Arco del Cavallo" in Ferrara. Moreover, Uccello's viewpoint in the Hawkwood landmark straightforwardly paraded Alberti's origination of point of view as delineated in "De Pictura" (1435, converted into Italian as "Della Pittura" in 1436): the evaporating point is at the eye-dimension of the observer as opposed to inside the field of the fresco, for instance. Alberti's "De re aedificatoria" likewise protested statues of troopers or potentially lay internments in temples. In spite of the fact that the fresco is frequently called "monochrome", its experience is dull red, the pony and tomb are highlighted in red, dark, white, and orange. The "Trompe-l'ÃÂil" viewpoint from the base, the "chiaroscuro" alleviation impact of the pony and the rider, and lighting from the left are like Masaccio's "Blessed Trinity". The association with Masaccio is so solid (or so frequently revealed) that Francesco Albertini really ascribed the work to Massaccio in 1510. Notwithstanding, Uccello's fresco has two perspectives: the steed and rider are painted as though on level with the onlooker, and the cenotaph is viewed as though from underneath.
