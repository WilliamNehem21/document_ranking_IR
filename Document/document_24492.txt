In 1990, a large, unknown shipwreck was encountered by the Fugro Seafloor Surveys vessel MV "Moana Wave 1" while surveying the path of the PacRimWest communications cable. One of the survey ship's crew theorised that the wreck, located at in of water, was "Australia", but Fugro kept the information to themselves until 2002, when the company's Australian branch mentioned the discovery during a conference. This piqued the interest of a member of the New South Wales Heritage Office, who requested copies of the company's data. The size and location of the ship pointed towards it being "Australia", but the depth meant verification through inspection could only be achieved with a remote operated vehicle (ROV). The RAN was approached in 2007 for assistance, but although they supported the project, the RAN did not have the equipment to assist. In March 2007, the United States Navy loaned the deep-sea ROV "CURV-21" to the Australian Government, to locate and recover a Black Hawk helicopter which crashed during the Australian response to the 2006 Fijian coup d'Ã©tat. While en route back to Australia, the ROV, carried aboard Defence Maritime Services vessel , was directed to Fugro's coordinates at the request of the NSW Heritage Office to verify and inspect the wreck. Video footage captured by the ROV allowed the NSW Heritage Office to confirm that the wreck was "Australia" by matching features like the superstructure and masts to historical photographs. Although initially sinking stern-first, the battlecruiser levelled out as she sank, with the aft mast the first to strike the bottom. After hitting the seabed, "Australia" slid about to her final resting place. The wreck site is protected under the federal "Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976".
