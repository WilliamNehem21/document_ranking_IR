Priestley appears to have longed for a more cosmopolitan network than Northumberland gave, keeping in touch with his sister that it was "apparently practically out of the world" and grumbling that he needed to sit tight seven days for news. He kept in touch with his companion John Vaughan: "We know however minimal more than we did when we left you of European undertakings." In the winter of 1794Ã¢ÂÂ 95, Priestley kept in touch with companions that his circumstance was exceptionally "inaccessible from my unique perspectives" and "my time here is a long way from passing so pleasantly as it did in England", yet he was "extremely appreciative for such a refuge" and he endeavored "to make the best of my circumstance". In his letters to companions back in Britain, Priestley reliably alluded to himself as an outcast and to England as his genuine home. Mary was more joyful with the couple's circumstance and wrote to William Vaughan: "I am cheerful and appreciative to meet with so sweet a circumstance thus quiet a retreat as the spot I currently compose from. Dr. Priestley likewise prefers it and of his own decision means to settle here, which is more than I sought after at the time we came up...This nation is extremely brilliant, the possibilities of wood and water more delightful than I have ever observed previously and the general population plain and tolerable in their habits."
