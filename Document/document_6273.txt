Maybe Szigeti's most productive melodic association was with his companion BÃÂ©la BartÃÂ³k. The principal piece BartÃÂ³k devoted to him was the [[Rhapsody No. 1 (BartÃÂ³k)|First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra]] (or piano) of 1928; the song, in light of both Romanian and Hungarian society tunes, was one of a couple of violin compositions written in 1928 (the other being devoted to [[ZoltÃÂ¡n SzÃÂ©kely]].) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist [[Benny Goodman]] collaborated to commission a trio from BartÃÂ³k: initially proposed to be a short work sufficiently long to fill the two sides of a 78ÃÂ rpm record, the piece before long extended past its humble expectation and turned into the three-development "[[Contrasts (BartÃÂ³k)|Contrasts]]" for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and BartÃÂ³k had both fled to the United States to get away from the war in Europe, BartÃÂ³k's wellbeing was coming up short and he had sunk into wretchedness. He was in desperate need of cash, however felt no motivation to make and was persuaded that his works could never pitch to an American group of onlookers. Szigeti went to his companion's guide by verifying gifts from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for BartÃÂ³k's therapeutic treatment, and after that, together with director and comrade [[Fritz Reiner]], influenced [[Serge Koussevitzky]] to commission from BartÃÂ³k what in the end turned into his much-cherished [[Concerto for Orchestra (BartÃÂ³k)|Concerto for Orchestra]]. The work's prosperity presented to BartÃÂ³k some proportion of money related security and gave him a truly necessary passionate lift.
