KetÃÂ¨lbey was monetarily sufficiently effective to leave Columbia Records in 1926 to invest more energy making, despite the fact that he kept on directing for them on an infrequent premise, especially somewhere in the range of 1928 and 1930 when he led sixteen of his own works with the organization, distributed as "KetÃÂ¨lbey Conducting his Concert Orchestra". He invested his energy undertaking yearly directing visits and forming, and in 1927 he distributed "By the Blue Hawaiian Waters" and the suite "In a Fairy Realm", while in the next year he composed another suite, "Three Fanciful Etchings". His works kept on selling admirably, and in the October 1929 issue of the "Performing Right Gazette" his distributer depicted him as "England's most noteworthy living arranger"; when the commercial was referenced in "The Musical Times", the unknown author expressed "we identify with Mr KetÃÂ¨lbey in being in this manner raised to an apex which he himself, we are certain, eventual extremely distant from guaranteeing." Sant composes that KetÃÂ¨lbey accordingly turned into Britain's first mogul writer. In February 1930 he started what turned into a yearly arrangement of shows at the Kingsway Hall, leading another work, "The Clock and the Dresden Figures". In an audit of the 1933 show, the pundit S.R. Nelson composed that "as an enlightening author KetÃÂ¨lbey truly takes some beating. He has the cheerful skill of joining unendingly sweet topics and the keenly weakened resemblance of the bona fide environment."
