Leyland was noted as a humorist in his playing days; numerous accounts are related with him, albeit some are presumably fanciful. He recounted stories against himself. One story concerned his expulsion amid a wartime coordinate, in which he was out to a horrible conveyance from a bowler who was gravely performing poorly due to a lack of practice. Leyland hit the ball noticeable all around and was gotten. He sadly remarked: "You know, I don't get much practice against that stuff". Some other time, he depicted how he confronted an over from O'Reilly, as related in his tribute in "The Cricketer": "'First he bowled me an off-break, at that point he bowled me a leg-break; at that point his googly, at that point a guard, at that point one that ran with his armÃÂ ...' 'Yet that is just five, Maurice. Shouldn't something be said about the last one?' 'Goodness, that,' said Maurice deprecatingly. 'That was a straight 'un and it bowled me. Among his colleagues, Leyland was known as "Tonnip", or "Turnip", potentially a reference to his nation childhood. Robertson-Glasgow and Cardus composed productively on Leyland; Gibson recommends that these pieces are among their best work. Leyland was well known with colleagues, adversaries and observers around the globe. Swanton finished up his tribute of Leyland: "Not any more gutsy or decided cricketer at any point clasped on cushions for England."
