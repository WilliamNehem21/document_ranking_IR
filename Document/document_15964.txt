Escorted by armed yacht , destroyers and , and French cruiser , the convoy was west of its destination of Le Verdon-sur-Mer by the end of the day on 15 August. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, German submarine launched three torpedoes at "Montanan". The first two, spotted by lookouts aboard "Montanan", missed, but a third, unseen torpedo struck "Montanan" amidships on her port side, opening a large hole. "Montanan" began to settle and was abandoned quickly. Two of "Montanan"s Naval Armed Guardsmen drowned when their lifeboat capsized in the heavy seas; three of her civilian crewmen also died in the attack. "Montanan"s 81 survivors were rescued by convoy escort "Noma".
Shortly after "Montanan" was attacked, "West Bridge", which had previously developed engine trouble and was drifting, was torpedoed by and abandoned. By the morning of 16 August both "Montanan" and "West Bridge", with decks awash, were still afloat some apart. "Montanan"s captain and several officers reboarded the ship the next morning for an attempt to get her under tow, but despite their efforts, the ship sank later that morning.
