The violin was Nielsen's own instrument and he composed four large-scale chamber works for it. The departures from standard procedures in the First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its often sudden modulations and its terse thematic material, disconcerted Danish critics at its first performance. The Second Sonata, Op.Â 35 of 1912 was written for the violinist Peder MÃ¸ller who earlier that year had premiered the composer's Violin Concerto. The work is an example of the composer's progressive tonality since, although it is stated to be in the key of G minor, the first and final movements end in different keys. The critic Emilius Bangert wrote of the premiere (which was given by Axel Gade), "The overall impression was of a beautiful, unbroken lineÂ â a flow of notesÂ â where in particular a wonderful second subject in the first part and the pure, high sphere of the last part were captivating". Two other works are for violin solo. The "Prelude, Theme and Variations", Op. 48 (1923) was written for TelmÃ¡nyi, and, like Nielsen's "Chaconne" for piano, Op. 32, was inspired by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The "Preludio e Presto", Op. 52 (1928) was written as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday of the composer Fini Henriques.
