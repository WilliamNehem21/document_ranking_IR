Treloar left his situation at the Memorial for the span of World War II. In September 1939 Treloar's dear companion Henry Gullett, who at the time was the Minister for Information, selected him the debut secretary of the Department of Information (DOI). The DOI was the first of 17 new Australian Government offices to be set up amid the war, and was in charge of both restriction and scattering government promulgation. Treloar ran the office in accordance with customary Australian Public Service rehearses and found a way to keep the its work from being politicized. To accomplish this, he actualized tight inward powers over the DOI's methodology and data scattering capacities and educated subordinates to not safeguard the administration from analysis. He remained the departmental secretary after Gullett was moved to an alternate service in March 1940, however lost status when Keith Murdoch was selected to the new position of Director-General of Information in June that year. Murdoch's arrangement was a piece of an administration crusade to create open help for expanded weapons creation following the fall of France, and he put a more grounded accentuation on producing publicity. Treloar was harried by the utilization of the DOI's picture takers to deliver exposure photos rather than pictures with recorded esteem. Neck was executed in the Canberra air debacle on 13ÃÂ August 1940. Treloar recovered full control of the DOI in December that year when Murdoch surrendered, however its picture takers were still chiefly entrusted with taking exposure photographs.
