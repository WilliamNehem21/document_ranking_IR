In 1937, South Africa toured New Zealand and decisively won the test series despite losing the first test; this 1937 South African team was described as the best team ever to leave New Zealand. It was not until 1949 that New Zealand next played the Springboks when they toured South Africa with Fred Allen as captain. Although each test against South Africa was very close, New Zealand lost the series 4â0.
At the same time as an All Black team was touring South Africa, Australia were touring New Zealand. The two tours coincided because MÄori players were not able to go to South Africa at the time, meaning the Australians, played against a New Zealand team made up of the best MÄori and the reserve non-MÄori players, while the South Africans encountered the best pÄkehÄ (non-MÄori) players. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand, captained by Johnny Smith, were beaten 11â6 by Australia in Wellington. New Zealand then lost their second test 16â9, which gave Australia a Bledisloe Cup series win in New Zealand for the first time. 1949 was an "annus horribilis" for the All Blacks as they lost all six of their test matches, and the experience of playing two test series simultaneously has not been repeated.
