Expert's second title was a western (likewise "tÃÂªte-bÃÂªche"): William Colt MacDonald's "Awful Man's Return", bound with J. Edward Leithead's "Bleeding Hoofs". Riddles and westerns rotated normally for the initial thirty titles, with a couple of books not in either kind, for example, P. G. Wodehouse's "Brisk Service", bound with his "The Code of the Woosters". In 1953, A.E. van Vogt's "The World of Null-A", bound with his "The Universe Maker", showed up; this was Ace's first invasion into sci-fi. (Prior in 1953, Ace had discharged Theodore S. Drachman's "Cry Plague!", with a plot that could be viewed as sf, yet the book it was bound withÃ¢ÂÂLeslie Edgley's "The Judas Goat"Ã¢ÂÂ was not sf .) Another sf twofold pursued later in 1953, and sf quickly settled itself, nearby westerns and riddles, as an imperative piece of Ace's the same old thing. By 1955, the organization discharged more sf titles every year than in both of the other two sorts, and from 1961 forward, sf titles dwarfed riddles and westerns joined. Expert additionally distributed various shocking adolescent reprobate books during the 1950s that are currently truly collectible, for example, D-343, "The Young Wolves" by Edward De Roo and D-378, "Out for Kicks" by Wilene Shaw.
