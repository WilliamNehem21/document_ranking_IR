Critics believed that the first chapter, "Launch of the "Screaming Narwhal"", was a respectable start to the game. Ryan Scott of GameSpy wrote that the puzzles "generally challenge [the player] "just" enough without becoming too frustrating", while Eurogamer's Kristan Reed stated that their quality was "bang-on time after time". However, criticism was directed toward certain puzzles' designsâparticularly toward that of one maze puzzle. The writing and story were lauded, with several reviews commending the dialogue's humor. Adventure Gamers staff writer Evan Dickens felt that writing did not match up to the quality of "LeChuck's Revenge", however. Although the chapter's supporting cast was considered weak, critics enjoyed the introduction of de Singe to the series. The voicework for the main characters was praised, as was Land's soundtrack. Critics were mostly complimentary toward the episode's graphics, with "New Straits Times" Bruno Chan and "The Sunday Times" David Phelan praising the updated interpretation of "The Curse of Monkey Island"s art style while 1UP.com's Bob Mackey called Guybrush "the most convincingly expressive Telltale character yet"; however, concerns were voiced over erratic graphical quality between characters. The game's controls were subject to reproof by a number of reviews; several preferred the keyboard controls over Telltale's new "click and drag" system.
