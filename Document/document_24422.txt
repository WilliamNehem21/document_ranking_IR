A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found "B.aemula" grew on ridges (dry heath) and "B. oblongifolia" on slopes (wet heath), and the two species did not overlap. Manipulation of seedlings in the same study area showed that "B. aemula" grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species did not appear to impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally "Banksia aemula" produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that "Banksia aemula" seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in the presence or absence of recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, "B.aemula" was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.
