Cheke called attention to that a few depictions after 1662 utilize the names "Dodo" and "Dodaers" when alluding to the red rail, showing that they had been exchanged to it after the vanishing of the dodo itself. Cheke subsequently indicates the 1662 portrayal as the last valid perception. A 1668 record by English explorer John Marshall, who utilized the names "Dodo" and "Red Hen" reciprocally for the red rail, referenced that the meat was "hard", which echoes the portrayal of the meat in the 1681 record. Indeed, even the 1662 record has been addressed by the author Errol Fuller, as the response to trouble cries matches what was portrayed for the red rail. Until this clarification was proposed, a depiction of "dodos" from 1681 was believed to be the last record, and that date still has defenders. As of late open Dutch original copies show that no dodos were seen by pilgrims in 1664Ã¢ÂÂ 1674. It is improbable the issue will ever be settled, except if late reports referencing the name close by a physical portrayal are rediscovered. The IUCN Red List acknowledges Cheke's reason for picking the 1662 date, taking every single consequent report to allude to red rails. Regardless, the dodo was most likely wiped out by 1700, about a century after its disclosure in 1598. The Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, however by then the dodo and the vast majority of the substantial earthly vertebrates there had turned out to be wiped out.
