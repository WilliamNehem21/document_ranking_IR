"Mecklenburg" and her sisters were excluded in the German armada that attacked the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, because of the shortage of escorts. The undeniably dynamic British submarines constrained the Germans to utilize more destroyers to ensure the capital boats. "Mecklenburg" participated in two breadths to HuvudskÃÂ¤r on 9Ã¢ÂÂ 11 and 21Ã¢ÂÂ 23 September. On 17 December she steered into the rocks in the passage to the harbor of Libau, yet was towed free without enduring any harm. She was to supplant the exhausted protected cruiser in the observation powers of the armada in the Baltic, however "Mecklenburg" and her sisters were expelled from administration presently. By this phase of the war, the German Navy was confronting extreme deficiencies of groups, which could be mitigated by the decommissioning of more seasoned, less successful warships. Moreover, the expanding risk from British submarines and Russian mines in the Baltic by 1916, the last of which sank the defensively covered cruiser , persuaded the German naval force to pull back the older "Wittelsbach"- class ships from dynamic administration. On 6 January 1916, "Mecklenburg" left Libau headed for Kiel, arriving the next day. She was decommissioned on 24 January and put available for later.
