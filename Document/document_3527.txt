O'Mahoney and Winter started chipping away at the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called "The Women's Story", around two Iraqi ladies who had traveled around the nation and recorded what they saw. They needed to make a narrative about "the general population never observed on the nightly news, [instead of] presidents, executives, commanders and aggressors ... professing to know something of Iraq's future". Winter clarified that "every one of these documentaries leaving Iraq were accomplished for or by grown-ups. Iraqi youngsters had not been in excess of an UN measurement about the dead, grabbed or harmed", so they chose to focus on what they saw as the "genuine wellspring of Iraq's future" Ã¢ÂÂ adolescents. "I needed to recount to the account of Iraq in an unexpected way. As writers, we do anecdotes about children and young people, however we don't get notification from them. In the event that you go to the UN reports, they are only a number and that is it." O'Mahoney was somewhat more hesitant; he had as of late worked in Iraq yet did not wish to return because of the common war and the decaying state of the nation. When it was chosen to utilize a school as a scenery to the story, which could likewise be utilized to give a sequential account, O'Mahoney and Winter acknowledged it would be unreasonably risky for the understudies to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera group since it would attract an excess of regard for them, thus they chose that the understudies would film the narrative themselves.
