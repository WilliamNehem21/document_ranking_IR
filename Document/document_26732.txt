In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of "The Shadow". WGN's "Chicago Theater of the Air", featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. "Chicago Theater of the Air" would run on Mutual through March 1955. Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show "Here's Morgan" began its network run in October 1940. Though "The Lone Ranger" moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. "The Adventures of Superman", picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as "The Return of Nick Carter" and later retitled "Nick Carter, Master Detective", it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired "The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, reprising their roles from the Universal film series. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to Mutual from September 1947 through June 1949. "The Mysterious Traveler", a protoâ"Twilight Zone" anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.
