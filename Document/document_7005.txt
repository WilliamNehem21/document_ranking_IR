The unmistakable paw, on the second digit of dromaeosaurids, has customarily been portrayed as a slicing weapon; its expected use being to cut and eviscerate prey. In the "Battling Dinosaurs" example, the "Velociraptor" lies underneath, with one of its sickle paws clearly inserted in the throat of its prey, while the snout of "Protoceratops" is clipped downward on the correct forelimb of its assailant. This recommends "Velociraptor" may have utilized its sickle hook to puncture imperative organs of the throat, for example, the jugular vein, carotid course, or trachea (windpipe), as opposed to slicing the midriff. Within edge of the paw was adjusted and not abnormally sharp, which may have blocked any kind of cutting or slicing activity, albeit just the hard center of the hook is protected. The thick stomach mass of skin and muscle of huge prey species would have been hard to cut without a particular cutting surface. The slicing theory was tried amid a 2005 BBC narrative, "The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs". The makers of the program made a counterfeit "Velociraptor" leg with a sickle hook and utilized a pork stomach to reproduce the dinosaur's prey. Despite the fact that the sickle paw penetrated the stomach divider, it was unfit to tear it open, showing that the paw was not used to gut prey.
