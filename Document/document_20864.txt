As part of his duties to the Gonzaga court, Monteverdi was often required to compose or arrange music for staged performances. These works included a fully-fledged opera, "L'Orfeo", written to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio the Younger and presented before the court on 24 February 1607. This performance pleased the duke, who ordered a repeat showing for 1 March. A contemporary account records that the piece "could not have been done betterÂ ... The music, observing due propriety, serves the poetry so well that nothing more beautiful is to be heard anywhere". Monteverdi was then required to write several pieces for performance at the wedding of the duke's son and heir Francesco, planned for early May 1608. These included a musical prologue for Battista Guarini's play "L'idropica" and a setting of the dramatic ballet "Il ballo delle ingrate" ("Dance of the Ungrateful Ladies"), with a text by Ottavio Rinuccini. There was also to be an opera, though it was not initially certain that Monteverdi would provide this. Other works under consideration were Peri's "Le nozze di Peleo e Tetide" ("The marriage of Peleus and Thetis") with a libretto by Francesco Cini, and a new setting of "Dafne" by Marco da Gagliano. In the event, the former was rejected and the latter designated for performance at the 1607â08 Carnival. The duke decreed that the wedding opera should be based on the myth of Arianna (Ariadne), and that Rinuccini should write the text. Monteverdi was instructed to provide the music.
