In 1814, the trustees of Columbia University (at that point Columbia College) were seeking the state governing body for assets when the lawmaking body out of the blue gave Hosack's previous land to the school. The greenery enclosures turned out to be a piece of Columbia's "Upper Estate" (rather than the "Lower Estate" in Lower Manhattan), relying on the prerequisite that the school move its whole grounds to the Upper Estate by 1827. In spite of the fact that the migration prerequisite was revoked in 1819, Columbia's trustees did not see the land as "an appealing or accommodating blessing", so the school let the patio nurseries break down. The region would not end up created until the 1830s, and the land's esteem did not increment to any significant sum until the late 1850s, when St. Patrick's Cathedral was fabricated adjacent, prodding an influx of advancement in the region. Incidentally, the house of prayer was worked in that area since it confronted the Upper Estate gardens. By 1860, the Upper Estate contained four line houses beneath 49th Street just as a wooden structure opposite the basilica. The encompassing territory was immature, with a potter's field and the railroad lines from Grand Central Depot situated toward the east.
