In 1963, authorities from Esso drew nearer Gustav Eyssell, who had been Rockefeller Center Inc's. leader since Hugh Robertson had ventured down in 1948. Esso recommended that Eyssell affirm another structure for the organization, which had outgrown the space that it effectively involved in Rockefeller Center. Eyssell genuinely considered the proposition in light of the fact that the complex did not have any desire to lose Esso's tenure, and on the grounds that the complex's current occupants were mentioning a consolidated of additional room. Rockefeller Center's supervisors re-employed Harrison and Abramovitz to plan three new towers on the west side of Sixth Avenue, with one pinnacle on every one of the squares somewhere in the range of 47th and 50th Streets. The chiefs bought the land for the three proposed structures in private. At the same time, they counseled with vast potential occupants, and in the long run figured out how to sign Esso, McGraw-Hill, and Celanese as the fundamental inhabitants for the structures. Under the arrangement, Esso (later renamed Exxon) would move into the northernmost pinnacle at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, while McGraw-Hill would possess the middle pinnacle at 1221, and Celanese would have the southernmost pinnacle at 1211. These were known as the "XYZ Buildings" in light of the fact that the three towers were similar to the point that their arrangements could be exchanged.
