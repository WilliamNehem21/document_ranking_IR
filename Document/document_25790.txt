In 1953, Birger Bohlin named "Troodon" "bexelli" based on a parietal bone from China. In 1964, Oskar Kuhn considered this as an unequivocal species of "Stegoceras"; "S. bexelli". In 1974, the Polish palaeontologists Teresa MaryaÅska and Halszka OsmÃ³lska concluded that the "gastralia" of "Stegoceras" were ossified tendons, after identifying such structures in the tail of "Homalocephale". In 1979, William Patrick Wall and Peter Galton named the new species "Stegoceras browni", based on a flattened dome, formerly described as a female "S. validus" by Galton in 1971. The specific name honours Barnum Brown, who found the holotype specimen (specimen AMNH 5450 in the American Museum of Natural History) in Alberta. In 1983, Galton and Hans-Dieter Sues moved "S. browni" to its own genus, "Ornatotholus" ("ornatus" is Latin for "adorned" and "tholus" for "dome"), and considered it the first known American member of a group of "flat-headed" pachycephalosaurs, previously known from Asia. In a 1987 review of the pachycephalosaurs, Sues and Galton emended the specific name "validus" to "validum", which has subsequently been used in the scientific literature. These authors synonymized "S. brevis", "S. sternbergi", and "S. lambei" with "S. validum", found that "S. bexelli" differed from "Stegoceras" in several features, and considered it an indeterminate pachycephalosaur.
