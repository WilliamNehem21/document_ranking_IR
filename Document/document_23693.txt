"God of War: Ghost of Sparta" was announced on May 4, 2010, on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony, Ready at Dawn utilized "state-of-the-art visual technologies" that allowed "higher quality environments and characters." "Ghost of Sparta" offers "over 25% more gameplay" than its PSP predecessor, "Chains of Olympus", while adding more enemies on screen and a greater number of boss encounters. Development of "Ghost of Sparta" took 23 months to complete. "Chains of Olympus" game director Ru Weerasuriya did not return to direct due to his busy schedule at Ready at Dawn, so Dana Jan, the lead level designer on "Chains of Olympus", became director. At Comic-Con 2010, Jan noted that when development began in 2008, the goal was to make the game "bigger" than "Chains of Olympus", which had "pushed" the PSP to its functional limits. Jan stated that "Ghost of Sparta" has taken the PSP to its "absolute capacity", with one additional feature being more on-screen foes. The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from "God of War III". The trophy revealed a site called "spartansstandtall.com"âit initially featured a simple animation of torrential rain falling into a body of water and a Spartan shield encompassed by a meter on the screen. The meter was speculated to have been filled by players achieving the trophy and reaching the site. On May 4, 2010, the meter reached maximum and the site was updated for a final time, revealing an image of Kratos standing above a reflection and the logo for "God of War: Ghost of Sparta", as the official site. On June 15, 2010, Sony displayed a cinematic trailer narrated by Linda Hunt during their 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) Press Conference.
