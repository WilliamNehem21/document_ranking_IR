The death of Abraham Lincoln only two days after Hyams related his story to Canadian authorities increased U.S. enthusiasm for capturing Blackburn to interface the death to Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his agents in Canada. The U.S. Authority of Military Justice requested Blackburn's capture for endeavored murder, yet a capture couldn't be affected in light of the fact that Blackburn was in Canada, past the Bureau's ward. The resulting revelation of the reserve of pieces of clothing and materials in Bermuda persuaded Canadian experts to act.

In October 1865, a Toronto court cleared Blackburn on grounds that the trunks of articles of clothing had been sent to Nova Scotia, which was out of the court's purview. A charge of trick to submit murder was dropped after Blackburn's lawyer reminded the court that such a charge must be made whether the denounced had made an endeavor on the life of a head of state. Blackburn did not affirm in the preliminary and possibly talked about the plot years after the fact when he condemned it as "unreasonably unbelievable for shrewd noble men to accept."
