The spores are curved to elongated, smooth, and have measurements of 7Ã¢ÂÂ 10 by 3Ã¢ÂÂ 4ÃÂ ÃÂµm. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are meager walled, club-formed to generally tube shaped, and measure 2Ã¢ÂÂ 25 by 5Ã¢ÂÂ 7ÃÂ ÃÂµm. They bear either two or four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia that are found on the substance of a gill) are generally tube shaped with adjusted finishes, slim walled, and 40Ã¢ÂÂ 55 by 5Ã¢ÂÂ 8ÃÂ ÃÂµm. The cells regularly have dark colored substance, and within the sight of 2%ÃÂ potassium hydroxide (KOH) will seem hyaline (translucent) or vinaceous (red wine-hued); in Melzer's reagent they become light yellow or darker. The cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the edge of a gill) are 30Ã¢ÂÂ 60 by 7Ã¢ÂÂ 10ÃÂ ÃÂµm, club-molded to practically tube shaped, slim walled, with darker incrusting material at the base, and masterminded like a heap of filaments. In KOH they seem hyaline, and are light yellow in Melzer's reagent. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are 60Ã¢ÂÂ 90 by 7Ã¢ÂÂ 9ÃÂ ÃÂµm, for the most part barrel shaped with adjusted closures, and orchestrated in packs with dark colored shade particles at the base. The caulocystidia recolor vinaceous in KOH. The fingernail skin of the top is made of a layer of interlaced coagulated hyphae that are independently 2Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ÃÂµm thick; the thick hyphae are in charge of the vileness of the fingernail skin. There are no brace associations in the hyphae.
