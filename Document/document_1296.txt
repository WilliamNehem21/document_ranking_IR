Liszt discovered his technique through two compositional practices, which he utilized in his symphonic lyrics. The main practice was cyclic structure, a method built up by Beethoven in which certain developments are connected as well as really reflect each other's substance. Liszt made Beethoven's training one stride further, consolidating separate developments into a solitary development cyclic structure. A large number of Liszt's develop works pursue this example, of which "Les prÃÂ©ludes" is a standout amongst the best-known models. The second practice was topical change, a sort of variety in which one subject is changed, not into a related or backup topic but rather into something new, isolated and autonomous. Topical change, as cyclic structure, was just the same old thing new in itself; it had just been utilized by Mozart and Haydn. In the last development of his Ninth Symphony, Beethoven had changed the topic of the "Tribute to Joy" into a Turkish walk. Weber and Berlioz had additionally changed subjects, and Schubert utilized topical change to tie together the developments of his "Drifter Fantasy", a work that impacted Liszt. Be that as it may, Liszt consummated the production of fundamentally longer formal structures exclusively through topical change, in the symphonic ballads as well as in different works, for example, his Second Piano Concerto and his Piano Sonata in B minor. Truth be told, when a work must be abbreviated, Liszt would in general cut areas of customary melodic improvement and save segments of topical change.
