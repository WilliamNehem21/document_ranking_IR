By means of Franklin Productions, Kay recorded the generation in six days, a typical event given that most movies of the period were shot with a speedy turnaround. Aha Productions at first circulated the film, yet it attempted to discover a group of people until Kroger Babb's Hallmark Productions obtained the rights for dispersion. Babb at first promoted the film under the title "The Story of Lila Leeds and Her ExposÃÂ© of the Marijuana Racket", yet neglected to make progress with that title and in the long run transformed it to ""She Shoulda Said 'No'!"". He pushed the erotic nature of Leeds with new special photos and another slogan: "How Bad Can a Good Girl Get... without losing her goodness or respect???", while sending letters to nearby networks dishonestly asserting that the United States Treasury Department entreated Hallmark to discharge the film "in however many towns and urban areas as would be prudent in the most limited conceivable period of time" as an open administration. The square-up misleadingly expressed that the makers wished to "openly recognize the magnificent collaboration of the Nation's opiate specialists and Government divisions, who supported in different ways the accomplishment of this generationÃ¢ÂÂ¦ . In the event that its introduction spares yet one young lady or kid from turning into a 'moron monster' Ã¢ÂÂ at that point its story has been well told."
