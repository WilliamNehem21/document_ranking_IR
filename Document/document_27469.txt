It is moderately serotinous, storing only one tenth the number of seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding "B.Â hookeriana" with which it coexists on sand dunes in scrub at Eneabba north of Perth. Even then, many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire, but instead after successive autumn rains. An experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of "Banksia attenuata" cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly immersions in water after being heated in a ring Bunsen flame to around for two minutes. Cones that had been exposed to water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time; around 40% released at threeÂ weeks, increasing steadily to almost 90% at tenÂ weeks, compared with a series of controls (which were kept dry) of which fewer than 10% of seed released. Thus, the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter (instead of dryer summer), increasing the chance of survival. After the follicle is split, the seed and separator are exposed to the elements. The wings of the woody separator are hygroscopic, and move together when wet, and spread and curl apart when dry. The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting.
