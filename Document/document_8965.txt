"New Zealand" was straddled a few times by the war vessel however was not hit. Beatty's boats kept up full speed trying to build the separation among them and the High Seas Fleet, and bit by bit moved out of range. They turned north and after that north-east to attempt to meet with the principle body of the Grand Fleet. At 5:40, they opened flame again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German heavy weapons specialists, and as they couldn't make out the British boats, they dismissed toward the north-east at 5:47. Beatty step by step turned more towards the east to enable him to cover the arrangement of the Grand Fleet in fight development and to advance of it, however he confused his move and constrained the main division to tumble off towards the east, further far from the Germans. By 6:35, Beatty was following "Unstoppable" and of the third BCS as they were guiding east-south-east, driving the Grand Fleet, and proceeding to connect with Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A couple of minutes sooner, Scheer had requested a concurrent 180ÃÂ° starboard turn and Beatty dismissed the High Seas Fleet in the fog. After twenty minutes, Scheer requested another 180ÃÂ° turn which put them on a meeting course again with the Grand Fleet, which had changed course toward the south. This enabled the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, shaping a fight line that cut over his fight line and severely harming his driving boats. Scheer requested one more 180ÃÂ° turn at 7:13 trying to remove the High Seas Fleet from the snare into which he had sent them.
