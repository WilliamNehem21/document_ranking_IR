The group of four never contended as a unit after the Moscow Olympics. Tonelli resigned following the Games, while Kerry enjoyed an all-encompassing reprieve. The backstroker endeavored a rebound in the leadup to the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, yet his shortened readiness before the determination preliminaries was insufficient and he was vanquished by different swimmers. This left Evans and Brooks as the main individuals from the 1980 group to partake in Australia's mixture hand-off triumph at the Commonwealth Games. In 1984, Kerry verified a review to the group as Australia's favored backstroker, while Brooks was outperformed by Mark Stockwell as the main freestyler. Australia came third in the 1984 Summer Olympics in the mixture hand-off as the Americans came back to the Olympic overlay; Evans and Kerry swam in the last, while Brooks did the free-form leg in the warms. Evans and Kerry resigned after the Olympics, and Brooks was not the main decision swimmer in 1986, implying that an entirely unexpected group of four contended in the mixture hand-off at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. Rivulets was suspended for plastered conduct on the trip back to Australia, and after that resigned, and each of the four individuals from the Quietly Confident Quartet had withdrawn the Australian swimming scene.
