Toward the finish of the period, Crawford played his last matches in England for a long time, showing up for an "EnglandÃÂ XI" against the Australians and for the Gentlemen of the South. He had recently talked about emigrating to Australia with the Australian Test player Victor Trumper, who had asked Clem Hill to research a potential showing post at St Peter's College, Adelaide. Initially, accepting that he would be a piece of the MCC visit to South Africa, he wanted to take up his situation in March 1910. At the point when the debate emerged, Crawford sent a message to educate the school he would take up the post of "Inhabitant Master" right off the bat in 1910, for a compensation of ÃÂ£160 every year. Consumes recommends that this learning he had the idea of work may have provoked him to stand firm against the Surrey board of trustees. In October 1910 he was offered the situation of "Common Master" at the school, and ÃÂ£50 towards his movement costs on the off chance that he withdrew right away. He left England by pontoon two days after the fact, seen off by his family. No cricket figures saw his takeoff, however there was impressive enthusiasm from the press.
