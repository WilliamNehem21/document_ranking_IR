The authority of the Japanese 17thÃÂ DivisionÃ¢ÂÂLieutenant General Yasushi SakaiÃ¢ÂÂrequested that Arawe be critically fortified when he was educated of the arrival there. He didn't trust this would be the primary Allied exertion in western New Britain, in any case. The power under Komori was requested to make scramble. The first Battalion, 141stÃÂ Infantry Regiment, positioned at Cape Bushing on the south shoreline of New Britain about east of Arawe was likewise coordinated to move via ocean to counter the Allied attack. One of this present legion's infantry organizations stayed at Cape Bushing, notwithstanding. Komori was named the administrator of every single Japanese power in the Arawe zone, which were hence assigned the Komori Force. The first Battalion, 141stÃÂ Infantry Regiment arrived at the town of Omoi the evening of 18 December, and began overland the following day to connect up with Komori at Didmop. The unit took eight days to cover the among Omoi and Didmop as it wound up lost on a few events while going through trackless wilderness and delayed at whatever point contact with American powers appeared to be likely. Komori came to Didmop on 19ÃÂ December, and assembled the units that had withdrawn from Umtingalu into his direction. Based on exchanges with staff who had seen the arrival at Arawe, Komori erroneously presumed that they had significantly overestimated the measure of the Allied power. Thus, on 20ÃÂ December he chose to dispatch a counteroffensive against the American positions.
