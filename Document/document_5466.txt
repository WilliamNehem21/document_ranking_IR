Dubious inevitably became disappointed with his job in Massive Attack, thinking that its constraining, and needed to record a collection with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another measurement to his verses and their importance. In 1993, he found Martina Topley-Bird, at that point an adolescent at Clifton College, when he saw her sitting against a divider close to his home, singing to herself. "That is actually how it occurred," she reviewed. "Half a month later, I headed over to his home with certain companions. We'd been drinking juice after our GCSEs. We were slamming into his entryway, yet he wasn't in. At that point Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and stated: 'No doubt, this is Tricky's home, bounce in through the window.'" Tricky, whose verses had developed from raps about road savagery and sex to progressively close to home and contemplative composition, said Topley-Bird discovered his tunes "very discouraging", which he accepted was a result of her increasingly favored foundation: "It's simply reality. She's been an understudy for her entire life, experienced childhood in Somerset, and I don't believe she's at any point confronted this present reality. She thinks that its every one of the somewhat abnormal. Be that as it may, she's my best mate." They shaped a melodic and sentimental organization over ensuing years, and their first chronicle together, "Outcome", later showed up on "Maxinquaye". Subsequent to offering the melody to Massive Attack, who were not keen on including it on their 1991 collection "Blue Lines", Tricky discharged "Outcome" autonomously to neighborhood record stores in September 1993 preceding he marked a record manage fourth and B'way.
