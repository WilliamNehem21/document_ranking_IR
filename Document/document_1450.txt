Right hand state lawyer general Tom Brunker contended against leniency, expressing: "Mr. Gardner was condemned to death and earned that capital punishment on account of his unflagging history of fierce wrongdoing." The group of the late George "Scratch" Kirk related how his being shot by Gardner influenced their lives and at last abbreviated Kirk's life. Kirk's little girl Barb Webb stated, "He's completed a ton of horrendous things from quite a while ago and I think, given the opportunity, he would do them all once more." Jason Otterstrom, whose father Melvyn was killed by Gardner, attempted to depict the effect upon his family. In the wake of tuning in to the declaration from the groups of the people in question, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole declined Gardner's recompense demand, expressing that the jury's decision and sentence were "not unseemly." The board individuals refered to his rough record amid detainment and scrutinized his push to change as being "short of what was needed." Gardner uncovered at the consultation that it was Darcy Perry McCoy who furnished him the weapon with which he killed Michael Burdell. Agent Salt Lake County lawyer Bob Stott said that McCoy would not be arraigned in light of the fact that Gardner, the main observer, would have been executed.
