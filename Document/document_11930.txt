The line started on the east side of downtown Cincinnati, at the edge of Eggleston Avenue and Court Street. The site of the block cargo station, shut in 1969 and wrecked in 1975, is presently possessed by Greyhound Lines, which utilizes it as an intercity transport terminal. A track worked in 1887 crossed Court Street, associating with the Little Miami Railroad's Eggleston Avenue Connection for cargo exchange. The line started by climbing the Deer Creek Valley, the main plausible rail access to downtown Cincinnati that did not pursue a stream valley. At the point when the railroad was worked in the late 1870s, the valley was utilized by the city as a dump. A 1852 city statute accommodated raising the ground level, start with the raising of Court Street by as much as . To pursue the possible surface dimension and keep away from the lofty slopes, the railroad was based on trestles for quite a bit of its climb, with a most extreme level of 3.5%. In the wake of leaving the terminal, the line navigated a S-formed trestle toward the east side of the valley, before intersection Elsinore Place and Eden Park Drive at level, with a second trestle between these boulevards. (The previous was supplanted in January 1889 with a straighter single-track trestle.) An extension took the line over Florence Avenue, and it at that point went through the area of Mount Auburn before going under the summit through the cut-and-spread Oak Street Tunnel north of McMillan Street. The line began its continuous plunge as it left the passage, for the most part following the current ground level and intersection roads at level.
