Mary and Percy started meeting each other furtively at Mary Wollstonecraft's grave in St Pancras Churchyard, and they began to look all starry eyed atÃ¢ÂÂshe was about 17, he almost 22. On 26 June 1814, Shelley and Godwin pronounced their adoration for each other as Shelley reported he couldn't conceal his "fervent enthusiasm", driving her in a "heavenly and euphoric minute" to state she felt a similar way; on either that day or the following, Godwin lost her virginity to Shelley, which custom cases occurred in the graveyard. Godwin depicted herself as pulled in to Shelley's "wild, learned, ridiculous looks". Regrettably, her dad objected, and attempted to ruin the relationship and rescue the "unblemished distinction" of his little girl. At about a similar time, Mary's dad educated of Shelley's failure to satisfy the dad's obligations. Mary, who later composed of "my inordinate and sentimental connection to my dad", was confounded. She saw Percy Shelley as an epitome of her folks' liberal and reformist thoughts of the 1790s, especially Godwin's view that marriage was a harsh restraining infrastructure, which he had contended in his 1793 version of "Political Justice" however since withdrew. On 28 July 1814, the couple absconded and subtly left for France, taking Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, with them, yet deserting Percy's pregnant spouse.
