Wainwright watched while driving in his vehicle that "it [would] be entertaining to re-try this as a tune cycle". Before long a short time later, he took the plan to New York-based dramatic maker Jared Geller (who might later co-produce the tribute show with David Foster), wanting to transform a fantasy into a reality. Geller at first idea the thought was "crazy", however he and Wainwright kept talking about alternatives. In the long run, Geller consented to help with the generation and the two discovered space in Wainwright's timetable to book Carnegie Hall a year ahead of time. When the scene was reserved, arranging components, for example, lighting, receiver area and intensification were talked about. Stephen Oremus marked on as the director of the 36-piece ensemble and Phil Ramone assumed responsibility for the account. Practices started in April 2006, and keeping in mind that it would have been simpler to rehearse in practice rooms, expansive venues, for example, the Lynch at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Museum of Jewish Heritage were used on the grounds that "Rufus needed a vibe for playing out this material on a phase". Because of budgetary limitations, full ensemble practices occurred just two days before the show and the day of every execution (practice with littler gatherings of instruments started a couple of months before the shows).
