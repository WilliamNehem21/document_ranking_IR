The difference between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers can be described as one of quantifying versus categorizing: in other words, mass-classifiers "create" a unit by which to measure something (i.e. boxes, groups, chunks, pieces, etc.), whereas count-classifiers simply "name" an existing item. Most words can appear with both count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; for example, pizza can be described as both ("yÃ¬ bÇsÃ ", "one pizza", literally "one of pizza"), using a count-classifier, and as ("yÃ­ bÇsÃ ", "one of pizza"), using a mass-classifier. In addition to these semantic differences, there are differences in the grammatical behaviors of count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; for example, mass-classifiers may be modified by a small set of adjectives (as in Â "yÃ­ dÃ  rÃ©n", "a big of people"), whereas count-classifiers usually may not (for example, *Â "yÃ­ dÃ  rÃ©n" is never said for "a big person"; instead the adjective must modify the noun: Â "yÃ­ dÃ  rÃ©n"). Another difference is that count-classifiers may often be replaced by a "general" classifier (), "gÃ¨" with no apparent change in meaning, whereas mass-classifiers may not. Syntacticians Lisa Cheng and Rint Sybesma propose that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers have different underlying syntactic structures, with count-classifiers forming "classifier phrases", and mass-classifiers being a sort of relative clause that only "looks" like a classifier phrase. The distinction between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers is often unclear, however, and other linguists have suggested that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers may not be fundamentally different. They posit that "count-classifier" and "mass-classifier" are the extremes of a continuum, with most classifiers falling somewhere in between.
