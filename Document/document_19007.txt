Hull, Falkson and Lydekker spent the night of 26/27 May 1940 patrolling the area around Rognan, about inland from BodÃ¸. After driving German bombers away from British and Norwegian forces fighting at Pothus south of Rognan, the Gladiators strafed German ground forces. Around 08:00 on 27 May, BodÃ¸ was attacked by 11 JuÂ 87 "Stuka" dive bombers from I./"SturzkampfgeschwaderÂ 1" (StG 1âDive Bomber Wing 1) and three Messerschmitt BfÂ 110 fighters attached to I./"ZerstÃ¶rergeschwader 76" (ZG 76âDestroyer Wing 76). Lydekker claimed one of the Stukas, but was ultimately forced to limp north to Bardufoss to land, his Gladiator heavily damaged. Having initially been caught on the ground by the German attack, Hull got his fighter airborne during a pause in the raid. After engaging the German aircraft and shooting down "Feldwebel" Kurt Zube's Stuka, which fell into the sea, Hull was overcome by one of the BfÂ 110s, piloted by "Oberleutnant" Helmut Lent, and forced to crash near the BodÃ¸ airfield. Wounded in the head and the knee, he was initially treated at BodÃ¸ Hospital before being evacuated back to Britain for further treatment on a Sunderland flying boat via Harstad. Hull's kills during the Norwegian Campaign made him the RAF's first Gloster Gladiator ace, as well as the most successful RAF fighter pilot of the campaign. On 17 June, while convalescing, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions in Norway.
