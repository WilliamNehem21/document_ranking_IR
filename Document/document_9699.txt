The diversion is noted for its basic battle framework that would "baffle those hankering sheer mechanical profundity", as expressed by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. The amusement's riddle configuration has been applauded for making a compensating knowledge for players who work through difficulties all alone; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for instance, said that "you unobtrusively, coherently, eagerly continue, and the deception is flawless: the diversion never guides you, despite the fact that the amusement is continually instructing you". "Ico" is likewise viewed as a short diversion, taking somewhere in the range of seven and ten hours for a solitary play through, which Game Revolution calls "horrendously short" with "no replay outside of deliberate difficulties". G4TV's Matthew Keil, notwithstanding, felt that "the diversion is so solid, many will complete 'Ico' in a couple of sittings". The absence of highlights in the North American discharge, which would wind up opened on resulting playthroughs in the wake of finishing the amusement, was said to diminish the replay estimation of the title. "Electronic Gaming Monthly" takes note of that "Yorda would presumably be the most exceedingly terrible friend - she's empty-headed and vulnerable; notwithstanding the way that the player builds up a bond with her, making the amusement's completion all the all the more deplorable."
