The score for the "Dull Angel" pilot was made and led by Joel McNeely. The pilot score track "Bike Ride" was utilized at last credits for the span of the arrangement. The pilot score was discharged in full as a component of the first exposure press pack, titled "Dull Angel: Complete Score from the Dark Angel Pilot". The 37-track CD was for limited time utilize just and not for resale. McNeely came back to score the whole arrangement, utilizing "protesting timpani moves, bass rhythms and ear-splitting metal and violin crescendos that recognizably sketch the activity circular segments of the account." Traditional symphonic components are incorporated with inventive electronic sounds and female vocals to make a feeling of Max's "supernatural quality", "frequenting wind rings, pseudo-Orientalist abstains and palliated shrill scary sounds" bring out Max's super-human capacities, and "driving hip bounce bass beats with substantial percussive impacts [and] sharp input and resonation" pass on Max's battles with savagery and her recollections of Manticore. The signature tune for the arrangement was made by Chuck D and Gary G-Wiz. Both McNeely and G-Wiz refered to "Dim Angel" as a chance to push sonic limits; G-Wiz expressed that Eglee and music boss Randy Gerston continued calling him and guiding him to make the signature tune "crazier". McNeely said scoring the arrangement was "like the contrast among jazz and traditional music. I'm a jazz player, so "Dull Angel" is as free structure and as peculiar as we need to get."
