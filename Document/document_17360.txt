The music of the "Mana" series, especially "Secret of Mana", has received wide acclaim and fan enthusiasm. The "Secret of Mana" soundtrack was one of the first official soundtracks of video games music released in the United States and thus before fully mainstream interest in RPGs. The "Secret of Mana"s opening theme, "Angel's Fear", was rated at number 7 on IGN's Top Ten RPG Title tracks, calling it a "magical title song that captures our hearts". It was also featured in the third Orchestral Game Concert. "Secret of Mana" is also the number 6 most remixed soundtrack on the popular video game music site OverClocked ReMix, with "Seiken Densetsu 3" tied at 18. The music of the other titles have also been well received. RPGFan called the music to "Final Fantasy Adventure" "addictive", despite its low, MIDI-like quality. GameSpy called "Children of Mana"s music some of the best Nintendo DS music yet and referred to it as "beautiful". "Game Informer" complimented "Dawn of Mana"s music, calling it good. IGN referred to "Legend of Mana"s music as "beautiful" and stated the background music brought "intensity", "suspense", and "subtle nuance" to the game. Other reviewers echoed similar praise with GameSpot calling it "excellently orchestrated" and RPGFan calling the music one of the game's good points.
