No changes were made to command arrangements in the South West Pacific following this episode, and Hewitt continued to lead No.Â 9 OG in its bombing and strafing campaign against Japanese airfields and lines of communication in New Britain, north-east of New Guinea. By mid-June 1943, he had set up Group Headquarters at Milne Bay, and No.Â 73 Wing HQ at Goodenough Island. On 22Â July, he mounted an operation against Gasmata airfield using 62Â aircraft from five of his squadrons, the largest strike undertaken by the Australians to that date. No.Â 9 OG would take most of the credit for the RAAF reaching a peak of 254Â tons of bombs dropped in October, as against 137Â tons delivered the previous month. On 8Â November, Hewitt sent out a formation of three Bristol Beauforts in a severe electrical storm to attack the heavily defended harbour at Rabaul. This was conceived as a "make or break" effort to prove the worth or otherwise of the Beaufort as a torpedo bomber, in which role it had so far been a disappointment; in what the official history of the RAAF in World War II described as "an heroic attack", at least one enemy tanker was struck, for the loss of one Beaufort.
