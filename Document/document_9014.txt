Including an aggregate of eight processors the Saturn's principle focal preparing units are two Hitachi SH-2 chip timed at 28.6ÃÂ MHz and fit for 56 MIPS. The framework contains a Motorola 68EC000 running at 11.3ÃÂ MHz as a sound controller, a custom sound processor with a coordinated Yamaha FH1 DSP running at 22.6ÃÂ MHz fit for up to 32 sound channels with both FM amalgamation and 16-bit PCM testing at a most extreme rate of 44.1ÃÂ kHz, and two video show processors, the VDP1 (which handles sprites, surfaces and polygons) and the VDP2 (which handles foundations). Its twofold speed CD-ROM drive is constrained by a committed Hitachi SH-1 processor to diminish load times. The Saturn's System Control Unit (SCU), which controls all transports and capacities as a co-processor of the fundamental SH-2 CPU, has an inside DSP running at 14.3ÃÂ MHz. The Saturn contains a cartridge space for memory development, 16 Mbit of work irregular access memory (RAM), 12 Mbit of video RAM, 4 Mbit of RAM for sound capacities, 4 Mbit of CD cushion RAM and 256 Kbit (32 KB) of battery reinforcement RAM. Its video yield, given by a stereo AV link, shows at goals from 320ÃÂ224 to 704ÃÂ224 pixels, and is equipped for showing up to 16.77 million hues all the while. Physically, the Saturn measures . The Saturn was sold bundled with a guidance manual, one control cushion, a stereo AV link, and its 100V AC control supply, with a power utilization of roughly 15W.
