In 1936, Wheeler left on a visit to the Near East, cruising from Marseilles to Port Said, where he visited the Old Kingdom tombs of Sakkara. From that point he went through Sinai to Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria. Amid this excursion, he visited different archeological activities, yet was terrified by the nature of their unearthings; specifically, he noticed that the American-run exhuming at Tel Megiddo was embracing principles that had been dismissed in Britain a quarter century beforehand. He was away for about a month and a half, and upon his arrival to Europe found that his significant other Tessa had kicked the bucket of a pneumonic embolism after a minor task on her toe. As indicated by Tessa's biographer, for Wheeler this disclosure was "the pinnacle of mental hopelessness, and denoted the finish of his capacity to feel a particular sort of affection". That winter, his dad additionally kicked the bucket. By the mid year of 1937, he had left on another sentiment, with a young lady named Mavis de Vere Cole, widow of Horace de Vere Cole, who had initially met Wheeler when visiting the Maiden Castle unearthings with her then-sweetheart, the painter Augustus John. After she in the end consented to his rehashed solicitations for marriage, the two were married from the get-go in 1939 out of a service held at Caxton Hall, with a gathering at Shelley House. They continued on a wedding trip to the Middle East.
