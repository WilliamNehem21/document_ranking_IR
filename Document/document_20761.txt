Although the evidence in Gibraltar failed to support Flood's theories of murder and conspiracy, the suspicion of foul play lingered. Insurance fraud on the part of Winchester was briefly suspected, on the grounds of newspaper reports that "Mary Celeste" had been heavily over-insured. Winchester was able to refute these allegations, and no inquiry was instituted by the insurance companies that issued the policies. In 1931 an article in the "Quarterly Review" suggested that Morehouse could have lain in wait for "Mary Celeste", then lured Briggs and his crew aboard "Dei Gratia" and killed them there. Paul Begg, in his account of the mystery, comments that this theory ignores undisputed facts: "Dei Gratia" left New York eight days after "Mary Celeste", was a slower ship, and would not have caught "Mary Celeste" before the latter reached Gibraltar. Another theory posits that Briggs and Morehouse were partners in a conspiracy to share the salvage proceedings. The unsubstantiated friendship between the two captains has been cited by commentators as making such a plan a plausible explanation. Hicks comments that, "If Morehouse and Briggs had been planning such a scam, they would not have devised such an attention-drawing mystery," and also asks why, if Briggs intended to disappear permanently, he left his son Arthur behind.
