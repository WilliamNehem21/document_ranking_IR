Les Jackson took over order of No.ÃÂ 75 Squadron the day after his sibling was killed. Despite the fact that the squadron was never again a compelling battling unit, it had checked Japan's endeavors to overwhelm Port Moresby via air assault, and the town kept on working as an essential Allied base. John Jackson was made due by his better half and kids, and entombed in Moresby's Bomana War Cemetery. His domain was sworn for probate at an estimation of ÃÂ£29,780 ($1,870,800 in 2011). His name shows up on board 104 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial (AWM), Canberra. Jackson was a sharp novice movie producer, and a four-minute reel of 16ÃÂ mm film that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM. Moresby's Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson's Strip in his respect; it later progressed toward becoming Jacksons International Airport. In a 1989 meeting, individual No.ÃÂ 75 Squadron part Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker remarked, "I would state that had JohnÃÂ F. Jackson not existed, the squadron would not have been successful in that resistance job for whatever length of time that it wasÃÂ ... So the entire soul of JohnÃÂ F's initiative, and I guess his last penance, was what made 75 Squadron." In March 2003, the St George township raised a landmark to Jackson and another nearby RAAF personality, Aboriginal military pilot Len Waters.
