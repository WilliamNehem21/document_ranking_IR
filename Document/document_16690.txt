The full JWP reports were published in January 2016. The JWP recognised the discovery of element 113, assigning priority to Riken. They noted that while the individual decay energies of each nuclide in the decay chain of 113 were inconsistent, their sum was now confirmed to be consistent, strongly suggesting that the initial and final states in 113 and its daughter Db were the same for all three events. The decay of Db to Lr and Md was previously known, firmly anchoring the decay chain of 113 to known regions of the chart of nuclides. The JWP considered that the JINRâLLNL collaborations of 2004 and 2007, producing element 113 as the daughter of element 115, did not meet the discovery criteria as they had not convincingly determined the atomic numbers of their nuclides through cross-bombardments, which were considered necessary since their decay chains were not anchored to previously known nuclides. They also considered that the previous JWP's concerns over their chemical identification of the dubnium daughter had not been adequately addressed. The JWP recognised the JINRâLLNLâORNLâVanderbilt collaboration of 2010 as having discovered elements 117 and 115, and accepted that element 113 had been produced as their daughter, but did not give this work shared credit.
