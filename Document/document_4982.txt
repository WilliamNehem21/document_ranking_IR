At the point when Hayes seemed to have lost the presidential decision the next month to Democrat Samuel Tilden, the Republicans propelled endeavors to invert the outcome in Southern states where they held the governorship: South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida. On the off chance that Hayes won each of the three states, he would take the race by a solitary appointive vote. Concede requested that Garfield fill in as an "unbiased onlooker" in the describe in Louisiana. The onlookers before long prescribed to the state constituent commissions that Hayes be announced the victorÃ¢ÂÂGarfield suggested that the whole vote of West Feliciana Parish, which had given Tilden a sizable larger part, be tossed out. The Republican governors of the three states guaranteed that Hayes had won their states, to the shock of Democrats, who had the state lawmaking bodies submit rival returns, and took steps to keep the checking of the constituent voteÃ¢ÂÂunder the Constitution, Congress is the last referee of the race. Congress at that point passed a bill building up the Electoral Commission, to decide the victor. Despite the fact that he restricted the Commission, feeling that Congress should check the vote and announce Hayes triumphant, Garfield was designated to it over the complaints of Democrats that he was excessively divided. Hayes developed the victor by a Commission vote of 8 to 7, with each of the eight votes being thrown by Republican government officials or representatives of that gathering to the Supreme Court. As a component of the arrangement whereby they perceived Hayes as president, Southern Democrats verified the expulsion of government troops from the South, finishing Reconstruction.
