In spite of the fact that Gervase Holles recorded numerous sixteenth century landmarks when he visited Sleaford, most have vanished. Among those which remain are the tombs and plaques remembering the principal individuals from the Carre family to settle in Sleaford. The Carres hailed from Northumberland, yet George Carre (d. 1521), a fleece shipper, set up himself in the town and is celebrated in St Denys' by a metal. On the northern side of the chancel is an alabaster landmark devoted to George's oldest enduring child Robert Carre (d. 1590), his three spouses and a portion of their youngsters; he progressed toward becoming master of the estates of Old and New Sleaford. Inverse, on the southern side, is an alabaster special raised area tomb by Maximilian Colt committed to Robert's fourth child and possible beneficiary, Sir Edward Carre, first Baronet (d. 1618), which conveys the likenesses of Edward and one of his two spouses, most likely his second, Anne Dyer; as indicated by Trollope, it was "said to have been disfigured amid the Civil War". Further plaques celebrate Sir Edward Carre's grandson, Sir Robert Carre, third Baronet (d. 1682), and his child, Sir Edward (d. 1683), who is additionally remembered by a bust in the congregation.
