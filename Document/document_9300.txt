The makers attempted to cast Jessie Bannon. Diminish Lawrence at last picked Jesse Douglas, who he felt mirrored Jessie's vitality and knowledgeÃ¢ÂÂ"[Jesse Douglas] has huge vitality, immense vitality, and is the sort of lady who could do all the sort of things Jessie could doÃ¢ÂÂyou know, athletic, savvy, so, etc "[sic]"." Douglas awed Lawrence with her dynamic way of life, including artful dance, equestrianism, and tennis. At the point when gotten some information about the character's incorporation, Douglas expressed, "I'd be mooched on the off chance that I upset anyone. Jessie is truly cool. It isn't care for she is a young lady who is crying constantly. On the off chance that anything, she is a great springboard for the remainder of the storyline." Roth bolstered her, asserting that "Jonny hasn't found young ladies yet when he does Jessie would be the kind of young lady he'd like to be with...I think something will occur between them however right now Jess is his closest companion." H-B Chief Fred Seibert concurred, implying that as grown-ups "there may be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." Turner moved toward George Segal to try out for the piece of Dr. Mission. Segal depicted the show as having "a genuine family feeling about it... I'd never observed this stuff. That was very amazing."
