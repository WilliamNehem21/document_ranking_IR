Petter's big-footed mouse is a terrestrial rodent with short forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150Â mm (5.9Â in) and body mass of 105Â g (3.7Â oz) in the only known complete specimen, it is much larger than "M.Â bastardi", and its measurements fall at or above the upper end of the known range of variation in "M.Â ingens". The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8Â mm (0.2 to 0.3Â in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9Â mm (0.3 to 0.4Â in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60Â mm (2.4Â in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32Â mm (1.3Â in).
