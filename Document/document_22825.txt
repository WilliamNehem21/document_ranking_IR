On October 6, 2012, Amaker was inducted into his high school's inaugural hall of fame class. Amaker's 2012â13 Harvard team entered the season affected by the 2012 Harvard cheating scandal. Instead of being the favorite as originally expected, the team was predicted to finish second to Princeton by various media sources because Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew due to the scandal. Casey and Curry had been first-team and second-team All-Ivy selections for the 2011â12 Ivy League men's basketball season, respectively. Both players withdrew in hopes of preserving their final year of athletic eligibility following the investigation. During the season, the team defeated Boston College its fifth consecutive victory against Boston College Eagles men's basketball, making Amaker a perfect 6â0 against the Atlantic Coast Conference. The 2012â13 Harvard team overcame the withdrawal of its senior co-captains to repeat as 2013 Ivy League champions, which earned Harvard a trip to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. On March 21, 14th-seeded Harvard earned the school's first NCAA Tournament victory by a 68â62 margin and its first victory over a top 10 opponent when it defeated 3rd-seeded New Mexico (#10 AP Poll â #10 Coaches' Poll). Two nights later, Harvard lost to Arizona 74â51. Following the season, Amaker was inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2013. Amaker won the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (NSSA) Clarence "Big House" Gaines College Basketball Coach of the Year in Division I as the top minority coach, the NABC Coach of the Year for District 13 and was again a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award. In August, Amaker was inducted into his fourth Hall of Fame (Washington Metro Basketball Hall of Fame).
