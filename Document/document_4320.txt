On 1 July, an Italian heavily clad unit touched base in Gacko to fortify the battalion. A UstaÃÂ¡e activity to clear the agitators from the Stolac area started on 3 July, meeting with progress and opening of the street from Berkovci north to OdÃÂ¾ak. The UstaÃÂ¡e did not go nearer to Nevesinje as they were not in uniform, and were worried that the Home Guards would confuse them with radicals. Amid this activity, three UstaÃÂ¡e were slaughtered, including their authority, and the UstaÃÂ¡e warriors murdered ten revolutionaries and caught two. In the possessions of one of the caught agitators, the UstaÃÂ¡e found a report by the "National Movement for the Liberation of Nevesinje" (), which was clearly how the dissidents alluded to themselves. The report clarified that the renegades were utilizing military strategies and association, and indicated co-task with the Italians. As indicated by data assembled by the police, the neighborhood rebel authority included previous Mostar vendor ÃÂedo MiliÃÂ, the BjelogrliÃÂ siblings from Avtovac, the Orthodox cleric Father MastiloviÃÂ from NadiniÃÂi, and a Captain RadoviÃÂ from Avtovac. Montenegrins associated with the authority of the uprising included Colonel Bajo StaniÃÂ¡iÃÂ, Major Minja ViÃÂ¡njiÃÂ, and Radojica NikÃÂeviÃÂ from NikÃÂ¡iÃÂ.
