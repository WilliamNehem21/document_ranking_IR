When war was pronounced in late April 1898, Mr. Dooley had directed his position, regardless of whether the "Diary" had not. On April 16, Dunne had Dooley paint a ridiculing representation of Fitzhugh Lee, the U.S. emissary in Havana whose hostile reports were powering the drive to war, in a segment printed while the "Diary's" publication page was lauding Lee. However, the genuine leap forward was after the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1. That a fight had occurred was referred to, however as the American officer, Admiral George Dewey, was accepted to have separated the link lines, no word went to the United States, and the country held up in anticipation, dreading rout. At that point, news that Dewey had annihilated the run down Spanish armada arrived, however the subtleties, and the destiny of Dewey and his boats and men, were obscure. Before word originated from Dewey that he had not lost a ship or man showed up the May 7 Mr. Dooley piece, "On His Cousin George", that is the naval commander, for "Dewey or Dooley, 'tis all th' same". Dooley anticipated that "he'll think of home and state he has the islands; and he'll turn them over to the administration and return to his ship, and Mark Hanna'll sort out the Philippine Islands Jute and Cider Company, and the revolutionists'll wish they hadn't. That is what'll occur. Imprint my assertion."
