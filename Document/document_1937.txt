After the April 10, 1967, recording session, the Experience went through the following two weeks playing shows and going to limited time appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC TV program "Monday" and BBC2's "Late Night Line-Up". Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer finished the last blending of "Are You Experienced" at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had consented to try out the completed LP for Polydor's head of A&R, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so following a couple of long periods of rest he arranged a reasonable vinyl demo and ventured out to Polydor. Chandler reviewed: "As Horst began to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a virus sweat, thinkingÃÂ ... when he hears this present, he's going to arrange the men in white coats to take me awayÃÂ ... Horst played the main side through and didn't let out the slightest peep. At that point he turned the circle over and played the opposite side. I began pondering how I was going to work out of this. Toward the second's end side, he just sat there. At long last, he stated, 'This is splendid. This is the best thing I've at any point heard.'" Horst promptly turned into a fervent supporter of the collection and the band, advocating the showcasing and conveyance of their introduction LP.
