Gondwanatheres are a small group of mammals of uncertain phylogenetic affinities known from the late Cretaceous to the Eocene (~56â34 mya) of the Gondwanan continents, known only from teeth and a few lower jaws. Upon their discovery in the 1980s, gondwanatheres were initially thought to be xenarthransâpart of the same group as living sloths, armadillos, and anteatersâbut later workers have favored affinities with multituberculates (a diverse group of fossil mammals) or left the relationships of the gondwanatheres open. The group comprises two families. The family Ferugliotheriidae, whose members had low-crowned teeth, occurs in the Campanian (~84â71 mya) to Maastrichtian of Argentina. All other gondwanatheres, including "Lavanify", are placed in the Sudamericidae, which have high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth. These include "Gondwanatherium" from the Campanian and Maastrichtian of Argentina; "Sudamerica" from the Paleocene (~66â56 mya) of Argentina; "Lavanify"; at least one species from the Maastrichtian of India; an unnamed species related to "Sudamerica" from the Eocene of Antarctica; and an unnamed possible gondwanathere, TNM 02067, from the Cretaceous of Tanzania. In 2007, teams led by G.P. Wilson and G.V.R. Prasad independently described this animal as "Dakshina" and "Bharattherium" respectively; as the latter name was published first, it is the correct name for this genus according to the Principle of Priority. Gondwanatheres have been interpreted as feeding on roots, bark, and abrasive vegetation or as the earliest grass-eating mammals.
