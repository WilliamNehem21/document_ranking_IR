McDonagh noticed that two explicitly charged flashbacks are vital to comprehension "Tenebrae". These particular yet unequivocally related memory sections are presented over and over all through the film, normally quickly following a homicide grouping. In spite of the fact that the flashbacks are never completely clarified, the primary uncovers an excellent young lady's sexual embarrassment (however oral assault) of a high school kid, dared to be Peter Neal. The young lady is for the most part topless amid this first succession, and she mortifies the young fellow by sticking the impact point of one of her sparkly red shoes into his mouth while he is held somewhere near a gathering of joyous young men on a pale-white shoreline. The second flashback demonstrates the horrible vengeance murder of the lady some time later. McDonagh takes note of that the majority of the fetishistic symbolism of these flashbacks, joined with the perverted subtleties of the homicide successions in the primary account, "set the parameters of "Tenebrae"s fetishistic and fetishicized visual vocabulary, framed in wording both ceremonial and orgiastically out of controlÃÂ ... Dwindle Neal enjoys sins of the fragile living creature and "Tenebrae" delights in them, welcoming the observer to participate; indeed, it sets out the watcher not to do as such."
