In the pre-winter of 1942, JevÃÂeviÃÂ adopted a profoundly unexpected strategy in comparison to other Chetnik pioneers and talked for teaming up with the Muslims to shape Muslim Chetnik units in the battle against the UstaÃÂ¡e and the Partisans. He supported such resistance in regions where the Muslims were ensured by the Germans, and thought of it as a strategic need while focusing on that "there can be no obvious solidarity with them". In late September or early October 1942, JevÃÂeviÃÂ and Chetnik authority Petar BaÃÂoviÃÂ held converses with Muslim pioneer Ismet Popovac and consented to frame a Muslim Chetnik association. JevÃÂeviÃÂ then encouraged the Italian military to involve all of Bosnia and Herzegovina so as to end UstaÃÂ¡e rule and guaranteed the help of 80 percent of the populace, comprising of Serbs and Muslims. In the meantime, he mentioned that the Germans concede self-rule to Bosnia and Herzegovina until the finish of the war, refering to that the Muslims were "tried companions of the Germans both in the prior and in the present period". Despite the fact that JevÃÂeviÃÂ endeavored to enlist Muslims while utilizing the Bosnian want for self-governance to help his partnership with the possessing Axis powers, nothing created from these solicitations.
