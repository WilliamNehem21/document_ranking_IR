An early difficulty was the implementation of texture mapping. Neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with the concept on an Apple II computer in the late 1980s, but he believed that the more powerful IBM PCs of the time might be able to process it. He contacted Lerner Research programmer Chris Greenâan acquaintance from his past work with Ned Lernerâwho created a working algorithm. Using the "Space Rogue" engine, Green's algorithm, assembly code from Lerner Research's "Car and Driver" and original programming, the Blue Sky team completed a prototype of "Underworld" after roughly a month of work. Neurath described the prototype as "fast, smooth, and [featuring] true texture mapped walls, though the ceiling and floor were flat shaded and the corridors and rooms were all 10' [3.0 m] highâit looked a lot like "Wolfenstein-3D" in fact." The team demonstrated it at the June 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and impressed Origin Systems. Origin producer Warren Spector later said, "I remember Paul showing me that demo ... at CES and being totally floored by it. None of us had ever seen anything like it." The two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer, and Origin suggested that the game be reworked to fit into the "Ultima" universe. The team agreed, and the game was renamed "Ultima Underworld". While Spector had hoped to produce the game, he was not assigned to the role; and he later said that he "sort of watched [the other producer] jealously from the sidelines."
