Zinta has been the subject of a few debates. In 2003, as an observer in the Bharat Shah case, she affirmed against the Indian mafia. Bharat Shah, the financer of one of her movies, "Chori Chupke", was captured in 2000 for having associations with Chhota Shakeel, a Mumbai black market supervisor. In contrast to a few of her partners, Zinta rehashed in court her before proclamation that she had gotten blackmail dangers from the mafia amid the shooting of the film. After her declaration, she was given observer assurance and was compelled to avoid the open eye for two months. Thirteen different observers before her, including big names Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were observers for the situation yet later withdrawn their before articulations. Zinta was the main observer who did not end up antagonistic to the indictment; the country reacted decidedly to her activities. Subsequently, she was the main beneficiary of Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award at the yearly Red and White Bravery Awards, given to her for the "gutsy demonstration" of remaining against the Mumbai Underworld. On accepting the honor, she stated, "To be bold isn't to be valiant. It is the point at which you dread and you get over it, at that point you can be called valiant. I am human. It isn't that I dread nothing. Be that as it may, getting over a dread is a ceaseless procedure and I have been fruitful up until this point." Since 2006, Zinta has been the brand diplomat for the Godfrey Phillips Bravery grants.
