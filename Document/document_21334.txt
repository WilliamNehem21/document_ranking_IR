"Amanita bisporigera" is considered the most toxic North American "Amanita" mushroom, with little variation in toxin content between different fruit bodies. Three subtypes of amatoxin have been described: Î±-, Î², and Î³-amanitin. The principal amatoxin, Î±-amanitin, is readily absorbed across the intestine, and 60% of the absorbed toxin is excreted into bile and undergoes enterohepatic circulation; the kidneys clear the remaining 40%. The toxin inhibits the enzyme RNA polymerase II, thereby interfering with DNA transcription, which suppresses RNA production and protein synthesis. This causes cellular necrosis, especially in cells which are initially exposed and have rapid rates of protein synthesis. This process results in severe acute liver dysfunction and, ultimately, liver failure. Amatoxins are not broken down by boiling, freezing, or drying. Roughly 0.2 to 0.4Â milligrams of Î±-amanitin is present in 1Â gram of "A.Â bisporigera"; the lethal dose in humans is less than 0.1Â mg/kg body weight. One mature fruit body can contain 10â12Â mg of Î±-amanitin, enough for a lethal dose. The Î±-amanitin concentration in the spores is about 17% that of the fruit body tissues. "A.Â bisporigera" also contains the phallotoxin phallacidin, structurally related to the amatoxins but considered less poisonous because of poor absorption. Poisonings (from similar white amanitas) have also been reported in domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and cows.
