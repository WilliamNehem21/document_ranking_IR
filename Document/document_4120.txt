The many-sided subtleties of Imlay's business dealings are spread out unmistakably by NystrÃÂ¶m. On 1794, Peder Ellefsen, who had a place with a rich and powerful Norwegian family, purchased a ship called the "Freedom" from operators of Imlay in Le Havre, France. It would later turn out to be certain that Ellefsen never claimed the ship yet rather occupied with a genius forma deal in the interest of Imlay. He renamed the ship the "Maria and Margaretha" (probably after Mary and her house keeper Marguerite) and had the Danish Consulate in Le Havre confirm it with the goal that the ship could go through the British bar of France (Imlay was a barricade sprinter). Conveying silver and gold Bourbon plate, the ship cruised from France under a Danish banner and landed at Copenhagen on 1794. In spite of the fact that Ellefsen evidently requested the ship to proceed to Gothenburg, it never achieved its goal. Imlay occupied with a few unproductive endeavors to find the ship and its important freight and after that dispatched Wollstonecraft to arrange a concurrence with Ellefsen, who had thusly been captured for taking the ship and its substance. Wollstonecraft's prosperity or disappointment in the dealings is obscure just like a definitive destiny of the ship and its fortune.
