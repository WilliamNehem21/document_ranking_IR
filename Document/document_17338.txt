There is no reliable evidence of Eta Carinae being observed or recorded before the 17thÂ century, although Dutch navigator Pieter Keyser described a fourth-magnitude star at approximately the correct position around 1595â1596, which was copied onto the celestial globes of Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and the 1603 "Uranometria" of Johann Bayer. Frederick de Houtman's independent star catalogue from 1603 does not include Eta Carinae among the other 4thÂ magnitude stars in the region. The earliest firm record was made by Edmond Halley in 1677 when he recorded the star simply as "Sequens" (i.e. "following" relative to another star) within a new constellation Robur Carolinum. His "Catalogus Stellarum Australium" was published in 1679. The star was also known by the Bayer designations Eta Roboris Caroli, Eta Argus or Eta Navis. In 1751 Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave the stars of Argo Navis and Robur Carolinum a single set of Greek letter Bayer designations within his constellation Argo, and designated three areas within Argo for the purposes of using Latin letter designations three times over. Eta fell within the keel portion of the ship which was later to become the constellation Carina. It was not generally known as Eta Carinae until 1879, when the stars of Argo Navis were finally given the epithets of the daughter constellations in the "Uranometria Argentina" of Gould.
