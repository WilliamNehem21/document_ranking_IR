In 1875 the director of the Royalty Theater, Richard D'Oyly Carte, required a short piece to round out a bill with Offenbach's "La PÃÂ©richole". Carte had directed Sullivan's "Cox and Box". Recalling that Gilbert had proposed a lyrics to him, Carte connected with Sullivan to set it, and the outcome was the one-demonstration comic musical drama "Preliminary by Jury". "Preliminary", featuring Sullivan's sibling Fred as the Learned Judge, turned into an unexpected hit, winning sparkling applause from the commentators and playing for 300 exhibitions over its initial couple of seasons. "The Daily Telegraph" remarked that the piece represented the arranger's "incredible limit with respect to sensational composition of the lighter class", and different audits stressed the fitting mix of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. One expressed, "it appears, as in the incomparable Wagnerian musical dramas, just as lyric and music had continued all the while from one and a similar mind." A couple of months after the fact, another Sullivan one-act comic musical show opened: "The Zoo", with a lyrics by B. C. Stephenson. It was less effective than "Preliminary", and for the following 15 years Sullivan's sole operatic teammate was Gilbert; the accomplices made a further twelve musical dramas together.
