A theoretical reassessment of "Domesday Book" (1086) material recommends that St Denys' sources might be prior. Two houses called "Eslaforde" (Sleaford) were recorded in the "Domesday Book", one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a congregation and cleric, just as 8 factories, 1 section of land of forest, of knoll and of bog. Ramsey Abbey had been allowed land in Sleaford and encompassing towns before the Norman Conquest of England; in "Domesday" its charge comprised of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 sections of land of glade. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's house of Quarrington, where he held two chapels. There is no proof for a second church at Quarrington, which recommends that the record is implying one in one more of the abbot's houses for which Quarrington was a domain focus. The nearby students of history David Roffe and Christine Mahany decided out the likelihood this alluded to Cranwell, one more of the monastery's expenses, and inferred that it is most likely a reference to the congregation at Old Sleaford, which was allowed by a knight of Ramsey to Haverholme Priory in "c". 1165. Henceforth, the congregation controlled by the diocesan in the other house more likely than not been a second church in Sleaford, and in this way could just have been St Denys' in what might turn out to be New Sleaford.
