The northernmost area of the advanced USÃÂ 41 among Houghton and Copper Harbor started in the nineteenth century as the Military Road. The street was one of 13 streets worked somewhere in the range of 1817 and 1864 by the government. Development of the street was proposed as ahead of schedule as two years after the US gained the last tracts of land in the Upper Peninsula. Congress approached Secretary of War William Wilkins for subsidizing to fabricate such a street in 1844, since the territory relied upon a land association with Green Bay, Wisconsin, for as long as a half year a year for provisions and mail. The gauge for a , rough street was $37,400 (proportionate to $ in ). The issue kicked the bucket until 1848 when the Michigan Legislature requested of Congress for an assignment to work to interface Green Bay to the Keweenaw Bay. The intrigue went unfulfilled by the legislature, yet private gatherings ventured in. Mail administration was accessible overland once every month amid the winter from Green Bay. In 1857, the Legislature established a law to give a street from Eagle Harbor south to Ontonagon. This street was stretched out south to the state line as per two laws in 1859.
