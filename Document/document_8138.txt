In 1892, Fuller ventured out to the Cape of Good Hope "to convalesce", despite the fact that from what ailment or damage, her biographer Joan Kerr does not say. While there, she was a visitor of her uncle Sir Thomas Ekins Fuller, an individual from the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, and through him she met Cecil Rhodes, the Colony's Prime Minister, who dispatched her to paint a scene appearing home. After two years, she made a trip on to England and France, where she stayed for 10 years. During the 1890s, Australian specialists concentrating abroad supported Paris over London, and Fuller was no exemption. Different Australians concentrating in France around that time included Agnes Goodsir, Margaret Preston, James Quinn, and Hugh Ramsay. Fuller concentrated first at the AcadÃÂ©mie Julian, where her educators included William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and later, RaphaÃÂ«l Collin, one of whose studios she oversaw for a period. A large number of the French craftsmanship schools had as of late opened their ways to ladies, and those at AcadÃÂ©mie Julian experienced poor, packed conditions and disdain from the (generally male) educators. In spite of this current, Fuller's aptitudes created, and contemporary pundits remarked positively because of the French preparing.
