A few, at the season of structure and since, have seen similitudes between the dime and a plaque delineating Roosevelt etched by African-American stone worker Selma Burke, uncovered in September 1945, which is in the Recorder of Deeds Building in Washington; Burke was among those claiming her work was utilized by Sinnock to make the dime. She upheld for this situation until her passing in 1994, and convinced various numismatists and government officials, including Roosevelt's child James. Numismatists who bolster her point to the way that Sinnock took his portrayal of the Liberty Bell, which shows up on the 1926 Sesquicentennial half dollar and Franklin half dollar (1948Ã¢ÂÂ 1963), from another originator without giving credit. In any case, Robert R. Van Ryzin, in his book on secrets about U.S. coins, called attention to that Sinnock had outlined Roosevelt from life in 1933 for his first presidential decoration (structured by Sinnock), and records from the season of issuance of the dime express that Sinnock utilized those, just as photos of the president, to set up the dime. A 1956 eulogy in "The New York Times" credits Marcel Sternberger with snapping the picture that Sinnock adjusted for the dime. As indicated by Van Ryzin, the progression of time has made it difficult to check or preclude Burke's charges.
