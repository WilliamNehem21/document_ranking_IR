Some evangelicals have upheld the Potter books: outreaching writer Connie Neal, in her books, "What's a Christian to Do with Harry Potter?", "The Gospel According to Harry Potter", and "Wizards, Wardrobes, and Wookiees: Navigating Good and Evil in Harry Potter, Narnia, and Star Wars", composed that the books lecture Christian qualities and can be utilized to teach kids in Christian fundamentals. Mike Hertenstein of "Foundation" magazine, in his article "Harry Potter versus the Muggles, Myth, Magic and Joy," utilizes the term 'Muggles,' utilized in the books to portray non-mysterious people, to depict Christians without creative ability. "Christianity Today" distributed a publication for the books in January 2000, considering the arrangement a "Book of Virtues" and affirming that despite the fact that "<nowiki>m</nowiki>odern black magic is undoubtedly a capturing, enchanting false religion that we should shield our kids from," this does not speak to the Potter books, which have "superb instances of sympathy, reliability, fearlessness, fellowship, and even selflessness." Italian Methodist priest Peter Ciaccio investigated the connection between J. K. Rowling's work and Christian philosophy, expressing that the Harry Potter arrangement is the positive result of the experience of the Jewish-Christian convention with other imperative highlights of the Western social legacy (to be specific Celtic, Nordic and Classical).
