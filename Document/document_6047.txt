O'Reilly shook English trust in the Third Test, played on a peaceful surface at Old Trafford, by taking three wickets in four balls. Cyril Walters, who up to that point had been untroubled, neglected to pick the bosie and accordingly inside edged the ball to short leg. Weave Wyatt confessed all in and was bowled for a brilliant duck, conveying Hammond in to confront the cap trap ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-attendant Bert Oldfield, however the following conveyance clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O'Reilly evacuated Sutcliffe before long, however the batsmen settled down and the following wicket did not come until Hendren fell just before the finish of the primary day's play. Britain were 5/355 and O'Reilly had taken every wicket. The following day, the hosts finished on 9/627, regardless of a constant 59 overs from O'Reilly, who finished with 7/189 and was the main bowler to challenge the batsmen. The high-scoring match never looked liable to deliver an outcome, with the exception of when Australia were in risk of being compelled to pursue on. They were 55 flees from the pursue on sign of 478 toward the finish of the third day with two wickets close by, and O'Reilly was on one. The following day Arthur Chipperfield fell with 24 runs still required and O'Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 preceding the last fell. O'Reilly finished with 30 not out after an innings in which he was fortunate not to be gotten off an edge on numerous occasions.
