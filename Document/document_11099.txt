Reliable with Bolkovac's record, "The Whistleblower" depicts DynCorp International representatives as members in the after war Bosnian sex exchange with the UN turning a visually impaired eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon facilitated a screening of the film and guaranteed move would be made to counteract further occurrences of human dealing. Bolkovac reacted, "Shockingly, the across the board repulsiveness is now there. This won't be straightforward or a convenient solution." She said that notwithstanding Bosnia, peacekeepers had abused human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she needed to be idealistic and trusted that the screening would "lead to veritable talk and considered the UN's contribution in sex dealing and different wrongdoings", she stressed that it probably won't have the ideal enduring effect: "I realize we will hear a great deal about what has been done since the time portrayed in this film, yet talk just goes up until this point. The circumstance has heightened." Following the showy arrival of "The Whistleblower", "The Guardian" detailed that other UN authorities endeavored to make light of the occasions delineated and that activities against dealing in Bosnia were prematurely ended.
