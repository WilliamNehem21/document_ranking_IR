The success of "The Vortex" in both London and America caused a great demand for new Coward plays. In 1925 he premiered "Fallen Angels", a three-act comedy that amused and shocked audiences with the spectacle of two middle-aged women slowly getting drunk while awaiting the arrival of their mutual lover. "Hay Fever", the first of Coward's plays to gain an enduring place in the mainstream theatrical repertoire, also appeared in 1925. It is a comedy about four egocentric members of an artistic family who casually invite acquaintances to their country house for the weekend and bemuse and enrage each other's guests. Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family. By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in "The Times" as a "dazzling achievement; like "The Importance of Being Earnest", it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery." By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: "The Vortex", "Fallen Angels", "Hay Fever" and "On with the Dance". Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'. Soon, his frantic pace caught up with him, and he collapsed on stage in 1926 while starring in a stage adaptation of "The Constant Nymph" and had to take an extended rest, recuperating in Hawaii.
