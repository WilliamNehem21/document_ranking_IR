For most of June, the ships of the squadron conducted individual training. "Vizeadmiral" Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Imperial Naval Office, brought the "Reichstag" budget committee to view the I Squadron in an attempt to convince them of the value of continued naval expansion. Toward the end of the month, "Kaiser Friedrich III" departed for Britain with Prince Heinrich to represent Germany during the coronation of King Edward VII. The ceremony was delayed, however, and "Kaiser Friedrich III" returned to Kiel on 30 June. The I Squadron began a training cruise to Norwegian waters on 8 July that ended on 20 July. During the annual gunnery training held after the ships' return to Kiel, "Kaiser Friedrich III" won the Kaiser's "SchieÃpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellence in gunnery. On 17 August, the fleet assembled in Kiel for the annual training maneuvers. Assigned to the "hostile" force, "Kaiser Friedrich III" patrolled the Great Belt in the Baltic to prevent the "German" squadron from passing through. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and several other battleships then forced an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River, where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized. The "hostile" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days.
