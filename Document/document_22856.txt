Hershkovitz and Ray's classification was never widely followed, and from 1976 on authors started to reinstate some of the other groups lumped in "Oryzomys" as separate genera. The genus was reduced to 43Â species (out of 110 in Oryzomyini) in the third edition (2005) of "Mammal Species of the World", but it was still not a natural, monophyletic group; rather, it mostly united those oryzomyines that lacked the conspicuous specializations of other genera. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler's comprehensive phylogenetic analysis produced further evidence that the genus was polyphyletic, as species of "Oryzomys" were dispersed all over the oryzomyine tree. He proposed that eleven new genera should be created to accommodate those species that were not closely related to the type species of "Oryzomys", the marsh rice rat; he considered other options that would require fewer new genera, but argued that that would result in less meaningful genus-level groups in Oryzomyini. Later in the same year, Weksler, Percequillo, and Voss created ten new generaâ"Aegialomys", "Cerradomys", "Eremoryzomys", "Euryoryzomys", "Hylaeamys", "Mindomys", "Nephelomys", "Oreoryzomys", "Sooretamys", and "Transandinomys"âfor species formerly placed in "Oryzomys" and placed six more species related to ""Oryzomys" alfaroi" in "Handleyomys" pending the description of more new genera for them. They left only five species in "Oryzomys", which was now finally a natural, monophyletic group. Because of subsequent taxonomic work, the number of species has since increased to at least eight.
