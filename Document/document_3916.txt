Amazing Coulee Dam bolsters four diverse power houses containing 33 hydroelectric generators. The first Left and Right Powerhouses contain 18 primary generators and the Left has an extra three administration generators for absolute introduced limit of 2,280ÃÂ MW. The main generator was appointed in 1941 and each of the 18 were working by 1950. The Third Powerplant contains an aggregate of six primary generators with a 4,215ÃÂ MW introduced limit. Generators G-19, G-20 and G-21 in the Third Powerplant have a 600ÃÂ MW introduced limit yet can work at a most extreme limit of 690ÃÂ MW which brings the general greatest limit of the dam's capacity offices to 7,079ÃÂ MW. The Pump-Generating Plant contains six siphon generators with an introduced limit of 314ÃÂ MW. While siphoning water into Banks Lake they devour 600ÃÂ MW of power. Every generator is provided with water by an individual penstock. The biggest of these feed the Third Powerplant and are in distance across and can supply up to . The dam's capacity offices initially had an introduced limit of 1,974ÃÂ MW however developments and updates have expanded age to 6,809ÃÂ MW introduced, 7,079ÃÂ MW greatest. Fabulous Coulee Dam produces 21 TWh of power every year. This implies the dam produces around 2,397 MW of intensity by and large, which results in an absolute plant factor effectiveness of 35%. In 2014, 20.24 TWh of power was produced.
