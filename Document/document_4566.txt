In 1973, LutosÃÂawski went to a presentation given by the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau with the piano player Sviatoslav Richter in Warsaw; he met the vocalist after the show and this motivated him to compose his all-encompassing symphonic tune "Les Espaces du sommeil" ("The spaces of rest"). This work, "Preludes and Fugue", "Mi-Parti" (a French articulation that generally makes an interpretation of as "partitioned into two equivalent yet unique parts"), "Novelette", and a short piece for cello to pay tribute to Paul Sacher's seventieth birthday celebration, involved LutosÃÂawski all through the 1970s, while out of sight he was working ceaselessly at an anticipated third orchestra and a "concertante" piece for the oboist Heinz Holliger. These last pieces were demonstrating hard to finish as LutosÃÂawski attempted to bring more noteworthy familiarity into his sound world and to accommodate pressures between the consonant and melodic parts of his style, and among closer view and foundation. The Double Concerto for oboe, harp and chamber ensembleÃ¢ÂÂappointed by Paul SacherÃ¢ÂÂwas at long last completed in 1980, and the Third Symphony in 1983. In 1977 he got the Order of the Builders of People's Poland. In 1983 he got the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.
