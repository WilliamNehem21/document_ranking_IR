The De Beers Lightbox brand entered the market starting in September 2018. De Beers had previously limited its synthetic diamond production to industrial applications. As of November 2018, the brand's website describes the diamonds as costing $200 for a quarter carat stone, $400 for a half carat, and $800 for a full carat. These prices are far lower than most previous offerings about one-tenth of the price of similar mined diamonds and less than one-fourth the price of synthetic diamonds offered for sale in May 2018 by another producer, Diamond Foundry. However, Lightbox does not offer stones for sale without them being mounted in a setting (which adds somewhat to the price), and the brand only offers relatively low quality settings (sterling silver, rose gold plated, or 10K gold settings, not high-carat solid gold or platinum) and only offers settings for earrings and necklaces, not rings. The website emphasizes pink and blue stones, although colorless stones are also offered. The website's FAQ page says the lab-grown diamonds are "neither as valuable or precious" as natural stones. The Lightbox branded jewelry is promoted as being "for lighter moods and lighter moments, like birthdays and beach days and just because days", and the items are provided in what "The New York Times" called "candy-colored cardboard gift boxes". The Lightbox jewelry is offered for sale only directly through the website, although the site says that some partner sales locations will be added in 2019.
