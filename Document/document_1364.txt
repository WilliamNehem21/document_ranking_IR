The accentuation was on dream, and a lot of it was "smooth" dreamÃ¢ÂÂthe kind of sort fiction that the upmarket smooth magazines, for example, "The Saturday Evening Post", were eager to purchase. Some sci-fi showed up too in the main couple of years, including Isaac Asimov's "Sally", which depicts a world in which vehicles have been given mechanical cerebrums and are keen. In 1955 it was chosen to move the concentration from dream to sf: in Browne's words, "Accounts of straight dream were generally wiped out and straight sci-fi substituted, spread topic was the fate of a logical sort, the words "sci-fi" showed up under the title, inside fine art was taken care of to supplant the free, 'aesthetic' sort of illustration we had been utilizing." Sales rose 17% inside two issues. Browne was uninterested in sci-fi, in any case, and the nature of the fiction before long dropped, with a little steady of journalists creating a lot of "Fantastic"s fiction under house names throughout the following couple of years. By the beginning of 1956 the fiction in "Phenomenal" was, in the supposition of sf antiquarian Mike Ashley, "[in] a trough of hack consistency", however there was some imaginativeness clear from more up to date authors, for example, Robert Silverberg, Harlan Ellison and Randall Garrett.
