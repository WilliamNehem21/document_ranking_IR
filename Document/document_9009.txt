Gilligan was conceived in Denmark Hill, a territory of Camberwell in London. He was the second of three children, every one of whom played top of the line cricket, to Willie Austin Gilligan and Alice Eliza Kimpton. The family had a solid association with Sussex; Gilligan pursued Sussex County Cricket Club as a kid, and later played club cricket there. In the wake of going to Fairfield School, he was instructed at Dulwich College from 1906 until 1914 where he set up a donning notoriety in games and cricket. In the last game, he played in the school initial eleven, as did his siblings; in 1913, every one of the three young men played in the group. Gilligan played in the eleven somewhere in the range of 1911 and 1914 and captained the side in his last two years. In 1914, he came top of the school batting and bowling midpoints. Chosen to play delegate schools cricket at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1914, he took ten wickets altogether and scored one fifty in the two matches. By the models of school cricket, his pace was noteworthy, and Surrey welcomed him to play for their second eleven amid the school occasions of 1913 and 1914; his dad was an individual from that province's board of trustees, and Gilligan fit the bill to play through his London birth.
