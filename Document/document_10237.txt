Analytical columnists and Democratic agents had sought after bits of gossip that Agnew had been degenerate amid his years as a Maryland official, however they had not had the capacity to substantiate them. In February 1973, Agnew knew about the examination and had Attorney General Richard Kleindienst contact Beall. The VP's own lawyer, George White, visited Beall, who expressed that Agnew was not under scrutiny, and that examiners would do their best to secure Agnew's name. In June, Matz's lawyer unveiled to Beall that his customer could demonstrate that Agnew had been degenerate, yet that installments to him had proceeded into his bad habit administration. These later installments would not be banned by the legal time limit; Agnew could be arraigned. On July 3, Beall educated the new Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and toward the month's end Nixon, through his head of staff, Alexander Haig, was educated. Agnew had just met with both Nixon and Haig to declare his honesty. On August 1, Beall sent a letter to Agnew's lawyer, formally exhorting that the VP was under scrutiny for expense misrepresentation and debasement. Matz was set up to affirm that he had met with Agnew at the White House and given him $10,000 in real money. Another observer, Jerome B. Wolff, leader of Maryland's street bonus, had broad documentation that point by point, as Beall put it, "each degenerate installment he took an interest in with then-Governor Agnew".
