His first issue, November 1924, was minimal superior to those altered by Baird, in spite of the fact that it included two stories by new scholars, Frank Belknap Long and Greye La Spina, who ended up prominent patrons. Over the next year, Wright built up a gathering of authors as regulars, including Long and La Spina, and distributed numerous accounts by essayists who might be intently connected with the magazine for the following decade and then some.

That issue additionally contained the main portion of La Spina's epic "Intruders from the Dark", which Baird had dismissed as "excessively ordinary". It ended up being amazingly prominent with perusers, and Weinberg remarks that Baird's dismissal was "only one of the numerous oversights made by the before manager".
