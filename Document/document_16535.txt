Many of the concepts and characters within the series (Personas, Shadows, Philemon) use Jungian psychology and archetypes. A recurring motif are the "masks" people wear during everyday life, which ties back to their Personas. This motif was more overtly expressed in "Persona 5" through the main casts' use of masks in their thief guises. The dual lives of the main casts are directly inspired by these themes. Each game also includes specific themes and motifs. "Persona 2" focuses on the effect of rumors on the fabric of reality (referred to by the developers as "the power of Kotodama"); "Persona 3" employs themes involving depression and the darkness within people; "Persona 4" focuses on how gossip and the media influences people's views of others; and "Persona 5" shows how the main characters pursue personal freedom in a restrictive modern society. A recurring element in the earlier entries is "The Butterfly Dream", a famous story by the Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou. It ties in with the series' themes, and also with Philemon's frequent appearances as a butterfly. Philemon's original appearance was based on Zhuang Zhou. The character Nyarlathotep is based on the character of the same name from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and the Mythos as a whole is frequently referenced in "Persona 2". The Velvet Room was based on the Black Lodge from "Twin Peaks". Igor and the other assistants of the Velvet Room are all named after characters from the novel "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley.
