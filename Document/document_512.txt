For the greater part of the eighth century, Mercia was the predominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Mercian impact in the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, East Anglia, and Essex proceeded into the mid 820s under Coenwulf of Mercia. In any case, Coenwulf's passing in 821 denoted the start of a period in which Mercia experienced dynastic clashes and military annihilations that redrew the political guide of England. Four (conceivably five) lords, from what give off an impression of being four distinctive family gatherings, ruled Mercia all through the following six years. Minimal genealogical data about these rulers has endure, however since Anglo-Saxon names frequently included introductory components basic to most or all individuals from a family, students of history have proposed that kinfolk bunches in this period can be recreated based on the comparability of their names. Three contending family bunches are unmistakable in the sanctions and regnal arrangements of the time: the "C", "Wig" and "B" gatherings. The "C" gathering, which incorporated the siblings Coenwulf, Cuthred of Kent, and Ceolwulf I, was prevailing in the period following the passings of Offa of Mercia and his child Ecgfrith in 796. Ceolwulf was ousted in 823 by Beornwulf, maybe the first of the "B" gathering, who was murdered battling against the East Anglians in 826. He was trailed by Ludeca, not clearly connected to any of the three gatherings, who was executed in fight the next year. After Ludeca's passing, the first of the "Wig" family came to control: Wiglaf, who kicked the bucket in 839 or 840. Beorhtwulf, who prevailing to the position of royalty that year, is probably going to have originated from the "B" gathering, which may likewise have incorporated the disastrous Beornred who "held [power] a short time and miserably" after the homicide of King ÃÂthelbald in 757.
