At the point when the session finished, Sherman battled in Indiana and Ohio for Lincoln's re-appointment. In 1865, he went to Lincoln's second initiation, at that point made a trip to Savannah, Georgia to meet with his sibling William, who had touched base there after his military's walk to the ocean. Sherman returned home to Mansfield in April, where he learned of Lincoln's death only days after the Confederate surrender. He was again in Washington for the Grand Review of the Armies and after that returned home until December, when the 39th Congress gathered. There had been no extraordinary session that late spring, and President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor, had led the pack on Reconstruction of the vanquished South, to the horror of numerous in Congress. Sherman and Johnson had been cordial, and a few onlookers trusted that Sherman could fill in as a contact among Johnson and the gathering's "Radical" wing. By February 1866, be that as it may, Johnson was openly assaulting these Radical Republicans, who requested brutal discipline of the revolutionaries and government activity to help the freedmen. The next month Johnson vetoed the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1866, which had passed Congress with overpowering numbers. Sherman participated in re-ignoring the bill Johnson's veto. That equivalent year, Sherman voted in favor of the Fourteenth Amendment, which ensured measure up to security of the laws to the freedmen. It moved toward becoming law in 1868.
