Upon becoming a tropical storm, Erika began a motion to the northeast. There was initial uncertainty whether Erika or nearby Claudette would become the dominant system through their interaction. On SeptemberÂ 10, the storm developed a central dense overcast as it attained its peak winds of 60Â mph (95Â km/h). It accelerated east-northeastward toward the Azores along the northern periphery of a ridge, briefly interacting with Claudette. By SeptemberÂ 11, the convection had diminished, leaving the center exposed as Erika underwent extratropical transition. Shortly thereafter it passed through the Azores, striking SÃ£o Miguel Island. Nearby Santa Maria Island reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to 67Â mph (107Â km/h), prompting the closure of the airfield for several hours. On SeptemberÂ 12, Erika weakened to a tropical depression before completing the transition into an extratropical cyclone. It dissipated later that day.
Tropical Storm Fabian developed on OctoberÂ 15 in the western Caribbean from the interaction of a cold front and a tropical wave. Initially the storm was disorganized, with its strongest winds located primarily east of the center. An eastward-moving upper-level trough imparted a northeast motion as well as unfavorable wind shear. After reaching peak winds of 45Â mph (75Â km/h), Fabian crossed the Isle of Youth before crossing western Cuba. There, it dropped heavy rainfall, including in a six-hour period in one location. By early on OctoberÂ 16, the center was becoming difficult to locate as Fabian moved through the Florida Straits. It passed just southeast of the Florida coastline, prompting the closure of two state parks and dropping of rainfall in Conch Key. Effects were minimal, with winds gusting to 32Â mph (52Â km/h) in Key West. The storm later moved through the Bahamas and became extratropical as it interacted with an approaching front.
