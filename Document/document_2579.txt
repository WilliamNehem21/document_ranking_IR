Burton remarks that, in the late 1920s, Poulenc may have appeared to be in a lucky position: expertly fruitful and freely wealthy, having acquired a generous fortune from his dad. He purchased a substantial nation house, Le Grande Coteau, at Noizay, Indre-et-Loire, south-west of Paris, where he withdrew to create in quiet environment. However he was harried, attempting to deal with his sexuality, which was transcendently gay. His first genuine issue was with the painter Richard Chanlaire, to whom he sent a duplicate of the "Show champÃÂªtre" score engraved, "You have transformed me, you are the daylight of my thirty years, an explanation behind living and working". By the by, while this undertaking was in advancement Poulenc proposed marriage to his companion Raymonde Linossier. As she was very much aware of his homosexuality as well as impractically appended somewhere else, she rejected him, and their relationship ended up stressed. He endured the first of numerous times of dejection, which influenced his capacity to make, and he was crushed in January 1930 when Linossier kicked the bucket abruptly at 32 years old. On her passing he expressed, "All my childhood withdraws with her, all that piece of my life that had a place just with her. I sobÃÂ ... I am presently twenty years more established". His issue with Chanlaire diminished in 1931, however they stayed deep rooted companions.
