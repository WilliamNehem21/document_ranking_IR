In the 1974â75 season, Ipswich finished third in the First Division and were losing semi-finalists in the FA Cup. Suffering from cancer and becoming less able to carry out his duties as Chairman, John Cobbold swapped roles with director Patrick Cobbold in 1976. In the 1975â76 season Ipswich finished sixth of the league, and in October 1976, they signed Paul Mariner from Plymouth for a club record Â£220,000. The team challenged Liverpool for the First Division title for much of the 1976â77 season, going top of the table in February 1977 with a 5â0 defeat of Norwich City in the East Anglian derby. Mariner's efforts helped the club to a third place finish, and the following season, he scored seven goals in the FA Cup as the club won the second major honour in its history, Roger Osborne scoring the winning goal in a 1â0 victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. The club's league fortunes dipped dramatically during the season finishing 18th, just three points above the relegation places, but the team reached the third round of the UEFA Cup, where they beat Barcelona 3â0 at Portman Road; Barcelona won the second leg 3â0, Johan Cruyff scoring twice, and Ipswich went out on penalties. The team's FA Cup success secured qualification for the 1978â79 European Cup Winners' Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals, again losing to Barcelona. Over the next two seasons Robson brought Dutchmen Arnold MÃ¼hren and Frans Thijssen to the club while the team achieved two further top six finishes in the First Division. However, it was the 1980â81 season which, in Robson's words, "...Â helped put Ipswich on the mapÂ ...".
