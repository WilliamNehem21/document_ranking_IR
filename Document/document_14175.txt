Mulvany states that "Viking metalÃÂ ... is considerably less worried about conventional aural materials like instruments and tunes. Rather, Viking groups restrain themselves principally to the utilization of Norse folklore as a literary source, which they regularly increase with adapted shanty-like songs that are intended to bring out opportune pictures". He expounds: According to Mulvany, Viking metal draws vigorously on ocean shanties and media pictures of privateers and Vikings, an impact clear in two essential types of the class. The main sort "is to a great extent stepwise in movement with many rehashed note figures", is much of the time in minor key, and is basically sung as one. The second kind uses a "curving climb plunge structure" and is less subject to verses, making it "progressively suggestive of moving waves on the vast ocean". As instances of the primary kind, Mulvany analyzed the structures of ocean shanties, for example, "Intoxicated Sailor", the 1934 and 1996 film soundtrack variants of "Dead Man's Chest", Mario Nascimbene's "Viking" melody for the 1958 film "The Vikings", and the serenade from Monty Python's "Spam" sketch, and found comparative structures in pieces by Viking and dark metal groups, for example, Einherjer, Mithotyn, Naglfar, and Vargevinter. The second sort, that of angling rising and plummet, Mulvany saw in creations by Einherjer and Borknagar.
