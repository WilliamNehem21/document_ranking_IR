The five populaces living on the biggest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most discussion with respect to whether they are genuine species or simply particular populaces or subspecies. It is generally acknowledged that the populace living on the northernmost fountain of liquid magma, Volcan Wolf, is hereditarily autonomous from the four populaces toward the south and is thusly a different animal varieties. It is believed to be gotten from an alternate colonization occasion than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago obviously offered ascend to the Volcan Wolf species ("C. becki") while the four southern populaces are accepted to be plummeted from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz. Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have initially colonized the Sierra Negra fountain of liquid magma, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to frame. The tortoises at that point spread north to each recently made fountain of liquid magma, bringing about the populaces living on Volcan Alcedo and afterward Volcan Darwin. Later hereditary proof demonstrates that these two populaces are hereditarily particular from one another and from the populace living on Sierra Negra ("C. guentheri") and in this way structure the species "C. vandenburghi" (Alcedo) and "C. microphyes" (Darwin). The fifth populace living on the southernmost fountain of liquid magma ("C. vicina") is thought to have divided from the Sierra Negra populace all the more as of late and is hence not as hereditarily extraordinary as the other two. Isabela is the most as of late shaped island tortoises possess, so its populaces have had less time to develop freely than populaces on different islands, yet as per a few analysts, they are on the whole hereditarily extraordinary and should each be considered as independent species.
