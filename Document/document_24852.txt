After Nansen died on 13 May 1930, Quisling used his friendship with the editor of the "Tidens Tegn" newspaper to get his analysis of Nansen onto the front page. The article was entitled "Politiske tanker ved Fridtjof Nansens dÃ¸d" ("Political Thoughts on the Death of Fridtjof Nansen") and was published on 24 May. In the article, he outlined ten points that would complete Nansen's vision as applied to Norway, among them "strong and just government" and a "greater emphasis on race and heredity." This theme was followed up in his new book, "Russia and Ourselves" (), which was serialised in "Tidens Tegn" during the autumn of 1930. Advocating war against Bolshevism, the openly racist book catapulted Quisling into the political limelight. Despite his earlier ambivalence, he took up a seat on the Oslo board of the previously Nansen-led Fatherland League. Meanwhile, he and Prytz founded a new political movement, "Nordisk folkereisning i Norge," or "Nordic popular rising in Norway," with a central committee of 31 and Quisling as its "fÃ¸rer" â a one-man executive committee â though Quisling seemed to have had no particular attachment to the term. The first meeting of the league took place on 17 March 1931, stating the purpose of the movement was to "eliminate the imported and depraved communist insurgency."
