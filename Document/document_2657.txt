Orledge portrays the "Nocturnes" as incredibly changed in surface, "running from the Musorgskian beginning of 'Nuages', through the moving toward metal band parade in 'FÃÂªtes', to the silent female theme in 'SirÃÂ¨nes. Orledge considers the last a pre-reverberation of the marine surfaces of "La mer". "Estampes" for piano (1903) gives impressions of outlandish areas, with further echoes of the gamelan in its pentatonic structures. Debussy trusted that since Beethoven, the customary symphonic structure had turned out to be equation based, redundant and outdated. The three-section, cyclic orchestra by CÃÂ©sar Franck (1888) was more to his loving, and its impact can be found in "La mer" (1905); this uses a semi symphonic structure, its three segments making up a monster sonata-structure development with, as Orledge watches, a cyclic subject, in the way of Franck. The focal "Jeux de vagues" segment has the capacity of a symphonic advancement segment driving into the last "Discourse du vent et de la mer", "an incredible article in instrumental shading and resonation" (Orledge) which revamps subjects from the principal development. The audits were forcefully partitioned. A few commentators thought the treatment more obvious and less secretive than his past works, and even a stage in reverse; others adulated its "capacity and appeal", its "phenomenal verve and splendid dream", and its solid hues and clear lines.
