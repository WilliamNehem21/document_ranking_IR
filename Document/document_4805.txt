Somewhere in the range of 1927 and 1933 various unit compartment stock was worked by the Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon and Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for administrations from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The principal request was just for engine vehicles; half had Westinghouse brakes, Metro-Vickers control frameworks and four MV153 engines; they supplanted the engine autos working with bogie stock trailers. The remainder of the engine autos had a similar engine gear however utilized vacuum brakes, and worked with changed over 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to shape 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' stock was requested, 30 engine mentors and 25 trailers like the 'MV' units, yet with Westinghouse brakes. A further group of 'MW' stock was requested in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-mentor prepares, and incorporated extra trailers to build the length of the past 'MW' cluster trains to eight mentors. These had GEC WT545 engines, and albeit intended to work in different with the MV153, this did not function admirably by and by. After the Met turned out to be a piece of London Underground, the MV stock was fitted with Westinghouse brakes and the vehicles with GEC engines were re-outfitted to enable them to work in numerous with the MV153-motored autos. In 1938, nine 8-mentor and ten 6-mentor MW units were re-assigned T Stock. A trailer mentor worked in 1904/5 is put away at London Transport Museum's Acton Depot; it has been gravely harmed by flame, and the Spa Valley Railway is home to two T stock mentors.
