At 36 years of age and moving toward the finish of his profession, the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs was possibly his last shot at winning the Stanley Cup. The Flames vanquished the Vancouver Canucks, Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks to set up a Stanley Cup Finals rematch of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals with the Montreal Canadiens. McDonald was let well enough alone for the Flames' lineup for the third, fourth and fifth amusements, yet with Calgary driving the arrangement three successes to two, head mentor Terry Crisp felt that if the Flames were to win the title, McDonald had the right to be in the diversion. Fresh's choice paid profits, as halfway through the 6th amusement, McDonald ventured onto the ice in the wake of serving a punishment to join HÃÂ¥kan Loob and Joe Nieuwendyk in a three-on-one surge toward the Montreal objective. Loob left the puck behind to Nieuwendyk, who saw a streaking McDonald coming up the correct side of the ice. McDonald got the pass at that point shot the puck over Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy's glove to give the Flames a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1 lead. Doug Gilmour included two objectives, and Calgary won 4Ã¢ÂÂ 2 to win the establishment's first Stanley Cup title. Alliance president John Ziegler introduced the trophy to McDonald, co-chief Jim Peplinski and substitute Tim Hunter. Wearing the commander's "C" for the diversion, McDonald was the main individual from the Flames to convey the trophy as the group marched it around the Forum in festivity.
