The collection's lead single, "What Have You Done for Me Lately", topped at number four on the "Board" Hot 100 singles outline and at number one on the Hot Black Singles diagram. The single was ensured gold by the RIAA in November, 1990. The tune was contrasted positively with comparative chronicles of female strengthening discharged by dark ladies, for example, "New Attitude" by Patti LaBelle, "Should Be Good to Me" by Tina Turner and "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" by Aretha Franklin. Oprah Winfrey remarked: "What you're finding in every one of the regions of expressions and excitement is dark ladies disguising dark power and prideÃÂ ... Dark ladies began tuning in to their internal signals, instead of society or even the dark network's concept of what they should be and can be." "Dreadful", the collection's second single, beat "What Have You Done for Me Lately" by one position, cresting at number three on the Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot Black Singles diagram. It was confirmed gold in November, 1990. Pundit Jon Bream noticed "the musicians have guilefully compared a frightful sounding furrow and the redundancy of the word 'terrible' with an inconspicuous antinasty message."
