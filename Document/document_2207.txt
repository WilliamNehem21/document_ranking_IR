Before the finish of the nineteenth century, stories that were focused on logical innovations and set later on, in the custom of Jules Verne, were showing up normally in prominent fiction magazines. The main sci-fi (sf) magazine, "Astonishing Stories", was propelled in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback at the tallness of the mash magazine time. It was fruitful, and framed sci-fi as an independently advertised classification, yet in February 1929 Gernsback lost control of the distributer when it went bankrupt. By April he had framed another organization, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and made two backups: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. Amidst the year he propelled three new magazines: a non-sf magazine titled "Radio Craft", and two sf pulps titled "Science Wonder Stories" and "Air Wonder Stories". These were followed in September 1929 by the main issue of "Science Wonder Quarterly", and in October Gernsback sent a letter to a portion of the authors he had just purchased material from, telling them that he was seeing more interest for "analyst or criminal secret stories with a decent "logical" foundation". He named Arthur B. Reeve's "Craig Kennedy" stories for instance, and furthermore referenced S.S. Van Dine's "Philo Vance" stories, which were exceptionally mainstream at the time. In the January 1930 issue of both the sf magazines, Gernsback promoted the new magazine that he would have liked to populate with these accounts: "Logical Detective Monthly".
