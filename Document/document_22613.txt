In 1957, American News Company, by far the largest magazine distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen by the end of the decade. For a while "If" was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, "Space Age", which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve "If"'s circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.
