Along with parts of Moss Side and Withington, in 1885 Bradford, Harpurhey and Rusholme became part of the City of Manchester. To cope with the extra demands placed on the area's refuse disposal systems, Manchester Corporation began to look for disposal sites. A number of locations were considered, including one on Deeside and another in Nottinghamshire, but Carrington Moss was chosen due to the nature of its land and its accessibility. Therefore, in 1886, the corporation bought the Carrington Moss Estateâan area of grouse moorlandâfrom Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford.
The purchase was part of the corporation's ultimately unsuccessful plan to retain the pail closet system (now superseded by the water closet), and followed a public scandal created by the daily dumping of 30â60Â tons of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers, at Holt Town sewage works. It paid about Â£38,000 (Â£ as of 2019), for the site, but the bog's depth, between deep pushed the total development cost to almost Â£94,000 (Â£ as of 2019). The estate included of wild mossland, of partly cultivated mossland, of mossland under cultivation and of incomplete roads. A number of brick buildings were included, along with Asphodel Farm and Ash Farm, both with wooden farmhouses. The corporation rented of land in small holdings to local farmers and kept for itself.
