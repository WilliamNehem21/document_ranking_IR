At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was relegated to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was positioned on the east side of the Stones River. At the point when the Union Army of the Cumberland, told by Major General William Rosecrans, assaulted on December 31, 1862, starting the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's fundamental power at first repulsed the assault. Bragg requested Breckinridge to fortify him on the west side of the stream, however Brigadier General John Pegram, who told a rangers unit, wrongly revealed that a huge Union power was progressing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was moderate to agree to Bragg's organization. When he at last crossed the stream, his assaults were incapable, and Bragg requested him back over the waterway. By January 2, Union powers had taken an edge that kept running along the waterway; against Breckinridge's recommendation, Bragg requested the second Division to dispatch a close self-destructive assault on the government position. Preceding the assault, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, "if [the attack] should result in a debacle and I be among the murdered, I need you to do equity to my memory and tell the general population that I trusted this assault to be extremely hasty and endeavored to forestall it."
