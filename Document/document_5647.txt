In July 1965, on Nashville's Channel 5 "Night Train", Hendrix showed up. Performing in Little Richard's gathering band, he supported up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on "Shotgun". The video recording of the show denotes the soonest known film of Hendrix performing. Richard and Hendrix frequently conflicted over lateness, closet, and Hendrix's stage tricks, and in late July, Richard's sibling Robert terminated him. He at that point quickly rejoined the Isley Brothers, and recorded a second single with them, "Move Over and Let Me Dance" sponsored with "Have You Ever Been Disappointed". Soon thereafter, he joined a New York-based R&B band, Curtis Knight and the Squires, in the wake of meeting Knight in the entryway of an inn where the two men were remaining. Hendrix performed with them for eight months. In October 1965, he and Knight recorded the single, "How Would You Feel" supported with "Welcome Home" and on October 15, Hendrix marked a three-year recording contract with business person Ed Chalpin. While the association with Chalpin was brief, his agreement stayed in power, which later caused lawful and vocation issues for Hendrix. Amid his time with Knight, Hendrix quickly visited with Joey Dee and the Starliters, and worked with King Curtis on a few accounts including Ray Sharpe's two-section single, "Help Me". Hendrix earned his first writer credits for two instrumentals, "Hornets Nest" and "Thump Yourself Out", discharged as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966.
