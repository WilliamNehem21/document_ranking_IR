Upon its release, "Aries" received mixed reactions from music critics. AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis gave the album 2.5 stars out of five and found the ballads to be "sometimes a little too syrupy". He complimented some of the dance tunes such as "Suave" and "Dame Tu Amor", but said "Luz Verde" was a "somewhat dated attempt at early-'90s Latin hip-hop R&B". A music journalist for "Billboard" magazine wrote a favorable review of "Aries", stating that Miguel "trades in nostalgic boleros for a stylish, up-to-date package" and called "Ayer" a "perfect transition track from "Romance"". "Chicago Tribune" music critic Achy Obejas gave the record 2.5 stars out of four, calling it "a kind of middle ground between "Romance" and its lush ballads, and the bouncy pop of "20 AÃ±os," its immediate antecedent". She praised Miguel's vocals as "wonderfully nuanced and dramatic", and said the ballads mostly "work", but that "the uptempo tunes fall flat most of the time". Enrique Lopetegui of the "Los Angeles Times" gave the album three stars out of four; he lauded Miguel's inclusion of "healthy elements of jazz and funk into his polished sound" and said he "returns to familiar territory accompanied by his usual superb arrangements and musicianship".
