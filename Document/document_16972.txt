Iwata helped lead a revitalization of Nintendo's handheld business by transitioning the company from the Game Boy Advance to the Nintendo DS, which sported a unique form factor and inclusion of a touchscreen that allowed for novel games. The idea for using two screens on a single device originated with Yamauchi before his retirement, while Miyamoto suggested the use of a touchscreen. Miyamoto subsequently spearheaded development of the device and its prototypes. The Nintendo DS proved to be a highly profitable system and went on to become the second-best selling video game console of all time with more than 154Â million units, inclusive of subsequent iterations, sold by SeptemberÂ 2014. In JuneÂ 2004, Iwata sought a conference with Dr. Ryuta Kawashima about a game that could appeal to non-gamers. This project would later become "", released in MayÂ 2005. Iwata personally oversaw development of the "Brain Age" series, even foregoing a public appearance on the day of the Nintendo DS's release in Japan on DecemberÂ 2. Miyamoto supported Iwata's work with the series and sent one of his protÃ©gÃ©s, Kouichi Kawamoto, to help develop the game. The "Brain Age" series is partially credited with launching the popularity of the Nintendo DS, and the series as a whole sold over 30Â million copies by DecemberÂ 2008.
