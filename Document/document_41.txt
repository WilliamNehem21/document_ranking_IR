On 1 July, the minelayer , escorted by the cruisers "Roon", "Augsburg", and "LÃÂ¼beck" and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of BogskÃÂ¤r. While coming back to port, the flotilla isolated into two areas; "Augsburg", "Gooney bird", and three destroyers made for RixhÃÂ¶ft while the rest of the unit went to Libau. "Augsburg" and "Gooney bird" were blocked by an amazing Russian squadron told by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, comprising of three defensively covered and two light cruisers. Commodore Johannes von Karpf, the flotilla authority, requested the slower "Gooney bird" to steam for nonpartisan Swedish waters and reviewed "Roon" and "LÃÂ¼beck". "Gooney bird" was grounded off Gotland and "Augsburg" got away, and the Russian squadron quickly connected with "Roon" before the two sides broke contact. After being educated of the circumstance, Hopman sortied with "Prinz Adalbert" and "Prinz Heinrich" to help von Karpf. While in transit, the cruisers experienced the British submarine , which scored a hit on "Prinz Adalbert". The torpedo hit underneath the conning tower, caused serious harm, and slaughtered ten men. Hopman exchanged to the torpedo vessel while Michelsen stayed on board "Prinz Adalbert" to administer the arrival to port. The ship took on some of water; her draft expanded fundamentally, which kept her from having the capacity to put into Danzig. She rather needed to make the adventure back to Kiel for fixes, which she came to on 4 July.
