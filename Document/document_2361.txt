As no comparable remains had been found in the zone previously, Lambe was uncertain of what sort of dinosaur they were, and whether they spoke to one animal groups or more; he proposed the arches were "prenasals" arranged before the nasal bones on the midline of the head, and noticed their comparability to the nasal horn-center of a "Triceratops" example. In 1903, Hungarian scientist Franz Nopcsa von FelsÃÂ-SzilvÃÂ¡s recommended that the fragmentary vaults of "Stegoceras" were in reality frontal and nasal bones, and that the creature would accordingly have had a solitary, unpaired horn. Lambe was thoughtful to this thought of another kind of "unicorn dinosaur" in a 1903 survey of Nopscsa's paper. Right now, there was still vulnerability over which gathering of dinosaur "Stegoceras" had a place with, with the two ceratopsians (horned dinosaurs) and stegosaurs (plated dinosaurs) as contenders. Hatcher questioned whether the "Stegoceras" examples had a place with similar animal groups and whether they were dinosaurs by any stretch of the imagination, and proposed the arches comprised of the frontal, occipital, and parietal bones of the skull. In 1918, Lambe alluded another vault (CMN 138) to "S. validus", and named another species, "S. brevis", in view of example CMN 1423 (which he initially incorporated into "S. validus"). At this point, he considered these creatures as individuals from Stegosauria (at that point made out of the two groups of defensively covered dinosaurs, Stegosauridae and Ankylosauridae), in another family he called Psalisauridae (named for the vaulted or arch formed skull rooftop).
