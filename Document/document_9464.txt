Aaliyah's vocals are in a controlled soprano style all through the collection. "Vibe" magazine's Hyun Kim contended that its melodies attract center to her singing more than her past records, "conveying it to the bleeding edge instead of concealing it behind the layered creation". "Raise some static" was sung with short of breath vocals by Aaliyah, who educates her darling on the most proficient method to satisfy her explicitly and likens her suggestive high to a medication high. Anthems, for example, "I Care 4 U", "Never No More", and "I Refuse" are sung all the more emotively, communicating despairing characteristics and hurt. On "I Can Be", Aaliyah sings from the point of view of a two-faced man's courtesan who needs to be his preeminent sweetheart. Alex Macpherson from "The Guardian" composed that "Aaliyah's clear, desensitized conveyance" on the tune "makes being the other lady appear to be a candidly masochistic type of self-medicine". Biographer Christopher John Farley said she "sincerely nitty gritty a melody" not at all like on her past collections and that "her delicate voice currently appeared to be something basic, a generously wind blowing through the parts of a major tree." According to Joshua Clover, Aaliyah drives melodic notes "into weird corners of syncopation's tricky design" on the more "shape-challenging" tracks. He composed that "she makes the sonics recount to the story, making significance outside the verses, delight past the snares."
