Todd McCarthy of "Assortment" said Jolie was more influencing than in "A Mighty Heart"ÃÂ (2007) on the grounds that she depended less on guile. He likewise noticed a surfeit of good supporting exhibitions, Michael Kelly's specifically. Oliver SÃÂ©guret of "LibÃÂ©ration" said the cast was the film's best component. He lauded the supporting on-screen characters and said Jolie's execution was intense yet downplayed. Kirk Honeycutt of "The Hollywood Reporter" said Jolie evaded her "motion picture star" persona to seem powerless and undaunted. He saw the supporting charactersÃ¢ÂÂAmy Ryan's exceptedÃ¢ÂÂas having few shades of dim. David Ansen, writing in "Newsweek", reverberated the opinion, yet said that "a few stories truly are about the heroes and the terrible". He said that with the diversions of Jolie's VIP and magnificence set aside, she conveyed the job with restriction and power. Manohla Dargis of "The New York Times" felt that Jolie's superstar was sufficiently diverting to render her unconvincing, and David Denby of "The New Yorker" said that while Jolie demonstrated aptitude and magnanimity, the execution and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking wants or disposition. He refered to comparative issues with Malkovich's Briegleb, closing, "both of them make an exceptionally appropriate and dull pair of colleagues."
