Penelope Wilton reprised her role as Harriet Jones to film a scene on , in a cottage in Dinas Powys. Filming was stalled because of difficulty transporting the Dalek props into the cottage: specifically, the raised patio doors made it difficult to balance and maneuver the props. The remainder of the fifth week was used to film Dalek-only scenes at Upper Boat Studios, when the Vault set was redressed as the "Crucible" command deck. Scenes that featured Martha and Sarah in their houses were filmed alternately during the sixth weekâthe former in the previously regular location of Lower Cwrt-Y-Vil Road in Penarth and the latter primarily at Upper Boatâending on with scenes of Sarah and Luke in their attic. The last exterior scene filmed for the episode was recorded on in the regular "The Sarah Jane Adventures" filming location of Clinton Road in Penarth, and consisted of external shots of Sarah's house and two Daleks accosting Sarah en route to meeting the Doctor. General filming for the episodeâand the two-parterâclosed with Dawkins' and O'Grady's cameos: Dawkins was filmed at Upper Boat after shooting finished in the attic set; and O'Grady was filmed on alongside an episode of "The Paul O'Grady Show" at The London Studios on the South Bank of the River Thames.
