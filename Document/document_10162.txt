Since medieval occasions the Exchequer had utilized count sticks, bits of cut, scored wood, regularly willow, as a feature of their bookkeeping methodology. The parliamentary student of history Caroline Shenton has depicted the count sticks as "generally as long as the range of a forefinger and thumb". These sticks were part in two with the goal that the opposite sides to an understanding had a record of the circumstance. When the reason for each count had reached an end, they were routinely wrecked. Before the finish of the eighteenth century the value of the count framework had similarly arrived at an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament expressed that all records ought to be on paper, not counts. The Act likewise nullified sinecure positions in the Exchequer, yet a proviso in the demonstration guaranteed it could just produce results once the rest of the sinecure-holders had passed on or resigned. The last sinecure-holder passed on in 1826 and the demonstration came into power, despite the fact that it took until 1834 for the outdated strategies to be supplanted. The author Charles Dickens, in a discourse to the Administrative Reform Association, depicted the maintenance of the counts for such a long time as a "stubborn adherence to an old custom"; he additionally derided the bureaucratic advances expected to actualize change from wood to paper. He said that "all the formality in the nation developed redder at the exposed notice of this intense and unique origination." By the time the substitution procedure had completed there were two truck heaps of old count sticks anticipating transfer.
