American Canadian language specialist William J. Samarin noted Armstrong conflated tone and pitch generally; he guaranteed this prompted "misrepresented complexities" in her portrayal, especially as for the last intonational fall in interrogatives. At the point when Armstrong kept in touch with her original copy, investigation of tone was a beginning field and the mind boggling connection between phonemic tonemes and phonetic pitch drove phoneticians to break down dialects as having vast quantities of tones. In 1952, SOAS etymologist Lyndon Harries had the capacity to take Armstrong's information and dissect Kikuyu tone as just having two hidden tone levels. American etymologist Mary Louise Pratt additionally re-examined Armstrong's Kikuyu information as just having two dimensions. Pratt likewise noted Armstrong did not recognize allophonically long vowels from vowels which are phonemically long. College of Nairobi etymologist Kevin C. Portage composed that if Armstrong had not kicked the bucket before finishing this book "there is no uncertainty she could have extended her scope of information and most likely exhibited some thorough investigation, which is tragically ailing in the distributed work". The American phonologist Nick Clements depicted Armstrong's book in a 1984 paper as "a very important wellspring of data because of the exhaustiveness of its inclusion and exactness of the writer's phonetic perceptions".
