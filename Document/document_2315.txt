The new arena took its name from the road which encases the ground on three sides, the fourth limit being the River Wensum. The name "Carrow" initially alludes to the previous Carrow Abbey that once remained on the riverside, its name thus having conceivable Norse starting points. In 1800, John Ridges, proprietor of the Carrow Abbey Estate and the land inverse on the banks of the Wensum in Thorpe Hamlet, "conceded consent for a proposed street access over his grounds to Carrow". By 1811, Philip M. Martineau, a specialist, possessed the structure, terrains and estate of Carrow, including the nearby Thorpe land. Carrow Hill Road was made on his Carrow Abbey Estate, to give work to the poor in the network. The street connected Martineau's Bracondale Estate to Carrow Toll Bridge, introduced in 1810. Norwich Railway Co. had procured the land in Thorpe around Carrow Road by the 1840s, and by 1860 the Thorpe site of things to come arena had a place with the firm of J. and J. Colman. The arena's Thorpe Corner recognizes this chronicled connection. In 1935, Colman's offered the 20-year leasehold to Norwich City and development of the new arena started quickly on the site: tenders were issued on the day the site was acquired and after ten days, on 11 June, work started.
