No "Apatosaurus" skull was referenced in writing until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of "Diplodocus" and "Apatosaurus". They found that however he never distributed his sentiment, Holland was in all likelihood right, that "Apatosaurus" had a "Diplodocus"- like skull. As indicated by them, numerous skulls long idea to relate to "Diplodocus" may rather be those of "Apatosaurus". They reassigned numerous skulls to "Apatosaurus" in light of related and intently related vertebrae. Despite the fact that they bolstered Holland, it was noticed that "Apatosaurus" may have had a "Camarasaurus"- like skull, in view of a disarticulated "Camarasaurus"- like tooth found at the exact site where an "Apatosaurus" example was discovered a long time previously. On October20, 1979, after the distributions by McIntosh and Berman, the primary genuine skull of "Apatosaurus" was mounted on a skeleton in an exhibition hall, that of the Carnegie. In 1998 it was proposed that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had incorporated into his 1896 skeletal reclamation rather had a place with "Brachiosaurus". In 2011 the main example of "Apatosaurus" where a skull was discovered verbalized with its cervical vertebrae was portrayed. This example, CMCVP7180, was found to vary in both skull and neck highlights from "A.louisae", however shared numerous highlights of the cervical vertebrae with "A.ajax". Another very much saved skull is Brigham Young University example 17096, an all around protected skull and skeleton, with a saved braincase.
