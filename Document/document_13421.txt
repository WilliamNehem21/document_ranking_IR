Film pundit Aniruddha Guha of "Day by day News and Analysis" depicted Mukerji's execution in the 2011 film "Nobody Killed Jessica" as "a standout amongst her best exhibitions till date". The film (co-featuring Vidya Balan) was Mukerji's first business accomplishment since "Ta Ra Rum Pum", and was particularly noted for being a triumph regardless of the nonattendance of a noticeable male on-screen character. The film was a semi-historical spine chiller dependent on the Jessica Lal murder case in which Mukerji played the anecdotal character of Meera Gaity, an indecent TV writer who is profoundly included with the case. To advance the film, she repeated the job of Gaity on the "C.I.D." TV arrangement. In a meeting with "The Telegraph" she stated, "It was such an alternate job to depict. It wasn't a job that was regular of a Hindi film courageous woman. Meera was progressively similar to a legend. It was a character that really took the story forward. [..] Meera made a great deal of things occur. It wasn't something that I had ever done previously. I really needed to play a man!" Certain commentators, in any case, were condemning of her execution, including Anupama Chopra of NDTV, who called her job, "the deadly, false note in "Nobody Killed Jessica"," contending that "the character is composed externally and Rani's depiction of her is similarly worn-out. It's about facades. She contends a ton and gladly marks herself a bitch however her hair stays splendidly set up and at last, she even gets the chance to complete a hero like moderate movement walk." Nonetheless, the job earned her few honors and assignments, including a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare.
