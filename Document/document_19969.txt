While "The Darjeeling Limited" did receive generally positive reviewsâhaving attained a 68% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoesâmany of the champions of "Hotel Chevalier" tended to combine praise of "Chevalier" with subtle shots at "Darjeeling". Portman's performance was praised by "TIME" reviewer Richard Corliss, who declared her to be "a comic actress in fresh bloom" in the "beguiling vignette", and expressed his wish that her role in "Darjeeling" had been greater. The feature, he felt, lacked "the feeling and wit of the short film". Stephanie Zacharek of "Salon" concurred, stating that "the untold story of "Hotel Chevalier" is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the one told outright in ", and calling the short "very close to perfect". "The Guardian" columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the "genuine ardour" that greeted the "perfectly measured narrative" of "Chevalier". He proposed that the constraints of the short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work. A. O. Scott of "The New York Times" hailed "Chevalier" as "a small gem" in comparison to the "overstuffed suitcase" of the feature, and wrote that "It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson's vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry."
