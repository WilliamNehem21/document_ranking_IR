Following the principal Arab attack of Constantinople (674Ã¢ÂÂ 678), the Arabs and Byzantines encountered a time of harmony. After 680, the Umayyad Caliphate was in the throes of the Second Muslim Civil War and the ensuing Byzantine power in the East empowered the sovereigns to extricate enormous measures of tribute from the Umayyad government in Damascus. In 692, as the Umayyads rose as victors from the Muslim Civil War, Emperor Justinian II () re-opened threats. The outcome was a progression of Arab triumphs that prompted the loss of Byzantine command over Armenia and the Caucasian territories, and a continuous infringement upon Byzantine borderlands. Step by step, the Caliphate's officers, more often than not individuals from the Umayyad family, propelled attacks into A byzantine area and caught strongholds and towns. After 712, the Byzantine guarded framework started to hint at breakdown: Arab assaults infiltrated further and further into Asia Minor, fringe strongholds were over and over assaulted and sacked, and references to Byzantine response in the sources become increasingly rare. In this, the Arabs were helped by the drawn out time of inward insecurity that pursued the primary statement of Justinian II in 695, in which the Byzantine royal position changed hands multiple times in rough upsets. In the expressions of the Byzantinist Warren Treadgold, "the Arab assaults would regardless have increased after the finish of their own common warÃÂ ... With unquestionably more men, land and riches than Byzantium, the Arabs had started to focus everything that is in them against it. Presently they took steps to douse the domain altogether by catching its capital."
