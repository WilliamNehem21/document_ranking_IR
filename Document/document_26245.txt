"Single Ladies" was first parodied in the November 15, 2008, episode of "SNL", which featured BeyoncÃ©. She was initially reluctant to participate in the segment but agreed to after a visit from Timberlake in her dressing room. BeyoncÃ©'s choreographer, Frank Gatson Jr., expressed mixed emotions at the result, saying: "I was upset because I know that Justin's a great dancer and if he learned the choreography, he could do it really well... If they're making parodies [of our work] just like they make parodies of politicians and presidents, that means it must be big time. So in that respect, I have to take my hat off to them for doing it." Later, Joe Jonas of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers posted a video on their YouTube account where he imitated the dance in a black leotard and heels. Irish pop duo Jedward parodied BeyoncÃ©'s dance moves for the video of their cover version of "All the Small Things". In London, one hundred dancers wearing leotards similar to the one worn by BeyoncÃ© performed the choreography on April 20, 2009, to promote Trident Unwrapped gum. On November 20, 2009, BBC Newsreaders including Fiona Bruce, Sophie Raworth, Kate Silverton, and Susanna Reid performed "Single Ladies" in black military-style uniforms. They were later joined onstage by their male newsreader colleagues Bill Turnbull, Ben Brown, Nicholas Owen, and Charlie Stayt before taking on Diversity, winners of the third series of "Britain's Got Talent", in a dance-off. They performed the choreography to raise funds for the UK campaign, "Children In Need".
