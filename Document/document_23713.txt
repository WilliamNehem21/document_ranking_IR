The anime's first season focuses on Tenma, Harima, and Karasuma, and Harima's relationships with other females including Sawachika and Yakumo. Its second season involves more of the secondary cast. The "Extra Class" OVAs are compiled from various first season storylines. Both the "Third Semester" synopses and episodes return to the main cast. The anime's structure has been compared to "Azumanga Daioh", with thematic influences from "Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu". In places it makes deliberate use of unconventional nomenclature; the title of episodeÂ 25 of season one is a set of pictograms, while episodeÂ 26's title has 187 characters in the Japanese original. In season two, the Japanese title for episodeÂ 26 consists of just a period.
The narrative of the "School Rumble" anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown from the perspective of its charactersânotably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affectionâthe anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episodeÂ 1 of season one. She notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase's inherent humor, those familiar with "Initial D" will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference. Lisa Marie comments "I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with "Initial D"s famous AE86 has a bit more cachet when you know why there's a cheesily rendered race car in slow moving Eurobeat."
