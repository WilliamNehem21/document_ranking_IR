In April 1914 Grainger gave his first execution of Delius' piano concerto, at a music celebration in Torquay. Thomas Beecham, who was one of the celebration's visitor conductors, answered to Delius that "Percy was great in the "strong point" entries, however made decidedly an excessive amount of commotion in the calmer bits". Grainger was accepting expanding acknowledgment as a writer; driving artists and symphonies were adding his attempts to their collections. His choice to leave England for America toward the beginning of September 1914, after the flare-up of the First World War, harmed his notoriety among his energetically disapproved of British companions. Grainger composed that the purpose behind this unexpected takeoff was "to give mother a change" Ã¢ÂÂ she had been unwell for a considerable length of time. Be that as it may, as indicated by Bird, Grainger frequently clarified that his explanation behind leaving London was that "he needed to rise as Australia's first writer of worth, and to have exposed himself to the likelihood of being executed would have rendered his objective unattainable". "The Daily Telegraph" music faultfinder Robin Legge blamed him for weakness, and let him know not to anticipate a welcome in England after the war, words that hurt Grainger profoundly.
