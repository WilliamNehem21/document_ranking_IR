The dromons that Procopius portrays were single-banked boats of most likely 50 paddles, orchestrated with 25 paddles on each side. Again not at all like Hellenistic vessels, which utilized an outrigger ("parexeiresia"), these all-encompassing straightforwardly from the body. In the later bireme dromons of the ninth and tenth hundreds of years, the two paddle banks ("elasiai") were separated by the deck, with the main paddle bank was arranged underneath, while the second paddle bank was arranged above deck; these rowers were relied upon to battle close by the marines in boarding tasks. Makrypoulias proposes 25 rowers underneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The general length of these boats was most likely around 32 meters. Albeit most contemporary vessels had a solitary pole ("histos" or "katartion"), the bigger bireme dromons likely required something like two poles so as to move viably, accepting that a solitary lateen sail for a ship this size would have achieved unmanageable measurements. The ship was directed by methods for two quarter rudders at the stern ("prymnÃÂ"), which likewise housed a tent ("skÃÂnÃÂ") that secured the commander's compartment ("krab(b)at(t)os"). The front ("prÃÂra") included a raised forecastle ("pseudopation"), underneath which the direct for the release of Greek flame anticipated, albeit optional siphons could likewise be conveyed amidships on either side. A pavesade ("kastellÃÂma"), on which marines could hang their shields, went around the sides of the ship, giving insurance to the deck team. Bigger ships additionally had wooden manors ("xylokastra") on either side between the poles, like those confirmed for the Roman liburnians, furnishing bowmen with raised terminating stages. The bow goad ("peronion") was proposed to ride over a foe ship's paddles, breaking them and rendering it powerless against rocket flame and boarding activities.
