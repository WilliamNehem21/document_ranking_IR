The underlying adaptation of WinFax just took a shot at fax modems containing a particular chipset, and was just fit for sending faxes; it couldn't get them. This was helped with the dispatch of the WinFax PRO 2.0 item amid the mid year of 1991. One of the key factors that separated this variant of WinFax from other fax programming bundles of the time was the purposeful endeavor to make the program perfect with all fax/modems. Before the presentation of WinFax PRO 2.0, contenders focused fundamentally on structure programming that would just work with a solitary brand of fax/modem equipment. While it propelled its WinFax PRO 2.0 item, Delrina likewise reported an OEM adaptation of a similar item intended to be packaged with new fax/modems. Inside a couple of months, eight modem makers had consented to package this OEM variant (called "WinFax LITE") of the program alongside their very own item. By the mid year of the next year this number had developed to 50 OEM associations with different fax-modem and PC framework makers to package the "Light" variant of Delrina's WinFax programming with their very own items. By February 1993 this number had developed to more than 100 OEM associations.
