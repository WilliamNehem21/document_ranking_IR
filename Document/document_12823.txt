Ward showed him phonetics and bored him with ear-preparing and translation works out. John Rupert Firth, who might later work at the University College Phonetics Department himself along Armstrong, was an understudy at University College from 1923 to 1924; the classes he took incorporated Armstrong's course in French Phonetics. In the mid year of 1934, Scottish phonetician J. C. Catford, at that point age 17, took a class in French phonetics educated by Armstrong and HÃÂ©lÃÂ¨ne Coustenoble. Armstrong showed propelled phonetics to American etymologist Lorenzo Dow Turner while he was doing postdoctoral research at the School of Oriental Studies from 1936 to 1937. French Canadian language specialist , who got his lords qualification concentrating under Armstrong in 1937 and later worked close by her, particularly brought up Armstrong's benevolence and articulatory ability. While Australian artistic researcher Robert Guy Howarth was concentrating for his doctorate in English from 1937 to 1938, he likewise got a testament in phonetics and took "A Course of General Phonetics", instructed by Armstrong and others.
