In April 1953, the Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) league was endorsed and Fred Gardiner was named as its first administrator. Its main goal from the begin was to assemble the framework expected to help the quickly developing rural areas, whose administrations couldn't manage the cost of the tasks and regularly differ on joint ventures. One of its first needs was to manufacture the Lakeshore Expressway, and its second street need was an interstate through the Don River valley. Gardiner was a noteworthy defender of structure a roadway through the valley, since his days during the 1940s with the Toronto and York Planning Board. At the time, engineers felt that building a six-path roadway was unfeasible because of the two vast slopes and a tight valley. Gardiner and T&Y Board (and later Metro Planning Board) director James Maher by and by strolled the course through the valley, deciding the works that would be expected to put the expressway through. "We'll move the railroad over a piece. We'll tear down the slope. We'll move the waterway over a piece, at that point we can have the parkway through there." Gardiner visited New York City in June 1954 to think about the city's roads and city parking areas. Gardiner contrasted the proposed Don Valley road with the picturesque Grand Central Parkway, and was cited as asserting that valleys like the Don are not ruined by blood vessel expressways, however embellished by them. The principal Metro staff review and plausibility investigation of the expressway's course was affirmed in late 1953, preceding the Metro government itself appeared in 1954.
