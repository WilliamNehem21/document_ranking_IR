"Slay Tracks" received generally positive reviews. Much of the initial critical reception to "Slay Tracks" was from zines to whom Kannberg had sent the EP. A review in the San Francisco-based zine "Maximum RocknRoll" said "Most of the tunes work by virtue of their eclecticism, freshness, and originalityâthis is a good one." The zine "Conflict" called the EP "absolutely perfect." "Slay Tracks" also received attention from mainstream publications. Robert Christgau of the "Village Voice" rated "Slay Tracks" an A-, and selected it as his fourth favorite EP of 1990. "Spin"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s review said: "a long stream of noise water is omitted by Pavement. ... What a party!" A reviewer for "Option" praised the band's lo-fi characteristics and attitude, calling the EP "loose and intentionally lo-fi," and saying "let's hope this Pavement stays cracked." "College Music Journal"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> review was also favorable, noting "You're Killing Me" and "She Believes" as highlights, and calling the EP a "deep, intoxicating breath of homemade music from people with tongues in their cheeks and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin engine feedback and fuzz hits dead center with naive melodic balance, and whether that is in spite of or because of the sloppy, one-take feel is inconsequential."
