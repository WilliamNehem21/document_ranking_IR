Deals were exceptionally great, and Ziff Davis was adequately inspired after just two issues to move the magazine from a quarterly to an every other month plan, and to switch "Astonishing" from mash arrangement to process size to coordinate "Phenomenal". Right away a while later the choice was taken to dispose of "Awesome Adventures": the March 1953 issue was the last, and the MayÃ¢ÂÂ June 1953 issue of "Phenomenal" included a notice of "Fabulous Adventures" to the masthead, however this stopped with the accompanying issue. Installment began at two pennies for every word for all rights, however could go up to ten pennies at the editorial manager's prudence; this place "Fabulous" in the second echelon of magazines, behind titles, for example, "Dumbfounding" and "Universe". The explore different avenues regarding quality fiction did not last. Course dropped, which prompted spending cuts, and thusly the nature of the fiction fell. Browne had needed to isolate "Incredible" from "Amazing"s mash roots, however at this point discovered he needed to print more sci-fi (sf) and less dream so as to draw in "Amazing"s perusers to its sister magazine. "Fantastic"s poor outcomes were presumably a result of an over-burden sf-magazine advertise: definitely a bigger number of magazines showed up in the mid 1950s than the market had the capacity to help. Ziff Davis deals staff had the capacity to help sell "Fabulous" and "Astounding" alongside the specialized magazines that it distributed, and the accessibility of a national deals arrange, despite the fact that it was not centered exclusively around "Phenomenal", without a doubt helped the magazine to endure.
