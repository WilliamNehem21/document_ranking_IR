The evening of 8 April 1917, as the Battle of Arras started, the tenth Battalion assaulted Louverval Wood, a station of the Hindenburg Line of German protections. McCann was injured in the neck amid the assault, and in the wake of having it swathed and being barely ready to talk, stayed with his troops for a few hours, and as indicated by the "Australian Dictionary of Biography", "was a motivation to his men". When the circumstance was clear, he detailed for therapeutic consideration and was emptied to medical clinic in England. Following a month and a half recovering, McCann rejoined his unit toward the finish of May, expecting direction of A Company. He stayed with the contingent all through the Battle of Passchendaele in Flanders from July to November 1917, including the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge in September, before being favored to a preparation legion in the United Kingdom in late December. He came back to his unit in June 1918. On 29 June, after the brigade had caught a segment of the German line utilizing "quiet entrance" strategies, McCann's organization was in the recently won positions when the Germans counter-assaulted and got between his propelled posts. He drove his organization signallers, delegates and hold unit forward into the hole. The Germans dropped their weapons, which incorporated an automatic rifle, and ran.
