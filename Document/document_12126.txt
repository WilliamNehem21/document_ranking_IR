In 1864 Wagner's money related position was changed by his new benefactor, the 18-year-old King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who satisfied the writer's obligations and granted him a liberal yearly stipend. Ludwig likewise given Wagner a lakeside retreat at Lake Starnberg, and a fantastic house in Munich. At Wagner's prompting, von BÃÂ¼low acknowledged a post as Ludwig's "regal piano player"; he and Cosima moved to Munich, and took a house advantageously near Wagner's, apparently so that Cosima could function as the author's secretary. From 29 June 1864 Cosima went through over seven days alone with Wagner at Lake Starnberg, before von BÃÂ¼low went along with them on 7 July. As per Wagner's servant, Anna Mrazek, "it was anything but difficult to tell that something was going on between Frau Cosima and Richard Wagner". Mrazek said that later in the visit von BÃÂ¼low discovered his significant other in Wagner's room, yet by the by made no requests for a clarification, either from Wagner or from his better half. Nine months after this visit, on 10 April 1865, Cosima brought forth a little girl, Isolde. Such was von BÃÂ¼low's dedication to Wagner that he acknowledged the tyke as his own, and enrolled her as "the authentic little girl" of Hans and Cosima von BÃÂ¼low. Wagner went to the Catholic absolution on 24 April. On 10 June 1865, at the Munich Hofoper, von BÃÂ¼low led the debut of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde".
