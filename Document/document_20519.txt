In 2006, Weems defended his 2003 assessment of "Eubrontes", and proposed an animal like "Dilophosaurus" as possible trackmaker of numerous "Kayentapus" trackways of the Culpeper Quarry in Virginia. Weems suggested rounded impressions associated with some of these trackways to represent hand impressions lacking digit traces, which he interpreted as a trace of quadrupedal movement. In 2009 the American paleontologists Andrew R.C. Milner and colleagues used the new combination "Kayentapus soltykovensis", and suggested that "Dilophosauripus" may not be distinct from "Eubrontes" and "Kayentapus". They suggested that the long claw marks that were used to distinguish "Dilophosauripus" may be an artifact of dragging. They found that "Gigandipus" and "Anchisauripus" tracks may likewise also just represent variations of "Eubrontes". They pointed out that differences between ichnotaxa may reflect how the track-maker interacted with the substrate rather than taxonomy. They also found "Dilophosaurus" a suitable match for a "Eubrontes" trackway and resting trace (SGDS.18.T1) from the St.George Dinosaur Discovery Site in the Moenave Formation of Utah, though the dinosaur itself is not known from the formation, which is slightly older than the Kayenta Formation. Weems stated in 2019 that "Eubrontes" tracks do not reflect the gracile feet of "Dilophosaurus", and argued they were instead made by the bipedal sauropodopormph "Anchisaurus".
