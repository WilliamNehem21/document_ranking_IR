The 2nd Raiders suffered 16Â killed and 17Â wounded (plus 2Â wounded native guides). Non-battle casualties totaled 225, of which 125Â suffered from malaria, 29 from dysentery, and 71 from ringworm or jungle rot. Most of the remaining raiders were also suffering some type of physical ailment. On 17 December, the raiders departed Guadalcanal by ship and arrived back at their home camp on Espiritu Santo on 20 December. At Espiritu Santo, the unit continued to be affected by the lingering tropical diseases many had contracted during the Guadalcanal patrol. In the second week of March 1943, the 2ndÂ Raiders were declared unfit for combat duty, although this finding was never announced in an official document. The 2nd Marine Raiders did not participate as a unit in a combat operation until the Bougainville campaign beginning on 1 November 1943. In spite of the high fallout from disease, Carlson's troops generally felt that they had performed well as a unit during the patrol and had accomplished their mission. Cleland E. Earlyâa lieutenant in Carlson's Company Eâdescribed the long Guadalcanal patrol and the effect on his unit: "Enduring the living conditions was worse than the combat. My platoon went in with 30Â men, one corpsman and one officer. When we came out we had one officer, one corpsman, and 18Â enlisted, all of whom had malaria, worms, diarrhea, jungle rot and high morale.
