The transformative improvement of the Komodo mythical beast began with the family "Varanus", which started in Asia around 40 million years prior and relocated to Australia, where it developed into monster frames (the biggest of all being the as of late wiped out "Megalania"), helped by the nonattendance of contending placental carnivorans. Around 15 million years prior, a crash among Australia and Southeast Asia permitted these bigger varanids to move once more into what is currently the Indonesian archipelago, expanding their range as far east as the island of Timor. The Komodo mythical serpent was accepted to have separated from its Australian precursors 4 million years back. Be that as it may, late fossil proof from Queensland recommends the Komodo mythical beast really advanced in Australia before spreading to Indonesia. Sensational bringing down of ocean level amid the last frosty period revealed broad stretches of mainland rack that the Komodo winged serpent colonized, getting to be disengaged in their present island run as ocean levels climbed thereafter. Wiped out Pliocene types of comparative size to the advanced Komodo mythical beast, for example, "Varanus sivalensis", have been found in Eurasia too, demonstrating that they fared well even in conditions containing rivalry, for example, mammalian carnivores until the environmental change and elimination occasions that denoted the start of the Pleistocene.
