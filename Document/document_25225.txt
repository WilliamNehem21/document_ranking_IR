The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1,183Â runs and take 142Â wickets; he was only the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000Â runs and take 100Â wickets in an English season as part of a touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15Â wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232Â runs at an average of 38.66. "Wisden" said of Trumble's batting that season, "[Trumble] played so consistently well as to make it clear that if he had not been a bowler he would have been a great batsman". Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but "Wisden" stated that he "bowled quite as well as in 1896" and "[he] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantageÂ ...Â he was deadly". Australia won the Second Test by 10Â wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5Â wickets for 60Â runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).
