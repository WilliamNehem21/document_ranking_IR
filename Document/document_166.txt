The maxilla was any longer than high, framing the vast majority of the skull's side surface, and to the front, a large portion of the lower edge of the narial opening. The narial opening was generally oval, with its long pivot (the longest stretch from its front to the back) being parallel with the lower edge of the maxilla. The side surface of the maxilla underneath the narial opening was secured with little pits and foramina (openings), as in "Byronosaurus", and the line of these was simply above and parallel to the edge of the tooth-push. The side surface of the maxilla had three huge, prolonged openings, called the foremost, maxillary, and . The foremost fenestra seems to have been totally encased by the maxilla, and there were two lines of little pits underneath it. The back of the maxillary fenestra had a hard divider called the interfenestral bar, which isolated it from the antorbital fenestra, as in "Byronosaurus". The antorbital fenestra (the biggest of the three openings, situated before the circle) was rectangular in side view, and the piece of the maxilla beneath it was low and did not have little foramina, in contrast to the front part. The maxillary teeth were set along the greater part of the lower edge of the antorbital fenestra. On the lower side, the maxilla framed a broad inside rack which added to a substantial (which isolated the nasal aviation routes from the mouth), broadening in reverse from the contact with the premaxilla. The front piece of the palatal rack had three little openings, and there was a line of (which enabled blood to supply the bone with supplements) in a section simply above and parallel to the tooth push edge.
