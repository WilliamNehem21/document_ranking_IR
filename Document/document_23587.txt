Over time, "Enter the Wu-Tang" became one of the most highly regarded albums in hip hop. The album was originally given a rating of 4.5 mics out of 5 in "The Source" magazine in 1994; however, it was given a classic 5 mic rating in a later issue of the magazine. Similar to "The Source", "XXL" magazine gave the album a classic rating of "XXL" in its retrospective 2007 issue. In the book "Spin Alternative Record Guide" (1995), "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" has a critical rating of 8/10 from "Spin". In 2003, "Rolling Stone" named the album among the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time", asserting that "East-coast hip-hop made a return in 1993." The magazine later listed it as one of the "Essential Albums of the 90s" and "100 Best Debut Albums of All Time." "The Source" cited "Enter the Wu-Tang" as one of the "100 Best Rap Albums", while also naming "Protect Ya Neck/Method Man" and "C.R.E.A.M." among the "100 Best Rap Singles". MTV declared it among "The Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time", while "Blender" named the album among the "500 CDs You Must Own". Oliver Wang, author of "Classic Material: The Hip-Hop Album Guide" described it "as timeless an album as hip-hop has ever seen."
