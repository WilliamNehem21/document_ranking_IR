Both "Surfer Rosa" and Steve Albini's generation of the collection have been powerful on elective shake, and on grunge specifically. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain refered to "Surfer Rosa" as the reason for "Nevermind"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s songwriting. When he previously heard the collection, Cobain found a layout for the blend of overwhelming clamor and pop he was planning to accomplish. He commented in 1992 that he "heard tunes off of "Surfer Rosa" that I'd composed yet tossed out in light of the fact that I was too hesitant to even think about playing them for anyone." Cobain procured Albini to deliver Nirvana's 1993 collection "In Utero", basically because of his commitment to "Surfer Rosa". The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan portrayed "Surfer Rosa" as "the one that influenced me to go, 'my goodness'. It was so new. It shook without being weak." Corgan was awed by the collection's drum sound, and recognized that The Smashing Pumpkins used to ponder the record for its specialized components. Performer PJ Harvey said that "Surfer Rosa" "took my breath away," and that she "promptly went to find Steve Albini." Cobain recorded "Surfer Rosa" as number 2 of the main 50 collections he thought were most compelling to Nirvana's sound in his diary in 1993.
