Writing for the journal "British Politics", academic Mark Garnett provided a detailed analysis of the Blair and Mandelson memoirs, observing that while "A Journey" gives a more in-depth account of what he termed "contemporary British government", "The Third Man" is a more satisfying read: ""The Third Man" was a worthwhile effort for Peter Mandelson's reputation, while Tony Blair has journeyed in vain." The "New Zealand Listener", on the other hand, suggested that "A Journey" and other memoirs written by prominent architects of New Labour had helped to seal its doom after David Miliband â the preferred candidate of all three as Brown's successor â failed to be elected to the position: "All three backed David Miliband, and however much Miliband tried to distance himself â I'm not New Labour, I'm Next Labour â these three books and the publicity that surrounded them showed he had New Labour dye all over his hands. David was beaten to the leadership by his younger brother, Ed (a man who lacked, as Blair himself might put it, the New Labour baggage), by a whisker â just over 1%. And at a stroke, it's clear these great, vocal proselytisers of New Labour have unwittingly written its epitaph."
