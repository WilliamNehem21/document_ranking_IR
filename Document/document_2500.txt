A formal conference on Legislative Route 279 and on the Ardath Road association with La Jolla was hung on NovemberÃÂ 15, 1961. At the conference, there were concerns communicated in regards to decimation of vegetation. City and state authorities demonstrated that the Soledad Freeway would be developed in the northern piece of the gulch to limit ecological harm. On NovemberÃÂ 9, 1966, the I-5 trade with Ardath Road opened at the western end of what might move toward becoming SRÃÂ 52. The first objective was to interface the exchange with San Clemente Canyon Road, which filled in as an ancestor to SRÃÂ 52; plans were to augment the way to four paths and assign it as SRÃÂ 52. The interfacing inclines were not opened that day on the grounds that the aluminum monitor rails had not been conveyed on schedule. Appraisals showed that every occupant of La Jolla would spare 80ÃÂ hours every year by utilizing Ardath Road. A slope from southbound I-5 to westward Ardath Road was never finished in view of a clip turn that would be essential because of the transcending precipice on the west side of I-5 that Ardath Road climbs as it proceeds to La Jolla. On NovemberÃÂ 18, San Clemente Canyon Road was associated with I-5 when the aluminum protect rails arrived and were accordingly introduced. San Clemente Canyon Road was not completely opened until 1967. That year, natives communicated resistance to the development of the Soledad Freeway since some needed the land to be utilized for a recreation center, and did not see the road as "fundamental."
