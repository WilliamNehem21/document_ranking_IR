"Stay High" received mostly positive reviews. Anita Moran of "The New Zealand Herald" wrote on her review of "Truth Serum" that it was the EP's best track. In a positive review, Tyler Almodovar of Raver Rafting stated that: "'Stay High' doesn't have any rapid build-ups or explosive drops, and it doesn't need them, its impactful moments are successful enough on their own." Furthermore, Almodovar included the track on his list of 10 Songs to Ease You Into EDM and said that the "soft bass and beautiful lyrics make it an appropriate introduction to the genre". Additionally, Lewis Corner of Digital Spy ranked it at number 14 on his list of the best singles of 2014, and Reed Fischer of "Rolling Stone" described it as a "sadness vs. inebriation tug-of-war". Neil McCormick of "The Daily Telegraph" called it a "radical remix" that reduced the original song to a "druggy wisp". However, "Stay High" also received mixed reviews. Amy Davidson of Digital Spy said that the original song was the "most satisfying". Miles Raymer of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that the original track was arguably better than the remix and expressed that the latter "lacks the directness" of the former. Kitty Empire of "The Guardian" criticized the singer's reworked vocals, saying that the remix "loops Lo's vocal into a chipmunky travesty ".
