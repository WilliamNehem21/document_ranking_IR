Hornung knew Doyle's sister, Constance ("Connie") AimÃÂ©e Monica Doyle (1868Ã¢ÂÂ 1924), whom he had met when he visited Portugal. Connie was depicted by Doyle's biographer, Andrew Lycett, as being appealing, "with pre-Raphaelite looksÃÂ ... the most looked for after of the Doyle little girls". By December 1892, when Hornung, Doyle and Jerome visited the Black Museum at Scotland Yard, Hornung and Connie were locked in, and in 1893 Hornung committed his second novel, "Small Luttrell", "to C.A.M.D." They were hitched on 27 September 1893, despite the fact that Doyle was not at the wedding and relations between the two essayists were now and then stressed. The Hornungs had a child, Arthur Oscar, in 1895; while his first name was from Doyle, who was likewise Arthur's back up parent, the kid's center name was presumably after Doyle and Hornung's shared companion Oscar Wilde and it was by his second name that he was known. In 1894 Doyle and Hornung started take a shot at a play for Henry Irving, regarding the matter of boxing amid the Regency; Doyle was at first enthusiastic and paid Hornung ÃÂ£50 as an initial installment before he pulled back after the principal demonstration had been composed: the work was never finished.
