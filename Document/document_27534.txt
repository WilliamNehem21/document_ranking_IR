The northern voalavo has been found only in two massifs of the Northern Highlands, Anjanaharibe-Sud and Marojejy, but may range more widely. At Anjanaharibe-Sud, the species has been found in wet mountain forest at , where it occurred with the indigenous rodents Major's tufted-tailed rat and island mouse as well as the introduced black rat ("Rattus rattus"), and in drier forest at about , where it may live alongside other species of "Eliurus" and Voalavoanala. The Marojejy records come from similar habitats at above sea level.
The northern voalavo probably largely lives on the ground, but is able to climb in vegetation. It likes areas with dense networks of roots, among which it moves using runways and natural tunnels. The species is nocturnal (active during the night), is solitary, probably eats fruits and seeds, and bears up to three young per litter.
A variety of parasitic arthropods have been recorded on northern voalavo: mites from the families Laelapidae and Trombiculidae (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), the demodicid mite "Demodex" (Marojejy only), the atopomelid mite "Listrophoroides" (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), and unidentified sucking lice (Anjanaharibe-Sud only). In 2007, a laelapid mite found on "V.Â gymnocaudus" in Anjanaharibe-Sud was described as a new species, "Andreacarus voalavo". The apicomplexan parasite "Eimeria" has also been recorded in Anjanaharibe-Sud.
