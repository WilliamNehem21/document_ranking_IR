Berger embraced a few different jobs in the last phases of the war, while proceeding as head of the SS-HA. He had a key job in the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories from mid-1942, enabling the SS to coordinate a great part of the monetary action in the east. In this job he proposed an arrangement to seize and subjugate 50,000 Eastern European kids between the ages of 10 and 14, under the codename "Heuaktion", an arrangement that was in this way completed. In light of the Slovak National Uprising in August 1944, Berger was named as Military Commander in Slovakia, and was in control amid the underlying inability to stifle the revolt. The next month he was selected as one of the two head of staff of the "Volkssturm" volunteer army, and as head of the captive camps. In the last a long time of the war he told German powers in the Bavarian Alps, which included remainders of a few of the "Waffen-SS" units he had helped select. He surrendered to U.S. troops close Berchtesgaden, and was quickly captured. He was attempted and sentenced in the Ministries Trial of the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunals for atrocities, and was condemned to 25 years detainment. His sentence was before long decreased to 10 years, and he was discharged subsequent to serving six-and-a-half years. After discharge he pushed for the restoration of the "Waffen-SS" and worked in a few assembling organizations. He passed on in the place where he grew up in 1975.
