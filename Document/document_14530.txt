Be that as it may, the Rashtrakuta lords additionally disparaged Hinduism's devotees of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta beliefs. Practically the majority of their engravings start with a summon to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan engravings recount King Amoghavarsha I giving up a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi sanctuary at Kolhapur to turn away a catastrophe in his kingdom.

An early copper plate concede of King Dantidurga (753) demonstrates a picture of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend "Parama Maheshwara" (another name for Shiva). The rulers' titles, for example, "Veeranarayana" demonstrated their Vaishnava leanings. Their banner had the indication of the Ganges and Yamuna waterways, maybe replicated from the Badami Chalukyas. The renowned Kailasnatha sanctuary at Ellora and other shake slice caverns ascribed to them demonstrate that the Hinduism was thriving. Their family divinity was a goddess by name "Latana" (otherwise called "Rashtrashyena", "Manasa" "Vindyavasini") who appeared as a bird of prey to spare the kingdom. They assembled sanctuaries with symbols and ornamentation that fulfilled the requirements of various beliefs. The sanctuary at Salotgi was intended for devotees of Shiva and Vishnu and the sanctuary at Kargudri was intended for admirers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (Surya, the sun god).
