The segment of SRÃÂ 75 from Pomona Avenue in Coronado to Imperial Beach was likewise prescribed to turn into a beautiful parkway in February 1974. Future upgrades to the Imperial Beach Ã¢ÂÂ Coronado partition were dropped in April. In 1976, the California State Legislature renumbered the segment from I-5 to SRÃÂ 125 as SRÃÂ 117, which later progressed toward becoming SR 905. The change produced results toward the start of 1977. The renumbering was to diminish perplexity with the Coronado divide, as indicated by Caltrans territorial chief Jacob Dekema; new signs were to be established presently. The extension and the subsequent traffic kept on being a fervently discussed issue in the mid 1980s. An arrangement in 1981 to change over Fourth Street into a freeway prompting the maritime station was emphatically restricted by general society because of the required devastation of structures and an absence of proof that the arrangement would prevail with regards to lessening traffic; at this point, Third and Fourth roads had been changed over into single direction boulevards between the scaffold and the maritime station. A noteworthy remodel of the extension was booked for late 1992, which would incorporate a portable hindrance to avoid head-on crashes and important reemerging of the roadway. Work was in progress in January 1993 on the $4ÃÂ million venture (about $ in dollars), however it was behind the three-month plan by 11ÃÂ days because of precipitation and was required to be finished by March.
