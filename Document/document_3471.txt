The loss of Schmitt was a huge hit to the Austrian military association. Gotten out of retirement for this particular assignment, he was the most experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second just to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Moreover, he was a confided in individual from Archduke Charles' staff. He had structured a few of Charles' increasingly vital triumphs at Emmendingen, Schliengen, the attacks at Kehl and HÃÂ¼nigen, the fights at Ostrach and Stockach, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included fights at Winterthur and ZÃÂ¼rich. An accomplished officer and superb strategist, he may well have made a progressively compelling Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his possible substitution, Franz von Weyrother. In Schmitt's nonappearance, Weyrother, the draftsman of the Austrian fiasco at Hohenlinden in 1800, was picked to build up the general fight plan of Coalition activity at Austerlitz. Schmitt, without a doubt an obviously better strategist than Weyrother, and holder of prevalent preparing and mapping abilities, would have built up a progressively sensible Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's quality would likely not have been sufficient to transform that rout into a triumph, however it would have alleviated the size of the Coalition's misfortunes; Austerlitz was viewed as one of Napoleon's best triumphs.
