The whole thirteenth Red Army slowed down due to its thrashing at Radzymin. After that achievement the Poles gradually however relentlessly drove the Soviets back past the main line of barriers that had been overwhelm a few days prior. Before the finish of 16 August, the 28th and 30th Infantry Regiments kept an eye on the majority of the channel line along the RzÃÂdza River, close to the town of DybÃÂ³w. Albeit at first the Russian direction needed to utilize the edges of Radzymin as a turn for a strategic withdrawal to the RadzyminÃ¢ÂÂ BrzeÃÂÃÂ line, the next day the Soviet authority requested a full retreat towards WyszkÃÂ³w and later Grodno. In the interim, PiÃÂsudski's fourth Army outmaneuvered the astounded Russians and went as far north as the left wing of Nikolai Sollogub's sixteenth Red Army, which around then was always constrained from the front by the tenth and fifteenth divisions. This made existing Russian arrangements out of date, and Polish powers began an interest that finished with the triumphant Battle of the Niemen River in September. Upon the arrival of Polish triumph the Soviets issued a publicity blurb in Moscow announcing: "Warsaw has fallen. With it the Poland of yesterday moved toward becoming history. It is only a legend now while reality of today is the red reality. Long live the Soviets! Long live the powerful Red Army!"
