This environment was dominated by pterosaurs, including: "Anhanguera", "Araripedactylus", "Araripesaurus", "Brasileodactylus", "Cearadactylus", "Coloborhynchus", "Santanadactylus", "Tapejara", "Thalassodromeus", "Tupuxuara", "Barbosania", "Maaradactylus", "Tropeognathus", and "Unwindia." The known dinosaur fauna besides "Irritator" was represented by other theropods like the tyrannosauroid "Santanaraptor," the compsognathid "Mirischia," an indeterminate unenlagiine dromaeosaurid, and a megaraptoran. The crocodyliforms "Araripesuchus" and "Caririsuchus", as well as the turtles "Brasilemys", "Cearachelys," "Araripemys", "Euraxemys", and "Santanachelys", are known from the deposits. There were also clam shrimps, sea urchins, ostracods, and molluscs. Various well-preserved fish fossils record the presence of: hybodont sharks, guitarfish, gars, amiids, ophiopsids, oshuniids, pycnodontids, aspidorhynchids, cladocyclids, bonefishes, chanids, mawsoniids and some uncertain forms. According to Naish and colleagues, the lack of herbivorous dinosaurs could mean that the local vegetation was scant and thus incapable of sustaining a large population of them. The abundant carnivorous theropods would have then likely turned to the lush aquatic life as a primary food source. They also hypothesized that following storm events, pterosaur and fish carcasses might have washed up on the shoreline, providing theropods with plenty of carrion. Multiple piscivorous animals were present in the formation, which might in theory have led to high competition. Aureliano and colleagues stated there must have, therefore, been some degree of niche partitioning, where different animals would have fed on prey of varied sizes and locations within the lagoon.
