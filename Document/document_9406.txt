Coming back to Australia, Headlam moved toward becoming Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) on 26ÃÂ January 1965. He was named a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) "in acknowledgment of recognized administration in the Borneo Territories" on 22ÃÂ June. His residency as DCAS concurred with the most critical rearmament program the Air Force had embraced since World WarÃÂ II, and with labor deficiencies coming from this extension and from Australia's expanding association in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were focused on the Vietnam War towards the finish of his term, and he made a trip to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to design the arrangement. The prior year, Wilton had prescribed to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for acclimation purposes; Murdoch had repelled Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its military co-activity job when it at last deployed. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8ÃÂ August 1966. Bolster Command had been framed in 1959, by blending the RAAF's previous Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1ÃÂ January 1968, Headlam was presented on London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He filled in as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17ÃÂ November 1970 to 5ÃÂ June 1971.
