In "Groucho and Me", Groucho Marx called Skelton "the most unacclaimed jokester in Broadway", and "the legitimate successor to [Charlie] Chaplin", to a great extent due to his capacity to play a huge number of characters with insignificant utilization of exchange and props. "With one prop, a delicate battered cap", Groucho composed, portraying an execution he had seen, "he effectively changed over himself into a blockhead kid, an irritable old woman, a wavering tottering alcoholic, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and whatever other character that appeared to suit his extravagant. No unusual make-up, no interesting garments, simply Red." He included that Skelton likewise "plays an emotional scene about as viably as any of the sensational on-screen characters." In late 1965 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, thinking back about the stimulation business, singled out Skelton for high applause. "It's everything so altogether different today. The entire business of satire has changed Ã¢ÂÂ from 15 minutes of value to amount. We had a ton of extremely amusing individuals around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton." Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures likewise lauded Skelton, saying, "He's a jokester in the old convention. He needn't bother with turns of phrase. He has heart."
