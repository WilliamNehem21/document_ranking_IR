Ten minutes after the French opened flame "Goliath", overlooking flame from the fortification to starboard and from "Guerrier" to port, the majority of which was too high to even think about troubling the ship, crossed the leader of the French line. Chief Thomas Foley had seen as he moved toward that there was a sudden hole among "Guerrier" and the shallow water of the shore. All alone activity, Foley chose to abuse this strategic mistake and changed his point of way to deal with sail through the hole. As the bow of "Guerrier" went in close vicinity to run, "Goliath" opened shoot, incurring extreme harm with a twofold shotted raking broadside as the British ship swung to port and go down the ill-equipped port side of "Guerrier." Foley's Royal Marines and an organization of Austrian grenadiers joined the assault, discharging their flintlocks. Foley had proposed to stay nearby the French ship and connect with it intently, yet his grapple took too long to even consider descending and his ship passed "Guerrier" altogether. "Goliath" in the end halted near the bow of "ConquÃÂ©rant", starting to shoot at the new adversary and utilizing the unengaged starboard firearms to trade periodic shots with the frigate "SÃÂ©rieuse" and bomb vessel "Hercule," which were tied down inshore of the fight line.
