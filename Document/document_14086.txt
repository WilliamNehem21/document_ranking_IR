Aside from a couple of conceivable glyphs cut in stone (see petroglyphs), every enduring content are engraved in wood. As per custom, the tablets were made of toromiro wood. In any case, Orliac (2005) analyzed seven items (tablets B, C, G, H, K, Q, and "reimiro" L) with stereo optical and examining electron magnifying lens and established that all were rather produced using Pacific rosewood "(Thespesia populnea)"; a similar ID had been made for tablet M in 1934. This 15-meter tree, known as "Pacific rosewood" for its shading and called "mako'i" in Rapanui, is utilized for consecrated forests and carvings all through eastern Polynesia and was obviously conveyed to Easter Island by the principal pioneers. Nonetheless, not all the wood was local: Orliac (2007) built up that tablets N, P, and S were made of South African Yellowwood "(Podocarpus latifolius)" and hence that the wood had landed with Western contact. Fischer depicts P as "a harmed and reshapen European or American paddle", similar to A (which is European cinder, "Fraxinus excelsior") and V; noticed that wood from the disaster area of a Western vessel was said to have been utilized for some tablets; and that both P and S had been reused as planking for a Rapanui driftwood kayak, proposing that at that point the tablets had little an incentive to the islanders as writings. A few writings, including O, are cut on contorted driftwood. The way that the islanders were decreased to engraving driftwood, and were notwithstanding very efficient in their utilization of wood, may have had ramifications for the structure of the content, for example, the wealth of ligatures and possibly a transmitted style of composing that would convolute printed examination.
