A recurring race in the games are god-like beings created by Pulse and Lindzei to act as their servants in the mortal world. In the original mythos and the "XIII" games, the demigods are called fal'Cie . They take the form of crystal-powered mechanical beings in the "XIII" games. In the universe of "Type-0", they are both semi-sentient crystals and humanoid beings living among the people. The fal'Cie have the ability to imbue chosen humans with magical powers and assign them a task to complete either willingly or unwillingly. "Final Fantasy XIII" and "Type-0" refer to these people as l'Cie and the task given to them as a Focus. In the worlds of "XIII" and "Type-0", there are two possible outcomes for l'Cie: once their Focus is fulfilled, they can go into 'crystal stasis', transforming into a crystal statue, and gain eternal life, but if they fail they become mindless crystalline monsters. In "Type-0", l'Cie are chosen by the crystal of their country, and given great power to fulfill their assigned Focus, but lose their memories if emotionally unstable. While not referred to as such using the original terminology, humans imbued with magic and burdened with a task exist in "Final Fantasy XV", one of them being the main protagonist Noctis.
