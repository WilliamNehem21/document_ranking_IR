There were sets of divine beings for the hours of the day and night and for every nome (territory) of Egypt. A portion of these gatherings contain a particular, emblematically imperative number of divinities. Combined divine beings once in a while have comparable jobs, as do Isis and her sister Nephthys in their security and backing of Osiris.
