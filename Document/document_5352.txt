In 1760, de Henouville endeavored to decrease alumina to its metal, however with no achievement. He asserted he had attempted each strategy for decrease known at the time, however his strategies were not distributed. It is likely that he blended alum with carbon or some natural substance, with salt or soft drink for transition, and warmed it in a charcoal flame. In 1790, Austrian scientific experts Anton Leopold Ruprecht and Matteo Tondi rehashed Baron's tests, essentially expanding the temperatures. They discovered little metallic particles they accepted were the looked for after metal; however later tests by different scientists demonstrated these were iron phosphide from polluting influences in charcoal and bone cinder. German scientific expert Martin Heinrich Klaproth remarked in a repercussions, "if there exists an earth which has been placed in conditions where its metallic nature ought to be uncovered, on the off chance that it had such, an earth presented to tests reasonable for diminishing it, tried in the most sultry flames by a wide range of techniques, on an extensive just as on a little scale, that earth is unquestionably alumina, yet nobody has yet seen its metallization." Lavoisier in 1794 and French physicist Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau in 1795 liquefied alumina to a white finish in a charcoal flame bolstered by unadulterated oxygen yet found no metal. American physicist Robert Hare in 1802 dissolved alumina with an oxyhydrogen blowpipe, likewise acquiring the lacquer, yet at the same time found no metal.
