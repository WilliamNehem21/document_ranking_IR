Costly and expand ornamentation was an essential piece of a ship's appearance during the 1660s, despite the fact that it had been disentangled since the mid seventeenth century. Such ornamentation was accepted to upgrade the expert of outright rulers and to depict the ship as an image of military ability and regal specialist. There are no contemporary representations of the ornamentation of "Kronan", yet as per regular practice it was most sumptuous on the transom, the level surface confronting rearward. There are two pictures of "Kronan" appeared from the stern by two Danish specialists. The two works were dispatched numerous years after the sinking to remember the Danish triumph. Claus MÃÂ¸inichen's artwork at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 demonstrates a transom commanded by two lions widespread holding up a colossal imperial crown. The foundation is blue with models and decorations in gold. Swedish workmanship student of history Hans Soop, who has recently considered the models of "Vasa", a glory ship of Gustavus Adolphus' naval force that sank just 20 minutes into her first venture in Stockholm in 1628, has proposed that MÃÂ¸inichen may have purposefully misrepresented the span of the ship to upgrade the Danish triumph. A woven artwork at Rosenborg Castle demonstrates "Kronan" as a two-decker with a crown theme that is considerably bigger than MÃÂ¸inichen's sketch.
