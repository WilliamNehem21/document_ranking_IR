Australian maritime students of history David Stevens and Tom Frame differ on what occurred straightaway. Stevens expresses that Cumberledge amassed the ship's organization in the early evening, read the "Articles of War", addressed them on the reality of denying obligation, at that point requested the stokers to go to their stations, which they did compliantly. Edge guarantees the stokers came back to obligation unreservedly once the battlecruiser was in progress, before Cumberledge cleared lower deck and addressed the mariners. In the wake of tending to the mariners, Cumberledge accumulated the ship's senior officers for a request. Five men, including the Victoria Cross candidate from the Zeebrugge strike, were accused of prompting a rebellion and captured pending a court-military, which was held on board on 20 June, after "Australia" touched base in Sydney. The decision was that the five men had "joined an insurrection, not joined by savagery", and they were condemned to detainment in Goulburn Gaol: two for a year, one for eighteen months, and two for a long time with hard work. Various different mariners were accused of taking an interest in an uprising, however once more, Stevens and Frame differ on subtleties: the previous cases 7 men were effectively charged, while the last says 32 mariners were in this manner absolved of insurrection, yet then effectively accused of denying obligation. The two creators concur that these men were attempted by the skipper while "Australia" was as yet adrift, and rebuffed with 90 days each in cells.
