A major training cruise followed the next month; on 10 May the ships departed the Elbe river and made their way into the Atlantic. They cruised south to Spain, passing Ushant on 14 May and reaching the Iberian Peninsula five days later. There, they conducted a reconnaissance exercise off Pontevedra before anchoring in Vigo on 20 May. The squadron departed Spain on 30 May. The ships passed through the Strait of Dover on 3 June and continued into the Kattegat. There, they rendezvoused with the torpedo boats of the I "Torpedobootsflotille" (Torpedo Boat Flotilla)âcommanded by "KorvettenkapitÃ¤n" (Lieutenant Commander) Franz von Hipperâfor a mock attack on the fortifications at Kiel.
