In the midst of developing French and US suspicion of his capacity to give stable standard, DiÃ¡Â»Âm constrained the issue to a head in April 1955. He requested the BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn to surrender control of the National Police and submit to his order by incorporating into the VNA or disbanding, taking steps to pound them on the off chance that they can't. He paid off HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o and Cao ÃÂÃÂ i authorities into joining the VNA, bit by bit bringing about the abandonment of certain administrators and their units, while others kept on driving their powers against Saigon. The BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn opposed DiÃ¡Â»Âm's final offer. On 27 April, the VNA started the Battle for Saigon. After a brief yet vicious fight that left somewhere in the range of 500 and 1,000 individuals dead and around 20,000 destitute, the BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn were squashed. DiÃ¡Â»Âm had recovered both U.S. certainty and control of the police. Euphoric groups commended DiÃ¡Â»Âm and decried BÃ¡ÂºÂ£o ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¡i, who had attempted to reject him amidst the fight to keep him from controlling the BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn. Also, General Paul Ely, the leader of the French nearness in Vietnam, endeavored to obstruct DiÃ¡Â»Âm; his troops put barriers against the VNA and offered knowledge to the BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn.
