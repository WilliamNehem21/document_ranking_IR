The eating regimen and method of rummaging portrayed by Feuilley matches that of an ibis, while individuals from the Raphinae are known to have been natural product eaters. The species was named a land-winged creature by Dubois, so it didn't live in ordinary ibis environments, for example, wetlands. It has been recommended this is on the grounds that the precursors of the fledgling colonized RÃÂ©union before bogs had created, and had consequently turned out to be adjusted to the accessible natural surroundings. They were maybe kept from colonizing Mauritius too because of the nearness of red rails there, which may have involved a comparative specialty. It seems to have lived in high elevations, and maybe had a constrained dissemination. Records by early guests demonstrate the species was found close to their arrival locales, however they were discovered just in remote places by 1667. The winged animal may have made due in eastern swamps until the 1670s. Despite the fact that numerous late seventeenth century accounts express the fledgling was great sustenance, Feuilley expressed it tasted terrible. This might be on the grounds that it changed its eating regimen when it moved to increasingly tough, higher territory, to escape pigs that wrecked its homes; since it had restricted flight abilities, it likely settled on the ground.
