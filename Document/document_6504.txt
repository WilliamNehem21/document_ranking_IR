The genealogical types of the family "Cucurbita" were available in the Americas before the landing of people, and are local to the New World. The presumable focal point of root is southern Mexico, spreading south through what is currently known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is presently the southwestern United States. Developmentally, the sort is moderately later in starting point, going back just to the Holocene, though the family Cucurbitaceae, in the state of seeds like "Bryonia", dates to the Paleocene. No species inside the sort is altogether hereditarily secluded. "C.ÃÂ moschata" can intercross with all the others, however the cross breed posterity may not themselves be prolific except if they turned out to be polyploid. The sort was a piece of the way of life of pretty much every local people groups assemble from southern South America to southern Canada. Cutting edge developed "Cucurbita" are not found in nature. Hereditary investigations of the mitochondrial quality "nad1" appear there were somewhere around six free taming occasions of "Cucurbita" isolating household species from their wild predecessors. Species local to North America incorporate "C.ÃÂ digitata" (calabazilla), and "C.ÃÂ foetidissima" (wild ox gourd), "C.ÃÂ palmata" (coyote melon), and "C.ÃÂ pepo". A few animal groups, for example, "C.ÃÂ digitata" and "C.ÃÂ ficifolia," are alluded to as "gourds". Gourds, likewise called jug gourds, which are utilized as utensils or vessels, have a place with the class "Lagenaria" and are local to Africa. "Lagenaria" are in a similar family and subfamily as "Cucurbita" however in an alternate clan.
