Notwithstanding the unpromising association with the military, Kinkaid's most troublesome subordinate was a U.S. Naval force officer, as had been the situation with Rockwell in the Aleutians. This time, the subordinate was Rear Admiral Ralph W. Christie, the officer of Task Force 71, the Seventh Fleet's submarines. Christie ordinarily welcomed a returning submarine at the dock and granted improvements on the spot. This training circumvent military and maritime honor loads up, and irritated Kinkaid in light of the fact that affirmation of sinkings was cultivated by Ultra, and updates on honors given so rapidly could establish a security break. Kinkaid gave Christie and his different subordinates orders restricting pierside grants, and the honor of armed force awards to naval force staff. In June 1944, Christie went with a war watch on Commander Samuel D. Dealey's submarine . A short time later, Christie met with MacArthur and related the occasions of the war watch to the general, who chose to grant Dealey the Distinguished Service Cross and Christie the Silver Star. Whenever "Harder" was lost with Dealey and all hands on its next watch, Christie prescribed Dealey for the Medal of Honor. Kinkaid turned down the proposal in light of the fact that Dealey had effectively gotten the Distinguished Service Cross for a similar watch. Infuriated, Christie sent a dispatch to Kinkaid in an effectively understandable low-request code that condemned him and encouraged him to reevaluate. Angry with both Christie's frame of mind and his misfortunes, which included Dealey and Kinkaid's nephew, Lieutenant Commander Manning Kimmel on in July 1944, Kinkaid mentioned Christie's help. On 30 December 1944, Christie was supplanted by Captain James Fife Jr.
