Unthinkable, referred to in Madagascar as "fady", offers security for the fossa and different carnivores. In the Marolambo District (some portion of the Atsinanana area in Toamasina Province), the fossa has generally been detested and dreaded as a hazardous creature. It has been depicted as "voracious and forceful", known for taking fowl and piglets, and accepted to "go for little youngsters who stroll alone into the timberland". Some don't eat it for dread that it will exchange its bothersome characteristics to any individual who expends it. Notwithstanding, the creature is additionally taken for bushmeat; an examination distributed in 2009 announced that 57ÃÂ percent of towns (8 of 14 inspected) in the Makira woodland expend fossa meat. The creatures were ordinarily chased utilizing slingshots, with canines, or most generally, by putting catch traps on creature ways. Close Ranomafana National Park, the fossa, alongside a few of its littler cousins and the presented little Indian civet ("Viverricula indica"), are known to "rummage on the assemblages of progenitors", which are covered in shallow graves in the timberland. Therefore, eating these creatures is carefully precluded by "fady". In any case, in the event that they meander into towns looking for residential fowl, they might be executed or caught. Little meat eater traps have been seen close chicken keeps running in the town of Vohiparara.
