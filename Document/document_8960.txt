The passage to the vestry is situated toward the finish of the correct side walkway beside the choir; toward the finish of the left side path is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The sanctuary is arranged on the church's raised area. The congregation's fundamental special stepped area is looked with a dim green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, just as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a gift from the Diocese of Verona. The amboÃ¢ÂÂa projection turning out from the soleasÃ¢ÂÂis on the correct side of the raised area, and is looked with a similar marble. Behind the special stepped area, on the mass of the apse, there is a nine-meter high stone cross with a three-meter high figure of Christ. Mortar figures portraying the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by draftsman Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are situated on the left and the correct sides (separately) of the corbels. On the contrary side of the raised area or more the house of God's vestibule is the organ space, which had initially space for 50ÃÂ choristers; a substantial piece of it is currently involved by the organ.
