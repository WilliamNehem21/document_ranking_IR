By 1900, just a short stretch of the DetroitÃ¢ÂÂ Howell Plank Road was as yet made of boards; the vast majority of the other board streets had been changed over to rock at this point. On May 13, 1913, the Michigan Legislature passed the "State Reward Trunk Line Highway Act" (Public Act 334 of 1913) that made the first state thruway framework. In that demonstration, Grand River Avenue among Detroit and Grand Rapids was incorporated as DivisionÃÂ 9 of the framework. The state thruways were signposted beginning in 1919, and on the principal maps distributed on July 1 of that year, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had connected the M-16 number to Grand River Avenue over the state between Grand Haven and Detroit. M-16 was rerouted in the Lansing territory in 1925, running along Grand River Avenue from Grand Ledge to East Lansing. The previous directing through Downtown Lansing on Michigan Avenue turned out to be a piece of M-39 and the area north of Grand Ledge was inevitably redesignated M-100. A second realignment moved M-16 to pursue Grand River Avenue from Ionia through Ada. The previous arrangement turned into a piece of M-21. On August 7, 1926, the state finished clearing on M-16, opening it to traffic as "the main cleared expressway over the state".
