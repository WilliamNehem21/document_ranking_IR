The Germans' primary focal point of consideration changed rather to "Schotterwerk Nordwest", the previous quarry at adjacent Wizernes, where work had been continuous to assemble a bombproof V-2 storeroom. This task was extended to transform the quarry into a fixed dispatch office. Plans were put into impact to assemble a colossal cement domeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ now open to people in general as the historical center of La CoupoleÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ under which rockets would be fuelled and equipped in a system of passages before being transported outside for propelling. The Allies did facilitate overwhelming shelling against both the Watten and Wizernes destinations with minimal starting impact on the structures themselves, in spite of the fact that the rail and street arrange around them was methodicallly demolished. On 3 July 1944, Oberkommando West offered consent to stop development at the two locales, which had been so disturbed by bombarding that work could never again continue. After three days an Allied strike prevailing with regards to destroying the inside of the Watten dugout with a Tallboy bomb that cut down piece of the rooftop. At long last, on 18 July 1944, Hitler announced that plans for propelling rockets from dugouts need never again be sought after. Dornberger's staff along these lines chose to proceed with minor development at Watten "for trickiness purposes". The site itself was presently pointless, as the Germans perceived when they wryly codenamed it "Solid Lump", and the fluid oxygen generators and apparatus were exchanged to the Mittelwerk V-2 production line in focal Germany, well far from Allied aircraft.
