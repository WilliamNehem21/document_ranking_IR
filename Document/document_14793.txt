In the mean time, on 4 February, Mackay and his gathering (Murray and Beuchat, joined via sailor Stanley Morris) declared they were leaving the following day, to look for land. Mackay gave Bartlett a letter dated 1 February that started: "We, the undersigned, with regards to the present basic circumstance, want to make an endeavor to achieve the land." The letter mentioned fitting supplies, and finished up by accentuating that the adventure was alone activity and pardoning Bartlett from all duties. Bartlett distributed them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammo and sustenance for 50 days. They left on 5 February; the last locating of them was a couple of days after the fact, by Chafe and the Inuit, coming back from their unsuccessful outing to Herald Island. They discovered Mackay's gathering attempting to make progress, with a portion of their arrangements lost and dress and other hardware disposed of to relieve their burden. Beuchat specifically was in an upset state, about woozy and in the throes of hypothermia. Be that as it may, the gathering declined help and rejected Chafe's supplications that they come back with him to Shipwreck Camp. From that point the main trace of their destiny was a mariner's scarf having a place with Morris, later discovered covered in an ice floe. It was expected that the four had either been pounded by the ice, or had fallen through it.
