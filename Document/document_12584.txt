Amid the principal decade of his standard, Selvo's arrangements were to a great extent a continuation of those of Domenico Contarini. There were not many furnished clashes at home or abroad, and the Doge appreciated a time of fame because of the prosperous financial conditions. The relations with the Holy Roman Empire were bit by bit fortified to a dimension obscure since the rule of the last Orseolo through moderately unhindered commerce and the great relationship that Selvo kept up with Emperor Henry IV. The significance of the financial partnership between the two countries turned out to be progressively vital when the generally shared intensity of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope was tested by the Investiture Controversy between Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. Selvo needed to walk a very tight line of contending needs. From one perspective, he needed to keep up the exchange understanding Venice had with the grounds involved by Henry IV, however then again, Venetians were religiously faithful to Roman Catholicism instead of the Eastern Orthodoxy. At the stature of the debate, Pope Gregory VII secretly took steps to ban Selvo and put a prohibit on the Venetian Republic, however Selvo had the capacity to barely get away from this by strategically affirming Venice's religious power as the presumed holders of the remaining parts of St Mark.
