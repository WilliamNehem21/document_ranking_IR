By 11:30ÃÂ pm on May 9, the men had gathered at Hand's Cove (in what is presently Shoreham, Vermont) and were prepared to cross the lake to Ticonderoga. Be that as it may, water crafts did not touch base until 1:30ÃÂ am, and they were deficient to convey the entire power. Eighty-three of the Green Mountain Boys made the main intersection with Arnold and Allen, and Douglas returned for the rest. As first light drew nearer, Allen and Arnold wound up dreadful of losing the component of amazement, so they chose to assault with the current men. The main guard on obligation at the south entryway fled his post after his black powder gun fizzled, and the Americans raced into the fortification. The Patriots at that point awakened the modest number of dozing troops at gunpoint and started appropriating their weapons. Allen, Arnold, and a couple of other men energized the stairs toward the officers' quarters. Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the associate to Captain William Delaplace, was stirred by the clamor, and called to wake the commander. Slowing down for time, Feltham requested to know by what specialist the post was being entered. Allen, who later asserted that he said it to Captain Delaplace, answered, "for the sake of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!" Delaplace at long last rose up out of his chambers (completely dressed, not with "his breeches in his grasp", as Allen would later say) and surrendered his sword.
