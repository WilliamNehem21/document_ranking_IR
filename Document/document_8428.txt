At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was welcomed as a legend by representatives who considered him to be the gathering's future. In the wake of being designated for a second term, Agnew conveyed an acknowledgment discourse concentrated on the organization's achievements, and stayed away from his typical cutting denunciation, however he denounced McGovern for supporting transporting, and affirmed that McGovern, whenever chose, would ask the North Vietnamese for the arrival of American detainees of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the crusade; for once, Agnew's rejection from Nixon's inward hover worked to support him, as he knew nothing of the issue until perusing of it in the press, and after gaining from Jeb Magruder that organization authorities were in charge of the break-in, cut off dialog of the issue. He saw the break-in as silly, and felt that both significant gatherings routinely kept an eye on one another. Nixon had taught Agnew not to assault McGovern's underlying running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton pulled back in the midst of disclosures worried past emotional wellness treatment, Nixon recharged those guidelines for previous diplomat Sargent Shriver, who had turned into the new possibility for Vice President.
