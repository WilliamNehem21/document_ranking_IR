In 2011, Denver Fowler and associates recommended another technique by which "Deinonychus" and different dromaeosaurs may have caught and limited prey. This model, known as the "raptor prey restriction" (RPR) model of predation, suggests that "Deinonychus" slaughtered its prey in a way fundamentally the same as surviving accipitrid winged animals of prey: by jumping onto its quarry, sticking it under its body weight, and grasping it firmly with the vast, sickle-formed hooks. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then start to benefit from the creature while still alive, until it in the end passed on from blood misfortune and organ disappointment. This proposition depends basically on examinations between the morphology and extents of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to a few gatherings of surviving feathered creatures of prey with known savage practices. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most intently take after those of falcons and birds of prey, particularly as far as having a broadened second hook and a comparative scope of getting a handle on movement. Be that as it may, the short metatarsus and foot quality would have been progressively like that of owls. The RPR strategy for predation would be predictable with different parts of "Deinonychus'" life systems, for example, their irregular jaw and arm morphology. The arms were likely canvassed in long quills, and may have been utilized as fluttering stabilizers for equalization while on battling prey, alongside the solid counterbalancing tail. Its jaws, thought to have had a relatively feeble chomp constrain, may be utilized for saw movement nibbles, similar to the cutting edge Komodo mythical serpent which additionally has a frail chomp compel, to complete off its prey if its kicks were not sufficiently incredible.
