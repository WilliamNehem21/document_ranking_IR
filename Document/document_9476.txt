"I-174" located Convoy GP55 about east of Smoky Cape at 4.37ÃÂ pm on 16ÃÂ June. The submarine promptly started arrangements to assault the Allied boats and effectively entered the escort screen. As of now "Portmar" was attempting to come back to her station and was going to the port of USS "LST-469". This made the boats a perfect focus for Nanbu as they covered from the perspective of his periscope. As needs be, he terminated two torpedoes at them at 5.20ÃÂ pm. A solitary torpedo struck the LST close to her stern two minutes after the fact, bringing about extreme harm and the loss of 26 lives and 17 injured. "Portmar" detected the second torpedo and endeavored to dodge it but on the other hand was struck on her starboard side. The vehicle's load of petroleum and ammo rapidly burst into flames and she sank inside ten minutes. One of her team and a traveler were murdered, and 71 survivors, including four who were harmed, were safeguarded by "Deloraine". Regardless of losing steerage "LST-469" stayed above water and was taken under tow by the corvette. "I-174's" assault on Convoy GP55 was presumably the best made by a Japanese submarine off Australia.
