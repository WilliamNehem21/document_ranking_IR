The Interior Department declared in July 1921 that Edward Doheny had been granted a rent to penetrate along the edges of the Elk Hills maritime save in California. The declaration pulled in little discussion, as the oil would have been lost to wells on adjoining private land. Wyoming Senator John Kendrick had gotten notification from constituents that Teapot Dome had likewise been rented, however no declaration had been made. The Interior Department would not give documentation, so he verified the entry of a Senate goals convincing revelation. The office sent a duplicate of the rent giving boring rights to Harry Sinclair's Mammoth Oil Company, alongside an explanation that there had been no aggressive offering since military readiness was includedÃ¢ÂÂMammoth was to construct oil tanks for the Navy as a feature of the arrangement. This fulfilled a few people, yet a few traditionalists, for example, Gifford Pinchot, Harry A. Slattery, and others, pushed for a full examination concerning Fall and his exercises. They got Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. to start a Senate examination concerning the oil leases. La Follette convinced Democratic Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh to lead the examination, and Walsh read through the truckload of material given by the Interior Department through 1922 into 1923, including a letter from Harding expressing that the exchange and rents had been with his insight and endorsement.
