Buckingham Palace reported in November that King George VI was wanting to take a short voyage for his wellbeing on board "Vanguard", which implied that her Admiral's suite again must be adjusted to oblige him and his staff. Skipper John Litchfield accepted direction on 21 December while the ship was all the while refitting, yet the King passed on 6 February 1952 preceding he could make his voyage. A separation from the ship took part in his memorial service parade before she left for her post-refit squeeze voyage on 22 February. Subsequent to practicing with "Unyielding", "Unstoppable" and the quick minelayer , "Vanguard" returned home on 29 March. She progressed toward becoming lead of Home Fleet again on 13 May when Admiral Sir George Creasy raised his banner. Due to keeping an eye on and weight issues, "Vanguard" worked with a considerable lot of her turrets unmanned and with ammo conveyed for just two of the 15-inch turrets and just starshell ammo for the 5.25-inch firearms. She partook in activities with the Dutch and American naval forces, before coming back to Portsmouth for the occasions. Litchfield was eased by Captain R. A. Ewing on 19 January 1953; the ship withdrew the following day for a short refit at Gibraltar. After its culmination on 2 March, the ship prepared with a few of the Royal Navy's bearers before landing back at Portsmouth on 25 March. "Vanguard" partook in Queen Elizabeth's Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 15 June 1953. The next September, she took an interest in NATO's Exercise Mariner in the Denmark Strait.
