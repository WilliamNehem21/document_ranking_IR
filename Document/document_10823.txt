The healthful segments of "R.ÃÂ virescens" mushrooms have been portrayed. Crisp mushrooms contain about 92.5% dampness. An example of dried mushroom (100ÃÂ gÃÂ dw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules). Starches make up the greater part of the organic product bodies, including 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the sugars will be sugars, the vast lion's share of which (10.9%) is mannitol. The all out lipid, or rough fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The extent of unsaturated fats (communicated as a level of complete unsaturated fats) are 28.78% soaked, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most common unsaturated fats include: palmitic corrosive, 17.3% of all out unsaturated fats; stearic corrosive, 7.16%; oleic corrosive, 40.27%; and linoleic corrosive, 29.18%. A few bioactive mixes are available in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 micrograms (ÃÂµg) of tocopherols (20.0ÃÂ ÃÂµg alpha, 21.3ÃÂ ÃÂµg beta, and 8.0ÃÂ ÃÂµg gamma) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the carotenoid color lycopene. There are 4.46ÃÂ g of natural acids per 100ÃÂ g of dry mushrooms, including oxalic corrosive (0.78ÃÂ g), malic corrosive (2.71ÃÂ g), citrus extract (0.55ÃÂ g), and fumaric corrosive (0.23ÃÂ g). Mushrooms have 22.6ÃÂ mg/100ÃÂ gÃÂ dw of the phenolic compound 4-hydroxybenzoic corrosive, and 15.8ÃÂ mg/100ÃÂ gÃÂ dw of cinnamic corrosive.
