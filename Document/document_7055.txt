Two melodies taken from the collection ("Mandatory Suicide" and "South of Heaven") have turned out to be close steady installations in the band's live setlist, scoring up appearances on the accompanying: the live DVDs "Live Intrusion", "War at the Warfield", "As yet Reigning", "Soundtrack to the Apocalypse's" fancy release's reward live plate, and the live twofold collection "Decade of Aggression". Lombardo guested with Finnish cellist aggregate Apocalyptica on a live variety of the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven celebration in the Netherlands. Adrien Begrand of "PopMatters" portrayed "South of Heaven" as "an irregular set opener in principle", noticing "the tune went over like a megaton bomb exploding the spot: many reversed crosses anticipated behind the high drum riser, the strong opening notes kicked in, trailed by a suggestion of bass, cymbal accidents, and tom fills, paving the way to the gradually fabricating crescendo" in a show survey. Lombardo tuned in to a live interpretation of "South of Heaven" and considering, Man! There's simply such a great amount of depression in that tune.' To my children I was stating, 'Tune in to that! Tune in to how cool that is!' And it's overwhelming." A live form of the track included on the "JÃÂGERMUSIC Rarities 2004" limited time CD, offered away to participants at the Spring 2004 JÃÂ¤germeister Music Tour.
