A voracious reader, Procter was largely self-taught, though she studied at Queen's College in Harley Street in 1850. The college had been founded in 1848 by Frederick Maurice, a Christian Socialist; the faculty included novelist Charles Kingsley, composer John Hullah, and writer Henry Morley.
Procter showed a love of poetry from an early age, carrying with her while still a young child a "tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself could write ... as another little girl might have carried a doll". Procter published her first poem while still a teenager; the poem, "Ministering Angels", appeared in "Heath's Book of Beauty" in 1843. In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens's "Household Words" under the name "Mary Berwick", wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens's friendship with her father; Dickens did not learn "Berwick's" identity till the following year. The poem's publication began Procter's long association with Dickens's periodicals; in all, Procter published 73 poems in "Household Words" and 7 poems in "All the Year Round", most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry, both entitled "Legends and Lyrics". She was also published in "Good Words" and "Cornhill." As well as writing poetry, Procter was the editor of the journal "Victoria Regia", which became the showpiece of the Victoria Press, "an explicitly feminist publishing venture".
