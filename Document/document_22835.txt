In a footnote to a poem titled "Speech to the Western Indians", Arent DePeyster, British commandant from 1774 to 1779 at Fort Michilimackinac (a former French fort in what was then the British Quebec territory), noted that "Baptist Point deSaible" was "a handsome negro", "well educated", and "settled in Eschecagou". When he published this poem in 1813, DePeyster presented it as a speech that he had made at the village of Abercroche (now Harbor Springs, Michigan) on July4, 1779. This footnote has led many scholars to assume that Point duSable had settled in Chicago by 1779; but letters written by traders in the late 1770s suggest that Point duSable was at this time settled at the mouth of Trail Creek ("RiviÃ¨re duChemin") at what is now Michigan City, Indiana. In August 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, Point duSable was arrested as a suspected partisan at Trail Creek by British troops and imprisoned briefly at Fort Michilimackinac. An officer's report following his arrest noted that Point du Sable had many friends who vouched for his good character. The following year, he was ordered transported to the Pinery. From the summer of 1780 until May 1784, Point duSable managed the Pinery, a tract of woodlands claimed by a British officer, Lt.Patrick Sinclair, on the St. Clair River in eastern Michigan. Point duSable and his family lived in a cabin at the mouth of the Pine River in what is now the city of St. Clair.
