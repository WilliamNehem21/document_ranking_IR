To the back and at right stands Don JosÃÂ© Nieto VelÃÂ¡zquezÃÂ (8)Ã¢ÂÂ the ruler's chamberlain amid the 1650s, and leader of the illustrious embroidered artwork worksÃ¢ÂÂwho may have been a relative of the craftsman. Nieto is appeared, with his correct knee twisted and his feet on various advances. As the craftsmanship pundit Harriet Stone watches, it is dubious whether he is "coming or going". He is rendered in outline and seems to hold open a shade on a short trip of stairs, with a vague divider or space behind. Both this backdrop illumination and the open entryway uncover space behind: in the expressions of the workmanship antiquarian Analisa Leppanen, they draw "our eyes inevitably into the profundities". The regal couple's appearance pushes the other way, forward into the image space. The evaporating purpose of the viewpoint is in the entryway, as can be appeared by broadening the line of the gathering of divider and roof on the right. Nieto is seen just by the lord and ruler, who share the watcher's perspective, and not by the figures in the forefront. In the references of Joel Snyder's article, the writer perceives that Nieto is the ruler's chaperon and was required to be nearby to open and close entryways for her. Snyder proposes that Nieto shows up in the entryway with the goal that the lord and ruler may leave. With regards to the artistic creation, Snyder contends that the scene is the finish of the regal couple's sitting for VelÃÂ¡zquez and they are planning to exit, clarifying that is "the reason the menina to one side of the Infanta starts to dip".
