From 1380 until 1384, Paul stayed at his see in Negroponte. A relative of his, George TagarisÃ¢ÂÂmost likely an unexpected individual in comparison to Manuel Tagaris' childÃ¢ÂÂwas brought in to help with the organization of the male centric spaces. His residency was pained, as the nearby Orthodox pastorate engaged the Venetian specialists for insurance against his exactions, while the Latin Archbishop of Athens, Antonio Ballester, grumbled of the Patriarch's impedance in his see. Besides, his rent of a portion of the Church arrives in 1383 to a Venetian from Crete, Giacomo Grimani, demonstrated a wellspring of extended legitimate inconvenience since Grimani, in the expressions of the French medievalist Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, "uncovered himself as much a fraud as the Patriarch". In 1384, Paul was by and by decried as an impostor to the Pope, potentially by Ballester, who was named vicar-general of the Patriarchate around the same time, and who had held a similar office amid the 1378Ã¢ÂÂ 1379 opportunity. Paul had evidently left his bishopric before his revilement, and continued his wanderings. In 1385, he was in Cyprus, where he delegated James of Lusignan as King of Cyprus in return for 30,000 gold coins, and kept allowing clerical arrangements on the island as though he were still patriarch.
