While the meaning of seabirds proposes that the winged animals being referred to spend their lives on the sea, numerous seabird families have numerous species that put in a few or even the vast majority of their lives inland far from the ocean. Most strikingly, numerous species breed tens, hundreds or even a large number of miles inland. A portion of these animal groups still come back to the sea to sustain; for instance, the snow petrel, the homes of which have been discovered inland on the Antarctic territory, are probably not going to discover anything to eat around their rearing locales. The marbled murrelet settles inland in old development woods, looking for gigantic conifers with vast branches to settle on. Different species, for example, the California gull, home and feed inland on lakes, and after that move to the coasts in the winter. Some cormorant, pelican, gull and tern species have people that never visit the ocean by any stretch of the imagination, spending their lives on lakes, waterways, swamps and, on account of a portion of the gulls, urban areas and rural land. In these cases it is suspected that these earthbound or freshwater fowls developed from marine progenitors. A few seabirds, primarily those that home in tundra, as skuas and phalaropes do, will move over land also.
