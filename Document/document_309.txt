Keeping with the soul of past recreations, Howard guaranteed to keep with the soul of "huge world, do-anything"- style amusements, feeling that a specific size and number of decisions were expected to make pretending feel "significant"; however at this point there was to be more prominent accentuation on keeping the diversion centered. Pete Hines saw the advancements between amusements as less an issue of configuration center and more as a "characteristic reaction of improving and refining how the diversion functions". In the event that brilliant choices were made, simplicity of play would normally pursue. "Blankness" would incorporate less NPCs and missions than "Morrowind", and thoughtless filler, which Howard felt the group had been liable of before, would be dodged. In return, Producer Gavin Carter later clarified, there would be more noteworthy spotlight on length and profundity in the journeys, including increasingly "interchange ways", more characters "to associate with, who really have identities". Carter cast negative slanders on parts of ongoing interaction excessively far expelled from the diversion's focal plot. Carter expressed that such material was not required, leaning toward rather that the emphasis be on the plot, on "battling these devil rulers", and that further material is "tertiary" and "removes".
