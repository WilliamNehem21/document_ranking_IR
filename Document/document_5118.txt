The primary skeletal recreations demonstrate the skull in a close flat stance. Salgado, in 1999, contended that such a stance would have been anatomically unthinkable because of the prolonged neural spines of the neck vertebrae. Rather, he imagined the head in an almost vertical introduction. The ongoing introduction of the head is typically reflected by the introduction of the crescent channels of the internal ear, which housed the feeling of equalization (vestibular framework). Utilizing their three-dimensional model of the inward ear, Carabajal and associates recommended that the nose confronted downwards at a point of generally 65ÃÂ° in respect to the even. A comparable esteem has as of late been proposed for the related "Diplodocus". The impartial stance of the neck can be approximated dependent on how the cervical vertebrae connected to one another. As per Carabajal and partners, the neck was delicately slanting downwards, with the goal that the nose would have rested over the ground in nonpartisan stance. In actuality, neck stance would have differed by the separate exercises of the creatures. Raising of the neck, for example for achieving an alarm position, would have been choked by the prolonged neural spines, not allowing statures more prominent than .
