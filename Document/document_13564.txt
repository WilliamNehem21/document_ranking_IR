Albeit very nearly 50 antiquated works of Roman historiography notice Cleopatra, these regularly incorporate just laconic records of the Battle of Actium, her suicide, and Augustan publicity about her own insufficiencies. In spite of not being a memoir of Cleopatra, the "Life of Antonius" composed by Plutarch in the first century AD gives the most exhaustive enduring record of Cleopatra's life. Plutarch carried on a century after Cleopatra yet depended on essential sources, for example, Philotas of Amphissa, who approached the Ptolemaic regal royal residence, Cleopatra's own doctor named Olympos, and Quintus Dellius, a nearby comrade of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Plutarch's work included both the Augustan perspective on CleopatraÃ¢ÂÂwhich ended up authoritative for his periodÃ¢ÂÂjust as sources outside of this convention, for example, onlooker reports. The Jewish Roman history specialist Josephus, writing in the first century AD, gives important data on the life of Cleopatra by means of her strategic association with Herod the Great. Be that as it may, this work depends to a great extent on Herod's journals and the one-sided record of Nicolaus of Damascus, the mentor of Cleopatra's kids in Alexandria before he moved to Judea to fill in as a counsel and recorder at Herod's court. The "Roman History" distributed by the authority and student of history Cassius Dio in the mid third century AD, while neglecting to completely understand the complexities of the late Hellenistic world, by the by gives a consistent history of the time of Cleopatra's rule.
