The diary, which switches between the primary individual particular and plural yet never distinguishes its storytellers, depicts Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week visit over the Continent. It is separated by nation: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the gathering touches base in Calais and continues to Paris, they choose an arrangement: "In the wake of talking over and dismissing numerous plans, we fixed on one sufficiently flighty, yet which, from its sentiment, was satisfying to us. In England we couldn't have placed it in execution without supporting persistent affront and impudence: the French are unmistakably progressively tolerant of the notions of their neighbors. We set out to stroll through France". Every day they enter another town; yet even while voyaging, they invest energy composing and perusing. The diary remarks on the general population they meet, the wide open, and the recent developments that have molded the earth. Some of what they see is lovely and some is "desolate and vomited". Percy sprains his lower leg, which turns into an expanding issueÃ¢ÂÂthe gathering is compelled to employ a carriage. When the trio achieves Lucerne, they are about out of cash and choose to return home. They return by vessel along the Rhine, the least expensive method of movement. In spite of issues with questionable pontoons and risky waters, they see some wonderful landscape before arriving in England.
