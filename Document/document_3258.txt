The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are singled out by Cox as among the best of this piece of Wood's profession. Among those directing their own works or hearing Wood lead them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's "Five Pieces for Orchestra" likewise gotten its first execution (the author not being available); amid practices, Wood asked his players, "Stick to it, men of honor! This is nothing to what you'll need to play in 25 years' time". The commentator Ernest Newman composed after the execution: "It is a rarity indeed an English group of onlookers murmurs the music it doesn't care for, however a decent third of the general population at Queen's Hall last Tuesday allowed themselves that extravagance after the execution of the five instrumental bits of Schoenberg. Another third of the group of onlookers was just not murmuring since it was giggling, and the staying third appeared to be too confounded either to chuckle or to murmur; so that all in all it doesn't look as though Schoenberg has so far made numerous companions in London." However, when Wood welcomed Schoenberg himself to lead the work's second British execution, on 17 January 1914, the author was so charmed with the outcome, more heartily got than had been the debut, that he praised Wood and the symphony energetically: "I should state it was the first run through since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as an artist of culture requests."
