For the team's space suits, Scott was roused to incorporate round glass head protectors subsequent to perusing a story in Steve Jobs' account about structure an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott stated, "In case I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, for what reason would I structure a protective cap that has vulnerable sides. What I need is something where I have 360 [vision]. Glass, by at that point, will be light and you won't almost certainly break it with a projectile." The inside of the prop head protectors had nine working video screens, inner lighting, an air supply given by two fans, and battery packs covered inside a rucksack. The cap's outside highlighted an utilitarian light source and top notch camcorders with a transmitter and recorder. For the whatever it preferences may be, Scott needed to stay away from the cumbersome NASA-style suit. His continuous teammate, Janty Yates, utilized restorative research ideas identifying with skin substitution medicines and materials to build up a piece of clothing that would be authentic, adaptable and agreeable. The outfit contained a neoprene suit worn under a space suit, a base to which the head protector could be appended, and a knapsack.
