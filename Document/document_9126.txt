Robert Heinlein was among the top of the line sci-fi creators of the 1950s, alongside Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke; they were known as the "enormous three" that commanded U.S. sci-fi. As opposed to the others, Heinlein immovably supported the counter socialist supposition of the Cold War period in his composition. Heinlein served in the U.S. Naval force for a long time in the wake of moving on from the United States Naval Academy in 1929. His involvement in the military significantly affected his fiction. Sooner or later somewhere in the range of 1958 and 1959, Heinlein set aside the novel that would move toward becoming "Stranger in a Strange Land" and expressed "Starship Troopers". His inspiration emerged somewhat from his outrage at U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower's choice to suspend U.S. atomic tests, and the Soviet tests that happened soon a short time later. Writing in his 1980 volume "Extended Universe", Heinlein would state that the distribution of a paper notice put by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy on April 5, 1958, requiring a one-sided suspension of atomic weapons testing by the United States started his craving to express "Starship Troopers". Heinlein and his better half Virginia made the "Patrick Henry League" trying to make support for the U.S. atomic testing program. Heinlein expressed that he utilized the novel to elucidate his military and political perspectives.
