Amid the last phases of the breakdown of his marriage, Le Mesurier met Joan Malin at the Establishment club in Soho in 1963. The next year he moved out of his conjugal house, and that day proposed to Joan, who acknowledged his offer. Le Mesurier enabled Jacques to bring a separation suit on grounds of his own disloyalty, to guarantee that the press reprimanded him for the separation, along these lines keeping away from any negative attention for Jacques. Le Mesurier and Malin wedded in March 1966. A couple of months after they were hitched, Joan started an association with Tony Hancock, and left Le Mesurier to move in with the humorist. Hancock was a self-admitted alcoholic at this point, and was verbally and physically harsh to Joan amid their relationship. Following a year together, with Hancock's brutality towards her exacerbating, Joan endeavored suicide; she along these lines understood that she could never again live with Hancock and came back to her significant other. Regardless of this, Le Mesurier remained companions with Hancock, calling him "a comic of genuine virtuoso, fit for incredible warmth and liberality, yet a tormented and despondent man". Without Le Mesurier's information, Joan continued her issue with Hancock and, when the comic moved to Australia in 1968, she wanted to tail him on the off chance that he had the capacity to defeat his liquor abuse. She deserted these plans and stayed with Le Mesurier after Hancock ended it all on 25 June 1968.
