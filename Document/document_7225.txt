In late 1908 Lang was educated of his race as Bishop of Montreal. Letters from the Governor General of Canada and the Canadian High Commissioner asked him to acknowledge, yet the Archbishop of Canterbury requested that he reject. Half a month later a letter from Herbert Asquith, the PM, educated Lang that he had been named Archbishop of York. Lang was just 44 years of age, and had no involvement as a diocesan priest. On the issue of age, the "Congregation Times" trusted that Asquith intentionally prescribed the most youthful religious administrator accessible, after solid political campaigning for the arrangement of the older Bishop of Hereford, John Percival. Such an advancement for a suffragan, and inside so short a period after appointment, was without ongoing point of reference in the Church of England. Lang's companion Hensley Henson, a future Bishop of Durham, stated: "I am, obviously, astonished that you go "straight" to an archbishopricÃÂ ... Be that as it may, you are unreasonably fleeting for point of reference." The arrangement was commonly generally welcomed, despite the fact that the Protestant Truth Society looked for futile to keep its affirmation. Solid rivals of Anglo-Catholic practices, they kept up that as Bishop of Stepney Lang had "plotted at and empowered outrageous violating of the law identifying with chapel custom".
