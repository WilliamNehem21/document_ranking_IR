In March 1967, the first Battalion turned into the sole unit of the Gloucestershire Regiment when, because of a rearrangement of the TA, the fifth Battalion turned into A Company of the Wessex Volunteers in the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve. The regiment barely maintained a strategic distance from amalgamation with the Royal Hampshire Regiment in 1970, and it praised its tercentenary toward the beginning of March 1994; 300 years since the raising of Gibson's Regiment of Foot. However, at that point, the disintegration of the Soviet Union had incited the administration to rebuild the military. Subsequently, the Gloucestershire Regiment was amalgamated with the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment to shape the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. The new regiment kept up the back identification custom, and when it was thus amalgamated in 2007, it passed the convention on to its successor regiment, The Rifles, who wear the back identification with their stately uniform. The Glosters marched once and for all on 26ÃÂ March 1994 in Gloucester. The hues, conveying more fight respects than some other regiment of the line, were then walked to the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum, and the regiment pursued the 28th and 61st Regiments of Foot into history.
