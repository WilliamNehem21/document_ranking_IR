Before either Baltic army could total preparing, these advancements were overwhelmed by substantial setbacks endured by the West European armies on the Eastern Front, and like the West European armies, it was chosen to join the Baltic armies into bigger arrangements. This brought about the "Estnische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade", comprising of the Estonian Legion and components of the first SS Infantry Brigade, and the "Lettische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade", conformed to the Latvian Legion and parts of the second SS Infantry Brigade. The beginnings of a large number of the men of the two SS infantry detachments was Reich German or "Volksdeutsche", so these two developments were never simply Baltic. Not long after the two new volunteer units had been shaped and resolved to fight, they were moved up to divisional status, and a third Baltic division was approved, utilizing the labor of the Latvian security contingents. To man and keep up these three new divisions, Himmler requested the enrollment of Estonian and Latvian men, and made all previous Estonian Army officers and non-authorized officers obligated for administration. By 1944, the "Waffen-SS" incorporated the three divisions, to be specific; the fifteenth Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (first Latvian), the nineteenth Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (second Latvian), and the twentieth Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (first Estonian). The two Latvian divisions were later consolidated into the VI SS Army Corps (Latvian), and every one of the three divisions battled the Soviet Red Army with regards to their countries amid 1944, and were enclosed there or devastated in consequent battling somewhere else.
