On the southeast corner of the site, a few property proprietors likewise wouldn't sell. Columbia University was eager to give Rockefeller Center Inc. control of all leases in the previous Upper Estate that were never again held by an outsider. In any case, William Nelson Cromwell, a conspicuous legal advisor and Columbia graduate, who claimed three nearby line houses at 10Ã¢ÂÂ 14 West 49th Street, would not move out of his home when his rent terminated in 1927. The difference proceeded until 1936, amid which time Cromwell would not pay lease on 14 West 49th Street, while Rockefeller Center Inc. retained $400,000 of Cromwell's lease installments to Columbia. Rockefeller Center Inc. would later purchase 8 West 49th, therefore confining Cromwell's territory between the two Rockefeller Center packages. The organization permitted Robert Goelet to keep the neighboring part at 2Ã¢ÂÂ 6 West 49th Street in light of the fact that the organization considered his "advantage and worry" to be an "expansive concern". Notwithstanding, he couldn't build up the land since Cromwell controlled an easement over piece of Goelet's property. The St. Nicholas Church, situated on 48th Street behind Goelet's part, likewise would not sell its property regardless of an idea of up to $7 million for the bundle.
