Amid the track, Rihanna's vocal range traverses one octave, from the low note of B to the high note of B. Proposing unlawful acts, she utilizes an "explicitly forceful tone" in her vocal execution. The verses are about sex, sadomasochism, servitude and BDSM obsessions, including the sexual dreams and turn-ons of its hero. The melody opens with the snare, "Na, na, na, c'mon". Amid the ensemble the verses incorporate, "'Cause I might be terrible, however I'm superbly great at it/Sex noticeable all around, I couldn't care less, I cherish its smell." In the melody, Rihanna depicts herself as "awful" and transparently applauds her own sexual ability; verses incorporate, "Sticks and stones may break my bones/But chains and whips energize me." Rihanna told "Turn" magazine that the verses are figurative. She said that she thought the tune was primarily about believing in one's character, and about being impenetrable to bits of gossip and analysis. As indicated by Jake Conway of "Q Magazine at Yale", the verses are blameworthy of "stripping sex of feeling" and re-visualizing viciousness as interest; he proceeded to state that Rihanna pays tribute to the sexual demonstrations in an enabled move and club temperament. Chris Ryan portrayed the melody as being about "filthy, shrewd, illegal room exercises".
