After the tale of Creation, Proba quickly references the Great Flood by utilizing lines from the fourth book of the "Georgics" that initially talked about the demise of a bee sanctuary and the need of laws after the finish of the Golden Age, separately. As per the classicist Karla Pollmann, by utilizing lines that worry demolition and the foundation of law, Proba can pass on the customary thought that Noah's survival speaks to the unfolding of a "second creation and another request" (that is, the Patriarchal age). Proba commits just a couple of lines to Exodus before moving onto the New Testament. Cullhed reasons this is on the grounds that the Book of Exodus and the staying Old Testament is packed with savagery and fighting that is elaborately excessively near the custom of agnostic epic poetrya convention that Proba explicitly rejects in the proem of "De laudibus Christi". In the transitional area between the Old and New Testaments, Proba appropriates the summon of the Muses of war that promptly goes before the Catalog of Italians (from Book VII, "Aeneid") and sections that initially depicted Aeneas' prophetic shield (from Book VIII, "Aeneid"). As per Culhed, these stanzas initially worked as beautiful gadgets, empowering Virgil to move from the "Odyssean" first 50% of the lyric to the "Iliadic" last half. Proba moreover has re-purposed these sections to help in her progress from the Old Testament into the New.
