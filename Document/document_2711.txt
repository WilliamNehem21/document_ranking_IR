"Brachiosaurus" varied in its body extents from the firmly related "Giraffatitan". The storage compartment was about 25Ã¢ÂÂ 30% longer, bringing about a dorsal vertebral section longer than the humerus. Just a solitary complete caudal (tail) vertebra has been found, yet its extraordinary tallness recommends that the tail was bigger than in "Giraffatitan". This vertebra had an a lot more noteworthy territory for tendon connection because of a widened neural spine, showing that the tail was additionally longer than in "Giraffatitan", perhaps by 20Ã¢ÂÂ 25%. In 1988, scientist Gregory S. Paul recommended that the neck of "Brachiosaurus" was shorter than that of "Giraffatitan", however in 2009, scientist Mike P. Taylor called attention to that two cervical vertebrae likely having a place with "Brachiosaurus" had indistinguishable extents. Not at all like "Giraffatitan" and different sauropods, which had vertically arranged forelimbs, the arms of "Brachiosaurus" seem to have been somewhat spread at the shoulder joints, as shown by the sideward introduction of the joint surfaces of the coracoids. The humerus was less slim than that of "Giraffatitan", while the femur had comparative extents. This may demonstrate that the forelimbs of "Brachiosaurus" upheld a more prominent division of the body weight than is the situation for "Giraffatitan".
