The Weald Clay Formation consists of sediments of Hauterivian (Lower Weald Clay) to Barremian (Upper Weald Clay) age, about 130â125 million years old. The "B.Â walkeri" holotype was found in the latter, in clay representing non-marine still water, which has been interpreted as a fluvial or mudflat environment with shallow water, lagoons, and marshes. During the Early Cretaceous, the Weald area of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent was partly covered by the large, fresh-to-brackish water Wealden Lake. Two large rivers drained the northern area (where London now stands), flowing into the lake through a river delta; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its climate was sub-tropical, similar to the present Mediterranean region. Since the Smokejacks Pit consists of different stratigraphic levels, fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the locality include the ornithopods "Mantellisaurus", "Iguanodon", and small sauropods. Other vertebrates from the Weald Clay include crocodiles, pterosaurs, lizards (such as "Dorsetisaurus"), amphibians, sharks (such as "Hybodus"), and bony fishes (including "Scheenstia"). Members of ten orders of insects have been identified, including "Valditermes", "Archisphex", and "Pterinoblattina". Other invertebrates include ostracods, isopods, conchostracans, and bivalves. The plants "Weichselia" and the aquatic, herbaceous "Bevhalstia" were common. Other plants found include ferns, horsetails, club mosses, and conifers.
