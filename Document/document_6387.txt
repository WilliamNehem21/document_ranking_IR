The writer (and previous Sibelius student) Leevi Madetoja further commended the score upon audit, writing in "Uusi Suometar" in July 1914 that Sibelius, as opposed to "repeat[ing] unendingly" the style of his past works, had once more demonstrated his propensity for "reestablishing himself musicallyÃÂ ... continuously forward, taking a stab at new points". The Finnish commentator Karl Wasenius (otherwise known as BIS), writing in "Hufvudstadsbladet" after the birthday festivity exhibitions of 1915, composed enthusiastically of Sibelius' "refined dominance" of system. "Not a solitary note is squandered on reckless impacts", Wasenius proceeded. "However compelling things are still accomplished. Sibelius gives us the breadth and extent of the sea, its ground-breaking wave-tune yet without egotistic motions. He is unreasonably honorable for that". In "Tidning fÃÂ¶r musik", Otto Anderssen deciphered Sibelius' most recent organizations (among them "The Oceanides") up 'til now another pointer that he was among the most forward-looking pioneers: "Sibelius is, I trust, a man of the futureÃÂ ... always comparatively radical. Presently he remains at the statures where the skyline extends over fields which the remainder of us can't yet observe". Cecil Gray, additionally, calls the piece "brave" and acclaims the score's "outstanding multifaceted nature and refinement", testing pundits who consider Sibelius to be a "crude craftsman".
