At the point when the cutting edge balanced out, the Polish central command tossed every one of its stores into a counterattack. BeniaminÃÂ³w was fortified with the 29th Infantry Regiment. The Polish assault started around 05:30, following a 20-minute big guns blast. Before long the whole tenth Infantry Division began a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew waterway so as to defeat the Russian powers from the north, while the first Lithuanian-Belarusian Division pushed legitimately towards the town. In spite of the fact that the Russian side had prevalent big guns and brought a few Austin-Putilov defensively covered autos, this time the Polish ambush was upheld by five Renault FT tanks and various flying machine. Notwithstanding experiencing mechanical disappointments, the tanks effectively got through the Russian lines, and the infantry of the 85th "Wilno Rifles" Regiment from the first Lithuanian-Belarusian Division tailed them into the town. After a short battle the Polish powers indeed controlled the town. Be that as it may, when it was taken, General ÃÂ»eligowski chose to revamp his division and couldn't bolster the 85th Regiment with crisp powers. One more effective counterattack by the Russian 61st and 62nd Infantry Brigades constrained the Polish first Division to withdraw back to its underlying positions.
