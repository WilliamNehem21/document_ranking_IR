In between films Terry-Thomas appeared on television on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US in MarchâApril 1967 he was in "The Five Daughters Affair", a two-part story in the TV series "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", and on 22 May he appeared on "The Red Skelton Hour". On British television, in an episode of the "Comedy Playhouse" called "The Old Campaigner", he played James Franklin-Jones, a salesman for a plastics company who was continually searching for love affairs while travelling on business. This character was "yet another variation on his rakish cad persona", according to Mark Lewisohn. The episode was well-received, and a six-part series was commissioned that ran over December 1968 and January 1969. Although the series performed well in the ratings, a second series was not commissioned. In between the pilot and the series of "The Old Campaigner", in April 1968, Terry-Thomas appeared on the British ITV network in a one-off variety special, "The Big Show", which combined musical numbers and his urbane monologues. Robert Ross commented that Terry-Thomas "seemed to delight in resurrecting his vintage sophisticated patter after years in moviesÂ ... the top raconteur was back where he belonged". In 1969 he again teamed up with Eric Sykes and director Ken Annakin for a joint Italian, French and British production "Monte Carlo or Bust!". The film was "the only copper-bottomed sequel toÂ ... "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"", according to Richard Ross. Terry-Thomas played Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage, the "thoroughly bad egg son of flying ace Sir Percy Ware-Armitage", his role in "Those Magnificent Men". Terry-Thomas secured four other roles in minor films that year, including "Arthur? Arthur!" (which he joked had "never been shown anywhereâas far as I know!"), as well as on television in the UK, US and Australia.
