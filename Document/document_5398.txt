The boats of the Fourth Carrier Division were relegated to the Main Body of the first Mobile Fleet, told by Vice Admiral JisaburÃÂ Ozawa. The Main Body's job was to go about as baits to pull in consideration far from the two different powers drawing closer from the south and west. All powers were to combine on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was inside scope of the northernmost American transporters of Task Force 38 and Ozawa requested an air strike propelled by the Third Carrier Division ("HyÃÂ«ga" and "Ise" had no flying machine on board) to pull in the consideration of the Americans. This practiced little else as the Japanese air ship neglected to infiltrate past the protecting warriors; the survivors arrived at landing strips on Luzon. The Americans were distracted managing the other Japanese maritime powers and protecting themselves from air assaults propelled from Luzon and Leyte and couldn't extra any air ship to look for the Japanese bearers until the evening. They at last discovered them, however Admiral William Halsey, Jr., leader of Task Force 38, concluded that it was past the point of no return in the day to mount a successful strike. He did, be that as it may, turn the majority of his boats north to position himself for a day break assault on the Japanese transporters the following day.
