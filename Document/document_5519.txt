Clinkscales regularly plays streetball with the Sean Bell All-Stars against neighborhood groups in New York City, going about as the beginning stage monitor. The group was named after an unarmed New York local who was shot multiple times by three cops on November 25, 2006. The Sean Bell All-Stars won the Trayvon Martin Invitational in August 2013, with a group that included Clinkscales and Tobias Harris, in Harlem, New York. The occasion raised over $5,000 for the Trayvon Martin Foundation and was gone to by NBA players Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans, and future NBA chief Adam Silver. At the invitational, Clinkscales took a stand in opposition to police ruthlessness, saying, "Children wherever are getting shot and killed, regardless of whether it's in Jamaica, the Bronx, Chicago. It appears as though it never goes right with regards to the law, yet the message to the children is that on the off chance that you go hard on the court you need to go hard in the homeroom." In 2015, he sought the All-Stars at The Basketball Tournament, in a group that highlighted Delroy James and Zamal Nixon and was overseen by Raheem Wiggins. In a triumph against Team No Excuses in 2015, Clinkscales scored 11. Just as playing streetball, he mentors youth ball in South Jamaica, Queens.
