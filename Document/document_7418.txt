The destiny of Christianity in the area remains to a great extent obscure. The congregation foundations would have crumpled together with the fall of the kingdom, bringing about the decrease of the Christian confidence and the ascent of Islam in its stead. Islamized bunches from northern Nubia started to convert the Gezira. As right on time as 1523 King Amara Dunqas, who was at first a Pagan or ostensible Christian, was recorded to be Muslim. By the by, in the sixteenth century vast parts of the Nubians still viewed themselves as Christians. An explorer who visited Nubia around 1500 affirms this, while additionally saying that the Nubians were so ailing in Christian guidance they had no information of the confidence. In 1520 Nubian represetatives achieved Ethiopia and requested of the Emperor for ministers. They guaranteed that no more ministers could achieve Nubia as a result of the wars between Muslims, prompting a decay of Christianity in their territory. In the main portion of the seventeenth century, a prescience made by the Sudanese Sheik Idris Wad al-Arbab referenced a congregation in the Nuba Mountains. As late as the mid 1770s there was said to be a Christian princedom in the Ethiopian-Sudanese outskirt zone, called Shaira. Apotropaic customs coming from Christian practices outlasted the transformation to Islam. As late as the twentieth century a few practices of without a doubt Christian starting point were "normal, however obviously not general, in Omdurman, the Gezira and Kordofan", more often than not spinning around the use of crosses on people and articles.
