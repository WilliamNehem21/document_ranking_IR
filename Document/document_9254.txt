The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer office was situated in a similar structure, and Bakshi addressed then-president Dan Melnick. "I figured he would comprehend what "The Rings" implied, on the grounds that UA did not." Bakshi and Melnick made an arrangement with Mike Medavoy at United Artists to purchase the Boorman content. "The Boorman content expense $3 million, so Boorman was glad by the pool, shouting and chuckling and drinking, 'cause he got $3 million for his content to be tossed out." However, after Melnick was terminated from MGM, the arrangement failed to work out. Bakshi then reached Saul Zaentz (who had helped money "Fritz the Cat") to request that he produce "The Lord of the Rings", and Zaentz concurred. Before the creation began, the first three-section adjustment was brought down to two sections at United Artists, and Bakshi met with Tolkien's little girl Priscilla to talk about how the film would be made. She demonstrated to him the room where her dad did his composition and drawing. Bakshi says, "My guarantee to Tolkien's little girl was to be unadulterated to the book. I wasn't going to state, 'Hello, toss out Gollum and change these two characters.' My activity was to state, 'This is the thing that the virtuoso said.'"
