The 68th started the second day in an increasingly faultless position on Cemetery Hill. This put them at the focal point of the Union line, and the vast majority of the day's initial activity was on the flanks. At night, in any case, Early's powers assaulted once more; the charging Confederates immediately achieved the highest point of the slope and some hand-to-hand battle broke out, yet misfortunes were light on the grounds that the developing dimness made it troublesome for fighters on the two sides to shoot precisely. Fortifications from the II Corps arrived and helped the XI Corps hold the position. On the third day, the 68th stayed in that position, however the significant assault of the day, Pickett's Charge, was to one side. The 68th performed superior to anything they had at Chancellorsville, taking an interest in their first Union triumph. They paid the cost with a lot higher losses, 8 killed and 63 injured; 67 were made detainees of war, numerous on the principal day amid the retreat to Cemetery Hill. In the thick of the activity for two out of three days, the 68th lost a larger number of men at Gettysburg than in some other fight.
