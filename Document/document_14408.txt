Before twentieth Century Fox gave "Outsider versus Predator" the greenlight, "Outsiders" essayist/chief James Cameron had been taking a shot at a story for a fifth "Outsider" film. "Outsider" executive Ridley Scott had chatted with Cameron, expressing "I figure it would be a ton of fun, however the most essential thing is to get the story ideal." In a 2002 meeting, Scott's idea for a story was "to return to where the outsider animals were first found and clarify how they were made"; this venture in the long run turned into Scott's film "Prometheus" (2012). On discovering that Fox expected to seek after "Outsider versus Predator", Cameron trusted the film would "slaughter the legitimacy of the establishment" and stopped work on his story, "To me, that was "Frankenstein Meets Werewolf". It was Universal simply taking their benefits and beginning to play them off against each other...Milking it." After survey "Outsider versus Predator", in any case, Cameron commented that "it was in reality entirely great. I think about the five "Outsider" films, I'd rate it third. I really preferred it. I really loved it a great deal." Conversely, Ridley Scott had no enthusiasm for the "Outsider versus Predator" films. At the point when inquired as to whether he had watched them, Scott giggled, "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't exactly make that stride." Director Neill Blomkamp would in the long run proceed to pitch his continuation of "Outsiders". Nonetheless, Scott expressed in 2017 that the undertaking has been dropped.
