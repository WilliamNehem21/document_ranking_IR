Responses to the transmissions were blended, setting off a media banter concerning the moral ramifications of blending rock stimulation with human catastrophe. The Edge stated, "A great deal of evenings it felt like a significant unexpected interference that was most likely not especially invited by many individuals in the group of onlookers. You were snatched out of a stone show and given an extremely solid portion of the real world and it was very hard now and again to return to something as trivial as a show having watched five or ten minutes of genuine human anguish." Mullen stressed that the band were abusing the Bosnians' languishing over stimulation. In 2002, he stated, "I can't recall that much else unbearable than those Sarajevo interface ups. It resembled tossing a can of virus water over everyone. You could see your gathering of people going, 'What the heck are these folks doing?' But I'm pleased to have been a piece of a gathering who were attempting to accomplish something." During a transmission for the band's show at Wembley Stadium, three ladies in Sarajevo told Bono by means of satellite, "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You will return to a stone show. You will overlook that we even exist. What's more, we're all going to pass on." Some individuals near the band joined the War Child philanthropy venture, including Brian Eno. Essayist Bill Flanagan trusts that the connection ups achieved Bono's objective for Zoo TV of "outlining in front of an audience the indecency of inertly flipping from a war on CNN to shake recordings on MTV". U2 pledged to perform in Sarajevo sometime in the future, in the long run satisfying this dedication on their 1997 PopMart Tour.
