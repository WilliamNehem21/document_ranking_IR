Anastasia's challenging once in a while surpassed the cutoff points of adequate conduct. "She without a doubt held the record for culpable deeds in her family, for in mischievousness she was a genuine virtuoso", said Gleb Botkin, child of the court doctor Yevgeny Botkin, who later kicked the bucket with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia in some cases stumbled the hirelings and pulled tricks on her coaches. As a tyke, she would climb trees and will not descend. Once, amid a snowball battle at the family's Polish domain, Anastasia folded a stone into a snowball and tossed it at her more seasoned sister Tatiana, thumping her to the ground. An inaccessible cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, reviewed that "Anastasia was dreadful to the point of being insidious", and would cheat, kick and scratch her companions amid diversions; she was insulted in light of the fact that the more youthful Nina was taller than she was. She was less worried about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a top of the line American creator and spouse of an American ambassador, portrayed how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without trying to expel her long, white musical drama gloves at the St. Petersburg musical drama house.
