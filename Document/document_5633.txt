Caraeff remained on a seat beside the edge of the stage while taking a progression of four monochrome pictures of Hendrix consuming his guitar. Caraeff was close enough to the flame that he needed to utilize his camera as a shield to shield his face from the warmth. "Moving Stone" later colorized the picture, coordinating it with different pictures taken at the celebration before utilizing the shot for a 1987 magazine spread. As per creator Gail Buckland, the fourth and last edge of "Hendrix bowing before his consuming guitar, hands raised, is a standout amongst the most celebrated pictures in shake." Author and student of history Matthew C. Whitaker expressed: "Hendrix's consuming of his guitar turned into a notorious picture in shake history and brought him national consideration." The "Los Angeles Times" stated that, after leaving the stage, Hendrix "moved on from talk to legend". Creator John McDermott remarked: "Hendrix left the Monterey crowd staggered and in dismay at what they'd quite recently heard and seen." According to Hendrix: "I chose to devastate my guitar toward the finish of a melody as a penance. You penance things you adore. I cherish my guitar." The execution was recorded by D.ÃÂ A. Pennebaker, and later incorporated into the show narrative "Monterey Pop", which helped Hendrix gain notoriety with the U.S. open.
