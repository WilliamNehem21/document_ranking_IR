In Russia, the youthful, profoundly religious Hasidic Jew Frimme Hersh cuts an agreement with God on a stone tablet to carry on with an actual existence of good deeds; he ascribes to it his later achievement throughout everyday life. He moves to New York, into an apartment working at 55 Dropsie Avenue, and carries on with a straightforward life committed to God. He embraces a newborn child young lady, Rachele, who is deserted on his doorstep. When she bites the dust of an unexpected sickness, Hersh is irritated, and blames God for disregarding their agreement. He surrenders his confidence, shaves his whiskers, and carries on with an actual existence as a stingy agent in a penthouse with a gentile courtesan. He unlawfully utilizes a synagogue's bonds that were endowed to him to purchase the apartment working in which he had lived when poor. He ends up disappointed with his better approach forever, and concludes that he needs another agreement with God to fill the void he feels. He has a gathering of rabbis draw up another agreement, yet when he returns home with it, his heart comes up short and he passes on. A kid, Shloime, discovers Hersh's old contract, and signs his very own name to it. Eisner affixed a page to the 2006 version, portraying Shloime climbing the stairs to the apartment.
