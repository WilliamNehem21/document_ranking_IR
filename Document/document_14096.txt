The author Evelyn Waugh had been comfortable with the "Journal" since his youth. It was an incredible most loved of his folksÃ¢ÂÂArthur Waugh used to peruse sections out loud to his family, and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has attracted regard for the unmistakably Pooterish components in the Waugh family. Evelyn Waugh was at first derisive of the book, yet developed to appreciate it, to the degree of writing in his 1930 article "One Way to Immortality" that it was "the most amusing book on the planet". He included: "No one needs to peruse other individuals' appearance on life and religion and governmental issues, however the daily practice of their day, appropriately recorded, is continually intriguing, and will turn out to be all the more so as conditions change with the years". Morton places that few of the main characters in Waugh's initial books, however socially far expelled from the Pooters, share the bewilderment of Charles and Carrie with the issues of an evolving world. In his 1945 novel "Brideshead Revisited", Waugh has Lady Marchmain consoling her family by perusing so anyone might hear from the "Journal" "with her lovely voice and incredible silliness of articulation". Morton proposes that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his own relationship with Lupin, and the manner by which the disliked child (as Waugh saw himself) more than once figures out how to turn antagonistic conditions further bolstering his definitive good fortune.
