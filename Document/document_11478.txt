Alleviated by the 23rd Battalion, Div Cav was moved back to Medicina. Following two days of rest there, the ninth Infantry Brigade came back to the forefronts behind the Allied development towards the Po stream. The unit was north of Bologna by the principal night back, when it was shelled by an Axis flying machine which injured four men. Following day the regiment was on the banks of the Reno waterway and crossed the Po after the remainder of the unit on 26 April. After its development was ceased by the Fratta Canal, the regiment moved east to Ospedaletto. An and C Squadrons cleared Ospedaletto of the Axis rearguard, taking fifty detainees. The force skirted dissipated German units, hustling for Padua amid the night. It achieved Padua around midnight and was welcomed by upbeat Italian groups. On 29 April a shell struck regiment central station, injuring Lieutenant Colonel Wilder and murdering two men (the last men of Div Cav executed in real life amid the war). More out of control was supplanted by Lieutenant Colonel Victor Tanner; the contingent progressed again at early afternoon on Route 11 towards Venice, experiencing its last solid German opposition in Mira. No. 12 Troop flanked the German positions, catching 140 men and slaughtering around 20. The force hustled on, changing to Route 14 set out toward Trieste, and was carried over the Piave on 30 April; it was at Monfalcone, constrained by Yugoslav partisans, before the finish of 1 May. Trieste was achieved the following day and the brigade stayed outdoors just past the city. Div Cav was assuaged on 6 May by a unit of the 363rd Infantry Regiment of the US 91st Division, and moved to Barcola.
