A progression of preliminaries were held to arraign those captured amid the uprising. The biggest number of capital punishments was passed on by the main Criminal Commission, which gathered at Yen Bay. Among the 87ÃÂ people found liable at Yen Bay, 46 were servicemen. Some contended in their own guard that they had been "astounded and compelled to participate in the rebellion". Of the 87 indicted, 39 were condemned to death, five to expulsion, 33 to life sentences of constrained work, nine to 20ÃÂ years detainment, and one to five years of constrained work. Of those sentenced to death, 24 were regular folks and 15 were servicemen. Presidential exonerations diminished the quantity of capital punishments from 39 to 13. HÃ¡Â»Âc and Chinh were among the 13 who were executed on June 17, 1930. The censured men cried "Viet Nam!" as the guillotine fell. HÃ¡Â»Âc composed a last request to the French, in a letter that asserted that he had for the longest time been itching to coordinate with French specialists, yet that their tenacity had constrained him to revolt. HÃ¡Â»Âc fought that France could possibly remain in Indochina on the off chance that they dropped their "merciless" approaches, and turned out to be progressively genial towards the Vietnamese. The VNQDD pioneer called for general instruction, preparing in trade and industry, and a conclusion to the degenerate practices of the French-introduced mandarins.
