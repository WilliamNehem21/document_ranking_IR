On 7 January 2004, Arsenal played Everton at Goodison Park. Wenger made a large group of changes: Cygan was reviewed in focal resistance, which implied TourÃÂ© was moved onto the privilege and Lauren was dropped, while Parlor began instead of Gilberto in midfield. Kanu had given Arsenal the lead in the principal half, just for Radzinski to score a "luxuriously merited late equalizer" for Everton with fifteen minutes remaining. Manchester United's triumph at Bolton on that night expanded the bosses' lead at the top to three. Three days after the Everton coordinate, Arsenal facilitated Middlesbrough and put on a showcase Wenger portrayed as one of the period's ideal: "We continued playing our common diversion and could have scored more," he said. The 4Ã¢ÂÂ 1 success implied Arsenal moved back top of the association, but one after another in order as their focuses, objective contrast and objectives scored were indistinguishable to that of Manchester United. After seven days Arsenal beat Aston Villa by two objectives to nil; both of the group's objectives were scored by Henry. Discussion encompassed the Frenchman's first objective, an immediately taken free-kick which incited disarray among Villa's players and realized a response towards official Mark Halsey, who flagged it was allowable. After 22 recreations played, Arsenal were in the lead position, two points clear of Manchester United.
