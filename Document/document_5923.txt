Functional contrasts between the applicants were not many, and Republicans started the crusade with the natural topic of waving the grisly shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was in charge of severance and four years of common war, and that if Democrats held power they would switch the increases of that war, disrespect Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans annuities out of the government treasury. With fifteen years having gone since the finish of the war, and Union officers at the head of the two tickets, the ridiculous shirt was of decreasing an incentive in energizing the voters. With a couple of months to go before the decision, the Republicans changed strategies to stress the levy. Seizing on the Democratic stage's require a "levy for income just", Republicans disclosed to Northern laborers that a Hancock administration would debilitate the tax assurance that kept them in steady employments. Hancock exacerbated things when, endeavoring to strike a moderate position, he stated, "The levy question is a nearby inquiry." The ploy demonstrated successful in joining the North behind Garfield. At last, less than two thousand votes, of the more than 9.2 million mainstream cast a ballot cast, isolated the two competitors, yet in the Electoral College Garfield had a simple triumph over Hancock, 214 to 155.
