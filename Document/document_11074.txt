Walter of Brienne had battled the Catalans in Italy amid the War of the Vespers, talked their language, and had picked up their regard. Utilizing this recognition, he currently contracted the Company for a half year against the Greeks, at the high cost of four ounces of gold for each overwhelming cavalryman, two for each light cavalryman and one for each infantryman, to be paid each month, with two months' installment ahead of time. Turning back, the Catalans caught the town of Domokos and exactly thirty different posts, and looted the rich plain of Thessaly, constraining the Greek states to deal with Walter. This brought Walter awards and money related prizes from Pope Clement V, yet the Duke currently declined to respect his deal with the Catalans and give the staying four months' compensation. Walter picked the best 200 horsemen and 300 Almogavar infantry from the Company, paid them their back payments and gave them land with the goal that they would stay in his administration, while requesting the rest to hand over their triumphs and leave. The Catalans offered to remember him as their master on the off chance that they were permitted to keep a portion of the land they had taken to set up themselves however Walter dismissed their proposition and arranged to remove them by power. The Duke of Athens collected an expansive armed force, involving his feudatoriesÃ¢ÂÂamong the most noticeable were Albert Pallavicini, Margrave of Bodonitsa, Thomas III d'Autremencourt, Lord of Salona and Marshal of Achaea, and the nobles of Euboea, Boniface of Verona, George I Ghisi and John of MaisyÃ¢ÂÂjust as fortifications sent from different realms of Frankish Greece.
