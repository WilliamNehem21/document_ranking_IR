Strindberg charmed Bosse by sending her books about theosophy and the mysterious, by endeavoring to form her psyche, and by facilitating her vocation. Devoting himself completely to composing plays with focal parts he thought about reasonable for her, he attempted to induce her to demonstration them, and the Dramaten the executives to cast her in them. Bosse affirms in her release of the "Letters" that she would in general hang back, as did the administration, being in understanding that she come up short on the experience for major and complex jobs. Strindberg, a power in the theater, all things considered frequently won. The job of Eleonora in "Easter" (1901), which threatened Bosse by its affectability and delicacy, yet which she at long last attempted to play, ended up being Bosse's best and adored job, and a defining moment in Bosse's and Strindberg's relationship. They ended up occupied with March 1901, amid the practices of "Easter", in what in Bosse's account might be the best-known episode of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to request that he give the part to a progressively experienced performer, yet he guaranteed her she would be ideal for it. "At that point he set his hands on my shoulders, saw me long and fervently, and asked: 'Might you want to have a little youngster with me, Miss Bosse?' I made a curtsey and replied, just as entranced: 'Indeed, thank you!'Ã¢ÂÂ and we were locked in."
