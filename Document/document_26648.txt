During production, the team were asked to make multiple adjustments and changes to its content by "Drakengard"s advisory board. It was annoying enough for Yoko that he decided at the time not to make another "Drakengard". "Drakengard" was first shown off to the western public at E3 2003. It underwent multiple changes for its western release. The original title, "Drag-On Dragoon," was chosen for its sound, but was not considered right for the western market. Because of this, it was changed to "Drakengard". In addition, some of the more mature themes, such as references to incest and sexual taboos, were censored in the western localization. It also underwent major debugging and an alteration in the angle of the in-game camera before its European release. While Square Enix published the title in Japan and North America, Take-Two Interactive was chosen to publish it in European territories. The mobile port was part of Square Enix's plans to branch out into the European mobile game market. It was co-developed with London-based mobile developer Macrospace as part of a collaboration between Square Enix and Vodafone, designed to function on the Vodafone live! service. It was first released in Germany, then made available in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy.
