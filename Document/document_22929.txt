The many unauthorised American productions of 1878â79 were of widely varying quality, and many of them were adaptations of the opera. One of the more "authentic" ones was the production by the Boston Ideal Opera Company, which was first formed to produce "Pinafore". It engaged well-regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3,000-seat Boston Theatre. The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an "ideal" production. The "Boston Journal" reported that the audience was "wrought up by the entertainment to a point of absolute approval". The paper observed that it is a mistake to consider "Pinafore" a burlesque, "for while irresistibly comical it is not "bouffe" and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost". The "Journal" described the opera as "classical" in method and wrote that its "most exquisite satire" lay in its "imitation of the absurdities" of grand opera. The company went on to become one of the most successful touring companies in America. The first children's version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences, extending its run through the summer of 1879. The "Boston Herald" wrote that "the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delightÂ ... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard".
