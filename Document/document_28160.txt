In 2004 LÃ¼ and colleagues determined that the skeleton belonged to a new, distinct taxon, and made it the holotype specimen of "Nemegtia barsboldi". The genus name refers to the Nemegt Basin, and the specific name honours the Mongolian palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold, the leader of the team that found the specimen. In 2005 the describers discovered (after being notified by a biologist) that the name "Nemegtia" had already been used for a genus of freshwater seed shrimp (Ostracoda) from the same formation in 1978, and was therefore preoccupied. They proposed instead the new genus name "Nemegtomaia" (""maia"" means "good mother" in Greek, and the full name means "good mother of the Nemegt"), making reference to the then-recent discovery that oviraptorids brooded eggs rather than stealing them, though no trace of a nest or eggs had yet been found associated with "Nemegtomaia" itself. The first known member of the oviraptorid family was found with a nest of eggs originally thought to have belonged to the ceratopsian genus "Protoceratops", and was therefore named "Oviraptor" in 1924; this name means "egg-seizer". In the 1990s more oviraptorid specimens were discovered associated with nests and eggs, wherein oviraptorid embryos were found, thereby proving that the eggs belonged to the oviraptorids themselves. "Ingenia" was similarly renamed as "Ajancingenia" in 2013, since the former genus name was preoccupied by a roundworm (Nematoda).
