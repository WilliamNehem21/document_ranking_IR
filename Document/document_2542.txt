Despite the fact that they needed to recreate a more established sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt likewise needed to catch a greater amount of the bass and drum parts to include a more intense, current component to the blend. They connected an increasingly fundamental way to deal with miking the instruments and using the detachable apparatus, utilizing a Neumann U 47 for guitars, substituting overhead receivers for Saadiq's drum pack, a blend of dynamic and condenser mics for the unit's bass drum, and Ampex tape machines for additional glow to the pack. Brungardt utilized different standard mics for the catch drum to accomplish an increasingly strong breaking sound, instead of catching the drum's general tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adjusted from "The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions", and as Brungardt related, "It truly gave us warmth and character. It enabled the amp to inhale and we got the tones of the amp alongside the room. For me, that truly opened things up so I could play with the live room, utilizing distinctive reverbs to get a sound." For Saadiq's bass, they utilized a DI unit to associate a receiver preamplifier, expanded the increase on a module for less pressure, and balanced the low-end tones with an equalizer module.
