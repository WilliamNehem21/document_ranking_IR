Walters' first operational arrangement following the episode of World WarÃÂ II was as boss of No.ÃÂ 1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, which he prompted Sembawang, Singapore, in July 1940. His advancement to transitory wing authority was reported that month. He had before ventured out in disguise to Singapore on a Qantas Empire flying pontoon, which had been explicitly mentioned to go amiss from its ordinary flight way with the goal that he could inspect landing strips in the Dutch East Indies. Conveyed in light of fears of Japanese development in Malaya, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron was the primary Australian unit outfitted with Lockheed Hudson light planes, which were utilized fundamentally for oceanic watch work. Walters was granted the Air Force Cross for his "dynamic part in all tasks" and for preparing his unit to "an especially exclusive requirement"; the respect was gazetted in the 1941 King's Birthday Honors. He succeeded Frank Lukis as boss of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in May that year, and was advanced acting gathering skipper. In May 1942, he joined Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area (SWPA), in Melbourne as Assistant Director of Operations. He was made an impermanent gathering chief in September, and exchanged to Headquarters RAAF Command as senior air staff officer.
