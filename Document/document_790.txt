Bounce Fischbach of the "Omaha World-Herald" called the cinematography sharp, the altering fresh, and the acting "consistently great". He included, "The best part is that the composing is moored in actuality. Coyle gives his film a chance to demonstrate instead of tell, and gives watchers a chance to achieve their very own decisions." "Lavender" magazine essayist John Townsend said the film passed on sympathetic perspectives on Christianity and complimented the cinematography. Townsend especially commended Baumgartner's execution and depicted the scenes among Sisto and a young man vexed by his gay emotions (John Skelley) as "flawless". Chelsa Doyle, an author with the site Blogcritics, called it "a contacting and reflective film about confidence, expectation and decision". Doyle adulated the film's tranquil tone and the exhibitions of Sisto and Chenoweth, yet said it "once in a while gets somewhat lethargic in the center", and that the subplot including Father John's ex could have been cut by and large. "Denver Post" film faultfinder Lisa Kennedy adulated the exhibitions of Sisto and Chenoweth, and complimented Coyle's comprehension of the peaceful work of an area cleric. Nonetheless, she included that the film "doesn't get things started as a story, even one about recovery". Andrea Gronvall of the "Chicago Reader" considered it a "mushy acting", and expressed, "Author chief Patrick Coyle handles such profound issues as kid misuse, liquor addiction, fraud, abstinence, and Catholic changes, yet the motion picture's otherworldly plan is misrepresented by its voyeurism."
