The story is described by 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12, who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games instead of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose. The male tribute is Peeta Mellark, a previous classmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's pastry shop when her family was starving. In the days paving the way to the Games in the Capitol, they are given guidance by their inebriated tutor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; chaperone Effie Trinket; and different beauticians to upgrade their open recognition to get potential supporters, who will send conceivably life-sparing blessings amid the Games. Katniss' beautician, Cinna, planned uncommon ensembles for Katniss and Peeta that set them apart from the tributes when acquainted with people in general. Amid their assessment by the Gamemakers, Katniss out of the blue gets the most astounding score among the others. In the interim, Rue, the petite 12-year-old young lady tribute from District 11, chases after Katniss and Peeta amid the instructional meetings. On the day preceding the recreations, in the broadcast meet with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta uncovers his since a long time ago pathetic love for Katniss; she is at first stunned by this and trusts this is a ploy to pick up supporters, yet later acknowledges this as earnest. Haymitch then advances their picture as "star-crossed darlings".
