In January 1996, there was major flooding throughout Pennsylvania. A blizzard from January 6â8Â produced up to of snow, which was followed on January 19â21Â by more than of rain with temperatures as high as and winds up to . The rain and snowmelt caused flooding throughout Pennsylvania, and ice jams made the flooding worse on many streams. In neighboring Lycoming County, flooding on Lycoming Creek in and near Williamsport killed six and caused millions of dollars in damage, and an ice jam on Plunketts Creek destroyed a mid-19thÂ century stone arch bridge which was also on the NRHP.
The pressure of the flood on the Sonestown Covered Bridge moved the center of the structure almost downstream. This and other major damage closed the bridge from January until late December, 1996. It was one of 69 publicly owned bridges in Pennsylvania destroyed or closed by the flooding. Sullivan County owns the bridge and paid for its repair, which was mandated by the state since it is listed on the NRHP. The original bid was for $93,000, and the repair was done by Lycoming Supply Inc. of Williamsport for $89,000Â over 60Â days between mid-November and Christmas. The bridge's closure caused a detour for those who normally used the bridge to reach their homes and businesses.
