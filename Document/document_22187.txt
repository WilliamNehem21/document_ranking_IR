In Saxony-Anhalt, the species forages deep in valleys when temperatures are above , but on warmer slopes or rocky areas when it is colder. There, "M.Â alcathoe" is relatively easy to capture in August, because "M.Â brandtii" and "M.Â mystacinus" already start swarming in late July. Although there are some records of "M.Â alcathoe" in caves during the winter, it is also possible that animals spend the winter in tree cavities, and whether swarming behavior occurs in "M.Â alcathoe" is unclear. An animal found in a cave in Saxony-Anhalt in January was not sleeping deeply. Reproduction may also take place in caves, but pregnant females have been found as late as June. Relatively many juveniles are caught between July and September. In England, one individual of "M.Â alcathoe" was captured in 2003 (and identified at the time as "M.Â brandtii") and again in 2009. Three individuals that were telemetrically tracked (in eastern France, Thuringia, and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, respectively) moved only , , and from their night quarters; "M.Â brandtii" and "M.Â mystacinus" tend to move over longer distances. A study in Poland suggested frequent hybridization among "M.Â alcathoe", "M.Â brandtii", and "M.Â mystacinus" sharing the same swarming sites, probably attributable to male-biased sex ratios (1.7:1 in "M.Â alcathoe"), a polygynous mating system, and the high number of bats at swarming sites. "M.Â alcathoe" showed a particularly high proportion of hybrids, perhaps because it occurs at lower densities than the other two species.
