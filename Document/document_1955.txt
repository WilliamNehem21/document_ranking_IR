James M. Redfield, a works of art teacher at the University of Chicago, in his article "An Aristotelian Analysis of "Miss Moppet"" finds the story pursues the precepts of Aristotle's "Poetics", with a positive starting (the fruitless endeavor to get the mouse), center (Miss Moppet claiming to be harmed and getting the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet prodding the mouse and his departure). Redfield takes note of that Potter makes the result of the plot questionable and makes equality between the characters, which are normally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet "youthful, unpracticed, female, and a pet", while the mouse is "develop, gallant, male, and free". Redfield acclaims Potter's expertise as a writer; she utilizes the opening in the duster twiceÃ¢ÂÂto permit Miss Moppet to get the mouse, however then for him to get away from herÃ¢ÂÂand utilizations expresses especially appropriate for a parent to peruse so anyone might hear to a youngster ("This is the mouseÃÂ ..."). Redfield presumes that while prodding is terrible in the storyÃ¢ÂÂhazardous for the mouse, and unfeeling for the felineÃ¢ÂÂPotter herself prods the peruser positively, indicating "us that prodding is a sort of adoring when it is a sort of educating. The writer plays with us, and by taking us through an unbelievable encounter, instructs us what it is to live in reality."
