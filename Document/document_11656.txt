There are not very many archeological sources contemporaneous with Neferefre, a reality which is presently observed by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to infer an extremely short rule. Specifically, starting at 2017, just a single engraving dated to his standard is known. It was left by the manufacturers of his pyramid on a corner hinder toward the finish of the hallway prompting the pyramid substructures. The engraving was composed on the fourth day of the Akhet season in the time of first event of the dairy cattle tally, an occasion comprising of checking the domesticated animals all through the nation to assess the measure of charges to be imposed. It is generally trusted that such checks happened at regular intervals amid the Old Kingdom albeit late reappraisals have driven Egyptologists to set a less customary and to some degree progressively visit tally. Subsequently, the engraving must allude to Neferefre's first or second year on the honored position, and his third year at the most recent. At long last, a couple of antiques dated to Neferefre's standard or not long after have been revealed in his funeral home complex and somewhere else in Abusir, for example, mud seals bearing his Horus name.
