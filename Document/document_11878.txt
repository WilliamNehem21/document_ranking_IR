On stamps, the name of the state has dependably been written in Irish and once in a while likewise written in English. The overprints were stepped first "Rialtas Sealadach na hÃÂ©ireann" ("Provisional Government of Ireland") and later "SaorstÃÂ¡t ÃÂireann" ("Irish Free State"). Ensuing stamps about all utilized the name "ÃÂire" ("Ireland"), despite the fact that this was not the name of the state until the 1937 Constitution produced results. The special cases were issued in 1949 and 1950, and utilized "POBLAÃÂT NA hÃÂIREANN" or "Poblacht na h-ÃÂireann" ("Republic of Ireland"). This expression is the official "depiction" of the state determined in the Republic of Ireland Act, which came into power in April 1949; the state's "name" was not changed by the Act. Fianna FÃÂ¡il crushed the active government in the 1951 race and relinquished the utilization of the portrayal, returning to the name on stamps and somewhere else. Initially, "ÃÂire" was written in Gaelic sort; from 1952 to 1979, numerous stamps had the name of the state in Roman kind, generally in all tops, and frequently expressed "EIRE" as opposed to "ÃÂIRE", excluding the "sÃÂ­neadh fada" highlight over the underlying 'E'. In 1981 the Department of Posts and Telegraphs suggested the consideration of "Ireland" alongside "ÃÂire" on stamps however the Department of the Taoiseach vetoed the thought on the premise it could cause "sacred and political repercussions" and that "the change could be unwelcome."
