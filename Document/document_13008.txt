An examination before long uncovered Beauchamp as the executioner, and he was caught at his home in Glasgow, four days after the homicide. He was attempted, indicted, and condemned to death by hanging. He was conceded a stay of execution to enable him to compose an avocation of his activities. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was striven for complicity in the homicide, yet was cleared for absence of proof. Her commitment to Beauchamp incited her to remain in his cell with him, where the two endeavored a twofold suicide by drinking laudanum presently before the execution. This endeavor fizzled. On the morning of the execution, the couple again endeavored suicide, this time by cutting themselves with a blade Anna had carried into the cell. At the point when the gatekeepers found them, Beauchamp was hurried to the hangman's tree, where he was hanged before he could bite the dust of his cut injury. He was the primary individual lawfully executed in the territory of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp kicked the bucket from her injuries in the blink of an eye before her better half was hanged. As per their desires, the couple's bodies were situated in a grasp when covered in a similar casket.
