"Gallimimus" had 64Ã¢ÂÂ 66 vertebrae in its spine, less than different ornithomimids. The centra (or bodies) of the vertebrae were platycoelous, with a level front surface and an inward rear surface, aside from the initial six caudal (tail) vertebraÃ¢ÂÂ where the rear surface was likewise flatÃ¢ÂÂ and those toward the finish of the tailÃ¢ÂÂ which were amphiplatyan with the two surfaces level. A significant number of the centra had foramina (openings which have additionally been classified "pleurocoels"), and were thusly most likely pneumatic (with their empty chambers attacked via air sacs). The neck comprised of 10 cervical vertebrae, which were all long and wide, aside from the chart book bone (the primary vertebra that interfaces with the back of the skull). The chart book contrasted from that of different ornithomimids in that the outside of its intercentrum was inclined downwards towards the back, rather than being sunken and confronting upwards. The neck seems to have been relatively longer in connection to the storage compartment than in different ornithomimids. The neck was isolated into two particular areas: the cervical vertebrae at the front had centra which were almost triangular in side view and decreased towards the back, just as low neural curves and short, expansive zygapophyses (the procedures that explained between the vertebrae); the cervical vertebrae at the back had spool-like centra which turned out to be steadily higher, and long, slight zygapophyses. The pneumatic foramina here were little and oval, and the neural spines anticipating outwards from the centra shaped long, low and sharp edges, aside from in the rearmost cervical vertebrae.
