The archeological remains are perceived as a GradeÃÂ I recorded structure and a booked old landmark, and are viewed as the most essential ascetic stays in Cheshire. They comprise of the previous undercroft and the establishments of the congregation and religious structures that were uncovered amid the unearthings. The undercroft remains outside the exhibition hall building. It is a solitary story structure comprising of seven sets of straights isolated into two compartments, one of four and the other of three sounds. It is entered through the colonnade added toward the west front of the nation house in 1886 by method for a couple of curved entryways in Norman style. The entryway to one side (south) is unique, dating from the late 12thÃÂ century, while the other entryway is a reproduction dated 1886. The more established entryway has been portrayed as "the best beautified Norman entryway in Cheshire". It is in great condition with little proof of disintegration and Greene thinks about this is on the grounds that it has dependably been shielded from the climate. The porch leads into the four-cove compartment. This has a tiled floor and contains a medieval-style chimney. The rooftop is ribbed vaulted. On the east divider is a two-curved entryway prompting the previous orders. Toward the north another opening prompts the three-inlet compartment. This likewise has a tile floor and contains the block wine canisters included the 1780s. The top of this compartment has groined vaults. The undercroft likewise contains a chime shape, reproduced from the parts of the first form found in the unearthings.
