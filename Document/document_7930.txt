McClellan's aversion to liberation included to the weight him, as he got unpleasant analysis from Radical Republicans in the legislature. He saw servitude as a foundation perceived in the Constitution, and qualified for government insurance wherever it existed (Lincoln held a similar open position until August 1862). McClellan's works after the war were run of the mill of numerous Northerners: "I admit to a preference for my own race, and can't figure out how to like the scent of either Billy goats or niggers." But in November 1861, he kept in touch with his significant other, "I will, if effective, toss my sword onto the scale to drive an improvement in the state of those poor blacks." He later composed that had it been his place to orchestrate the terms of harmony, he would have demanded steady liberation, guarding the privileges of the two slaves and bosses, as a major aspect of any settlement. Be that as it may, he made no mystery of his resistance to the extreme Republicans. He told Ellen, "I won't battle for the abolitionists." This place him in resistance with authorities of the organization who trusted he was endeavoring to actualize the arrangements of the resistance.
