As indicated by Jacobs, "Ralph, Captain Corcoran, Sir Joseph and Josephine all live in their intuitive music (especially 'Don't worry about it the why and wherefore'), and nearly as much melodic asset is pampered on two characters caricatured from musical show or drama, Little Buttercup with 'tramp blood in her veins' and the overwhelming stepping Dick Deadeye." Jacobs likewise opined that the main tone that starts "It doesn't mind the why and wherefore" "serves to stress the expression like a Johann Strauss-ian effortlessness note". The Sullivan researcher David Russell Hulme noticed Sullivan's farce of operatic styles, "especially the Handelian recitatives and the elopement scene (suggestive of such a significant number of nighttime operatic intrigues), however best of all is the crime of the enthusiastic tune in 'For he is an Englishman!'" Buttercup's Act II tune, in which she uncovers the dull mystery of the infant exchanging is gone before by a statement from Franz Schubert's "The Erl-King" and furthermore spoofs the musical drama "Il Trovatore". Jacobs takes note of that Sullivan likewise adds his own entertaining contacts to the music by setting typical articulations in "Donizettian recitative". In any case, on the genuine side, he upgrades the snapshots of genuine passionate peak, as in Josephine's Act II aria, and added melodic enthusiasm to coordinated numbers by "quietly moving the rhythms and bar groupings."
