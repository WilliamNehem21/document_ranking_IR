In 1911 American social researcher Wallace Craig distributed a record of the signals and hints of this species as a progression of depictions and melodic documentations, in light of perception of C. O. Whitman's hostage traveler pigeons in 1903. Craig aggregated these records to help with recognizing potential survivors in the wild (as the physically comparable grieving birds could somehow or another be confused with traveler pigeons), while taking note of this "small data" was likely all that would be left regarding the matter. As per Craig, one call was a basic brutal "keck" that could be given twice in progression with an interruption in the middle. This was said to be utilized to draw in the consideration of another pigeon. Another call was a progressively continuous and variable chiding. This sound was portrayed as "kee-kee-kee-kee" or "tete! tete! tete!", and was utilized to call either to its mate or towards different animals it viewed as foes. One variation of this call, depicted as a long, drawn-out "tweet", could be utilized to call down a herd of traveler pigeons passing overhead, which would then land in a close-by tree. "Keeho" was a delicate cooing that, while pursued by more intense "keck" notes or chiding, was aimed at the feathered creature's mate. A settling traveler pigeon would likewise emit a surge of somewhere around eight blended notes that were both high and low in tone and finished with "keeho". In general, female traveler pigeons were calmer and called inconsistently. Craig proposed that the uproarious, strident voice and "declined" musicality was the consequence of living in crowded states where just the most intense sounds could be heard.
