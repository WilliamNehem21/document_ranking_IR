The first subfossil feathered creature stays on RÃÂ©union were found in 1974, and alloted to a stork, "Ciconia" sp., by the British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles. The remaining parts were found in a cavern, which showed it had been brought there and eaten by early pioneers. It was theorized that the remaining parts could have had a place with an expansive, puzzling fowl depicted by Leguat, and called "Leguat's goliath" by certain ornithologists. "Leguat's mammoth" is currently thought to be founded on a locally terminated populace of flamingos. In 1987, subfossils of an as of late wiped out types of ibis from RÃÂ©union were portrayed as "Borbonibis latipes" by the French scientistss CÃÂ©cile Mourer-ChauvirÃÂ© and FranÃÂ§ois Moutou, and thought identified with the bare ibises of the variety "Geronticus". In 1994, the "stork" remains were appeared to have a place with this ibis also. The 1987 revelation drove the English scientist Anthony S. Cheke to propose to one of the describers of "Borbonibis" that the subfossils may have been of the RÃÂ©union solitaire. This recommendation was distributed by the describers in 1995, and they likewise reassigned it to the family "Threskiornis", presently joined with the particular designation "" from de SÃÂ©lys-Longchamps' 1848 binomial for the solitaire. The writers brought up that the contemporary portrayals coordinated the appearance and conduct of an ibis in excess of an individual from the Raphinae, particularly since a section of a nearly short and straight ibis mandible was found in 1994, and in light of the fact that ibis remains were copious in certain territories; it would be weird if contemporary scholars never referenced such a generally normal winged animal, though they referenced most different species thusly known from fossils.
