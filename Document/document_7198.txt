Bodley was instructed at a LycÃÂ©e in Paris before he was sent to Eton College and after that to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Bodley demonstrated enthusiasm as an essayist; he composed verse at Eton and for a cadet magazine at Sandhurst. From Sandhurst he was charged in the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a second lieutenant in September 1911. He went through three years serving in a regiment in British India where he started to compose and arrange plays. His leader once commented "The plays are entertaining. You're an a good representative for the regiment and all that, however did you join the military to turn into a trooper or a comic?" Shortly from there on the First World War broke out, and Bodley was sent toward the Western Front for a long time. He was injured a few times, including by toxin gas. At 26 years old he was given the position of lieutenant colonel and direction of a unit. He was delegated aide military attachÃÂ© to Paris on 15 August 1918, and went to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. What he heard there purportedly made him feel that he and the a great many different troopers had battled in vain; he composed later that "narrow minded government officials [were] laying the preparation for the Second World War Ã¢ÂÂ every nation getting everything it could for itself, making national oppositions, and resuscitating the interests of mystery." Disillusioned with the military, Bodley thought about a vocation in legislative issues on the exhortation of the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George.
