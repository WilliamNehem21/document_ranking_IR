Notwithstanding his absence of involvement in creating film music, Prokofiev started his "KijÃÂ©" score unquestionably, later composition: "I by one way or another had no questions whatever about the melodic language for the film". He told the makers, "What is imperative to me is the time, the interior importance of every occasion, the identity of every saint", and cautioned them not to expect negligible melodic "representations". He went to practices and made nitty gritty notes of the activity and the acting. The period setting of the film spoke to Prokofiev; Robinson remarks that the "KijÃÂ©" score is one of a few works, including the "Traditional Symphony", "The Love of Three Oranges", "Cinderella", and "War and Peace", that show "the author's affection for the eighteenth century". The language he picked joined components of silliness and sentiment with a hidden despairingÃ¢ÂÂhe deciphered the story as more appalling than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's "BolÃÂ©ro" in Paris, and had been quite inspired by the French arranger's utilization of the saxophone, an instrument at that point seldom utilized in symphonic organizations outside France yet which fit Prokofiev's goals splendidly. The author Gerard McBurney has called attention to the "eerie hints of the tenor saxophone" that accentuate the "KijÃÂ©" music.
