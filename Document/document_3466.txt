Amid the medium-term long periods of OctoberÃÂ 22Ã¢ÂÂ 23, Patricia turned northwest and decelerated somewhat as it achieved the western edge of the mid-level edge. Fast advancement proceeded into OctoberÃÂ 23, and the sea tempest came to CategoryÃÂ 5 status by 00:00ÃÂ UTC, with winds evaluated at 175ÃÂ mph (280ÃÂ km/h). Convection cooled significantly further, with cloud tops colder than encompassing a wide eye by 03:00ÃÂ UTC. In a 24-hour range, Patricia's breezes expanded by 120ÃÂ mph (195ÃÂ km/h) and its focal weight fell by 95ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 2.81ÃÂ inHg). Around 06:00ÃÂ UTC, an Air Force Reserve surveillance flying machine estimated flight-level breezes of and the flying machine's ventured recurrence microwave radiometer (SFMR) watched surface breezes of . Besides, the last dropsonde perception from that mission at about 06:45ÃÂ UTC showed a focal weight of 879ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 25.96ÃÂ inHg). Quick improvement proceeded after the flying machine left the sea tempest, as the three weight readings amid the mission demonstrated that the weight fell at a rate of more than 7ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 0.21ÃÂ inHg) every hour. Their discoveries likewise uncovered an exceptionally tight weight angle of 24ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 0.71ÃÂ inHg) per nautical mile, among the steepest inclinations on record.
