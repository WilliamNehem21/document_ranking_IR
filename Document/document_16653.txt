"Braunschweig" remained in Libau until late September, when she was recalled to Kiel, arriving on the 23rd. Two days later, she resumed guard ship duty in the mouth of the Elbe, which lasted until 4 October. She returned to Kiel the next day, and on 12 October was deployed back to Libau to guard the port, along with "Elsass" and . On 12 October, the British submarine fired a single torpedo at "Braunschweig", though it failed to hit its target. On 14 December, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited the ship. By this point in the war, the Navy was encountering difficulties in manning more important vessels, and the insufficient underwater protection of the older German battleships rendered them unusable in the Baltic, owing to the threat from submarines. As a result, the IV Squadron was dissolved and most of the ships were placed in reserve. "Braunschweig", however, became the flagship of "VAdm" Friedrich Schultz, the Commander of Reconnaissance Forces in the Eastern Baltic Sea. On 5 January 1916, "Braunschweig", "Mecklenburg", the light cruiser , and the X Torpedo-boat Flotilla left Libau for Kiel before continuing on to Hamburg. There, "Braunschweig" underwent repairs at the Blohm & Voss shipyard, which lasted from 10 January to 26 February.
