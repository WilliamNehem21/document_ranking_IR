Cosima was resolved to safeguard Bayreuth's select right, recognized by Ludwig, to perform "Parsifal". After Ludwig's demise in 1886 this privilege was quickly tested by his successor, an endeavor quickly crushed by Cosima with the assistance of GroÃÂ. A progressively genuine risk emerged from the German copyright laws, which just secured labors for a long time following the maker's demise; in this way "Parsifal" would lose its assurance in 1913 paying little mind to any concurrence with the Bavarian court. In expectation, in 1901 Cosima looked to have the time of copyright assurance reached out by law to 50 years. She campaigned individuals from the Reichstag vigorously, and was guaranteed by Kaiser Wilhelm II of his help. These endeavors neglected to realize any adjustment in the law. In 1903, exploiting the absence of a copyright understanding between the United States and Germany, Heinrich Conried of the New York Metropolitan Opera declared that he would arrange "Parsifal" soon thereafter. Cosima was maddened, yet her endeavors to avoid him were without much of any result; the first of 11 exhibitions occurred on 24 December 1903. The undertaking was a well known and basic achievement, however in Cosima's view it was an "assault"; her antagonistic vibe towards the Metropolitan went on for an amazing rest.
