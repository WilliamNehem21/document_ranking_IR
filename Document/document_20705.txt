The developers for "Final Fantasy XIII" were divided into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters. Each physical area of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas. Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. Director Motomu Toriyama had worked on "Final Fantasy X" and "X-2"; producer Yoshinori Kitase had worked on "V" through "VIII" and as the producer for "X" and "X-2"; main-character designer Tetsuya Nomura had performed the same role for "VII", "VIII", "X", and "X-2", and battle-system director Toshiro Tsuchida reprised that role from "Final Fantasy X". As "XIII" was the first "Final Fantasy" game for the PlayStation 3, the development team's internal goal was for the game to have the same "gameplay and craftmanship" impact that "Final Fantasy VII" and "X" had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles. They aimed to sell fiveÂ million copies of the game. Toriyama wanted the game to be "the ultimate single player RPG".
