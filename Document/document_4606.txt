In the post-war period there was a response against the substantial scale music of writers, for example, Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Stravinsky, whose "Ritual of Spring" was composed for a gigantic symphony, started to deal with an a lot littler scale. His 1923 artful dance score "Les noces" is made for voices and twenty-one instruments. Ravel disliked the work (his sentiment caused a cooling in Stravinsky's companionship with him) yet he was in compassion for the style for "dÃÂ©pouillement" Ã¢ÂÂ the "stripping without end" of pre-war lavishness to uncover the fundamentals. A considerable lot of his works from the 1920s are observably sparer in surface than prior pieces. Different impacts on him in this period were jazz and atonality. Jazz was well known in Parisian bistros, and French arrangers, for example, Darius Milhaud consolidated components of it in their work. Ravel remarked that he favored jazz to excellent musical show, and its impact is heard in his later music. Arnold SchÃÂ¶nberg's surrender of regular tonality likewise had echoes in a portion of Ravel's music, for example, the "Chansons madÃÂ©casses" (1926), which Ravel questioned he could have composed without the case of "Pierrot Lunaire". His other significant works from the 1920s incorporate the instrumental course of action of Mussorgsky's piano suite "Pictures at an Exhibition" (1922), the musical show "L'enfant et les sortilÃÂ¨ges" to a lyrics by Colette (1926), "Tzigane" (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).
