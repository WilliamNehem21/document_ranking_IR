In spite of the fact that he didn't need to confront top-class quick bowling in Test matches, he was effective against English quick bowlers, for example, Harold Larwood in province cricket, and he built up his domination over O'Reilly, the world's best bowler at the time. On one event, O'Reilly grasped his head when he saw Leyland turn out to bat, and was heard to state: "Gracious, it's that ridiculous Yorkshireman once more!" In later years, O'Reilly energetically denied that Leyland held the high ground, reacting to such proposals by saying "You simply check how often I got him out!" The cricket student of history David Frith calls attention to that "the appropriate response is multiple times in 16 Tests, yet with diminishing recurrence. In their Test experiences Leyland made 1,412 keeps running at a normal of 56." Robertson-Glasgow noticed that Leyland was practically unknown in great batting conditions under little weight; he woke up in increasingly troublesome conditions: "His component was foul climate. He would vanish into the cloudiness of Bramall Lane, where a sterner kind of amusement was being played under the name of cricket, and settle in himself among the sawdust and smoke and off-breaks and advances, and do his crude, extreme work peacefully."
