Monteux first directed the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (SFSO) in 1931, and in 1935 at 60 years old he was offered the main conductorship. He was suspicious about tolerating, both on close to home and on expert grounds. He would not like to leave the OSP, his better half did not have any desire to live on the west shore of America, and the symphony was so low in assets that it had been compelled to drop a whole season in 1934. Like most symphonies the SFSO had been seriously hit monetarily by the sadness, and it endured the further trouble that huge numbers of its previous players had left for better-paid occupations in Hollywood studios. That issue was exacerbated by the request of the Musicians' Union that just neighborhood players could be selected. Monteux all things considered acknowledged the arrangement. The SFSO show season was never longer than five months per year, which empowered him to keep working with the OSP, and enabled him to lead the debut show of the NBC Symphony Orchestra on 13 November 1937. In "The New York Times" Olin Downes composed that the new symphony was "of exceptionally high position" and that the communicate show had shown Monteux "at the tallness of his forces."
