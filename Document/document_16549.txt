On 22 March, "Pobeda" joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur's harbor and hit the once, killing seven men. She participated in the action of 13 April, when TÅgÅ successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, the battleship . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur, and "Petropavlovsk" struck a mine laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. When "Pobeda" was returning to port after "Petropavlovsk" sank, she struck a mine herself, but was able to steam to the harbor under her own power despite an 11Â° list. Her repairs were completed on 9 June although some of her guns were removed during this time to reinforce the defenses of the port. "Pobeda" lost a total of three 6-inch, two 75-millimeter, one 47-millimeter and four 37-millimeter guns. She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok. The new fleet commander, Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle. "Pobeda" bombarded Japanese positions besieging the port on 28 July.
