In 1978, the World Hockey Association (WHA) group was in rivalry with the set up NHL. The NHL did not permit the marking of players under age 20, yet the WHA had no guidelines with respect to such signings. A few WHA groups sought Gretzky, remarkably the Indianapolis Racers and the Birmingham Bulls. Birmingham Bulls proprietor John F. Bassett needed to stand up to the NHL by marking whatever number youthful and promising geniuses as could be expected under the circumstances and considered Gretzky to be the most encouraging youthful prospect. Be that as it may, it was Racers proprietor Nelson Skalbania who, on June 12, 1978, marked 17-year-old Gretzky to a seven-year individual administrations contract worth US$1.75ÃÂ million. Gretzky scored his first expert objective against Dave Dryden of the Edmonton Oilers in his fifth diversion, and his second objective four seconds after the fact. Skalbania picked to have Gretzky sign an individual administrations contract as opposed to a standard player contract to some degree since he realized an arrangement to take some WHA groups into the NHL was underway. He likewise realized that the Racers couldn't would like to be incorporated among those groups, and wanted to keep the Racers alive sufficiently long to gather remuneration from the enduring groups when the WHA broke down, just as any subsidizes earned from selling the youthful star.
