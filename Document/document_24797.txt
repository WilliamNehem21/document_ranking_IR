The first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as "Wolfenstein 3D", though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled "The Nocturnal Missions". Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game. In 1993 Apogee also published the "Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades" pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called "WolfMaster", along with a map editor titled "MapEdit" and a random level generator named "Wolf Creator". A retail "Wolfenstein" episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, "Spear of Destiny", was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled "Return to Danger" and "Ultimate Challenge", each the same length as "Spear of Destiny", in May 1994, and later that year published "Spear of Destiny" and the two mission packs together as the "Spear of Destiny Super CD Package". Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through GT Software in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through Activision in 1998.
