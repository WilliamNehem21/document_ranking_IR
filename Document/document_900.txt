The crippled Austrian armed force landed at Ulm in the early long periods of 10 October. Mack was pondering his strategy and the Austrian armed force stayed inert at Ulm until the eleventh. In the interim, Napoleon was working under imperfect presumptions: he trusted the Austrians were moving toward the east or southeast and that Ulm was softly watched. Ney detected this confusion and wrote to Berthier that Ulm was, truth be told, more intensely protected than the French initially suspected. Amid this time, the Russian risk toward the east started to distract Napoleon so much that Murat was given order of the conservative of the military, comprising of Ney's and Lannes' corps. The French were isolated in two monstrous wings now: the powers of Ney, Lannes, and Murat toward the west were containing Mack while those of Soult, Davout, Bernadotte, and Auguste Marmont toward the east were accused of guarding against any conceivable Russian and Austrian attacks. On 11 October Ney made a reestablished push on Ulm; the second and third divisions were to walk to the city along the correct bank of the Danube while Dupont's division, bolstered by one dragoon division, was to walk legitimately for Ulm and catch the whole city. The requests were sad on the grounds that Ney still did not realize that the whole Austrian armed force was positioned at Ulm.
