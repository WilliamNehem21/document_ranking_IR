In 1951, while making "High Noon", Cooper progressed toward becoming companions with the film's screenwriter, Carl Foreman, who had been an individual from the Communist Party. At the point when Foreman was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee, Cooper put his profession at stake to guard Foreman. At the point when John Wayne and others undermined Cooper with boycotting himself and the loss of his visa on the off chance that he didn't stroll off the film, Cooper gave an announcement to the press in help of Foreman, calling him "the best sort of American". At the point when maker Stanley Kramer evacuated Foreman's name as screenwriter, Cooper and executive Fred Zinnemann took steps to stroll off the film if Foreman's name wasn't returned on. Foreman later said that, of every one of his companions and partners and associates in Hollywood, ""Cooper was the main huge one who attempted to support him. The just one"". Cooper even offered to affirm for Foreman's benefit before HUAC, yet character observers were not permitted. Foreman constantly sent future contents to Cooper for first refusal, including: "The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Key" and "The Guns of Navarone". Cooper needed to turn them down in view of his age.
