Several Russian species, based on poorly preserved vertebral remains, were referred to "Elasmosaurus" by N.N. Bogolubov in 1911. One was "E.helmerseni", which was first described by W.Kiprijanoff in 1882 from Maloje Serdoba, Saratov, as "Plesiosaurus helmerseni". Some material from Scania, Sweden, was referred to "helmerseni" in 1885 by H.SchrÃ¶der. Vertebral and limb remains from Kursk initially referred by Kiprijanoff to "P.helmerseni" were also moved by Bogolubov to the new species "E.kurskensis", which he considered to be "identical with "Elasmosaurus" or related to it". He also named "E.orskensis", based on "very large" neck and tail vertebra remains from Konopljanka, Orenburg; and "E.serdobensis", based on a single neck vertebra from Maloje Serdoba. However, the validity of all of these species has been questioned. Welles considered "E.kurskensis" as an indeterminate plesiosaur in 1962. Persson noted in a 1959 review of the Swedish ""E."helmerseni" material that, while the species was probably closely related to "Elasmosaurus" proper, it was too fragmentary for this hypothesis to be assessed; he later remarked in 1963 that, regarding the latter three species, "their generic and specific definition is questionable", although he declined to specifically label them as invalid on account of not having seen the fossil material. Similarly, in 1999, Evgeniy Pervushov, Maxim Arkhangelsky, and A.V. Ivanov considered "E.helmerseni" to be an indeterminate elasmosaurid. In 2000 Storrs, Archangelsky, and Vladimir Efimov concurred with Welles on "E.kurskensis", and labelled "E.orskensis" and "E.serdobensis" as indeterminate elasmosaurids.
