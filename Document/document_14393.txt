Point by point land data about the Roman Empire, in any event its easternmost regions, is given in customary Chinese historiography. The "Shiji" by Sima Qian (c. 145Ã¢ÂÂ 86 BC) gives portrayals of nations in Central Asia and West Asia. These records turned out to be altogether more nuanced in the "Book of Han", co-created by Ban Gu and his sister Ban Zhao, more youthful kin of the general Ban Chao, who drove military adventures into Central Asia before coming back to China in 102 AD. The westernmost domains of Asia as depicted in the "Book of the Later Han" gathered by Fan Ye (398Ã¢ÂÂ 445 AD) framed the reason for practically all later records of Daqin. These records appear to be confined to depictions of the Levant, especially Syria. Recorded etymologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank clarifies that Chinese students of history considered Daqin to be a sort of "counter-China" situated at the contrary end of their known world. As per Pulleyblank, "the Chinese origination of DÃÂ  QÃÂ­n was befuddled from the beginning with old legendary ideas about the far west". The Chinese chronicles unequivocally related Daqin and Lijian (additionally "Li-kan", or Syria) as having a place with a similar nation; as indicated by Yule, D. D. Leslie, and K. H. G. Gardiner, the soonest portrayals of Lijian in the "Shiji" recognized it as the Hellenistic-period Seleucid Empire. Pulleyblank gives some phonetic examination to question their proposition, contending that Tiaozhi () in the "Shiji" was probably the Seleucid Empire and that Lijian, albeit still inadequately comprehended, could be related to either Hyrcania in Iran or even Alexandria in Egypt.
