After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of DÃ¼rer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573â74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633â58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. DÃ¼rer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as "among the most severe losses in the DÃ¼rer oeuvre".
In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that "Unknown Woman in a Coif", held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W.Â B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and DÃ¼rer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3Â cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and DÃ¼rer's 1514 charcoal drawing "Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63". Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as "precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds".
