The bigger quarries could be profoundly beneficial. The "Mining Journal" evaluated in 1859 that the Penrhyn quarries delivered a yearly net benefit of GBÃÂ£100,000, and the Dinorwig Quarry ÃÂ£70,000 every year. From 1860 onwards slate costs climbed consistently. Quarries extended and the number of inhabitants in the quarrying locale expanded, for instance the number of inhabitants in Ffestiniog ward expanded from 732 out of 1801 to 11,274 of every 1881. All out Welsh generation achieved 350,000ÃÂ tons per year before the finish of the 1860s. Of this aggregate, over 100,000ÃÂ tons originated from the Bethesda zone, for the most part from the Penrhyn Quarry. Blaenau Ffestiniog delivered nearly to such an extent, and the Dinorwig Quarry alone created 80,000ÃÂ tons every year. The Nantlle Valley quarries created 40,000ÃÂ tons, while the rest of Wales outside these territories delivered just about 20,000ÃÂ tons every year. By the late 1870s, Wales was creating 450,000ÃÂ tons of slate every year, contrasted and simply over 50,000ÃÂ tons for the remainder of the United Kingdom, which at that point included Ireland. In 1882, 92% of the United Kingdom's generation was from Wales with the quarries at Penrhyn and Dinorwig creating half of this between them. Alun Richards remarks on the significance of the slate business:
