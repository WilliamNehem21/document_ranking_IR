Amid the 1950s, H.D. composed a lot of verse, most quite "Helen in Egypt" (composed between 1952Ã¢ÂÂ 54), an examination from a women's activist perspective of a male-focused epic verse. H.D. utilized Euripides' play "Helen" as a beginning stage for a reinterpretation of the premise of the Trojan War and, by expansion, of war itself. This work has been seen by certain faultfinders, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D's. reaction to Pound's "Cantos", a work she incredibly respected. Different ballads from this period incorporate "Sagesse", "Winter Love" and "Hermetic Definition". These three were distributed after death with the aggregate title "Hermetic Definition" (1972). The lyric "Hermetic Definition" takes as its beginning stages her affection for a man 30 years her lesser and the line 'so moderate is the rose to open' from Pound's "Canto 106". "Sagesse", written in bed after H.D. had padped her hip in a fall, fills in as a sort of coda to "Set of three". being somewhat written in the voice of a youthful female Blitz survivor who winds up living in dread of the nuclear bomb. "Winter Love" was composed together with "End to Torment" and uses as storyteller the Homeric figure of Penelope to repeat the material of the diary in beautiful structure. At one time, H.D. considered annexing this sonnet as a coda to "Helen in Egypt."
