By April 1944, No.ÃÂ 463 Squadron had started to focus on focuses in France and Belgium as the Allied air battle moved concentration from vital shelling to decimating landing strips and disturbing lines of correspondence preceding the attack of the landmass. On 8ÃÂ May, Brill was the besieging controller for an attack on a landing strip close Brest. The controller was required to land in front of the primary Allied power, watch that flares denoting the objective were set up, and caution his colleagues on the off chance that they were bombarding mistakenly. When Brill had finished this undertaking and gone in himself to assault, the ground protections were completely alert and peppered his Lancaster with 140 slug gaps, however he wouldn't make hesitant move until he had conveyed his bombload. Elevated to acting wing administrator, Brill expected control of No.ÃÂ 467 Squadron on 12ÃÂ May, after the demise in battle of its past leader, Group Captain John Balmer. As indicated by the official history of the RAAF in World WarÃÂ II, Brill "demonstrated a commendable successor to Balmer both in organization and in the dashing kind of initiative which had conveyed the Waddington squadrons to the fore in No.ÃÂ 5 Group". He was granted the Distinguished Service Order on 19ÃÂ May for "authority, ability and valor of the most noteworthy request" and "his assurance to make each foray a triumph" disregarding incessant harm to his airplane. Early the following month he drove No.ÃÂ 467 Squadron in strikes on Axis radar stations in northern France. The unit was in real life on D-Day over Pointe du Hoc and, later, clearing a hall for Allied troops progressing up the Cherbourg promontory.
