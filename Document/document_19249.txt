The narrative was divided into smaller "pieces of drama" similar to a television series rather than one overarching story piece. This was reflected by the game's working title "Final Fantasy XIII: Season 2" when the project was first proposed within the company. Unlike "Final Fantasy X-2", which had a more cheerful and humorous feel than "Final Fantasy X", the staff members wanted the overall tone of "Final Fantasy XIII-2" to be serious as well as darker and more mysterious than its predecessor. The original scenario had called for Serah to travel alone with Mog. However, Kitase felt that their dialogue was "quite girly, almost camp and a bit over the top" and resulted in a tonal shift that was too similar to the one from "X" to "X-2". Noel was added to the story to counter this. Watanabe considered scriptwriting for the game's two-character party difficult. With the lack of varied personality traits provided by an ensemble cast, he had to ensure that conversations between Serah and Noel would not be repetitive or unrealistic. Unfamiliar concepts and terms in "Final Fantasy XIII", such as "l'Cie" and "fal'Cie", were deemed too difficult to understand and hence avoided in the sequel. A story link to "Final Fantasy Type-0" via the location Valhalla was planned but later discarded.
