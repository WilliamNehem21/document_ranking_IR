Prior in Bede's "Religious History of the English People" narrative, he records seven rulers who administered the southern territories of the English, with rules dating from the late fifth to the late seventh century. In this manner, the "Old English Saxon Chronicle"Ã¢ÂÂ another vital hotspot for the periodÃ¢ÂÂportrays these seven as or , a title interpreted as "England ruler" or "Wide-ruler". The "Account" adds only one ruler to the rundown: Egbert of Wessex, who reigned in the ninth century. The subsequent rundown of eight precludes a few in number Mercian rulers. It is conceivable that the writer was simply adding Egbert's name to Bede's unique rundown of seven, instead of asserting that no different rulers accomplished comparative powers in England. The recorder was more likely than not a West Saxon, and since neither ÃÂthelbald nor Offa were rulers of Wessex it is conceivable the writer does not specify them out of local pride. The importance of the expression "bretwalda", and the idea of the power that these eight lords used, has had much scholarly examination. One recommended understanding is that since Bede was composing amid ÃÂthelbald's rule, the first seven he recorded were basically those lords who could be viewed as models of ÃÂthelbald in their mastery of England south of the Humber.
