The commemoration is of Portland stone development. It comprises of a low screen divider over which is a tomb chest (cenotaph) finished with a cut wreath, the remainder of eight cenotaphs by Lutyens to be worked in EnglandÃ¢ÂÂthe first being Southampton's and the most acclaimed being that on Whitehall in London. The city's escutcheon is cut and painted into the tomb, bolstered by two help figures of holy messengers. The commemoration is flanked by platforms, which are finished with bronze flambeaux (flaring lights) overlaid with gold leaf. Jutting from the screen divider, underneath the emblem, is a Stone of Remembrance, the just a single he intended to be coordinated into a bigger structure. Incorporated with the structure were two metal coffins, one of which contained a rundown of Norwich's dead from the war and the substance of the second is obscure; the board concluded that it would have been wrong to open it amid rebuilding work. The remembrance is structured so gas can be singed inside it, with the smoke and flares produced through the flambeaux at either end. Lutyens proposed comparable structures for a few commemorations, including the Cenotaph on Whitehall, yet Norwich was the main spot where the proposition was acknowledged and is along these lines the just a single of his dedications fit for emanating a fire. The engravings read (over the stone) and (on the stone itself). A further engraving in littler text style on the base of the stone peruses . This was included sometime in the future, alongside the dates of the two world wars which are engraved on the screen divider, either side of the stone.
