In late April, "Schlesien" was taken into the drydock at the "Kaiserliche Werft" (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven to be converted into a training ship for naval cadets. The ship's main and secondary battery guns were removed so they could be used ashore, leaving "Schlesien" equipped with a battery of and guns. She had made several training cruises in the Baltic by November 1918; she was in Kiel during the Kiel mutiny in the closing days of the war. On 5 November, she left the port still flying the Imperial German flag even after most of the other vessels in the port had hoisted the red flag of revolution. "Schlesien" initially went to Flensburg, but mutineers had already spread to the port, so on orders from the "Reichsmarineamt" (Imperial Naval Office) she sailed instead to SwinemÃ¼nde, where on 10 November her commander, "FregattenkapitÃ¤n" (Frigate Captain) von Waldeye-Hartz hauled down his flag and placed his ship out of service. He and the crew remained aboard, and on 14 November they took the ship back to Kiel, where they were released from service on 20 November. She was used briefly again to train cadets to operate boilers and engines; on 1 December, she was again removed from service.
