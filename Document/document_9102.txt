Psilocybin is available in fluctuating fixations in more than 200 types of Basidiomycota mushrooms. In a 2000 audit on the overall dispersion of stimulating mushrooms, GastÃÂ³n GuzmÃÂ¡n and associates considered these to be disseminated among the accompanying genera: "Psilocybe" (116ÃÂ species), "Gymnopilus" (14), "Panaeolus" (13), "Copelandia" (12), "Hypholoma" (6), "Pluteus" (6), "Inocybe" (6), "Conocybe" (4), "Panaeolina" (4), "Gerronema" (2) and "Agrocybe", "Galerina" and "Mycena" (1ÃÂ species each). GuzmÃÂ¡n expanded his gauge of the quantity of psilocybin-containing "Psilocybe" to 144 species in a 2005 audit. Most of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the rest of in the US and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and related islands (19). The decent variety of psilocybian mushrooms is accounted for to have been expanded by level exchange of the psilocybin quality bunch between disconnected mushroom species. As a rule, psilocybin-containing animal types are dim spored, gilled mushrooms that develop in knolls and woods of the subtropics and tropics, more often than not in soils wealthy in humus and plant trash. Psilocybin mushrooms happen on all landmasses, yet most of species are found in subtropical muggy woods. "Psilocybe" species generally found in the tropics incorporate "P.ÃÂ cubensis" and "P.ÃÂ subcubensis". "P.ÃÂ semilanceata" Ã¢ÂÂ considered by GuzmÃÂ¡n to be the world's most generally circulated psilocybin mushroom Ã¢ÂÂ is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, yet is altogether missing from Mexico. In spite of the fact that the nearness or nonattendance of psilocybin isn't very useful as a chemotaxonomical marker at the familial dimension or higher, it is utilized to characterize taxa of lower scientific classifications.
