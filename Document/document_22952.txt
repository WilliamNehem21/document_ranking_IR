Cystidia that are located along the edge of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30â120 by 20â74Â Âµm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are club-shaped or elongated ellipses, up to 130â155Â Âµm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. "C.Â micaceus" may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60â100 by 5â10Â Âµm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.
