K-25 turned into a model for different vaporous dissemination offices built up in the early post-war years. The first of these was the K-27 finished in September 1945. It was trailed by the K-29 out of 1951, the K-31 of every 1951 and the K-33 out of 1954. Further vaporous dispersion offices were worked at Paducah, Kentucky in 1952, and Portsmouth, Ohio in 1954. The K-25 plant was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Today, uranium isotope partition is typically done by the more vitality effective ultra axis process, created in the Soviet Union. Axis falls started working at Oak Ridge in 1961. A gas axis test office (K-1210) opened in 1975, trailed by a bigger rotator plant show office (K-1220) in 1982. Because of a request from President Lyndon B. Johnson to cut generation of improved uranium by 25 percent, K-25 and K-27 stopped creation in 1964, however in 1969 K-25 started delivering uranium enhanced to 3 to 5 percent for use in atomic reactors. Martin Marietta Energy supplanted Union Carbide as the administrator in 1984. Vaporous dissemination at last stopped on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Creation of advanced uranium stopped in Portsmouth in 2001, and at Paducah in 2013.
