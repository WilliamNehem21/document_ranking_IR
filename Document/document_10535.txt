The "Dilophosauripus" impressions announced by Welles in 1971 were all on a similar dimension, and were depicted as a "chicken yard jumble" of impressions, with few framing a trackway. The impressions had been engraved in mud, which enabled the feet to sink down . The prints were messy, and the shifting expansiveness of the toe prints demonstrates that mud had clung to the feet. The impressions changed by contrasts in the substrate and the way in which they were made; now and then the foot was planted straightforwardly, however there was regularly a regressive or advances slip as the foot descended. The positions and edges of the toes additionally fluctuated significantly, which demonstrates they more likely than not been very adaptable. The "Dilophosauripus" impressions had a counterbalanced second toe with a thick base, and extremely long, straight paws that were in accordance with the tomahawks of the toe-cushions. One of the impressions was feeling the loss of the paw of the second toe, maybe because of damage. In 1984 Welles translated the way that three people were found firmly together, and the nearness of jumbled trackways close-by, as signs that "Dilophosaurus" went in gatherings. Gay concurred that they may have gone in little gatherings, yet noticed that there was no immediate proof for this, and that streak floods could have grabbed dissipated bones from various people and kept them together.
