Around 400 individuals from Vukovar's emergency clinic Ã¢ÂÂ non-Serb patients, restorative staff, nearby political figures and other people who had taken asylum there Ã¢ÂÂ were taken by the JNA. Albeit some were in this manner discharged, around 200 were transported to the adjacent OvÃÂara ranch and executed in what wound up known as the Vukovar slaughter. Something like 50 others were taken somewhere else and gone forever. Thousands more were exchanged to jail camps in Serbia and agitator controlled Croatia. Further mass killings pursued; at Dalj, north of Vukovar, where numerous occupants were recently slaughtered, various detainees from Vukovar were exposed to brutal cross examinations, beatings and torment, and no less than 35 were murdered. The JNA detained 2,000 individuals at the Velepromet mechanical office in Vukovar, 800 of whom were arranged by the JNA as detainees of war. Many were severely grilled, a few were shot on the spot by TO individuals and paramilitaries, and others were sent to OvÃÂara, where they were slaughtered in the slaughter. The rest of the detainees were exchanged to a JNA-run jail camp in Sremska Mitrovica. They were stripped bare on entry, beaten and cross examined, and compelled to rest for quite a long time on exposed wooden floors. Most were discharged in January 1992 under an understanding expedited by UN agent Cyrus Vance. Others were kept detainee until mid-1992. Serbs who battled on the Croatian side were viewed as deceivers by their captors and treated especially cruelly, suffering savage beatings.
