By May 1809, the Austrians were pushed to inside visual separation of Vienna, and in a basic commitment on the banks of the Danube waterway, the French and their partners hooked for control of the Marchfeld plain with the Austrians. The French held Lobau island, a crucial stream crossing, and the Austrians held the statures further toward the east. Between them lay a few towns, two of which were focal in the commitment and gave the fight its name: They lay so near Vienna that the fight could be seen and got notification from the city bulwarks and Aspern and Essling (likewise spelled in German as EÃÂling) are today part of the Donaustadt, an area of Austrian capital. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Klenau directed a detached power of near 6,000, including a contingent of the first "JÃÂ¤ger", three units of the third Infantry Regiment "Archduke Charles", eight squadrons each of the "Stipcisc" Hussars and "Schwarzenburg" Uhlans, and a steed mounted guns battery of 64 firearms. Run of the mill perplexity in the Austrian direction structure implied he got his requests late, and Klenau's postponement in organization implied that his men moved toward the French III Corps at Essling in sunlight and in close request; a two-firearm French battery on the plain past the Essling, "cut wrinkles" of enfilade fire in the Austrian positions.
