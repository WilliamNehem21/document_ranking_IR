Steiger played Pontius Pilate in Franco Zeffirelli's TV miniseries "Jesus of Nazareth" (1977). Stacy Keach, who depicted Barabbas, communicated his bliss at the chance to work with Steiger, portraying him as "liberal and obstinate". In 1978, Steiger played a congressperson in Norman Jewison's "F.I.S.T.", inverse Sylvester Stallone, who played a Cleveland distribution center specialist engaged with the trade guild authority of the anecdotal association named Federation of Inter-State Truckers. "Love and Bullets", soon thereafter, in which Steiger showed up as a mafia manager, was ineffectively gotten; Roger Ebert rejected it as a "pitifully confounded mishmash of pursues, killings, puzzling gatherings and partitions, and terribly exaggerated scenes by Steiger rotating with alarmingly underacted scenes by [Charles] Bronson". The next year, Steiger was given a role as a general inverse Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum in Andrew V. McLaglen's war film "Achievement", set on the Western Front. In "The Amityville Horror" (1979), Steiger showed up as an exasperates minister, who is welcome to play out an expulsion on a spooky house. Again Steiger was blamed for exaggerating; Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" stated: "Mr. Steiger howls and sobs and exaggerates completely everything. He won't get the telephone before it's rung 12 or multiple times." Pauline Kael imagined that Steiger's "otherworldly anguish was sufficient to break the camera focal point".
