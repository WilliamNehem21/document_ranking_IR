In spite of the fact that the Seven Years' War was a worldwide clash, it gained a particular force in the European performance center because of the challenge between FrederickÃÂ II of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, and Maria Theresa of Austria. Their contention dated from 1740, when, upon her climb, Frederick had assaulted and added the prosperous area of Silesia. The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which closed War of the Austrian Succession (1740Ã¢ÂÂ 1748) among Prussia and Maria Theresa's partners, granted Silesia to Prussia. Ruler Maria Theresa had marked the arrangement to pick up time to modify her military powers and produce new collusions. She proposed to recapture her command in the Holy Roman Empire and to reacquire Silesia. Likewise, France looked to break the British predominance of Atlantic exchange. In 1754, heightening strains among Britain and France in North America offered the Empress the chance to recover her lost domains and to confine Prussia's regularly developing force. France and Austria set aside their old contention to frame their very own alliance; Maria Theresa concurred that one of her girls, Maria Antonia, would wed the Dauphin of France, and her central clergymen arranged a military and political settlement favorable to the two gatherings. That drove Britain to adjust herself to George II's nephew, the King of Prussia; their partnership additionally included the Electorate of Hanover, which was held in close to home association by George, alongside George's and Frederick's relatives who controlled the Principality of Brunswick-WolfenbÃÂ¼ttel and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This arrangement of political manoeuvrers ended up known as the Diplomatic Revolution.
