In its operatic setting the mourn appears as an all-inclusive recitative of in excess of 70 vocal lines, conveyed in five segments isolated by choral remarks. A portion of the wording is prefigured in the quickly going before scene in which the First Envoy depicts Arianna's predicament to a thoughtful melody of anglers. The mourn delineates Arianna's different passionate responses to her deserting: distress, outrage, dread, self indulgence, destruction and a feeling of worthlessness. Cusick attracts regard for the way in which Monteverdi can coordinate in music the "expository and linguistic signals" in Rinuccini's content. The opening rehashed words "Lasciatemi morire" (Let me kick the bucket) are joined by an overwhelming seventh harmony which Ringer depicts as "a remarkable chromatic wound of agony"; Monteverdi was one of the primary clients of this melodic gadget. What pursues, says Ringer, has a range and profundity "equivalent to Shakespeare's most looking talks". The words "Lasciatemi morire" are trailed by "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two expressions speak to Arianna's differentiating feelings of hopelessness and aching. All through the mourn outrage and outrage are punctuated by delicacy, until the last emphasis of "O Teseo", after which a slipping line conveys the regret to a tranquil end.
