In 1949 he and Crawford resigned as fellows of the Society of Antiquaries. They did so to protest the selection of James Mannâkeeper of the Tower of London's armouriesâas the society's president, believing that Wheeler, a professional archaeologist, was a better choice. Childe joined the editorial board of the periodical "Past & Present", founded by Marxist historians in 1952. During the early 1950s, he also became a board member for "The Modern Quarterly"âlater "The Marxist Quarterly"âworking alongside the board's chairman Rajani Palme Dutt, his best friend and flatmate from his Oxford days. He authored occasional articles for Palme Dutt's socialist journal, the "Labour Monthly", but disagreed with him over the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; Palme Dutt defended the Soviet Union's decision to quash the revolution using military force, but Childe, like many Western socialists, strongly opposed with it. The event made Childe abandon faith in the Soviet leadership, but not in socialism or Marxism. He retained a love of the Soviet Union, having visiting on multiple occasions; he was also involved with a CPBG satellite body, the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR, and served as president of its National History and Archaeology Section from the early 1950s until his death.
