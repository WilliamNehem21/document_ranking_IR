"The Way I See It" was designed by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who blended the collection with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both got a kick out of the chance to layer numerous instruments and, preceding chronicle, had thought about procedures, for example, examining and drum programming. Be that as it may, they eventually discovered live instrumentalists progressively unique and moved themselves to repeat more established music preparations and the Motown tasteful of the 1960s. To acquaint themselves with vintage recording strategies, they considered Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book "The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions", books about Motown Records, and pictures of the name's studio faculty, setup of instruments, and mouthpiece arrangement. They likewise examined Motown EQs to accomplish a tone they found satisfactory for melodies' musicality guitar parts. Saadiq said that he needed to ignore "around 85 to 90 percent of the new systems ... Individuals used to pay attention to recording very. They used to wear sterile jackets at Abbey Road. So I quit fooling around with what I was attempting to do, both rationally and physically." Brungardt said in a meeting for "Blend" that he deserted the methodology learned on past records he had designed, where "they needed it clean with no contortion. I was educated to ensure it was clean, clean, clean, and to ensure everything fits right, the bass hits and things are perfect for the enormous pop vocal."
