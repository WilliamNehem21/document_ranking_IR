Henry's vagrant regal court contained different parts. At the heart was Henry's residential family, called the "domus"; a more extensive gathering was named the "familia regis", and formal social events of the court were named "curia". The "domus" was separated into a few sections. The house of prayer, headed by the chancellor, took care of the regal records, the chamber managed money related undertakings and the ace marshal was in charge of movement and settlement. The "familia regis" incorporated Henry's mounted family troops, up to a few hundred in number, who originated from a more extensive scope of social foundations, and could be conveyed crosswise over England and Normandy as required. At first Henry proceeded with his dad's routine with regards to standard crown-wearing services at his "curia", however they turned out to be less successive as the years passed. Henry's court was fantastic and flashy, financing the development of huge new structures and mansions with a scope of valuable endowments in plain view, including the King's private zoo of colorful creatures, which he kept at Woodstock Palace. In spite of being an exuberant network, Henry's court was more firmly controlled than those of past rulers. Exacting standards controlled individual conduct and restricted individuals from the court from plundering neighboring towns, as had been the standard under William Rufus.
