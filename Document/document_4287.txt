Elevated to colonel in 1913, Chauvel turned into the Australian delegate on the Imperial General Staff yet the First World War broke out while he was still "in transit" to the United Kingdom. Chauvel orchestrated the Australian Imperial Force to be occupied to Egypt, where he joined his new direction, the first Light Horse Brigade, in December. In May 1915, it was sent gotten off to Gallipoli, where Chauvel accepted accountability for the absolute most risky pieces of the line. He assumed responsibility for the first Division that November. In March 1916, Chauvel progressed toward becoming authority of the Anzac Mounted Division, picking up triumphs in the Battle of Romani in August and the Battle of Magdhaba in December, and about winning the First Battle of Gaza in March 1917. The next month, he assumed control over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, along these lines turning into the main Australian to direction a corps, and the first to achieve the position of lieutenant general. At Beersheba in October 1917, his light steed caught the town and its essential water supply in one of history's last extraordinary rangers charges. By September 1918, Chauvel had the capacity to impact a mystery redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and dispatch an unexpected assault on the foe that won the Battle of Megiddo. He lined up this triumph with one of the quickest interests in military history.
