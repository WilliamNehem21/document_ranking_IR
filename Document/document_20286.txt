A spreading, densely-shading tree when mature, "F.Â rubiginosa" may reach or more in height, although it rarely exceeds in the Sydney region. The trunk is buttressed and can reach in diameter. The bark is yellow-brown. It can also grow as on other plants as a hemiepiphyte, or high lithophyte. Alternately arranged on the stems, the ovate (egg-shaped), obovate (reverse egg-shaped) or oval-shaped leaves are anywhere from long and wide, on -long petioles (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs. There are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral veins that run off the midvein at an angle of 41.5â84.0Â°, while distinct basal veins run off the midvein at an angle of 18.5â78.9Â°. As with all figs, the fruit (fig) is actually an inverted inflorescence (compound flower) known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the fig's inner surface into a hollow cavity. "F. rubiginosa" is monoeciousâboth male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Often growing in pairs, the figs are yellow initially and measure across. Ripening to red in colour, they are tipped with a small nipple and on a stalk. Fruits ripen throughout the year, although more so in spring and summer. Some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at the same time.
