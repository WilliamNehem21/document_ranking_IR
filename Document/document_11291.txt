Mulder, Scully, and the Smoking Man are the main characters to show up in both this scene and the arrangement's pilot. This scene is the fourth of just four scenes in season nine where Duchovny showed up, the others being "Trust No 1", "Bounce the Shark", and "William". Duchovny showed up in the initial two by means of chronicled film and just made a little appearance in the third. The scene denotes the arrival of a few characters who had either recently been murdered off or had left the show, including X, who was executed in the season four opener "Herrenvolk"; Alex Krycek, who was shot and slaughtered by Skinner in the eighth-season finale "Presence"; The Smoking Man, who was purportedly slaughtered in "Composition"; Gibson Praise, who was most recently seen in the eighth-season scene "Without"; The Lone Gunmen, who were executed off in the ninth-season scene "Hop the Shark"; Jeffrey Spender, who initially was slaughtered off in the 6th season scene "One Son" however returned in the ninth-season scene "William"; and Marita Covarrubias, who last showed up in the seventh season finale "Memorial".
