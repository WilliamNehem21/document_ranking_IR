In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's delegate in Naples, proposing three one-act musical shows dependent on scenes from stories by Russian author Maxim Gorky. By May the writer had put aside this proposition to focus on the undertaking which progressed toward becoming "La fanciulla del West", despite the fact that he didn't entirely forsake the possibility of a numerous musical drama evening. His next thought in this vein, a few years after the fact, was for a two-musical drama charge, one shocking and one comic; he later extended this to incorporate a third musical drama with a spiritualist or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had finished the "grievous" component, which progressed toward becoming "Il tabarro", however regardless he needed thoughts for the other two works. He considered arranging "Il tabarro" in mix with his very own initial work "Le Villi", or with other two-act musical dramas which may be utilized to round out the night's amusement. At long last, librettist Giovacchino Forzano gave the author two works of his own, which moved toward becoming "Suor Angelica" and "Gianni Schicchi". The last would be Puccini's first setting of a comic content; in spite of the fact that his prior musical dramas, for instance "La bohÃÂ¨me", contain comic scenes, these are just subordinate to the dramatization to give differentiate.
