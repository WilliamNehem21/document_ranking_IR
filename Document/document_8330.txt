Hurricane Gay previously influenced the Marshall Islands, striking a few atolls in the archipelago with tropical storm constrain winds. On Mejit Island, the primary island to be influenced, the tropical storm crushed each wooden structure and left the greater part of the islanders destitute. High breezes brought down the majority of the island's trees and wrecked 75% of the yields. Close-by, Ailuk Atoll experienced comparable breezes, however house harm was minor in spite of comparable harvest misfortunes. The huge breeze field stretched out toward the south, influencing Maloelap and Aur atolls with winds that harmed 30% of the houses and harvests. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of Majuro experienced lightning strikes from the hurricane, which caused an island-wide power blackout and slices to the water supply and radio correspondence. Flotsam and jetsam from the tempest shut the Marshall Islands International Airport for two days. On Ujae Atoll, the tropical storm crushed a computerized meteorological watching station that had been introduced in 1989. The tropical storm left over 5,000ÃÂ people destitute the nation over, yet there were no local passings and just single damage in the archipelago inferable from first rate alerts and arrangements. Be that as it may, huge waves from the tropical storm sank a watercraft in a little tidal pond, murdering one of the vessel's two mariners.
