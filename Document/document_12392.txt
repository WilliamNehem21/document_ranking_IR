The progressions Dimmock made did not alter the course. Dimmock later revealed to Gillings that "request was not adequate to give us certainty for the future", and Pearson's shut the magazine down. The last issue was dated 23 June 1934. Bleiler records that Speaights likewise discovered increasingly gainful work for their presses, and this added to Pearson's choice. In spite of the fact that it had never been focused at grown-up perusers, the disappointment of "Scoops" influenced it to give the idea that Britain was not a practical market for a sci-fi magazine. There was evidently enough British enthusiasm for American sci-fi for Hugo Gernsback to give the letter segment of the August 1935 issue of "Miracle Stories" to letters from British perusers, yet when one of those letters, from James Dudley, recommended that the time was directly for a British distributer to begin a sci-fi title, the manager, Charles Hornig, answered that "Scoops"' disappointment "demonstrated to us and other British distributers that [the UK] isn't yet arranged to help an expert sci-fi magazine enough to make it pay for itself". Gillings later portrayed "Scoops" as "the greatest screw up that British sci-fi ever constructed", however, as Bleiler would see it, the British market was not financially equipped for supporting a sci-fi magazine at the time. In spite of the difficulty, another distributer, Newnes, considered propelling a sci-fi magazine in 1935, however their arrangements were postponed until 1938. Gillings himself was the manager of the following British sci-fi title, "Stories of Wonder", which distributed its first issue in 1937, while Newnes' magazine, "Dream", showed up the next year.
