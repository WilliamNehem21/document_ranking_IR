Xu Xing, another Chinese scientist, named another types of "Psittacosaurus" in 1997, in light of a total skull with related vertebrae and a forelimb. This material was recuperated in Gansu Province, close to the outskirt with Inner Mongolia. This species is named "P. mazongshanensis" after the adjacent mountain called Mazongshan (Horse Mane Mountain) and has been depicted in a fundamental way. Lamentably, the skull was harmed while being taken care of by the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), and a few sections have been lost, including the majority of the teeth. The remaining parts were found in the Lower Xinminbao Formation, which have not been exactly dated, in spite of the fact that there is some proof that they were kept in the late Barremian through Aptian stages. Sereno proposed in 2000 that "P. mazongshanensis" was a "nomen dubium", with no novel highlights that different it from some other types of "Psittacosaurus". In any case, later creators have noticed that it tends to be recognized by its relatively long nose contrasted with different types of "Psittacosaurus", just as an unmistakable hard projection, pointing outwards and downwards, on the maxilla of the upper jaw. The maxillary bulge is additionally now absent. Different highlights initially used to recognize the species have been perceived as the consequences of the distortion of the skull after fossilization. Sereno (2010) stayed unconvinced of its legitimacy.
