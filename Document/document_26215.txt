The purely orchestral works fall into two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly programmatic in natureâin other words, the musical content and how it is handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.
Program music came naturally to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, "even a folk theme has a program of sorts." He composed the majority of his orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his careerâat the beginning, with "Sadko" and "Antar" (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with "Scheherezade", "Capriccio Espagnol" and the "Russian Easter Overture". Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer's overall approach and the way he used his musical themes remained consistent. Both "Antar" and "Scheherezade" use a robust "Russian" theme to portray the male protagonists (the title character in "Antar"; the sultan in "Scheherezade") and a more sinuous "Eastern" theme for the female ones (the peri Gul-Nazar in "Antar" and the title character in "Scheherezade").
