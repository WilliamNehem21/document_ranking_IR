The secured scaffold lays on projections of stone and mortar, which have been strengthened with cement. There are no parapets. The extension shafts are fortified in spots with steel bars. The scaffold deck is made of transversely "slender width laid ground surface". Wheel monitors on the deck separate the roadway from the person on foot walkways on either side and secure the sides, which are secured with "vertical board and secure siding" nearly to the roof. The inside and outside are painted red. The scaffold has long, slender windows with wooden screens: the south side has three windows, and the north side has two. An opening between the roof and the siding runs the length of the extension on the two sides. The peak rooftop is wooden shake shingles. The scaffold is bolstered by a Burr curve support, and is comparable in structure and development to the one in Forksville. The western end of the Hillsgrove connect lies against a precarious slope, and those moving toward the extension from the west should make a sharp right swing to enter it. Preceding the 2010 reclamation, the sides were unpainted, yet the entries were painted red, while the peak rooftop was sheet metal which had been introduced over the first wooden shake shingles.
