In the mid 1960s Lichtenstein's subject of funnies based work was fervently discussed. In a 1963 "New York Times" article, Brian O'Doherty composed that Lichtenstein's work was not craftsmanship, saying Lichtenstein was "one of the most noticeably awful specialists in America" who "energetically approached making a sow's ear out of a sow's ear." This was a piece of a far reaching banter about the benefits of Lichtenstein's comic blow-ups as evident workmanship. In January 1964 "Life" ran a story under the title "Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?" on this debate. Later audits were a lot kinder. Todd Brewster noticed this may have been spurred by prevalent interest; he told "Life" in 1986 that "Those animation blowups may have exasperates the faultfinders, yet gatherers, tired of the gravity of conceptual expressionism, were prepared for some lighthearted element. For what reason couldn't the interesting pages be compelling artwork?" His work is presently broadly acknowledged, albeit some reprimand him for acquiring from funnies without crediting the first makers, paying sovereignties, or looking for authorization from copyright holders. David Barsalou has devoted a long time to recognizing the majority of Lichtenstein's source materials and has posted in excess of 1,000 pictures on Flickr itemizing Lichtenstein's unrecognized sources.
