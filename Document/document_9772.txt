Lody was reclaimed to London where he was kept in Wellington Barracks under the watch of the 3rdÃÂ Battalion, the Grenadier Guards. A gathering of the Cabinet on 8 October chose to attempt him for "war injustice", a choice that has been depicted as "lawfully, exceptionally inquisitive" by the legitimate history specialist A. W. B. Simpson. He was not accused of surveillance under both of the two pertinent resolutions, the Official Secrets Act 1911 or DORA. The main reason lay in the wording of the Hague Convention of 1907, which expresses: "An individual must be viewed as a government agent when, acting stealthily or on affectations, he gets or attempts to get data in the zone of tasks of a combative, with the expectation of conveying it to the antagonistic party." Lody was working in the British Isles, outside the zone of activities, and was hence not secured by this definition. Such conditions had been foreseen by the latest release of the British "Manual of Military Law", distributed in February 1914, which prescribed that people in such cases ought to be striven for war conspiracy: "Surely for each situation where it is suspicious whether the demonstration comprises of secret activities, when the truth of the matter is built up that an individual has outfitted or endeavored to outfit data to the foe, no time need be squandered in looking at whether the case relates precisely to the meaning of reconnaissance."
