In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant PeÃÂanac via air to Mehane (south-west of NiÃÂ¡ in the Toplica district) to set up a guerrilla uprising in help of an arranged Allied hostile. There, PeÃÂanac reached a few gatherings of guerrillas, known as "comitadji". PeÃÂanac united with nearby pioneer Kosta VojinoviÃÂ, and they both built up base camp on Mount Kopaonik. Competition immediately created between the two chiefs, for the most part in light of the fact that PeÃÂanac just had requests to get ready to help the arranged Allied hostile, yet VojinoviÃÂ was directing activities that may result in pre-emptive activity by the Bulgarian occupation powers. Matters reached a crucial stage in JanuaryÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ February 1917 when the Bulgarians started recruiting neighborhood Serbs for military administration. At a gathering of guerrilla pioneers to talk about whether they ought to start a general uprising, PeÃÂanac was outvoted. In any case, occasions had overwhelmed the pioneers, and they were basically joining a famous uprising that was at that point in progress. After guerrillas under PeÃÂanac's order connected with the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a pioneer of the opposition, in spite of the fact that he had genuine doubts about the possible result once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians submitted substantial quantities of troops to repress the uprising. The guerrillas were shutting on NiÃÂ¡ toward the beginning of March when the possessing powers went in all out attack mode. PeÃÂanac prompted his contenders to hang out in the forested areas and mountains, while VojinoviÃÂ requested his to battle until the very end. By 25 March, the uprising had been squashed. PeÃÂanac's support in the insubordination came at an incredible individual cost; three of his kids passed on while in Bulgarian internment.
