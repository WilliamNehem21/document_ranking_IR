In 1956 Holloway made the job of Alfred P. Doolittle in the first Broadway creation of "My Fair Lady". The librettist, Alan Jay Lerner, recollected in his diaries that Holloway was his first decision for the job, even before it was composed. Lerner's solitary concern was whether, after so long far from the melodic stage, Holloway still had his full performing voice. Holloway consoled him over a lunch at Claridge's: Lerner reviewed, "He put down his blade and fork, tossed back his head and released a solid baritone note that resonated through the lounge area, overwhelmed the string group of four and sent a couple of dozen individuals off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted." Holloway had a long relationship with the show, showing up in the first 1956 Broadway creation at the Mark Hellinger Theater, the 1958 London rendition at the Theater Royal, Drury Lane, and the film form in 1964, which he embraced rather than the job of Admiral Bloom in "Mary Poppins" that he had been offered that year. In "The Manchester Guardian", Alistair Cooke expressed, "Stanley Holloway distils into the assemblage of Doolittle the taste and smell of each bar in England." Also in 1964, he showed up as Bellomy in the Hallmark Hall of Fame TV generation of "The Fantasticks".
