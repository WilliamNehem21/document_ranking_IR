Amid the start of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-presented the draft (enrollment) in September 1940, and Koval enlisted for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company verified him a year's suspension from administration until February 1942. As indicated by student of history Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers needed him to take data about compound weapons, and felt that he would not have the capacity to do as such while drafted. At the point when the delay terminated, Koval was enlisted into the United States Army. He got fundamental preparing at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval filled in as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was exchanged to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit set up in December 1942 to give skilled enlistees instruction and specialized preparing. Koval went to the City College of New York (CCNY) and concentrated electrical designing. His CCNY schoolmates admired the more seasoned Koval as a good example and father figure who never did homework and was a prominent women's man, failing to know about his Soviet training and spouse. Associates reviewed that he never talked about governmental issues or the Soviet Union.
