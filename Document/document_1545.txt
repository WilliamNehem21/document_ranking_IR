The Chou (Ã¤Â¸Â) is a male jokester job. The Chou more often than not assumes auxiliary jobs in a troupe. To be sure, most investigations of Beijing musical show group the Chou as a minor job. The name of the job is a homophone of the Mandarin Chinese word "chou", signifying "monstrous". This mirrors the customary conviction that the comedian's mix of offensiveness and giggling could head out abhorrence spirits. Chou jobs can be isolated into "Wen Chou", regular citizen jobs, for example, traders and prison guards, and "Wu Chou", minor military jobs. The "Wu Chou" is a standout amongst the most requesting in Beijing musical show, in light of its mix of comic acting, trapeze artistry, and a solid voice. Chou characters are commonly interesting and agreeable, if somewhat stupid. Their ensembles go from straightforward for characters of lower status to expound, maybe excessively along these lines, for high status characters. Chou characters wear exceptional face paint, called "xiaohualian", that varies from that of Jing characters. The characterizing normal for this sort of face paint is a little fix of white chalk around the nose. This can speak to either a mean and undercover nature or a snappy mind.
