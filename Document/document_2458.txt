As the diversion starts, Raziel approaches Kain's position of authority and expands recently developed wings. In a demonstration of appearing desire, Kain tears the bones from Raziel's wings and has him tossed into the Lake of the Dead, a huge regular whirlpool; in any case, Raziel is revived as a phantom by The Elder God to turn into his "spirit reaver" and execute Kain, in this manner reestablishing Nosgoth. With The Elder God's direction, Raziel adjusts to his new shape and comes back to Nosgoth. Penetrating a Necropolis possessed by the Melchahim vampires, Raziel discovers his sibling Melchiah, who has degenerated into a brute unfit to continue his very own tissue. After Raziel murders Melchiah and ingests his spirit, he goes up against Kain among the demolished Pillars of Nosgoth in the Sanctuary of the Clans. Kain does not seem shocked to see Raziel, evidently having even been anticipating him, and suggests that he has crushed Raziel's vampire group, which just infuriates Raziel much further. At the point when Raziel starts to censure him, Kain just dispatches a tirade against him before taking note of what has happened to the domain and drawing in him in battle. Kain rapidly overwhelms Raziel and endeavors to hit him down with the Soul Reaver, an incredible sword that retains its exploited people's spirits; in any case, the Reaver breaks when it strikes Raziel, and Kain get away, abnormally fulfilled. Raziel enters the unearthly domain to discover the edge's spirit eating up ghastly structure, which ties itself to him. After this, Raziel meets Ariel, who reestablishes his quality, and takes in of Zephon's area from The Elder God.
