By 1961, when all airframe support at Laverton was exchanged to Nos.ÃÂ 2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.ÃÂ 1 AD had overhauled forty-two air ship types all through its reality. It kept on keeping up air motors, and started supporting broadcast communications gear too. The air ship motor fix offices at No.ÃÂ 1 AD were shut down in 1968. Staff were exchanged to No.ÃÂ 3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, to get ready for the presentation of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing plane to Australian administration and focus on keeping up the new flying machine's motors. No.ÃÂ 1 AD's concentrate from there on moved to ground support, fabricating, introducing, adjusting and giving preparing to navigational, aviation authority, broadcast communications and engine transport gear utilized by the Air Force and different segments of Defense and government. From 1968 to 1977, the terminal was sorted out into two parts, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (keeping up ground interchanges gear for control towers, transmitters and accepting stations in Australia and the district), Radar Squadron (supporting reconnaissance frameworks at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (keeping up engine transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical frameworks), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (correspondences, route and other ground-based upkeep at Laverton, just as spectrometric examination of oil utilized by the RAAF in flying machine and other hardware).
