In spite of the fact that a period film, "Chandralekha" did not depend on chronicled actuality; its plot depends on the primary part of "Robert Macaire, or the French Bandit in England". Sasankan depends on Macaire and, as per film student of history B. D. Garga, Chandralekha is "most likely" in view of a female artist in the novel whom Macaire whips when she will not move; the film incorporates the scene from the novel. Garga noticed that "Chandralekha" was additionally affected by other Western scholarly and true to life works, including the novel "Blood and Sand" (1908) and the movies "The Mark of Zorro" (1920), "Robin Hood" (1922), "The Thief of Baghdad" (1924) and "" (1925). In December 1964, film antiquarian Jerzy Toeplitz considered the film an "augmentation and improvement" of the fanciful classification: "The characters are humans however carry on like radiant creatures, and their developments and signals, similar to those of the divine beings and saints of the "Mahabharata" are impregnated with the inexplicable." Toeplitz composed that the story was a "minor appearance to hold together the diverse scenes, every one of which develops like a carnival turn: the strain mounts to a coming full circle point, whereupon the following scene promptly dominates." According to Roy Armes' 1987 book, "Third World Film Making and the West", Uday Shankar's 1948 "Kalpana" (additionally shot at Gemini Studios) roused Vasan to make "Chandralekha". In the 2003 "Reference book of Hindi Cinema", the film is portrayed as a "Ruritanian period spectacle".
