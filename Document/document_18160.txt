The Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the ""Deutschland" or "Lothringen" types." "Braunschweig" was chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed Reichsmarine. The ship was modernized at the "Reichsmarinewerft" in Wilhelmshaven from 1921â1922. She was recommissioned on 1 December 1921, initially with a reduced crew, though work on the ship continued on into the following year. Work was finished and her crew was completed on 1 March 1922, at which point she replaced the light cruiser as the flagship of the "Marinestation der Nordsee" (Naval Station of the North Sea), then commanded by "KAdm" Konrad Mommsen. At the time, the unit consisted of "Braunschweig", "Hamburg", the cruiser , and several torpedo boats. On 11 April, Mommsen was replaced by "KAdm" Theodor PÃ¼llen. In July, "Braunschweig" visited Norway, including stops in Fretheim from 8 to 13 July and Mundal from 13 to 17 July. From late August to 15 September, the ships of the "Marinestation der Nordsee" held joint maneuvers with those from the "Marinestation der Ostsee" (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea), and during these "ReichsprÃ¤sident" (President of Germany) Friedrich Ebert came aboard the ship to observe the exercises on 5 and 6 September.
