On the congregation's northeastern rise there are three huge, symmetrical recolored glass windows, each with a fixed upper scarf and a lower container band. Like the primary faÃÂ§ade's entryways and windows, the ledges, lintels and lintel corner squares of the recolored glass windows are white-painted stone. Beneath the windows is an uncovered coursed-stone establishment with five tie-bar workmanship grapple plates. A little block fireplace is available on this height. The congregation's southwestern rise likewise has a coursed-stone establishment, with five tie-pole grapple plates, banked into the ground beneath three symmetrical recolored glass windows with fixed upper bands and lower container scarves and encased with white-painted stone ledges, lintels and lintel corner squares. On this rise are a little block stack in the rooftop slant and metal seasonal travelers along the rooftop line. Downspouts are situated at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern rises. The congregation's southeastern (back) height has an uncovered coursed-stone establishment high, because of its area on slanting ground. At the focal point of this height is a jutting, gabled block augmentation for the inside raised area, with symmetrical recolored glass windows on the two sides. The gabled projection is topped by aluminum blazing. A 1895 created iron fence encases the property's northwestern edge, and a cleared block walkway gives passerby access from the garage to the two primary passageways.
