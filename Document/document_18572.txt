It is not the case that every noun is only associated with one classifier. Across dialects and speakers there is great variability in the way classifiers are used for the same words, and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best. For example, for cars some people use Â "bÃ¹", others use Â "tÃ¡i", and still others use Â ()Â "liÃ ng"; Cantonese uses Â "gaa3". Even within a single dialect or a single speaker, the same noun may take different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking, or on different nuances the person wants to convey (for instance, measure words can reflect the speaker's judgment of or opinion about the object). An example of this is the word for person, Â "rÃ©n", which uses the measure word Â ()Â "gÃ¨" normally, but uses the measure Â "kÇu" when counting number of people in a household, and Â "wÃ¨i" when being particularly polite or honorific, and Â "mÃ­ng" in formal, written contexts; likewise, a group of people may be referred to by massifiers as ("yÃ¬ rÃ©n", "a of people") or ("yÃ¬ rÃ©n", "a of people"): the first is neutral, whereas the second implies that the people are unruly or otherwise being judged poorly.
