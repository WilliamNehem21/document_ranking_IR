Breckinridge stayed in Lexington while choosing where to start work on, getting law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's dad. Choosing that Lexington was stuffed with legal advisors, he moved to Frankfort, yet was unfit to discover an office. In the wake of being spurned by an affection intrigue, he and previous cohort Thomas W. Bullock left for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 looking for better chances. Traveling westbound, they considered settling ashore Breckinridge had acquired in Jacksonville, Illinois, yet they found the bar supplied with capable men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They proceeded to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842Ã¢ÂÂ 1843, Breckinridge answered to relatives that his firm dealt with a greater number of cases than practically some other in Burlington. Impacted by Bullock and the residents of Iowa, he related to the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic advisory group of Des Moines County. A large portion of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's gathering alliance, William Breckinridge announced, "I felt as I would have done in the event that I had heard that my girl had been shamed."
