In April 1945, Waddy joined Caldwell, Arthur, Gibbes and four other senior pilots of No.Â 1 TAF in an action that became known as the "Morotai Mutiny". The eight attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of the RAAF's fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Earlier that month, Waddy had asked his intelligence officer to produce a "profit and loss statement" for No.Â 80 Squadron, covering the period 1Â October 1944 to 31Â March 1945, in order to "bring out the fact that the expenditure by the squadron was not compensated for by the achievements of the Squadron". In that time, Waddy had lost eleven pilots with the unit, including seven to enemy action. Arthur had produced a similar "balance sheet" for No.Â 81 Wing. Both had become frustrated with the lack of attention paid by superior officers to their concerns regarding the usefulness of No.Â 1 TAF operations. At the subsequent inquiry into events on Morotai, Justice John Vincent Barry cleared the pilots of fault over the incident, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere. Waddy continued to lead No.Â 80 Squadron until handing over command on 1Â June 1945. For his service in the Pacific, he was mentioned in despatches and awarded the US Air Medal, the former promulgated on 25Â June 1946 and the latter on 1Â July 1948.
