Reviews for "The Boys from Baghdad High" were generally favourable. "The Huffington Post" said that giving the video cameras to the students was an excellent idea because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured "with neutral equality [so] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of "The Independent" said, "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative dilemmas and secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." "Time Out New York" gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters rated it 8 out of 10. "The Washington Post"s Paul Farhi said, "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home of some of the most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... "Baghdad High" does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred[ibility]." "Variety", "The Christian Science Monitor", "LA Weekly", and the "Los Angeles Times" also praised the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one audience member, a new recruit to the United States Marine Corps, told Ali, who had also attended, "I finally know what life is like behind those walls and what you guys are like, and it's been really, really fantastic."
