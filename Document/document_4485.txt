Not long after taking force, the radical chiefs of the insurgency had started building strongholds on Eetioneia, an overwhelming point in the passage to the harbor of Piraeus, apparently to shield the harbor against an assault from the armada at Samos. With interior difference expanding, they joined these new fortresses to existing dividers to frame a redoubt solid against assaults from land or ocean, which contained an extensive distribution center into which the fanatics moved the vast majority of the city's grain supply. Theramenes challenged the structure of this fortress, contending that its motivation was not to keep the democrats out, yet to be given over to the Spartans; Thucydides affirms that his charges were not without substance, as the fanatics were really considering such an activity. At first careful (as foes of the routine had been executed previously), Theramenes and his gathering were encouraged and stirred without hesitation by a few occasions. Initial, a Peloponnesian armada, apparently dispatched to help against Athenian powers on Euboea, was moving gradually up the bank of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this armada was wanting to catch the fortresses on Eetioneia, in a joint effort with the radicals. Second, an Athenian minute man, evidently following up on requests from schemers higher in the positions of the administration, killed Phrynichus, the pioneer of the radical group. He got away, yet his assistant, an Argive, was caught; the detainee, under torment, would not express the name of his manager. With the fanatics unfit to make compelling move for this situation, and with the Peloponnesian armada overwhelming Aegina (a consistent ceasing point on the way to deal with Piraeus), Theramenes and his gathering chose to act.
