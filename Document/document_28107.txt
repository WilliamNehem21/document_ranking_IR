The seventh nocturne departs from the AâBâA form of FaurÃ©'s earlier nocturnes; in Pinkas's view is it constructed more like a ballade than a nocturne. It opens with a slow ("molto lento") theme of harmonic ambiguity, followed by a second theme, equally ambiguous in key, though nominally in D major. The central section is in F major, and the re-emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion. Morrison finds in this piece a sense of bleakness, and of the composer's struggle against despair. Pinkas, however, regards the work as a "contrast between ambiguity and joy, ending in reassurance." It is sometimes known as the "English" nocturne, having been composed while FaurÃ© was staying in the UK, and being dedicated to the English pianist Adela Maddison.
FaurÃ© did not intend the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His publisher collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as "8 piÃ¨ces brÃ¨ves", allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.
The ninth nocturne, dedicated to Cortot's wife, Clotilde BrÃ©al, is the first of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of FaurÃ©'s final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.
