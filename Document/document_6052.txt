In December 1952 Cameron moved to an abandoned farm in Beaumont. With the guide of Druks and Paul Mathison, she accumulated a free coterie of otherworldly experts around herself which she called "The Children". Purposefully involving individuals from different races, she directed a scope of sex enchantment customs with the goal of making a type of blended race "moonchildren" who might be given to Horus. She ended up pregnant because of these rituals, and named her anticipated kid "the Wormwood Star", in spite of the fact that the pregnancy finished in premature delivery. After some time, a large number of Cameron's partners inside The Children removed themselves from her, specifically on account of her undeniably prophetically catastrophic proclamations; she guaranteed that Mexico was going to vanquish the U.S., that a race war was going to break out in the Old World, and that a comet would hit the Earth, and that a flying saucer would save her and her supporters and take them to Mars. Amid her otherworldly customs she utilized a scope of medications, including pot, peyote, and enchantment mushrooms, and in June 1953 she visited Los Angeles to go to a Gerald Heard address on the brain extending employments of stimulants. Maybe due to her medication use, Cameron was experiencing sound-related mental trips, visit episodes of melancholy, and emotional episodes. Amid this period, she compared with the Thelemite Jane Wolfe, albeit different Thelemites and Crowley partners, for example, Karl Germer and Gerald Yorke considered her crazy.
