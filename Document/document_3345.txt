The "Cheats' Den", a 2.27MB download offering the opportunity to "Reveal an acclaimed privateer's lost ship and guarantee it for your own", was discharged on May 22 for the Xbox 360, estimated at 150 Marketplace focuses, "generally" comparable to US$1.89. Clarifying the extra, Ashley Cheng expressed "Fundamentally, it's "Goonies"." "Mehrunes' Razor", a mission rotating around a mage looking for the destructive Daedric antique known as Mehrunes' Razor, was discharged on June 14. It turned into the most costly download yet, at US$2.99 for PC clients and 250 Marketplace focuses, identical to US$3.13, for Xbox 360 proprietors. One 1UP.com columnist took the event to consider the expanding cost of owning the "total" "Blankness". With all the additional items included, he determined, "That is over $80 in amusement for the total form of Oblivion, up to this point."

Joystiq kept on remarking on the "Steed Armor" add-on in their notice of the journey's discharge. "With a weapon like that, who needs horse protective layer?" On July 13, "The Vile Lair", wearing a shrouded sepulcher called "Deepscorn Hollow" for players chomped with "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s vampirism bug, was discharged. Like the "Orrery" and the "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set "The Vile Lair's" PC discharge cost at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 discharge cost at 150 Marketplace focuses, comparable to US$1.88. Joystiq reacted emphatically to the new value point. "What a bargain!ÃÂ ...ÃÂ It's decent to see the people at "Obscurity" have taken in their exercise and aren't putting forth moderately overly costly substance not fit to see the light of day."
