The three citations by Epiphanius in "Panarion" 30.13.6, 4, and 7, separately, structure the opening of the gospel account, including the mission of John the Baptist, his appearance and diet, and the sanctification of Jesus by John. The start of the gospel (13.6) has parallels to the Gospel of Luke yet in curtailed structure. The content demonstrates a commonality with the outset story of Luke 1:5 regardless of coming up short on its very own birth account. Citing from the content with respect to the eating routine of John (13.4), Epiphanius whines that the Ebionites have distorted the content by substituting "cake" ("egkris" Ã¡Â¼ÂÃÂ³ÃÂºÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂ) for "beetle" ("akris" Ã¡Â¼ÂÃÂºÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂ, in Matthew 3:4). The similitude of the wording in Greek has driven researchers to presume that Greek was the first language of sythesis. In the story of the immersion of Jesus by John (13.7), the voice of God talks multiple times in close parallels to the Gospel of Mark 1:11, Luke 3:23 (Western content sort), and Matthew 3:17, individually. The nearness of different baptismal theophanies has prompted an agreement among present day researchers that the content cited by Epiphanius is a gospel amicability of the Synoptic Gospels. The presence of an incredible light on the water might be a reverberation of St. Paul's transformation or an extra harmonization of the "Good news of the Hebrews" to this work.
