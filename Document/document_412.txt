In the wake of stacking officers and men from the 29th Infantry Division on 13 June, "Princess Matoika" set sail from Newport News the following day with "Wilhelmina", "Pastores", "Lenape", and British troopship . On the morning of 16ÃÂ June, posts on "Princess Matoika" detected a submarine and, before long, a torpedo heading legitimately for the ship. The torpedo missed her by a couple of yards and heavy weapons specialists keeping an eye on the ship's ÃÂ guns asserted a hit on the sub with their second shot. Later that morning, the Newport News ships got together with the New York bit of the guardÃ¢ÂÂwhich included , "Covington", "Rijndam", "Dante Alighieri", and British steamer "Vauben"Ã¢ÂÂ and set out for France. The caravan was escorted by cruisers and "Frederick", and destroyers and ; war vessel and a few different destroyers participated in escort obligations for the gathering for a period. The caravan had a bogus caution when a coasting barrel was confused with submarine, however generally uneventfully touched base at Brest on the evening of 27ÃÂ June. "Princess Matoika", "Covington", "Lenape", "Rijndam", "George Washington", "DeKalb", "Wilhelmina", and "Dante Alighieri" left Brest as a gathering on 30 June. The next night at 21:15, "Covington" was torpedoed by "U-86" and sank the following evening. "Princess Matoika" and "Wilhelmina" landed back at Newport News on 13 July.
