On 11 January 1915, the French were cautioned that the Austro-Hungarian armada was going to foray from its base at Pola, so "Courbet", "Paris" and "France" drove the Naval Army north to the Albanian coast. It turned out to be a bogus alert and they were back at their moorings three days after the fact. Meanwhile, the boats watched the Ionian Sea. The affirmation of war on Austria-Hungary by Italy on 23 May and the Italian choice to accept accountability for maritime activities in the Adriatic, enabled the French Navy to pull back to either Malta or Bizerte, French Tunisia, to cover the Otranto Barrage. Sooner or later amid the year, "Courbet"s 47ÃÂ mm weapons were put on high-edge mountings to enable them to be utilized as against flying machine (AA) firearms. They were later enhanced by a couple of Mle 1891 G firearms on hostile to air ship mounts. On 27 April 1916, the French started utilizing the port of Argostoli on the Greek island of Cephalonia as a base. Around this time numerous men from the warships' groups were exchanged to hostile to submarine boats. Toward the start of 1917, the French started to utilize the Greek island of Corfu too, yet developing deficiencies of coal seriously restricted the war vessels' capacity to go to ocean. In 1918 they were practically stable, leaving Corfu just for support and fixes. On 1 July the Naval Army was rearranged with "Courbet", "Paris" and "Jean Bart" doled out to the second Battle Division of the first Battle Squadron. Eventually amid the year, "Courbet"s mainmast was abbreviated and a mechanized winch was introduced to enable her to work a kite expand, however this was not a triumph.
