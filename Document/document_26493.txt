As editing progressed, budget shortfalls prevented BSÃ from finalizing contracts. The organization also restricted post-production funds to "limit [its] exposure" in the event the project was not completed. Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC, Nick Fraser, who had declined to help finance the film in 2001. Fraser was commissioning editor for the BBC's "Storyville" documentaries series. According to Stoneman, Fraser was "still undecided", having been told by the head of BBC Two that "we've done ChÃ¡vez". Nevertheless, the BBC pre-purchased the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut. At the BBC's behest, the opening of the television version was made more dramatic. Fraser was unsure about the voice-over; he asked for a more "opinionated" narration that, according to Bartley, would "get the boot in". Although the BBC did not ask outright, Bartley's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be "against ChÃ¡vez". Fraser later said he had asked for the filmmakers to "include [an interview] with someone not a ChÃ¡vez supporter". He also suggested that a more experienced director be employed to help edit the film. The filmmakers "made a few minor concessions", but resisted major edits. ÃÂ Briain's voice-over in the final cut was "polished up but not significantly changed".
