The 17th Infantry Brigade was the last to land in Greece, arriving at Piraeus on 12Â April. Savige was placed in charge of "Savige" Force, consisting of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/11thÂ Infantry Battalions, with armour, artillery, engineer and other support. He was given the mission of covering the Allied flank around Kalabaka. On 17Â April, Savige received orders to withdraw from Kalabaka, leaving only a rearguard behind. The road behind him, however, was packed with vehicles, and a crucial bridge on the only reasonably good road back had accidentally been demolished. Savige elected to disregard his orders and hold his position until the road was clear. He then managed to withdraw, although his driver's foot was broken in an air raid. Savige arrived back in Palestine on 1Â May 1941 and began the task of rebuilding his brigade. For the campaign in Greece, he received his fourth mention in despatches.
In June 1941, the 7thÂ Division fought in the SyriaâLebanon Campaign. One of its problems was that it was trying to fight three battles with only two brigades, because the 18thÂ Infantry Brigade that was normally part of the division was engaged in the Siege of Tobruk. Accordingly, Savige's 17thÂ Infantry Brigade headquarters was brought in to provide the 7thÂ Division with a third brigade headquarters. Savige was given three battalions that had never worked together beforeâthe 2/3rd and 2/5thÂ Infantry Battalions and 2/2ndÂ Pioneer Battalion. He scored a notable success in the Battle of Damour, which he rated as his most successful battle of the war, although his conduct was not above criticism by Berryman, who felt that Savige had located his headquarters too far back, resulting in failure to seize an important opportunity. Ultimately, though, this had no significant impact on the battle.
