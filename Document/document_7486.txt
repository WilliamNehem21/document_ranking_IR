The stem is long by 1ÃÂ mm thick, generally measure up to in width all through, and decreases to a long "root" which ends in a dull dark, generally circular sclerotium. The stem might be covered profoundly in its substrate. The stem surface is generally a similar shading as the top, with a fine whitish powder on the upper surface. In the lower divide, the stem is tanish, and has fine depressions that run the long way all over the surface. The lower half is secured with unpredictably masterminded short branch-like projections at right points to the stem that measure 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3 by 0.5ÃÂ mm. These projections are tube shaped and decreasing, with finishes that are secured with an ooze head of conidia (parasitic spores created abiogenetically). "D.ÃÂ racemosa" is the main mushroom species realized that shapes conidia on side parts of the stem. The sclerotium from which the stem emerges is watery grayish and homogeneous in cross area (not isolated into inner chambers), with a dainty dull dark external coat, and measures in width. American mycologist Alexander H. Smith advised that learner gatherers will normally miss the sclerotium the first occasion when they discover the species. The edibility of "D.ÃÂ racemosa" is obscure, however as David Arora says, the organic product bodies are "excessively diminutive and uncommon to be of significant worth."
