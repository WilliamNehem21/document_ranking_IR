Benjamin attempted to deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential assignment, feeling he had betrayed the South. Douglas battled that despite the fact that the Supreme Court, in "Dred Scott v. Sandford", had expressed Congress couldn't confine subjection in the domains, the general population of every region could pass enactment to bar it. This position was utter horror toward the South. Benjamin applauded Douglas' rival in his re-appointment offer, previous congressman Abraham Lincoln, for in any event being consistent with his standards as a rival of the extension of subjection, while the congressperson believed Douglas to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Benjamin was participated in his resistance to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were successful to the point that the 1860 tradition was not ready to name anybody and split into Northern and Southern groups. The Northerners sponsored Douglas while Southern agents picked Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. In spite of their understanding in restricting Douglas, Benjamin and Davis contrasted on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted in favor of a bill to help Africans freed by U.S. maritime vessels from illicit slave ships, so as to return them to their local landmass from Key West. Davis and numerous different Southerners restricted the bill.
