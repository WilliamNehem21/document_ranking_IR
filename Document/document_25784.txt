The red-billed quelea was one of the many birds described originally by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his "Systema Naturae". Classifying it in the bunting genus "Emberiza", he gave it the binomial name of "Emberiza quelea". He incorrectly mentioned that it originated in India, probably because ships from the East Indies picked up birds when visiting the African coast during their return voyage to Europe. It is likely that he had seen a draft of "Ornithologia, sive Synopsis methodica sistens avium divisionem in ordines, sectiones, genera, species, ipsarumque varietates", a book written by Mathurin Jacques Brisson that was to be published in 1760, and which contained a black and white drawing of the species. The erroneous type locality of India was corrected to Africa in the 12th edition of "Systema Naturae" of 1766, and Brisson was cited. Brisson mentions that the bird originates from Senegal, where it had been collected by Michel Adanson during his 1748-1752 expedition. He called the bird "Moineau a bec rouge du Senegal" in French and "Passer senegalensis erythrorynchos" in Latin, both meaning "red-billed Senegalese sparrow". Also in 1766, George Edwards illustrated the species in colour, based on a live male specimen owned by a Mrs Clayton in Surrey. He called it the "Brazilian sparrow", despite being unsure whether it came from Brazil or Angola. In 1850, Ludwig Reichenbach thought the species was not a true bunting, but rather a weaver, and created the genus name "Quelea", as well as the new combination "Q.Â quelea". The white-faced morph was described as a separate species, "Q.Â russii".
