The portion of I-8 bypassing Holtville began construction in DecemberÂ 1969, and was nearing completion in MayÂ 1971, to result in a continuous freeway that connected two existing segments from Crestwood in San Diego County to just west of Winterhaven. It was estimated that the bypass would save travelers 20Â minutes of travel time through the Imperial Valley. The cost of this project was $11.2Â million (about $ in dollars). However, Holtville residents raised concerns about SRÂ 115 providing the only access to the eastern part of the city, notably the narrow and curved portion leading from the freeway into town. Work on the Holtville portion began at 3:30Â a.m. daily during the summer in order to avoid the desert heat. In addition to this, construction of the Highline Canal overpass involved a steel span that was prefabricated and made of girders that were hoisted into position by barges. The Matich Construction Company attempted to set the world record for laying the most concrete in a day, aided by the level terrain, but failed to do so after the concrete mixer malfunctioned. That same year, bids for an Arizona plant inspection station near Winterhaven, next to the California agricultural inspection station, were submitted.
