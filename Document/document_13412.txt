England was at war, yet the US was definitely not. Oliphant traveled to the United States in late August 1941, apparently to examine the radar program, yet really to discover why the United States was disregarding the MAUD Committee's discoveries. He found to his unnerve that the reports and different archives sent straightforwardly to Briggs had not been imparted to all individuals from the board of trustees; Briggs had secured them a safe. Oliphant then met with William D. Coolidge, who was acting in Compton's place while the last was in South America; Samuel K. Allison, an associate of Compton's at the University of Chicago; Ernest O. Lawrence, the executive of the Radiation Laboratory; Fermi and Conant to clarify the desperation. In these gatherings he talked about a nuclear bomb with forcefulness and conviction. Allison reviewed that when Oliphant met with the S-1 Section, he "went to a gathering, and said 'bomb' undoubtedly. He disclosed to us we should focus each exertion on the bomb and said we reserved no privilege to chip away at power plants or anything besides the bomb. The bomb would cost $25 million, he stated, and Britain did not have the cash or the labor, so it was up to us."
