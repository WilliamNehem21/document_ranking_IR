Taito has released several arcade sequels. The first was "Space Invaders Part II" in 1979; it featured color graphics, an attract mode, new gameplay elements, and added an intermission between gameplay. According to the "Killer List of Video Games", this was the first video game to include an intermission. The game also allowed the player with the top score to sign their name on the high score table. This version was released in the United States as "Deluxe Space Invaders" (also known as "Space Invaders Deluxe"), but it featured a different graphical color scheme and a lunar-city background. Another arcade sequel, "Space Invaders II", was released exclusively in the United States. It was in a cocktail-table format with very fast alien firing and a competitive two-player mode. During the summer of 1985, "Return of the Invaders" was released with updated color graphics and more complex movements and attack patterns for the aliens. Subsequent arcade sequels included "Super Space Invaders '91", "Space Invaders DX", and "Space Invaders 95". Each game introduced minor gameplay additions to the original design. Like the original game, several of the arcade sequels have become collector's items, though some are considered rarer. In 2002, Taito released "Space Raiders", a third-person shooter reminiscent of "Space Invaders".
