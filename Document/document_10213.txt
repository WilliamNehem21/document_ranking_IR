In December 1818, the Shelleys voyaged south with Claire Clairmont and their hirelings to Naples, where they remained for three months, accepting just a single guest, a doctor. In 1820, they got themselves tormented by allegations and dangers from Paolo and Elise Foggi, previous hirelings whom Percy Shelley had rejected in Naples not long after the Foggis had hitched. The pair uncovered that on 27 February 1819 in Naples, Percy Shelley had enrolled as his youngster by Mary Shelley a two-month-old child young lady named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis likewise guaranteed that Claire Clairmont was the child's mom. Biographers have offered different elucidations of these occasions: that Percy Shelley chose to embrace a neighborhood kid; that the child was his by Elise, Claire, or an obscure lady; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley demanded she would have known whether Claire had been pregnant, however it is indistinct the amount she truly knew. The occasions in Naples, a city Mary Shelley later called a heaven occupied by fallen angels, remain covered in secret. The main sureness is that she herself was not the kid's mom. Elena Adelaide Shelley kicked the bucket in Naples on 9 June 1820.
