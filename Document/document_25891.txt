In 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on PinzÃ³n Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto PinzÃ³n sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The GalÃ¡pagos National Park, Island Conservation, Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in PinzÃ³n tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native PinzÃ³n tortoise nests on the island and the GalÃ¡pagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to PinzÃ³n Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that PinzÃ³n and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.
