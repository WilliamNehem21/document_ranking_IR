The gauge started to fall that day and a tropical tornado started to frame. The 1889 Apia violent wind expanded in savagery throughout the following two days. Downpour fell in sheets, cutting perceivability. Winds of 70 to 100ÃÂ knots (130Ã¢ÂÂ 185ÃÂ km/h, 80-115ÃÂ mph) blew straightforwardly into the jetty, catching the boats in the V-formed harbor. The harbor base was scoured by flows and grapples lost their buy. Working their motors at full speed to oppose the breeze and waves, dispatches all things considered hauled their stays and were unyieldingly determined landward. Vessels impacted and were tossed on the reefs or shorewards, and some sank. By 09:00 on the sixteenth, "Calliope", albeit as yet riding at stay, had been hit by one ship and barely missed by another, and Captain Kane chose to endeavor to get away. To soothe the strain on the five grapple links, "Calliope"s boilers were creating greatest weight; the motors were being worked "intensely hot", and the propeller was making 74ÃÂ revolutions every moment, adequate for 15ÃÂ knots (28ÃÂ km/h) in more quiet waters. Disregarding this titanic exertion, the ship was scarcely ready to make progress against the breezes and the oceans in the harbor, and stay links started to part.
