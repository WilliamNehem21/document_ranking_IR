After Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, the BBC expected Burgess to choose speakers who might portray Britain's new Soviet partner in a great light. He swung again to Blunt, and to his old Cambridge companion Jim Lees, and in 1942 orchestrated a communicated by Ernst Henri, a Soviet operator taking on the appearance of a columnist. No transcript of Henri's discussion endures, yet audience members recollected that it as unadulterated Soviet promulgation. In October 1941, Burgess assumed responsibility for the leader political program "The Week in Westminster", which gave him practically boundless access to Parliament. Data gathered from standard wining, dining and tattling with MPs was priceless to the Soviets, paying little heed to the substance of the projects that came about. Burgess looked to keep up a political equalization; his kindred Etonian Quintin Hogg, a future Conservative ruler chancellor, was a customary supporter, as, from the contrary social and political range, was Hector McNeil, a previous columnist who turned into a Labor MP in 1941 and filled in as a parliamentary private secretary in the Churchill war service.
