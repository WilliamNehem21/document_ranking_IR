"New York Dolls" highlights 10 unique melodies and 1 spreadÃ¢ÂÂthe 1963 Bo Diddley tune "Pills". Johansen portrayed the collection as "a little gem of urban society workmanship". Rundgren, then again, said the band's sensibilities were not quite the same as "the urban New York thing" since they had been raised outside Manhattan and drew on cheerful shake and roll and Brill Building pop impacts, for example, the Shangri-Las: "Their melodies, as punky as they were, generally had a ton to do with a similar old kid young lady thing however in a substantially more intoxicated way." Johansen cited the verse "you'd best trust I'm enamored L-U-V" from the Shangri-Las' "Give Him a Great Big Kiss" (1964) when he opened "Searching for a Kiss", which recounts to an account of juvenile sentimental want hampered by friends who use drugs. On "Metro Train", he utilized verses from the American people standard "Somebody's in the Kitchen with Dinah". In the sentiment of pundit Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the collection's boisterous hard shake tunes additionally redone riffs from Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, bringing about music that sounded tense and compromising disregarding the New York Dolls' wittingly kitsch and camp sensibilities. "Identity Crisis" highlighted awkward double guitars, boogie-woogie piano, and a theatrical interruption, while "Rubbish" was a punky pop shake tune with bold singing.
