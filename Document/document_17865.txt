U2 considered several other titles for the album, including "Man" (in contrast to the group's debut, "Boy"), "69", "Zoo Station", and "Adam", the latter of which would have been paired with the nude photo of Clayton. Other titles in consideration included "Fear of Women" and "Cruise Down Main Street", the latter a reference to the Rolling Stones' record "Exile on Main St." and the cruise missiles launched on Baghdad during the Gulf War. Most of the proposed titles were rejected out of the belief that people would see them as pretentious and "another Big Statement from U2".
As early as December 1990, the music press reported that U2 would be recording a dance-oriented album and that it would be released in mid-1991. In August 1991, sound collage artists Negativland released an EP entitled "U2" that parodied U2's song "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Island Records objected to the release, believing consumers would confuse the EP for a new U2 record. Island successfully sued for copyright infringement but were criticised in the music press, as were U2, although they were not involved in the litigation. "Uncut"s Stephen Dalton believes that the negative headlines were tempered by the success of "Achtung Baby"s first single, "The Fly", released on 21Â October 1991 a month before the album. Sounding nothing like U2's typical style, it was selected as the lead single to announce the group's new musical direction. It became their second song to top the UK Singles Chart, while reaching number one on the singles charts in Ireland and Australia. The single was less successful in the US, peaking at number 61 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
