Amid the main portion of the 1930s, different Soviet productions scrutinized the realized verifiable actualities with respect to the age of the Cathedral. The productions focused on that the medieval structure had experienced real reproductions and that little of the first Byzantine-style church building was protected. This influx of addressing prompted the destruction of the religious community and its supplanting with another authoritative place for the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (recently situated in the city of Kharkiv). Prior to its annihilation (8 June Ã¢ÂÂ 9 July 1934), the structure was deliberately examined by T.M. Movchanivskyi and K. Honcharev from the as of late cleansed and re-sorted out Institute of Material Culture of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. Based on their review, the house of prayer was announced to have a place essentially with the Ukrainian Baroque style, as opposed to the twelfth century as was recently suspected, and in this way did not justify protection because of its absence of authentic and imaginative esteem. This end upheld up the Soviet experts' arrangements to destroy the whole religious community. Neighborhood antiquarians, archeologists, and modelers consented to the religious community's pulverization, albeit reluctantly. Just a single teacher, Mykola Makarenko, wouldn't sign the devastation demonstration; he later kicked the bucket in a Soviet jail.
