The cerebrum's surface is genuinely smooth, run of the mill for a "crude" creature. It involves just 61% of the cranial hole and is squeezed against within surface by cerebrospinal liquid. The capacity of this generally extensive measure of liquid isn't known, albeit one probability is that it goes about as a safeguard, padding the cerebrum if the creature tumbles from a tree.
