Anselme may have acquired the artworks from his dad Pieter or uncle Jakob, who had made a trip to Jerusalem on journey around 50 years sooner, coming back to Ghent around 1427 or 1428. On their arrival the Adornes siblings subsidized a copy of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulcher worked in Bruges, known as the Jerusalem house of prayer. They may likewise have authorized the two St Francis artistic creations as remembrance of the journey, in the design of the Eyckian "The Three Marys at the Tomb"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ ascribed to Jan's sibling HubertÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a canvas which may have been appointed to remember a fruitful journey. An elective hypothesis is that they had the little painting readied as a versatile reverential work to expedite journey. The responsibility for reverential pieces was not uncommonÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the regularly vagrant Philip the Good kept an altarpiece for voyaging. Much all the more captivating is that Philip had van Eyck paint two indistinguishable pre-wedding assurance representations of Isabella of Portugal in 1428ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ to guarantee one endure the excursion from PortugalÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ which may have set a point of reference that Bruges workmanship benefactors looked to imitate. Anselme Adornes more likely than not expedited the littler painting with him journey in 1470; it was found in Italy, especially in Florence, and generally replicated. In the mid 1470s Sandro Botticelli, Verrochio, Filippino Lippi and Giovanni Bellini each created varieties of "St Francis Receiving the Stigmata" that included themes from van Eyck's form, particularly obvious in the rendering of the rough foundation.
