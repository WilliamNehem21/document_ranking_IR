A farmhouse initially possessed by John Denby in the mid-sixteenth century, after whom the home is named, remained at the core of Denbies. The grounds were sold by William Wakefield (or Wakeford) to Jonathan Tyers in 1734, to be created as an end of the week retreat. Tyers was the proprietor of London's Vauxhall GardensÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ referred to around then as New Spring GardensÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and was in charge of forming that scene into a "popular spot of night diversion". A straightforward two-story house in the Georgian style was worked by changing over a portion of the old ranch structures. Set over a slope about northwest of Dorking, the house had perspectives on the Surrey scene and upheld onto Ranmore Common. Tyers introduced a well next to the house; a note in "The Gentleman's Magazine" of 1781 gives the well's estimations, recorded on 4 October 1764, as being in distance across and achieving a profundity of . On that day it contained water to a profundity of provided from a spring. The front of the house had a pediment in the focal wing beautified with an escutcheon; the rooms were not substantial but rather were helpfully arranged.
