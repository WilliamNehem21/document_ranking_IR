With the ninth issue, dated July 1, 1919, Hersey was supplanted by Ronald Oliphant. The reason he was supplanted isn't clear, however a few clarifications have been recommended. Murray Leinster asserted that Hersey was terminated for distributing his very own lot fiction and verse in the magazine; as indicated by Leinster, a portion of the verse may have really been composed by Hersey's mom as opposed to by Hersey himself. Mash antiquarian Richard Bleiler views this hypothesis as far-fetched, since in spite of the fact that up to eighteen of the twenty-five short lyrics in the initial eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey, just two stories in those issues are unquestionably by him, and there are just four different stories which may have been Hersey's work distributed under a pen name. Bleiler recommends that at most Street and Smith would have impugned Hersey, and that the genuine purpose behind his rejection is bound to be that Street and Smith were disappointed with "The Thrill Book" under his editorship. Bleiler likewise recommends that Hersey may have begun the talk that he was given up for purchasing his very own lot material, as this would have been less destructive to his notoriety than a rejection for disappointment. Hersey himself asserted that he was not terminated, yet quit: "I wasn't terminated, yet I ought to have beenÃÂ ... I saw the 'penmanship on the divider' early. I solicited to be mitigated from my dutiesÃÂ ... furthermore, my solicitation was instantly acknowledged!"
