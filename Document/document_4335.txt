The updates on Ferrier's demise came as an impressive stun to the general population. Albeit some in melodic circles knew or suspected reality, the fantasy had been saved that her nonattendance from the show scene was impermanent. The musical drama commentator Rupert Christiansen, composing as the 50th commemoration of Ferrier's passing drew closer, kept up that "no vocalist in this nation has ever been all the more profoundly adored, as much for the individual she was with respect to the voice she articulated". Her passing, he proceeded, "actually broke the happiness of the Coronation" (which had occurred on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, supervisor of "Granta", trusted that she "may well have been the most praised lady in Britain after the Queen." Among the numerous tributes from her associates, that of Bruno Walter has been featured by biographers: "The best thing in music in my life has been to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav MahlerÃ¢ÂÂin a specific order." Very couple of artists, Lord Harewood states, "have earned so incredible a valedictory from so senior a partner." At a commemoration administration at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his commendation, said of Ferrier's voice: "She appeared to bring into this world a brilliance from a different universe."
