The groups reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 keeps running at 24.33 in three Test innings in his new position in the center request. Yardley won the hurl and chose to bat, and England made 363. Barnes got his first unfortunate casualty for the Test arrangement, the minute debutant opener George Emmett, who was amazed by a rising ball from Ray Lindwall. Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fought with one hand on the evenly held bat, while dodging his head down underneath his arms; the ball ricocheted gradually off the pitch and in the wake of hitting Emmett's bat, bounced back delicately open to question to Barnes, leaving England at 2/28. Barnes dropped two looks up some other time in the day, however neither cost Australia significantly. Jack Crapp hit Ernie Toshack to Barnes at short leg, who neglected to hold the catch. In any case, Crapp did not underwrite and was out before long. Amid a similar center session, Yardley hit Toshack to Barnes, who was again unfit to finish the reflex catch. Be that as it may, Yardley was rejected not long after for 22. Tail-ender Dick Pollard went to the wrinkle on the second morning and pulled a ball from Ian Johnson into the left ribs of Barnes, who was remaining at short leg, nearly on the edge of the cut strip. As per Fingleton, Barnes "dropped like a fallen tree", and a minority of observers boisterously commended the damage. Quickly incapacitated on his left side, he must be conveyed from the beginning four policemen and taken to emergency clinic for an examination.
