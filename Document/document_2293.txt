After the annihilation of Pope at Second Bull Run, President Lincoln reluctantly came back to the man who had retouched a broken armed force previously. He understood that McClellan was a solid coordinator and a gifted coach of troops, ready to recombine the units of Pope's military with the Army of the Potomac quicker than anybody. On September 2, 1862, Lincoln named McClellan to order "the fortresses of Washington, and every one of the troops for the resistance of the capital". The arrangement was disputable in the Cabinet, a lion's share of whom marked an appeal announcing to the president "our intentional assessment that, right now, it isn't sheltered to endow to Major General McClellan the direction of any Army of the United States". The president conceded that it resembled "restoring the chomp with the hair of the canine". Be that as it may, Lincoln told his secretary, John Hay, "We should utilize what devices we have. There is no man in the Army who can man these strongholds and lick these troops of our own into shape half just as he. On the off chance that he can't battle himself, he exceeds expectations in making others prepared to battle."
