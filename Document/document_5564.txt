The musical show was depicted by its makers as a "commedia lirica". McDonald remarked in 2009 that "Falstaff" is altogether different Ã¢ÂÂ an elaborate flight Ã¢ÂÂ from Verdi's prior work. In McDonald's view the vast majority of the melodic articulation is in the exchange, and there is just a single conventional aria. The outcome is that "such elaborate economy Ã¢ÂÂ increasingly advanced, more testing than he had utilized previously Ã¢ÂÂ is the keynote of the work." McDonald contends that deliberately or unknowingly, Verdi was building up the figure of speech that would come to overwhelm the music of the twentieth century: "the lyricism is truncated, looked at as opposed to reveled. Tunes blossom all of a sudden and after that evaporate, supplanted by differentiating rhythm or an unforeseen expression that presents another character or thought". In McDonald's view the symphonic composition goes about as a refined reporter on the activity. It has impacted something like one of Verdi's operatic successors: in 1952 Imogen Holst, melodic right hand to Benjamin Britten, composed, after an execution of "Falstaff", "I understood out of the blue the amount Ben owes to [Verdi]. There are symphonic bits which are "simply" as interesting to tune in to as the comic instrumental bits in "A. Herring"!"
