"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" was composed by Duchovny and "The X-Files" maker Chris Carter, making it Duchovny's second on-screen composing credit, after the 6th season scene "The Unnatural". He had beforehand co-built up the second-season finale "Anasazi" with Carter, and had gotten a teleplay credit for the third-season scenes "Symbol" and "Talitha Cumi". Duchovny chipped away at his part of the content while Carter composed the season debut, "The Sixth Extinction". Carter at that point added his outstanding parts to Duchovny's content in the wake of completing his work on the past scene. The slogan that shows up in the opening credits for this scene is "love fati". This is a Latin expression alluding to the "affection for destiny", which is a vital idea in the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche. With regards to the scene, the caption has been translated by author Charlton McIlwain in his book "When Death Goes Pop: Death, MediaÃÂ &ÃÂ the Remaking of Community" as a source of perspective to the adoration for a foreordained life, for this situation, Mulder's fantasy. In her book "We Want to Believe", Amy Donaldson proposes the expression implies that Mulder must "love his torment and inactively acknowledge it [and] effectively grasp his journeyÃÂ ... also, discharge his soul to discover new life."
