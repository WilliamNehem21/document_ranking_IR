Surveys of the primary execution of "Preliminary by Jury" were consistently shining. "Fun" magazine proclaimed the musical drama "incredibly amusing and honorably formed", while the opponent "Punch" magazine composed that it "is the most clever piece of drivel your agent has seen for a significant time", just lamenting that it was excessively short. The "Day by day News" adulated the creator: "In offbeat development and unpredictable diversion Mr. W. S. Gilbert has no living opponent among our sensational scholars, and never has his curious vein of buffoonery and parody been more obvious than in a little piece entitled "Preliminary by Jury"". "The Daily Telegraph" inferred that the piece outlined the author's "incredible limit with respect to emotional composition of the lighter class". Numerous commentators underlined the cheerful blend of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. One noticed that "so totally is each permeated with a similar soul, that it would be as hard to imagine the presence of Mr. Gilbert's stanzas without Mr. Sullivan's music, as of Mr. Sullivan's music without Mr. Gilbert's sections. Every give each a twofold appeal." Another concurred that "it appears, as in the incomparable Wagnerian musical shows, just as ballad and music had continued all the while from one and a similar mind."
