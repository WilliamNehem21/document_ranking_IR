The main complaint was procedural, by Utah's Reed Smoot: that the bill ought to have rather been alluded to and endorsed by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, or its Committee on Finance. Neither Smoot nor some other congressperson questioned the charge itself, which Martine demonstrated had the help of Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo. S. 6309 was the next day sent to the House of Representatives, where it was alluded to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures. It rose up out of that council on September 1, 1914, with a few corrections, one of which expanded the joined approved mintage of the two $50 pieces from 2,000 to 3,000. S. 6309 was quickly considered by the House of Representatives on January 4, 1915, and go after Kahn effectively proposed a minor correction to strike out the dollar sign from the expression "silver coins of the section of $50 pennies each". The Senate agreed in the House corrections two days after the fact, passing the bill undoubtedly, change, or restriction, and President Woodrow Wilson marked it into law on January 16.
