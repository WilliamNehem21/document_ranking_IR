The spores are generally round, thick-walled, 3Ã¢ÂÂ 6ÃÂ ÃÂµm in distance across (albeit a few examples gathered in the US go from 7.2 to 9.5ÃÂ ÃÂµm), and are secured with moment spines or moles. The utilization of filtering electron microscopy has uncovered that these ornamentations on the spores are commonly 0.95ÃÂ ÃÂµm long. Spore ultrastructure is particular among "Calvatia" species, and has been utilized to help check ordered groupings and affirm the status of species inside the class. The capillitia (coarse, thick-walled hyphae in the gleba) are septate, with branches that are limited towards the tips; they are 3Ã¢ÂÂ 8ÃÂ ÃÂµm in distance across. At the point when developed in unadulterated culture in the research facility, "C.ÃÂ sculpta" is, under specific conditions, ready to develop structures called "mycelial strands". These are direct totals of hyphae whereby more established "driving" hyphae become encased by snaked layers of more up to date "ringlet" hyphae. Mycelial strands give a conductor to transporting water and supplements crosswise over non-supplement material, enabling the parasite to achieve new wellsprings of sustenance. They are likewise ensnared in the development of organic product bodies and sclerotia. The mycelia of "C.ÃÂ sculpta" can be instigated to frame mycelial strands when there is a penetrable physical hindrance among it and the agar substrate. The wide hyphae in the focal point of the mycelial strands contain protein-thick structures on their cell dividers that are molded like a torus. Their capacity is obscure.
