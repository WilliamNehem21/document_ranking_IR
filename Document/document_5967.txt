In quest for his arrangements, Jardine accepted guidance on handling positions from Frank Foster, who had bowled a type of medium-quick leg hypothesis amid the 1911Ã¢ÂÂ 12 arrangement in Australia with much achievement, taking 32 wickets at 21.63. Larwood did not at the time think about Jardine's proposed strategies as either novel or questionable. His need was to contain Bradman, so "any plan that would hold him within proper limits spoke to me a lot". In region matches following the Piccadilly Hotel supper, Larwood and Voce attempted the strategies out, with blended outcomes. Two Essex batsmen supported wounds as their side battled with the new bowling, at one phase losing 8 wickets for 52 runs. Be that as it may, Glamorgan, figured to be a feeble batting side, scored more than 500 against the exploratory assault; observers, including the future cricket essayist and analyst John Arlott, were bewildered by the inadequacy of the bowling. Arlott later contemplated that what seemed powerless bowling on English pitches would be an alternate suggestion on the a lot quicker Australian pitches. Unfriendly quick bowling was not kept to Larwood and Voce; in Yorkshire's match against Surrey at The Oval, Bill Bowes bowled a progression of bouncers, bringing dissents from Hobbs and press analysis from Warner.
