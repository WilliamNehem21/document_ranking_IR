While traveling in the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq watched individuals there tuning in to great soul music and was propelled to seek after it as a melodic bearing for his next collection. He described the involvement in a meeting for "Blues and Soul", saying that "I resembled 'Amazing, perhaps I should take advantage of this vibe, since it's really what I LOVE!' ... I understood that, however you can hear it in a large number of the records I've done all through my vocation, I'd never given 100% consideration to going toward that path previously. So the distinction this time is that I took a progressively engaged course." As a piece of Tony! Toni! TonÃÂ©! amid the late 1990s, Saadiq had consolidated impacts from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the gathering. Before account "The Way I See It", Saadiq marked to Columbia Records. Mark official Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was awed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and counsel to him as a performance craftsman, "He instructed me to never confine myself. I simply must act naturally. You must pursue your very own way. I've constantly gone not far off less voyaged, however at this point I do it significantly more forcefully."
