The remainder of the district was settled by the general population called "Nerve Gaidhil" (present day Scottish Gaelic: "Nerve GhÃÂ idheil") in their own language, varieties of "Gallwedienses" in Latin, and ordinarily Galwegians or Gallovidians in current English. References in the eleventh century to the kingdom of the Gall-Gaidhil focus it far toward the north of what is presently Galloway. Kingarth ("Cenn Garadh") and Eigg ("Eic") were depicted as "in Galloway" ("Gallgaidelaib") by the "Martyrology of ÃÂengus", as opposed to WhithornÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂsome portion of present day GallowayÃ¢ÂÂwhich was named as existing in another kingdom, The Rhinns ("Na Renna"). These zones had been a piece of the Kingdom of Northumbria until the ninth century, and a while later were changed by a procedure in all respects inadequately reported, yet presumably completed by various little groups of socially Scandinavian however semantically Gaelic warrior-pioneers moving in from Ireland and southern Argyll. "Galloway" today just alludes to the terrains of Rhinns, Farines, Glenken, Desnes MÃÂ³r and Desnes Ioan (that is, Wigtownshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright), yet this is because of the regional changes that occurred in and around Donnchadh's lifetime instead of being the contemporary definition. For example, a twelfth century bit of marginalia found the island of Ailsa Craig "lying between "Gallgaedelu" [Galloway] and "Cend Tiri" [Kintyre]", while a sanction of MÃÂ¡el Coluim IV ("Malcolm IV") portrays Strathgryfe, Cunningham, Kyle and Carrick as the four "cadrez" (presumably from "ceathramh", "quarter"s) of Galloway; an Irish record section for the year 1154 assigned galleys from Arran, Kintyre, the Isle of Man as "Gallghaoidhel", "Galwegian".
