From Raqqa, Ibn Ra'iq's troops quickly assumed control over the regions of northern Syria, where al-Ikhshid's sibling Ubayd Allah was representative, while the Egyptian powers withdrew south. By October or November, Ibn Ra'iq's men had come to Ramla and proceeded onward into the Sinai. Al-Ikhshid drove his military against Ibn Ra'iq, yet after a short conflict at al-Farama, the two men went to a comprehension, partitioning Syria between them: the zones from Ramla toward the south would be under al-Ikhshid, and the territories toward the north under Ibn Ra'iq. In May or June 940, notwithstanding, al-Ikhshid discovered that Ibn Ra'iq had by and by moved against Ramla. Yet again, the Egyptian ruler drove his military to fight. Albeit vanquished at al-Arish, al-Ikhshid had the capacity to rapidly rally his troops and trap Ibn Ra'iq, keeping him from entering Egypt legitimate and constraining him to withdraw back to Damascus. Al-Ikhshid sent his sibling, Abu Nasr al-Husayn, with another military against Ibn Ra'iq, yet he was vanquished and murdered at Lajjun. In spite of his triumph, Ibn Ra'iq settled on harmony: he gave Abu Nasr a respectable entombment and sent his child, Muzahim, as emissary to Egypt. Consistent with his political procedure, al-Ikhshid acknowledged. The understanding saw the rebuilding of the regional existing conditions of the earlier year, however with al-Ikhshid paying a yearly tribute of 140,000 gold "dinars". The arrangement was solidified by the marriage of Muzahim with al-Ikhshid's little girl Fatima.
