He endeavored to modernize the educational modules by including human sciences, government and financial aspects courses, yet experienced solid opposition from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes, the investigation of the battles of the American Civil War was supplanted with the investigation of those of World War I. In History class, more accentuation was set on the Far East. MacArthur extended the games program, expanding the quantity of intramural games and requiring all cadets to take an interest. He enabled high society cadets to leave the booking, and endorsed a cadet paper, "The Brag", precursor of the present "West Pointer". He additionally allowed cadets to head out to watch their football crew play, and gave them a recompense of $5 ($ in current dollars) a month. Educators and graduated class alike dissented these extreme moves. A large portion of MacArthur's West Point changes were before long disposed of at the same time, in the following years, his thoughts wound up acknowledged and his developments were bit by bit reestablished.
