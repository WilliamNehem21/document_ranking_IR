"Compsognathus" is known from two practically total skeletons, one from Germany that is long and another from France that is long. The doctor and fossil authority Joseph Oberndorfer procured the German example (BSP AS I 563) in 1859, found about that year in the lithographic limestone stores in the Riedenburg-Kelheim area of Bavaria, in the Jurassic piece of a lagoonal locale known as the Solnhofen archipelago. The limestone of this territory has likewise yielded such very much protected fossils as "Archaeopteryx" with quill impressions and a few pterosaurs with engravings of their wing layers. The German "Compsognathus" fossil itself no doubt originated from the Painten Formation of the Kapfelberg area, explicitly dated to the highest Kimmeridgian organize (150.8 million years prior); be that as it may, elective potential outcomes incorporate quarries close Jachenhausen or Goldberg, both from the Tithonian, to which arrange "Compsognathus" has customarily been dated. Johann A. Wagner talked about the example quickly in 1859, when he authored the name "Compsognathus longipes", and portrayed it in detail in 1861. In mid 1868, Thomas Huxley thought about the two species and, following prior proposals by Karl Gegenbaur and Edward Drinker Cope, reasoned that, aside from its arms and plumes, the "Archaeopteryx" skeleton was firmly like "Compsognathus", and that the proto-winged creature was identified with the dinosaurs. In 1896, Othniel Marsh perceived the fossil as a genuine individual from the Dinosauria. John Ostrom altogether redescribed the species in 1978, making it a standout amongst the best-known little theropods around then. The German example is in plain view at the Bayerische Staatsammlung fÃÂ¼r PalÃÂ¤ontologie und historische Geologie (Bavarian State Institute for Paleontology and Historical Geology) in Munich, Germany, which purchased the fossil from Oberndorfer in 1865.
