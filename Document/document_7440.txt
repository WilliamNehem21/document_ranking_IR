Thompson saw the novel as an account of "adoration and cash," taking note of that a few people required one more than the other. Amid the composition procedure, official maker Sydney Pollack focused on that the film be reasonable to present day groups of onlookers, and that it be clarified why the Dashwood sisters couldn't simply acquire an occupation. "I'm from Indiana; on the off chance that I get it, everybody gets it," he said. Thompson trusted that Austen was similarly as understandable in an alternate century, "You don't think individuals are as yet worried about marriage, cash, sentiment, finding an accomplice?" She was quick to accentuate the authenticity of the Dashwoods' dilemma in her screenplay, and embedded scenes to make the distinctions in riches increasingly clear to current gatherings of people. Thompson made the Dashwood family more extravagant than in the book and added components to help balance their initial riches with their later monetary problem; for example, since it may have been befuddling to watchers that one could be poor and still have hirelings, Elinor is made to address a vast gathering of workers at Norland Park from the get-go in the film for watchers to recall when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee additionally looked to underscore social class and the constraints it put on the heroes. Lee passes on this partially when Willoughby openly rejects Marianne; he comes back to an all the more extravagantly outfitted room, an image of the riches she has lost. "Family shows," he expressed, "are about clash, about family commitments versus through and through freedom."
