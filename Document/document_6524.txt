There was no play on the next day, Sunday being a rest day, however on Monday morning, the trade among Warner and Woodfull was accounted for in a few Australian papers. The players and authorities were sickened that a touchy private trade had been accounted for to the press. Holes to the press were for all intents and purposes obscure in 1933. David Frith takes note of that attentiveness and regard were exceedingly prized and such a break was "viewed as an ethical offense of the principal request." Woodfull clarified that he seriously objected to the hole, and later composed that he "constantly anticipated that cricketers should make the best decision by their colleagues." As the main full-time writer in the Australian group, doubt quickly fell on Fingleton, in spite of the fact that when the story was distributed, he disclosed to Woodfull he was not capable. Warner offered Larwood a reward of one pound in the event that he could reject Fingleton in the second innings; Larwood obliged by bowling him for a duck. Fingleton later asserted that Sydney Sun journalist Claude Corbett had gotten the data from Bradman; for the remainder of their lives, Fingleton and Bradman made case and counter-guarantee that the other man was in charge of the break.
