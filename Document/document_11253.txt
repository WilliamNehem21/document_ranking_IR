As Britain moved towards war in the July Crisis of 1914, many tried to change over Bank of England notes into gold, and the bank's stores of that metal tumbled from ÃÂ£27 million on 29 July to ÃÂ£11 million on 1 August. Following the presentation of war against Germany on 4 August, the administration coursed one-pound and ten-peddling banknotes instead of the sovereign and half sovereign. Limitations were put on sending gold to another country, and the dissolving down of coin made an offense. Not all were energetic about the change from gold to paper: J.J. Cullimore Allen, in his 1965 book on sovereigns, met his first finance after the change to banknotes, with the specialists questionable about the banknotes and at first requesting to be paid in gold. Allen changed over five sovereigns from his own pocket into notes, and the laborers made no further complaint. Change into gold was not prohibited, yet the Chancellor, David Lloyd George, clarified that such activities would be unpatriotic and would hurt the war exertion. Maybe a couple demanded installment in gold despite such interests, and by mid-1915, the sovereign was once in a while found in London business. The coin was portrayed on purposeful publicity blurbs, which encouraged help for the war.
