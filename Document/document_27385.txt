Writers agree that the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British newspaper "The Observer" writes "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every levelÂ [...] It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated for the past six seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by "Ally McBeal", the "Buffy" musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." Johnston in the "Sunday Herald Sun" says, "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in "The Age" comments, "Whedon demonstrates yet again what "Buffy" aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack." Steve Murray in "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" characterizes the episode as "scary in a brand-new way", saying "Once More, with Feeling" is "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as "(b)oth spoof and homage, [parodying] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".
