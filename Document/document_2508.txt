Likewise with all individuals from the sort, these leaf sharp edges are thickly secured by peduncular (stalked) adhesive organs and sessile (level) stomach related organs. The peduncular organs comprise of a couple of secretory cells over a solitary celled stalk. These cells produce an adhesive emission which frames obvious beads over the leaf surface. This wet appearance most likely enables draw to prey looking for water; a comparable marvel is seen in the sundews. The beads discharge just restricted catalysts and serve for the most part to capture creepy crawlies. On contact with a creepy crawly, the peduncular organs discharge extra adhesive from extraordinary repository cells situated at the base of their stalks. The creepy crawly battles, activating more organs and encasing itself in adhesive. "P. moranensis" can twist its leaf edges marginally by thigmotropism, carrying extra organs into contact with the caught bug. The sessile organs, which lie level on the leaf surface, serve to process the bug prey. When the prey is ensnared by the peduncular organs and assimilation starts, the underlying stream of nitrogen triggers protein discharge by the sessile organs. These compounds, which incorporate amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease separate the edible segments of the creepy crawly body. These liquids are then assimilated once again into the leaf surface through cuticular openings, leaving just the chitin exoskeleton of the bigger creepy crawlies on the leaf surface.
