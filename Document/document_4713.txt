The commemoration was developed by Hobson Limited of Nottingham. While numerous First World War dedications highlight form or plain religious imagery, Rochdale's, in the same way as other of Lutyens' remembrances, utilizes dynamic and ecumenical shapes roused by traditional engineering. It contains two components: an arch and a Stone of Remembrance framed from light dim Cornish rock which are raised on a stage (stylobate) of three stages. The cenotaph is raised on six stages on the stage, and ascends in decreasing levels of comprehensively rectangular cross segment, with its long pivot arranged southeast to northwest. On the plain first level are four cut and painted stone banners with overlaid bronze shafts, two to either side: the Union Flag and the White Ensign on the southwest side, and the Royal Air Force Ensign and the Red Ensign on the upper east. The banners flank a second, littler, level which has a semi-section at either end and which comes full circle in a littler plinth supporting a catafalque. At the top is a figure of a supine fighter hung with his jacket. The plan for the arch depends on Lutyens' Midland Railway War Memorial, revealed in Derby in 1921. Painted stone banners are a common element in Lutyens' war dedication structures. He initially proposed them for Whitehall's Cenotaph, where they were dismissed for texture banners, however they show up on a few of his different commemorations including Northampton War Memorial and Leicester's Arch of Remembrance.
