Designer Nomura said that he wanted Tidus' clothing and accessories to suggest a relationship with the sea. Tidus' clothing has a distinctive blue motif; his blitzball team logo, based on a fish hook, is an amalgam of the letters "J" and "T" (the first letters of Tidus' name and that of his father, Jecht). Because a player can change Tidus' name, the character is not referred to by name in audible dialogue; however, a character in Dream Zanarkand uses Tidus' name in a dialogue box. The only other in-game appearance of his name is "Tidu" in Spiran script on the nameplate of an Auroch locker in the Luca stadium. Before "Final Fantasy X"s release, Tidus was known to the media as Tida. In early 2001, PlayOnline changed the character's name to "Tidus". Because his name is never spoken in "Final Fantasy X", its intended pronunciation has been debated. Interviews with James Arnold Taylor and spoken dialogue in the English versions of "Dissidia Final Fantasy", "Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy", and "Kingdom Hearts" (with cameo appearances by the character) indicate that it is pronounced (); in the English version of "Kingdom Hearts II", Tidus' name is pronounced (). According to Taylor, it was pronounced during the localization of "Final Fantasy X" because the narrator of an early English trailer pronounced it that way.
