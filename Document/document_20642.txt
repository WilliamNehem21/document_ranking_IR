Steller's sea cows grew to be long as adults, much larger than extant sirenians. Georg Steller's writings contain two contradictory estimates of weight: . The true value is estimated to fall between these figures, at about . This size made the sea cow one of the largest mammals of the Holocene epoch, along with whales. The sea cow's large size was likely an adaptation to reduce its surface area-to-volume ratio and conserve heat. Unlike other sirenians, Steller's sea cow was positively buoyant, meaning that it was unable to completely submerge. It had a very thick outer skin, , to prevent injury from sharp rocks and ice and possibly to prevent unsubmerged skin from drying out. The sea cow's blubber was thick, another adaptation to the frigid climate of the Bering Sea. Its skin was brownish-black, with white patches on some individuals. It was smooth along its back and rough on its sides, with crater-like depressions most likely caused by parasites. This rough texture led to the animal's being nicknamed the "bark animal". Hair on its body was sparse, but the insides of the sea cow's flippers were covered in bristles. The fore limbs were roughly long, and the tail fluke was forked.
