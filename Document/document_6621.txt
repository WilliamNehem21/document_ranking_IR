Cystidia that are situated along the edge of the top (called cheilocystidia) are circular, and 30Ã¢ÂÂ 120 by 20Ã¢ÂÂ 74ÃÂ ÃÂµm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are club-formed or extended ovals, up to 130Ã¢ÂÂ 155ÃÂ ÃÂµm long. The pleurocystidia distend from the essence of the gill and go about as watchmen, keeping adjoining gills from contacting one another, and furthermore guaranteeing that the basidia and spores have adequate space for improvement. "C.ÃÂ micaceus" may likewise have dispersed caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60Ã¢ÂÂ 100 by 5Ã¢ÂÂ 10ÃÂ ÃÂµm, however their quality is variable and can't dependably be utilized for ID. Both De Bary and Buller, in their examinations concerning the structure of the cystidia, reasoned that there is a focal mass of cytoplasm shaped where various dainty plates of cytoplasm meet at the focal point of the cell. De Bary trusted that the plates were filamentous expanding forms, yet Buller suspected that they were framed in a procedure like the dividers of froth bubbles, and that the focal mass had the capacity to gradually change structure and position by adjusting the general volumes of the vacuoles encased by the various slender cytoplasmic dividers. In more seasoned cells, the cytoplasm might be restricted to the outskirts of the cell, with one colossal vacuole involving the cell focus.
