Titchwell has a long history of human occupation. Populaces of both Modern and Neanderthal individuals were available in Norfolk before the last glaciation somewhere in the range of 100,000 and 10,000ÃÂ years back, and returned as the ice withdrew north. The archeological record is poor until around 20,000 years prior, mostly because of the common conditions, yet in addition in light of the fact that the coastline was a lot further north than at present, with the goal that numerous destinations are currently under the ocean. Early Mesolithic rock apparatuses with trademark sharp edges up to long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell date from when it was from the ocean. Other rock devices have been discovered dating from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic. As the ice withdrew amid the Mesolithic, the ocean level rose, filling what is currently the North Sea, and conveying the Norfolk coastline a lot nearer to its present line; the remaining parts of submerged backwoods can even now be distinguished at low tide. By 11,000 BC, the creators of the long cutting edges had gone, and peat bogs had shaped behind a seaward obstruction island or spit. A layer of peat framed somewhere in the range of 1920 and 1680ÃÂ BC and another somewhere in the range of 1020 and 830ÃÂ BC, showing boggy conditions; cleaned Neolithic tomahawks found in those layers were darkened by presentation to the peat.
