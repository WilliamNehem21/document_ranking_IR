The presented snake "Boa constrictor" preys on "O.ÃÂ couesi" on Cozumel. Parasites recorded on "O.ÃÂ couesi" in Veracruz incorporate unidentified ticks, vermin, insects, and fly hatchlings. The bug "Polygenis odiosus" was found on an "Oryzomys couesi" from Cozumel. Out of ten "O.ÃÂ couesi" in San Luis PotosÃÂ­, five each were contaminated by the nematode worms "Hassalstrongylus musculi" and "H.ÃÂ bocqueti", with around 25 worms for every rodent, and two were tainted by a couple of cestodes of the class "Raillietina". The vermin "Eubrachylaelaps circularis" and "Gigantolaelaps boneti" have been found on "Oryzomys couesi" in Oaxaca, the sucking mite "Hoplopleura oryzomydis" in Nicaragua, the parasites "Laelaps oryzomydis", "Echinonyssus microchelae", "Ornithonyssus bacoti", "Prolistrophorus frontalis", and "Prolistrophorus bakeri" in Colima, and the apicomplexan "Eimeria couesii" in Mexico. The species is tainted by two hantavirusesÃ¢ÂÂCatacamas infection in Honduras and Playa de Oro infection in western MexicoÃ¢ÂÂwhich are identified with the Bayou infection contaminating the bog rice rodent, a typical reason for hantavirus diseases in the United States. No hantavirus contaminations in people have been connected to "O.ÃÂ couesi" hantaviruses, be that as it may. Chiapas "O.ÃÂ couesi" effectively endure trial contamination with a few arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis infection, recommending that the species may fill in as a supply for that infection.
