The name "Ganesha" is a Sanskrit compound, joining the words "gana" (), meaning a group, multitude, or categorical system and "isha" (), meaning lord or master. The word "gaá¹a" when associated with Ganesha is often taken to refer to the gaá¹as, a troop of semi-divine beings that form part of the retinue of Shiva, Ganesha's father. The term more generally means a category, class, community, association, or corporation. Some commentators interpret the name "Lord of the " to mean "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord of created categories", such as the elements. "Ganapati" (; ), a synonym for "Ganesha", is a compound composed of ', meaning "group", and ', meaning "ruler" or "lord". Though the earliest mention of the word "Ganapati" is found in hymn 2.23.1 of the 2nd-millennium BCE "Rigveda", it is however uncertain that the Vedic term referred specifically to Ganesha. The "Amarakosha", an early Sanskrit lexicon, lists eight synonyms of "Ganesha": "Vinayaka", ' (equivalent to "Vighnesha"), ' (one who has two mothers), ' (equivalent to "Ganapati" and "Ganesha"), "Ekadanta" (one who has one tusk), "Heramba", "Lambodara" (one who has a pot belly, or, literally, one who has a hanging belly), and "Gajanana" (""); having the face of an elephant.
