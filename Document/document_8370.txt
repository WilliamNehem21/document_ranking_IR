Just the back piece of the skull is protected. It likely demonstrated a horselike, expansive nose outfitted with pencil-like teeth, as observed in related sauropods for which progressively total skulls are known. As in different dicraeosaurids, the (nostril opening) was arranged in the back portion of the skull, corner to corner over the (educational), which was relatively huge. As in most different dinosaurs, the skull highlighted three extra openings (fenestrae). The , situated beneath the circle, was long and slender. Behind the circle was the , which in dicraeosaurids was particularly little and can be seen when the skull is seen from the side. This appears differently in relation to other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were coordinated upwards, along these lines being obvious just in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been situated before the enlightening, in spite of the fact that this locale isn't protected. An irregular component were little openings seen on the posterior of the skull, the alleged parietal openings or fontanelles. In different tetrapods, these openings are typically observed just in adolescents and would close as the individual develops. Skull highlights imparted to "Dicraeosaurus" however missing in most different sauropods incorporated the melded and the strikingly long , hard augmentations interfacing the with the .
