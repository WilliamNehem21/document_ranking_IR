Ratings for "Blue's Clues" were high during its first season, and it was Nickelodeon's most popular preschool program. It has been described as the first commercial television show for preschoolers that was both educational and profitable. Its creators met regularly with businesses that developed "Blue's Clues" merchandise and products to ensure toys that were educational and met "the same highÂ ... standards as the show." Products, like the show, were heavily tested prior to marketing. "Blue's Clues" had sold almost 40 million units of its 45 VHS and DVD titles by 1998 and generated over $1 billion in product licensing in 2000. More than ten million "Blue's Clues" books were in print by 2001 and over three million copies of six CD-ROM titles based on the show had been sold. Seven "Blue's Clues" titles sold at least 1 million copies each. The show's first direct-to-video production was "Blue's Big Musical Movie" (2000), featuring Ray Charles and The Persuasions; it received mostly positive reviews and has sold over 3 million copies since 2006. The launch of "Blue's Clues" products at FAO Schwarz's flagship store in New York City was the most successful product launch in the store's history and was attended by over 7,000 people. By 2002, "Blue's Clues" had received several awards for children's programming, educational software, and licensing and been nominated for nine Emmy Awards. It also won a Peabody Award in 2001.
