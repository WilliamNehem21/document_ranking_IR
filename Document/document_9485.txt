By 1957, the DRR was getting to be overpowered by regularly expanding groups; Disney verified that a third train was required. Rather than having another train worked without any preparation to pull the train, Disney trusted that expenses could be spared by obtaining and reestablishing an effectively existing thin measure steam train, and the activity of discovering one was given to Roger Broggie. With the help of Gerald Best, an appropriate train was found in Louisiana; it had been worked by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894, had recently been utilized as a switcher at a sugar stick plant in Louisiana possessed by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was at first utilized by the Lafourche, Raceland and Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its buy, the train was conveyed to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where rebuilding work started, which included introducing another kettle worked by Dixon Boiler Works and having its firebox reconfigured to consume diesel oil for fuel to create steam. This train turned into the DRR's No. 3 train and it went into administration on March 28, 1958, at an expense after rebuilding of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 train when it went into administration were five new outside Narragansett-style outing vehicles with forward looking seat seating all things considered alluded to by Disneyland workers as the "Trip Train", which was planned by Bob Gurr and worked at Walt Disney Studios.
