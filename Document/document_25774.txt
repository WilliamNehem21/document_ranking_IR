Critics often praised the performances by Swank and Sevigny; Peter Travers said the pair "give performances that burn in the memory", and The Film Stage termed Swank's performance "one of the greatest" Best Actress Oscar-winning performances. Peter Stack of the "San Francisco Chronicle" lauded the lead acting performances of Swank, Sevigny, Saarsgard, and Sexton III, writing, "It may be the best-acted film of the year". Online film reviewer James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four; he highlighted the performances of Swank and Sevigny as the film's greatest success and likened the film's intensity to that of a train wreck. Berardinelli wrote that Swank "gives the performance of her career" and that "Sevigny's performance is more conventional than Swank's, but no less effective. She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film." Emanuel Levy of "Variety" called the acting "flawless" and concluded that the "stunningly accomplished" and "candid" film could be "seen as a "Rebel Without a Cause" for these culturally diverse and complex times, with the two misfits enacting a version of the James DeanâNatalie Wood romance with utmost conviction, searching, like their '50s counterparts, for love, self-worth and a place to call home". Stephen Hunter of "The Washington Post" said the performances are of such "luminous humanity that they break your heart". "Premiere" listed Swank's performance as one of the "100 Greatest Performances of All Time". Owen Gleiberman of "Entertainment Weekly" called Swank a "revelation" and wrote, "by the end, her Brandon/Teena is beyond male or female. It's as if we were simply glimpsing the character's soul, in all its yearning and conflicted beauty."
