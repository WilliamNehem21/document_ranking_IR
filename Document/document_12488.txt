Inside the contemporary American abstract scene Griswold ended up known as flighty, narrow minded, pompous, and malevolent. As history specialist Perry Miller expressed, "Griswold was about as underhanded as they came in this time of mischief; did not adequate documentation demonstrate that he really existed, we may assume himÃÂ ... one of the less conceivable creations of Charles Dickens". Later compilations, for example, "Exposition Writers of America" and "Female Poets of America" helped him become known as an abstract tyrant, whose endorsement authors looked for even while they dreaded his developing force. Indeed, even as they endeavored to awe him, be that as it may, a few creators voiced their assessment on Griswold's character. Ann S. Stephens called him untrustworthy and "naturally unequipped for talking reality". Indeed, even his companions knew him as a quintessential liar and had a truism: "Is that a Griswold or a reality?" Another companion once called him "a standout amongst the most touchy and pernicious men I at any point met". Writer Cornelius Mathews wrote in 1847 that Griswold looked for journalists to abuse, cautioning "the poor minimal honest fishes" to maintain a strategic distance from his "Griswold Hook". An audit of one of Griswold's collections, distributed namelessly in the Philadelphia "Saturday Museum" on January 28, 1843, however accepted to have been composed by Poe, asked: "What will be [Griswold's] destiny? Overlooked, spare just by those whom he has harmed and offended, he will sink into blankness, without leaving a milestone to tell that he once existed; or on the off chance that he is discussed from now on, he will be cited as the unfaithful worker who manhandled his trust."
