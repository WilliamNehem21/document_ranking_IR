After "Sunday Night Heat", the pay-per-view event began with a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. The champions, La RÃ©sistance (RenÃ© DuprÃ©e and Sylvain Grenier), defended their titles against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when they executed a 3D on DuprÃ©e. As D-Von covered DuprÃ©e, Rob Conway, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee was distracted. DuprÃ©e then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship.
The following match pitted The Undertaker against A-Train in a standard match. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively before The Undertaker gained the advantage. He attempted to lift A-Train for a Tombstone piledriver. A-Train countered it, in the process knocking the referee down. He attempted to take advantage of the situation by trying to hit The Undertaker with a steel chair. The Undertaker, however, countered the attack with his boot, causing the chair to hit A-Train in the face. The Undertaker then chokeslammed A-Train and, since the referee had recuperated, covered his opponent for the pinfall. After the match, Sable tried to seduce Undertaker, but was grabbed by the throat and then was attacked by a returning Stephanie McMahon.
