On 26 and 27 May 1971 Scott recounted to his story to Hooson and David Steel, the Liberals' main whip. Nor was completely persuaded, yet felt the issue justified further examination. Against Thorpe's desires, a private gathering enquiry was masterminded 9 June, to be led by Lord Byers, the pioneer of the Liberals in the House of Lords. At the enquiry Byers took an extreme line against Scott, neglecting to offer him a seat and treating him, Scott stated, "similar to a kid at school up before the superintendent." Byers' unsympathetic way immediately agitated Scott, who changed the subtleties of his story a few times and habitually separated in tears. Byers proposed that Scott was a typical blackmailer who required mental help. Announcing that Byers was a "pontificating old grass", Scott fled the room. The enquiry at that point examined cops regarding letters which Scott had appeared to the police in 1962, yet were informed that these were uncertain. Thorpe induced the Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling, and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, John Waldron, to educate Byers that there was no police enthusiasm for Thorpe's exercises, and no proof of bad behavior on his part. Thus, the enquiry expelled Scott's charges.
