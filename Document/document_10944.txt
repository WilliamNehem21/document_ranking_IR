Dating Lindow Man is tricky as tests from the body and encompassing peat have created dates spreading over a 900-year time frame. In spite of the fact that the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300ÃÂ BC, Lindow Man himself has an alternate date. Early tests at various labs returned clashing dates for the body; later tests proposed a date somewhere in the range of 2ÃÂ BC and 119ÃÂ AD. There has been a propensity to credit the body to the Iron Age time frame as opposed to Roman because of the elucidation that Lindow Man's passing may have been a custom penance or execution. Clarifications for why the peat in which he was found is a lot more seasoned have been looked for. Excavator P.ÃÂ C.ÃÂ Buckland recommends that as the stratigraphy of the peat seems undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been stored into a pool that was at that point some 300ÃÂ years old. Geographer K.ÃÂ E.ÃÂ Barber has contended against this speculation, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been excessively shallow, and recommends that the peat may have been stripped back to permit the internment and afterward supplanted, leaving the stratigraphy evidently undisturbed.
