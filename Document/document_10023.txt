Toward the beginning of July 1955, Hensley started a progression of gatherings close Altha, Florida. He directed the gatherings without snakes for three weeks, before securing a snake and conveying it to a Sunday evening administration on July 24. A few dozen individuals accumulated at a deserted smithy search for the recognition. Amid the administration, Hensley noisily conveyed a lesson on the point of confidence. He expelled the snake from the grease can in which it was put away, folded it over his neck, and scoured it all over. He strolled around the crowd while lecturing and afterward restored the snake to the can. As he put the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. Following a couple of minutes, Hensley turned out to be noticeably sick, encountering extreme torment, a stained arm, and hematemesis. He declined restorative consideration, despite the fact that he stayed in agony and was encouraged to look for treatment both by attendees and the Calhoun County Sheriff.
