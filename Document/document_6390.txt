The skeletal reproduction going with the 1908 portrayal reestablished the missing parts in a manner like "Stegosaurus", and Brown compared the outcome to the wiped out protected warm blooded creature "Glyptodon". Rather than current portrayals, Brown's stegosaur-like recreation indicated hearty forelimbs, an unequivocally angled back, a pelvis with prongs anticipating advances from the ilium and pubis, just as a short, hanging tail without a tail club, which was obscure at the time. Dark colored likewise reproduced the protection plates in parallel columns running down the back; this course of action was absolutely theoretical. Darker's reproduction turned out to be profoundly powerful, and rebuilding efforts of the creature dependent on his graph were distributed as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 survey of Brown's "Ankylosaurus" depiction, American scientist Samuel Wendell Williston scrutinized the skeletal reproduction as being founded on too few remains, and guaranteed that "Ankylosaurus" was simply an equivalent word of the variety "Stegopelta", which Williston had named in 1905. Williston likewise expressed that a skeletal reproduction of the related "Polacanthus" by Hungarian scientist Franz Nopcsa was a superior case of how ankylosaurs would have showed up throughout everyday life. The case of synonymy was not acknowledged by different specialists, and the two genera are presently viewed as unmistakable.
