Abolitionist servitude Northerners censured the war as a Southern trick to extend subjugation; Calhoun thusly saw an intrigue of Yankees to wreck the South.

He trusted that in their desire for office, support and riches, government officials in the North pandered to the abolitionist servitude vote, particularly amid presidential crusades, and lawmakers in the slave states yielded Southern rights with an end goal to mollify the Northern wings of their gatherings. Subsequently, the fundamental initial phase in any fruitful declaration of Southern rights must be the casting off of all gathering ties. In 1848Ã¢ÂÂ 49, Calhoun attempted to offer substance to his call for Southern solidarity. He was the main impetus behind the drafting and distribution of the "Address of the Southern Delegates in Congress, to Their Constituents." It claimed Northern infringement of the protected privileges of the South, at that point cautioned Southern voters to anticipate constrained liberation of slaves sooner rather than later, trailed by their total enslavement by an unholy coalition of deceitful Northerners and blacks. Whites would escape and the South would "become the lasting residence issue, rebellion, neediness, hopelessness, and wretchedness." Only the quick and determined solidarity of Southern whites could forestall such a catastrophe. Such solidarity would either convey the North to its faculties or establish the framework for a free South. Yet, the soul of association was as yet solid in the district and less than 40% of the Southern congressmen marked the location, and just a single Whig.
