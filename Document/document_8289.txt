Imamura looked for fortifications for the Admiralties in late 1943 and mid 1944. In October 1943 he mentioned an infantry division for the islands, however none was accessible. A consequent proposition to exchange the 66th Regiment from the Palaus, where it was being modified in the wake of enduring substantial misfortunes, to the Admiralties was additionally fruitless as IGHQ trusted that the Eighteenth Army had more noteworthy requirement for this unit. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) additionally dismissed Imamura's proposal that an exceptional maritime landing power unit be dispatched to the islands. IGHQ consented to convey the 66th Regiment to the Admiralties in January 1944 to support the area's guards following the Allied arrivals at Arawe and Saidor in mid-December and early January separately, however this development was dropped after a ship conveying fortifications for the regiment was sunk by with overwhelming death toll on the sixteenth of the month. Following this calamity Imamura guided the 38th Division to dispatch a brigade to the islands, and 750 men of the 2ndÃÂ Battalion, first Independent Mixed Regiment touched base there the evening of 24/25 January. An ensuing endeavor to deliver an infantry and a big guns unit to the Admiralties was baffled by Allied air and submarine assaults, yet 530 warriors of the 38th Division's 1stÃÂ Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment touched base there the evening of 2 February. A large portion of these troop developments were identified by Allied knowledge.
