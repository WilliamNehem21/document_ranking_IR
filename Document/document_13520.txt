By the mid-1970s, transportation had turned into an issue in the north-east rural areas. The number of inhabitants in the Tea Tree Gully locale had expanded from 2,500 of every 1954 to 35,000 by 1971. A passage of land along the River Torrens from Adelaide to Modbury, initially bought for the Modbury Freeway proposed under the MATS plan, was the subject of another proposition in 1973 when the State Director-General of Transport recommended constructing an overwhelming rail line that would interface the suburb to the Adelaide railroad framework. A resulting study, the "North East Adelaide Public Transport Review" (NEAPTR), thought about substantial rail, light rail, busways, and roads, at last reasoning that a light rail line or busway would be generally feasible. The state government chose a light rail proposition to expand the noteworthy Glenelg cable car. The new course was to proceed with King William Street past what was then the end in Victoria Square and weave through the Adelaide Park Lands to the Modbury hall. The light rail framework would interface with feeder transports at stations along the length of the hallway to exchange travelers to rural courses. New light rail vehicles were to be purchased to supplant the maturing 1929 H type cable cars.
