"Star Trek's" maker, Gene Roddenberry, who employed noteworthy impact in spite of his evil wellbeing, despised the content. Meyer's first gathering with Roddenberry brought about Meyer raging out of the room inside five minutes. Likewise with Meyer's past "Star Trek" film ("The Wrath of Khan"), the content had solid military hints, with a maritime subject present all through. A long way from being glorified, the characters were appeared extremist and defective. As opposed to Roddenberry's vision of things to come, Meyer thought there was no proof that bias would vanish by the 23rd century. At the point when Roddenberry dissented about the maligning of Saavik, Meyer answered that "I made Saavik. She was not Gene's. In the event that he doesn't care for what I plan on doing with her, perhaps he should give back the cash he's made off my movies. Perhaps then I'll mind what he needs to state." After the stormy first gathering, a gathering including Meyer, Roddenberry, and maker Ralph Winter talked about the updated draft. Roddenberry would voice his objection to components of the content line by line, and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. In general, the tone of the gathering was appeasing, yet the makers at last disregarded a large number of Roddenberry's worries. By February 13, 1991, the film was authoritatively put into generation with the understanding it would be in theaters before the year's over.
