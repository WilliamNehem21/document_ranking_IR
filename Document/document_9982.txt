At the point when Longacre finished the twofold hawk bites the dust, they were dismissed by Peale, who expressed that the plan was engraved also profoundly to completely awe the coin, and the pieces would not stack appropriately. Taxay, notwithstanding, noticed that the one enduring 1849 twofold hawk shows no such issues, and by appearance would be level in a stack. Peale whined to Patterson, who kept in touch with Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith requesting Longacre's evacuation on December 25, 1849, on the ground he couldn't make legitimate bites the dust. Patterson that day guaranteed the situation to etcher Charles Cushing Wright, viable when Longacre was expelled. Meredith addressed whether an equipped substitution could be found; Patterson guaranteed him that one could. Longacre protested Patterson that Peale was deferring acknowledgment of amended twofold bird kicks the bucket, the executive did not answer recorded as a hard copy, yet met with Longacre, disclosed to him the organization had chosen to end him, and that he ought to send in his abdication immediately. Longacre, in the wake of reasoning the issue over, did not do as such, yet rather went to Washington on February 12, 1850, to meet with Meredith. He found that the secretary had been misled about various issues. As indicated by Snow, Longacre did not look for requital, substance to be permitted to proceed with his work in harmony. The twofold falcon went into creation in March 1850, however Patterson griped that the coins did not strike well. The twofold hawk rapidly turned into the favored method to hold gold, and in the years to come progressively gold would be struck into twofold birds than into every single other group joined.
