Albeit some morphological contrasts between the two fossa species have been portrayed, these might be allometric (development related), and in their 1986 "Mammalian Species" record of the fossa, Michael KÃÂ¶hncke and Klaus Leonhardt composed that the two were morphologically indistinguishable. Be that as it may, stays of "C.ÃÂ spelea" are bigger than any living "C.ÃÂ ferox". Goodman and partners found that skull estimations in examples they recognized as "C.ÃÂ spelea" were 1.07 to 1.32 occasions as vast as in grown-up "C.ÃÂ ferox", and postcranial estimations were 1.19 to 1.37 occasions as expansive. The main example of "C.ÃÂ spelea" in which condylobasal length (a proportion of all out skull length) could be found out estimated 153.4ÃÂ mm (6.04ÃÂ in), contrasted with a scope of 114.5 to 133.3ÃÂ mm (4.51 to 5.25ÃÂ in) in grown-up "C.ÃÂ ferox". Humerus (upper arm bone) length in twelve "C.ÃÂ spelea" is 122.7 to 146.8ÃÂ mm (4.83 to 5.78ÃÂ in), averaging 137.9ÃÂ mm (5.43ÃÂ in), contrasted with 108.5 to 127.5ÃÂ mm (4.27 to 5.02ÃÂ in), averaging 116.1ÃÂ mm (4.57ÃÂ in), in the surviving fossa. Weight gauges for "C.ÃÂ spelea" extend from 17ÃÂ kg (37ÃÂ lb) to 20ÃÂ kg (44ÃÂ lb), and it was among the biggest carnivores of the island. By examination, grown-up "C.ÃÂ ferox" go from 5ÃÂ kg (11ÃÂ lb) to 10ÃÂ kg (22ÃÂ lb).
