Different classifiers often correspond to different particular nouns. For example, books generally take the classifier Â "bÄn", flat objects take Â ()Â "zhÄng", animals take Â ()Â "zhÄ«", machines take Â "tÃ¡i", large buildings and mountains take Â "zuÃ²", etc. Within these categories are further subdivisionsâwhile most animals take Â ()Â "zhÄ«", domestic animals take Â ()Â "tÃ³u", long and flexible animals take Â ()Â "tiÃ¡o", and horses take Â "pÇ". Likewise, while long things that are flexible (such as ropes) often take Â ()Â "tiÃ¡o", long things that are rigid (such as sticks) take Â "gÄn", unless they are also round (like pens or cigarettes), in which case in some dialects they take Â "zhÄ«". Classifiers also vary in how specific they are; some (such as Â "duÇ" for flowers and other similarly clustered items) are generally only used with one type, whereas others (such as Â ()Â "tiÃ¡o" for long and flexible things, one-dimensional things, or abstract items like news reports) are much less restricted. Furthermore, there is not a one-to-one relationship between nouns and classifiers: the same noun may be paired with different classifiers in different situations. The specific factors that govern which classifiers are paired with which nouns have been a subject of debate among linguists.
