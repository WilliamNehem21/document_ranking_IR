On board "Bird of prey", Scott and Irwin arranged for fueled drop inception (PDI), the consume that was to put them on the lunar surface, and, after Mission Control gave them authorization, they started PDI at 104:30:09.4 at a height of , somewhat higher than arranged. Amid the initial segment of the plunge, "Bird of prey" was adjusted so the space explorers were on their backs and in this manner couldn't see the lunar surface beneath them, however after the art made a pitchover move, they were upstanding and could see the surface before them. Scott, who as authority played out the arrival, was defied with a scene that did not at first appear to look like what he had seen amid recreations. Some portion of this was because of a mistake in the arrival way of some , of which CAPCOM Ed Mitchell educated the group before pitchover; part in light of the fact that the holes Scott had depended on in the test system were hard to make out under lunar conditions, and he at first couldn't see Hadley Rille. He inferred that they were probably going to overshoot the arranged landing site, and, when he could see the rille, began moving the vehicle to move the PC's arrival focus back towards the arranged spot, and searched for a generally smooth spot to arrive.
