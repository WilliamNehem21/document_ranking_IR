The first new interchange opened at Dixie Road in 1953, beginning a seven-year program to make the HamiltonâToronto section into a full-fledged freeway.
Over the next three years, the route was improved west to HighwayÂ 10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. Service roads were installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the accident rate along that section.
In Toronto, work began in 1955 to construct the Gardiner Expressway, which would tie in with the end of the QEW. The first section of the Gardiner, connecting the QEW to Jameson Avenue, was officially opened by Mayor Fred Gardiner and Premier Leslie Frost on AugustÂ 8, 1958.
Work was also underway on the Toronto Bypass, involving the upgrade of HighwayÂ 27 to a freeway between the QEW and the new HighwayÂ 401. Construction began in 1953,
and included an upgrade of the cloverleaf interchange with the QEW with larger loop ramps. This interchange would become one of the worst bottlenecks in the province a decade after its completion, according to Highways Minister Charles MacNaughton.
On SeptemberÂ 11, 1957, construction began to widen the QEW to six lanes between HighwayÂ 27 and the Humber River. It was completed by December 1958,
as were interchanges with Mississauga Road and Kerr Street.
Service roads allowed engineers to separate local access from the highway and avoid space-consuming interchanges in many places. Therefore, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then HighwayÂ 25), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then HighwayÂ 122), Southdown Road (now Erin Mills Parkway north of the interchange), Mississauga Road, Hurontario Street (then HighwayÂ 10), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and HighwayÂ 27.
