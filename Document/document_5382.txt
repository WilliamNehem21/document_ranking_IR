Running somewhat north of and parallel to U.S. Highway 30 (Sandy Boulevard), the bog streams by Zimmerman Heritage Farm on the left bank (south) about from the mouth, Big Four Corners Wetlands on the correct bank presently, and gets Wilkes Creek on the left soon after that. At about stream mile (RM)ÃÂ 15.5 or waterway kilometer (RK)ÃÂ 24.9, it goes through a gated levee that isolates the upper swamp from the center bog. Before long it passes Prison Pond Wetlands close Inverness Jail and interfaces with Johnson Lake Slough, all on the left. Presently, it streams under Interstate 205. From here and for the majority of the remainder of its course, the bog runs parallel to and marginally north of Columbia Boulevard. Passing Johnson Lake on the left, it crosses the Colwood National Golf Course and streams by Portland International Airport and an Oregon Air National Guard base on the right. On the left is Whitaker Ponds Natural Area. Presently, it gets Whitaker Slough on the left and crosses the Broadmoor Golf Course. Between from the mouth, it gets Buffalo Slough from the left and goes by the dead Peninsula Drainage Canal (City Canal), which deceives the bog's correct. Now, it goes during a time gated levee that isolates the center quagmire from the lower bog and its tidal stream inversions.
