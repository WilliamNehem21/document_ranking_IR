In 2013, Hoult had starring roles in two major films; he first played a zombie named R in Jonathan Levine's romantic comedy "Warm Bodies", which was released on 1 February. An adaptation of Isaac Marion's novel of the same name, the film is presented from point of view of the central character, mostly through narration. Levine said he had difficulties finding a suitable actor to play R until he met Hoult, who was attracted to the projectâwhich he described as "much more than a horror movie" owing to the use of multiple pop culture and literary allusionsâand even more so to the role which "bowled [me] over". Hoult said he drew inspiration from "Edward Scissorhands" (1990) because he thought the central characters in both films share the same difficulties. To prepare for the role of a zombie, Hoult and the other actors practiced with Cirque du Soleil performers; he said of the experience; "we would take our shoes off in a dance studioÂ ... kind of grow out of the wall and make our bodies feel very heavy". The film garnered positive response from critics and audiences. Ben Kendrick praised Hoult for the restraint in a potentially Razzie-worthy role: "[he] brings a lot of life to R without stepping too far in the other direction [and although his] zombie mannerisms may come across a bit forced but, overall, his memorable moments outnumber (and outweigh) the awkward ones" Hoult was also described as "an extremely appealing actor, [who] is charm personified" in his role of the living-dead.
