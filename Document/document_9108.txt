The Montreal group in Canada relied upon the Americans for substantial water from the US overwhelming water plant in Trail, British Columbia, which was under American contract, and for specialized data about plutonium. The Americans said that they would supply overwhelming water to the Montreal bunch just on the off chance that it consented to coordinate its exploration along the constrained lines proposed by du Pont, its principle contractual worker for reactor development. Regardless of doing much good work, by June 1943 the Montreal Laboratory had arrived at a total halt. Resolve was low and the Canadian Government proposed dropping the venture. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington concurred that Canada would manufacture a substantial water reactor. The Americans consented to help the venture with data and visits, and to supply materials, including fundamental uranium and overwhelming water. The Montreal Laboratory would be offered access to information from the Metallurgical Laboratory's examination reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, yet not from the generation reactors at the Hanford Site; nor was it to be given any data about the science of plutonium, or techniques for isolating it from different components. This game plan was formally affirmed by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. John Cockcroft turned into the chief of the Montreal Laboratory. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was shut. The task built up the ZEEP reactor, which went basic in September 1945.
