Skelton was conveying a serious act live every week, and the strain appeared in physical sickness. In 1952, he was drinking vigorously from the steady torment of a diaphragmatic hernia and conjugal issues; he contemplated separating from Georgia. NBC consented to film his shows in the 1952Ã¢ÂÂ 1953 season at Eagle Lion Studios, alongside the Sam Goldwyn Studio, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. Later the show was moved to the new NBC TV studios in Burbank. Procter and Gamble was discontent with the shooting of the TV program, and demanded that Skelton come back to live communicates. The circumstance made him consider leaving TV by then. Declining appraisals incited support Procter and Gamble to drop his show in the spring of 1953, with Skelton declaring that any future TV programs of his eventual theatrical presentations, where he would not have the practically consistent weight of performing. Starting with the 1953Ã¢ÂÂ 1954 season, he changed to CBS, where he stayed until 1970. For the underlying move to CBS, he had no support. The system bet by covering all costs for the program on a continuing premise; his first CBS support was Geritol. He abridged his drinking and his appraisals at CBS started to improve, particularly after he started showing up on Tuesday evenings for co-supports Johnson's Wax and Pet Milk Company.
