Around 1755, Howe captained a state army organization in Bladen County, and was selected an equity of the harmony for that district in 1756. Howe was chosen to the frontier Assembly from Bladen County in 1760 and served until 1762. In 1764, the Assembly made Brunswick County, and Howe was both selected its equity of the harmony and re-chose to the Assembly from the new region. Howe would be re-chosen six additional occasions from Brunswick County. In 1765, Howe worked with other pilgrim pioneers, for example, Hugh Waddell, Abner Nash, and Cornelius Harnett to establish the Wilmington Sons of Liberty association, which was dynamic in dissenting the Stamp Act 1765 that saddled most pieces of literature. At the time, the individuals from the Sons of Liberty did not believe their protection from be insubordination, as it depended on the possibility that administration authorities who performed acts contrary to the desire of the general population were not acting with full specialist. After the goals of the Stamp Act Crisis, Howe was made an officer of the common exchequer. Notwithstanding the Cape Fear River zone being the epicenter of Stamp Act challenges in North Carolina, Howe took no generous part in the dynamic encounters with Governor William Tryon, due in expansive part to their own fellowship and the support given by the Governor to Howe's political aspirations.
