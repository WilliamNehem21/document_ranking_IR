To turn into the character of Emperor Akbar, Prithviraj Kapoor was accounted for to have "depended totally on the content and chief". Before make-up, Kapoor would pronounce, ""Prithviraj Kapoor abdominal muscle jaa rahaa hai"" ("Prithviraj Kapoor is currently going"); after make-up, he would declare, ""Akbar stomach muscle aa rahaa hai"" ("Akbar is presently coming"). Kapoor confronted trouble with his substantial ensembles, and endured rankles on his feet in the wake of strolling shoeless in the desert for a grouping. Spear Dane, a picture taker who was on set amid the recording, reviewed that Kapoor attempted to recall his lines in certain scenes; he referenced one scene specifically that Kapoor required 19 takes to get right. At the season of recording, Kapoor who was on an eating routine, was advised by Asif to recapture the shed pounds for his depiction of Akbar. Durga Khote was given a role as Akbar's significant other Jodhabai, and Nigar Sultana as the artist Bahar. Zakir Hussain, who later turned into a "tabla" maestro, had at first been considered for the piece of the youthful Prince Salim, yet it turned into the presentation job of Jalal Agha, who later performed on the tune "Mehbooba" from "Sholay" (1975).
