In an interview for "Complex", BeyoncÃ© expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio. She intended "4" to help change that status, commenting, "Figuring out a way to get R&B back on the radio is challengingÂ ... With "4", I tried to mix R&B from the '70s and the '90s with rock 'n' roll and a lot of horns to create something new and exciting. I wanted musical changes, bridges, vibrata, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." On her website she wrote, "The album is definitely an evolution. It's bolder than the music on my previous albums because I'm bolder. The more mature I become and the more life experiences I have, the more I have to talk about. I really focused on songs being classics, songs that would last, songs that I could sing when I'm 40 and when I'm 60." BeyoncÃ© also sought to make more artistic music, rather than purely commercially oriented songs.
Although much of "4"s inspiration came from "touring, travelling, watching rock bands and attending festivals", the album's early musical direction was influenced by Nigerian Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti, whose passion for music motivated BeyoncÃ©. She worked with the band from "Fela!", the Broadway musical based on Kuti's life. DJ Swivel, one of "4"s engineers, later described how Kuti's use of percussion and horns influenced the track "End of Time". In 2015, The-Dream revealed that he and BeyoncÃ© had composed a whole album based on Kuti's music, although this was scrapped in favor of creating "4", therefore explaining how "End of Time" became so heavily influenced.
