Josef Neumann said he had been drawn closer by an obscure SS manÃ¢ÂÂmost likely PestekÃ¢ÂÂwith an idea of getaway. Before they could authorize their arrangements, the alert was raised and numerous SS monitors arrived. Neumann and Pestek were gotten, bound together, and diverted; both were investigated and tormented at Block 11. SS watch Stefan Baretzki, who knew Pestek very much, affirmed that Pestek had been captured at Birkenau. Baretzki said he had seen different SS monitors beating Pestek. Ryszard Henryk Kordek, a detainee, said that Baretzki had raised the alert over Pestek's arrival and that Baretzki was one of the watchmen who beat Pestek. SS man Perry Broad said he heard kapos boasting about pursuing and getting Pestek in woods around the camp. KÃÂ¡rnÃÂ½ theorizes that Pestek, acknowledging he had been perceived, surrendered his arrangements to spare RenÃÂ©e Neumann and her mom, and in this manner made the idea to Josef Neumann. Pestek was condemned to death by terminating squad in Kattowitz for favoring detainees and abandonment. He was executed in MiÃÂdzybrodzie Bialskie on 8 October 1944 at 7:04. Individuals from Pestek's unit announced being requested to observe the shooting. Amid the second liquidation of the family camp in July 1944, Neumann and her mom were chosen for constrained work in the Hamburg zone. Both endure the war.
