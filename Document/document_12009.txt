As one of Seijun Suzuki's most persuasive movies, "Marked to Kill" has been recognized as a wellspring of motivation by such universally famous chiefs as Hong Kong's John Woo, South Korea's Chan-wook Park and America's Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino. Jarmusch recorded it as his most loved contract killer film, nearby "Le SamouraÃÂ¯" (additionally 1967), and expressed gratitude toward Suzuki in the screen credits of his own assassin film "" (1999). Most eminently, Jarmusch reflected a scene in which the hero executes an objective by shooting up from a storm cellar through a sink channel. He ventured to such an extreme as to screen the film for Suzuki when the two met in Tokyo. Faultfinders have noted "Marked to Kill's" effect on the movies of Wong Kar-wai, for example, his contract killer film "Fallen Angels" (1995), just as Johnnie To's "Fulltime Killer" (2001). In any case, "Marked to Kill" was most powerful in its local Japan. The film's reason, in which hired gunmen attempt to murder each other in rivalry for the Number One position, is parodied in movies, for example, Takeshi Kitano's "Getting Any?" (1995) and Sabu's "Mailman Blues" (1997), which includes a character named Hitman Joe. "Marked to Kill" assumed a job in the improvement of the long-running Lupin III establishment. It likewise had a significant effect, through Suzuki's terminating and the subsequent understudy uprising, in the beginnings of the development film, typically underground or insurrectionary movies which concentrated on issues of import to gatherings of people, rather than generation line classification pictures.
