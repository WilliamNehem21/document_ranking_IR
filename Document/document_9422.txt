In the US, the film was not expose to any control whatsoever, and was discharged for all intents and purposes flawless to AIP's standard blend of drive-ins and grindhouses. Be that as it may, trying to interface the film with Roger Corman's prior Edgar Allan Poe arrangement of movies, it was retitled "The Conqueror Worm". Brief introduction and epilog portrayals (by Price) taken from Poe's lyric were added to legitimize the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his "Clique Movies" book, the movie went almost unnoticed by pundits amid its US discharge: "The few napping exchange analysts who saw it regarded it as simply one more section in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe seriesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ¦ and gave it such dreary notification that future appointments were rare." "Hollywood Citizen News" was dismayed by the movie: "A disrespect to the makers and scripters, and a miserable analysis on the craft of filmmakingÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ¦ a movie with such inhuman fierceness and orgiastic perversion, one thinks about how it at any point passed traditions to be discharged in this nation." The exchange diary "Film industry" noticed that: "Devotees of the blood and guts movie will be happy to realize that Vincent Price has returned to add another representation to his display of curve fiendsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ¦ washed in the most stomach-beating gore imaginableÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ¦ " "Assortment" opined that "Dwyer gives proof of acting ability, yet she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves' unremarkable content and normal course." Despite the absence of basic help, the motion picture was an unassuming achievement stateside, procuring $1.5 million for AIP as indicated by "Cinefantastique" magazine. In his life story of Reeves, Benjamin Halligan claims the film made $10 million in the US.
