As Lupton brings up, the majority of Angelou's life accounts, particularly "Confined Bird" and its prompt spin-off "Assemble in My Name", are "especially worried about what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it". Lupton contrasts Angelou's casual training and the training of other Black journalists of the twentieth century, who did not gain official degrees and relied on the "immediate guidance of African American social structures". Angelou's mission for learning and proficiency parallels "the focal legend of dark culture in America": that opportunity and education are associated. Angelou is affected by journalists acquainted with her by Mrs. Blooms amid her deliberate muteness, including Edgar Allan Poe and William Shakespeare. Angelou states, right on time in "Confined Bird", that she, as the Maya character, "met and began to look all starry eyed at William Shakespeare". Commentator Mary Vermillion sees an association between Maya's assault and Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece", which Maya remembers and presents when she recaptures her discourse. Vermillion keeps up that Maya discovers comfort in the sonnet's relationship with misery. Maya discovers books and their characters total and important, so she utilizes them to understand her dazing world. She is so engaged with her dreamland of books that she even uses them as an approach to adapt to her assault, writing in "Confined Bird", "...I was certain that any moment my mom or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the entryway and spare me".
