"Suillus pungens" is portrayed by the particular shading changes that happen in the top as it creates. The scope of shading variety makes it conceivable to misidentify the species with others whose shading covers. "Suillus pungens" has been misidentified as "S.ÃÂ placidus" due to the white shade of the youthful organic product bodies and the beads of exudate. "S.ÃÂ placidus" has a more extensive conveyance, is typically found in relationship with eastern white pine, is commonly littler, with a greatest top measurement up to , and has littler spores, estimating 7Ã¢ÂÂ 9 by 2.5Ã¢ÂÂ 3.2ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. It doesn't have any particular taste or scent. North American "S.ÃÂ granulatus" is another potential clone species, and at development it is about indistinguishable to "Suillus pungens". The top of "S. granulatus" is variable in shading, extending from light yellow to different shades of dark colored, while the pore surface is at first whitish, later getting to be yellowish, and like "S. placidus", its regular host is eastern white pine. Not at all like "S.ÃÂ pungens", it comes up short on a trademark smell and taste. The Californian species "Suillus glandulosipes" has cover material connected to the edge of the top when youthful. It likewise comes up short on the unmistakable changes in top shading amid advancement, is related with lodgepole pine, has littler spores (6.6Ã¢ÂÂ 8.8 by 2.5Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m), and does not have any conspicuous taste and scent. Another Californian species, "Suillus quiescens", recently portrayed in 2010, may take after "S.ÃÂ pungens", particularly at development. "S.ÃÂ quiescens" can be recognized by its absence of white or olive hues when youthful and by a less glandular stipe when develop.
