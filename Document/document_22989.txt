On April 12, 1985, Nashville competed in an exhibition game against their major league affiliate, the Detroit Tigers. Manager Sparky Anderson's Detroit club included Kirk Gibson, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Rusty Kuntz, Milt Wilcox, and Larry Herndon. Trailing 2â0 after the first inning, Detroit scored three runs in the top of the fifth on a trio of Sounds errors and a single, but Nashville tied the game with a Pedro Chavez RBI double in the bottom half. In the end, the Tigers outlasted the Sounds, scoring six runs in the tenth inning to defeat Nashville, 9â3, before a crowd of 16,182. On April 23, 1990, 14,012Â fans attended an exhibition game at Greer between Nashville and their new affiliate, the Cincinnati Reds. Reds pitchers Danny Jackson and Ron Robinson held the Sounds to just five hits, three by Terry McGriff and two by Keith Lockhart. Luis QuiÃ±ones scored the winning run in the first when he came home on a misplayed ball hit on the ground by Paul O'Neill. Lou Piniella's Cincinnati squad shutout Nashville, 3â0. An April 3, 1994, game was scheduled between the Sounds and Chicago White Sox, but cancelled due to wet grounds and the fear of player injury, especially to top White Sox stars Tim Raines and Ozzie GuillÃ©n who were slotted to play.
