Frogs extend in size from the as of late found "Paedophryne amauensis" of Papua New Guinea to the goliath frog ("Conraua goliath") of Cameroon. The skin hangs freely on the body as a result of the absence of free connective tissue. Frogs have three eyelid layers: one is straightforward to secure the eyes submerged, and two differ from translucent to hazy. They have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is engaged with hearing and, in certain species, is secured by skin. Genuine amphibians totally need teeth, however most frogs have them, explicitly pedicellate teeth in which the crown is isolated from the root by sinewy tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are likewise on the top of their mouths. No teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs for the most part gulp down their sustenance. The teeth are basically used to grasp the prey and keep it set up till gulped, a procedure helped by withdrawing the eyes into the head. The African bullfrog ("Pyxicephalus"), which preys on moderately huge creatures, for example, mice and different frogs, has cone molded hard projections called odontoid forms at the front of the lower jaw which work like teeth.
