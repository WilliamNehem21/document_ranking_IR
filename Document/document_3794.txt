The Weald Clay Formation comprises of residue of Hauterivian (Lower Weald Clay) to Barremian (Upper Weald Clay) age, about 130Ã¢ÂÂ 125 million years of age. The "B.ÃÂ walkeri" holotype was found in the last mentioned, in dirt speaking to non-marine still water, which has been translated as a fluvial or mudflat condition with shallow water, tidal ponds, and swamps. Amid the Early Cretaceous, the Weald territory of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent was incompletely secured by the huge, new to-saline water Wealden Lake. Two huge waterways depleted the northern region (where London currently stands), streaming into the lake through a stream delta; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its atmosphere was sub-tropical, like the present Mediterranean locale. Since the Smokejacks Pit comprises of various stratigraphic levels, fossil taxa found there are not really contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the region incorporate the ornithopods "Mantellisaurus", "Iguanodon", and little sauropods. Different vertebrates from the Weald Clay incorporate crocodiles, pterosaurs, reptiles, (for example, "Dorsetisaurus"), creatures of land and water, sharks, (for example, "Hybodus"), and hard fishes (counting "Scheenstia"). Individuals from ten requests of bugs have been distinguished, including "Valditermes", "Archisphex", and "Pterinoblattina". Different spineless creatures incorporate ostracods, isopods, conchostracans, and bivalves. The plants "Weichselia" and the sea-going, herbaceous "Bevhalstia" were normal. Different plants discovered incorporate greeneries, horsetails, club greeneries, and conifers.
