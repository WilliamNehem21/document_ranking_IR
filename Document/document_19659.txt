The PanzerÂ I's design history can be traced to the British Carden Loyd tankette, of which it borrowed much of its track and suspension design. After six prototype "Kleintraktor" were produced the cover name was changed to "Krupp-Traktor" whereas the development codename was changed to "Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper" (LaÂ S) (Agricultural Tractor). The LaÂ S was intended not just to train Germany's panzer troops, but to prepare Germany's industry for the mass production of tanks in the near future; a difficult engineering feat for the time. The armament of production versions was to be two 7.92Â mm MG 13 machine guns in a rotating turret. Machine guns were known to be largely useless against even the lightest tank armour of the time, restricting the PanzerÂ I to a training and anti-infantry role by design.
The final official designation, assigned in 1938, was "PanzerkampfwagenÂ I" (M.G.) with special ordnance number "Sd.Kfz. 101". The first 150 tanks (1./LaS, 1st series LaS, Krupp-Traktor), produced in 1934, did not include the rotating turret and were used for crew training. Following these, production was switched to the combat version of the tank. The Ausf.Â A was under-armoured, with steel plate of only 13Â millimeters (0.51Â in) at its thickest. The tank had several design flaws, including suspension problems, which made the vehicle pitch at high velocities, and engine overheating. The driver was positioned inside the chassis and used conventional steering levers to control the tank, while the commander was positioned in the turret where he also acted as gunner. The two crewmen could communicate by means of a voice tube. Machine gun ammunition was stowed in five bins, containing various numbers of 25-round magazines. 1,190 of the Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A were built in three series (2.-4./LaS). Further 25 were built as command tanks."
