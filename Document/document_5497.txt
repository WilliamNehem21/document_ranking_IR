The amusement's attention on feelings was started by Chen, who felt that the main role of stimulation items like computer games was the sentiments that they evoked in the gathering of people, and that the enthusiastic scope of most diversions was constrained. Chen attempted to make the amusement center more around feelings than on a message; he explicitly changed the plan of Flower when early analyzers felt there was a message of advancing environmentally friendly power vitality in the diversion. To make "Blossom" have the "passionate range" that he needed, Chen took a gander at the improvement procedure as making a masterpiece, instead of a "fun" amusement, which would not incite the ideal feelings. He outlined this view by saying that the main interactivity technician is hitting a bloom to trigger another occasion. The group explicitly removed further ongoing interaction components in light of the fact that these would have included "challenge" to the amusement, which, while fun, would not have been unwinding. Sony Santa Monica contracted with Bluepoint Games to make ports of the diversion for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were distributed in November 2013 to compare with the arrival of the PlayStation 4. Annapurna Interactive brought "Blossom" to the iOS stage in September 2017, and to Microsoft Windows in February 2019.
