Waddington loathed the class divisions in English cricket, his emotions fuelled by encounters of officers in the war and conceivably his visit to Australia in 1920Ã¢ÂÂ 21. He completely grasped Yorkshire's hard-edged intensity in the mid 1920s: he scrutinized the choices of umpires and sledged restricting batsmen, the two of which were uncommon at the time. His "Times" eulogy noticed that a few contradictions came in light of the fact that Waddington played to win and was an eager appealer, in spite of the fact that he was probably not going to win numerous interests for leg before wicket due to the edge at which he bowled. Anthony Woodhouse, the cricket student of history, portrays Waddington as a "wild and irresponsibleÃÂ ...ÃÂ quick-tempered person". However, there was another side to his identity; he was a decent talker and gotten a kick out of the chance to wear keen garments, including monogrammed silk shirts. Sutcliffe, a dear companion and colleague of Waddington, called him "a cheerful individual in the changing area; a man with an uncommon identity, verification of which is appeared by the way that at whatever point there was a discourse of any sort in the changing area, Abe for the most part governed it, to all aims and purposes, the administrator." The cricket author Jim Kilburn composed that "getting it done, [Waddington] was a sublimely threatening bowler with a standout amongst the most lovely activities at any point found in cricket, and his pace and crush spirit were an issue for the best of batsmen". The student of history Leslie Duckworth summed him up: "Indeed, a man of temper, Waddington, however a fine cricketer."
