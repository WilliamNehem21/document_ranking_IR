"The Monster and Other Stories" was the last accumulation of Crane's work to be distributed amid his lifetime. In the mid-twentieth century, the novella got a resurgence of basic consideration, particularly as to investigations of race relations in late nineteenth century New York. Pundit Chester L. Wolford composed that the story "uncovers facts not socially acknowledged for practically an additional hundred years. The story is, for sure, an abrasion of social conditions for the blacks, yet more importantÃÂ ... it is an abrasion everything being equal, all social orders, in all spots and all occasions." African-American creator Ralph Ellison called "The Monster", close by Mark Twain's "Undertakings of Huckleberry Finn", "one of the guardians of the advanced American epic". In a 1999 article, commentator James Nagel expressed that "no other work of short fiction in the decade was increasingly essential specifically, and nothing until William Faulkner's "The Bear" so enhanced the class of the United States. Screenwriter and chief Albert Band adjusted Crane's novella for the 1959 film "Face of Fire", featuring Cameron Mitchell as Dr. Trescott and James Whitmore as Johnson. Dissimilar to in the first story, Johnson was delineated as white, and his first name was changed from Henry to Monk.
