The places of the two nations were the switch of what they had been in 1941. American authorities were worried that Akers and other individuals from ICI engaged with the Tube Alloys venture were attempting to misuse American atomic logical learning to make a productive post-war industry. The Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, felt that since the United States was doing "90% of the work" on the bomb, it would be "better for us to come for the present without sharing anything over we could help". In December 1942, Roosevelt consented to confining the stream of data to what Britain could use amid the war, regardless of whether doing as such hindered the American task. The Americans quit sharing any data on overwhelming water generation, the strategy for electromagnetic detachment, the physical or substance properties of plutonium, the subtleties of nuclear bomb structure, or the actualities about quick neutron responses. This antagonistically affected crafted by the Montreal Laboratory, the joint British and Canadian venture that was exploring atomic reactor plan. In striking back, the British quit sending researchers to America, abating the pace of work there, which had depended on British researchers. The Americans at that point stopped all data sharing.
