At age 32, with no regular citizen business, Grant required work to help his developing family. It was the start of seven monetarily lean years. His dad offered him a spot in the Galena, Illinois part of the family's calfskin business on condition that Julia and the kids remain with her folks in Missouri or with the Grants in Kentucky. Ulysses and Julia contradicted another partition and declined the offer. In 1855, Grant cultivated on his brother by marriage property close St. Louis, utilizing slaves possessed by Julia's dad. The ranch was not fruitful and to procure a living he sold kindling on St. Louis road corners. Acquiring just $50 per month (), wearing his blurred armed force coat, an unkempt Grant urgently searched for work. The following year, the Grants moved to arrive on Julia's dad's homestead, and manufactured a home Grant called "Hardscrabble". Julia disdained the rural house, which she depicted as an "ugly lodge". The Panic of 1857 crushed ranchers, including Grant, who pawned his gold watch to pay for Christmas. In 1858, Grant leased Hardscrabble and moved his family to Julia's dad's 850-section of land estate that utilized slave work. That fall, after an episode of intestinal sickness, Grant resigned from cultivating.
