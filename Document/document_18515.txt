Opeth returned home in 2004 to start writing new material for its eighth album, and by the end of the year, they had finished writing it. Opeth's European label, Music for Nations, closed its doors in 2005, and after negotiations with various labels, the band signed with Roadrunner Records. Ãkerfeldt said the primary reason for signing with Roadrunner was the label's wide distribution, ensuring the album would be available at larger-chain retailers. When news leaked that the band was signed to Roadrunner, who predominantly worked with trend-oriented rock and metal, some fans accused the band of selling out. "To be honest," Ãkerfeldt said, "that's such an insult after 15Â years as a band and 8Â records. I can't believe we haven't earned each and every Opeth fan's credibility after all these years. I mean, our songs are 10Â minutes long!" The band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio, the first time the band rehearsed since the 1998 album, "My Arms, Your Hearse". During rehearsal, keyboardist Wiberg joined Opeth as a full-time member. Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in Ãrebro, Sweden, from March 18 to June 1, 2005, and released the resulting "Ghost Reveries" on August 30, 2005, to critical acclaim and commercial success. The album debuted at numberÂ 64 in the US, and number nine in Sweden, higher than any previous Opeth release. Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten, one of only 21Â albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site. Rod Smith of "Decibel" magazine called "Ghost Reveries" "achingly beautiful, sometimes unabashedly brutal, often a combination of both".
