In 1903, Pelham Warner, who played for Middlesex, was picked to skipper the main voyage through Australia to be supported by MCC, in the winter of 1903Ã¢ÂÂ 04. As indicated by Warner, Hirst and Rhodes were the initial two players to be chosen, as "the two best bowlers of the present day in this nation." Before the visit, faultfinders guaranteed Hirst would be ineffective, refering to his disappointment amid his past visit. Nonetheless, Warner later expressed: "Hirst, to state nothing of his batting, bowled perfectly all through the visit, and was of substantially more incentive as a bowler than his normal would recommend". He further depicted him as the best all-rounder in England and noticed that "the more tightly the match, the better he plays". "Wisden" was less persuaded, and the report on the visit said that, as a bowler, "Hirst, however in no way, shape or form the disappointment he had been with Mr Stoddart's group six years prior, fell far underneath his English structure." While remarking on his batting record, the "Wisden" report noticed: "The Australian wickets [i.e. pitches] in fine climate are fairly too quick to even think about suiting the pulling and snare strokes of which he is such an ace in England." As he couldn't make the ball swing in Australia similarly it did in England, Hirst utilized leg hypothesis, bowling at leg stump with defenders close by on the leg side.
