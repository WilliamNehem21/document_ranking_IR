Manchester United won the league again in the 1999â2000 and 2000â01 seasons. The team finished third in 2001â02, before regaining the title in 2002â03. They won the 2003â04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3â0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the 2005â06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League in the 2006â07 season, before completing the European double in 2007â08 with a 6â5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008â09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record Â£80Â million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2â1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.
