Yard trusted that while the National Park Service was powerful as an administration office, it was not fit for advancing the desires of the basic American. He wrote in June 1918 that the national park development must "be developed just by an association of the general population outside the legislature, and unrestricted by governmental issues and schedule". On May 29, 1919, the National Parks Association (NPA) was authoritatively made to fill this job. Yard, who turned into an essential figure in the new society, was chosen its official secretary. His obligations as the main full-time worker of the NPA were essentially equivalent to they had been with the NPSÃ¢ÂÂto advance the national parks and to instruct Americans about their utilization. In its initial years, the NPA was Yard's employment and energy: he enlisted the key establishing individuals, fund-raised and composed different public statements. Yard additionally filled in as editorial manager of the NPA's "National Parks Bulletin" from 1919 to 1936. In the principal issue, Yard delineated the association's targets so as to make an expansive instructive program: in addition to the fact that they would draw in understudies, specialists and essayists to the parks, however a "total and discerning framework" would be made and clung to by Congress and the Park Service.
