The whole arrangement was shot on sound stages. Generation architects Greg Loewen and Graemay Murray structured the therapeutic office as a "roundabout center with workplaces and rooms transmitting outward", and incorporated a second floor in which DeMilla could supervise the whole medical clinic's tasks. Executive Joe Napolitano applauded the sets while shooting the scene "Final Resort", calling the show "a great treat store for a chief" because of the usefulness and size of the emergency clinic. He clarified that the set empowered him to coordinate long goes for and stroll and talk arrangements absent much trouble. The arrangement required broad prosthetic work for Dr. Batung and the non-human patients. The utilization of Lund's prosthetic cosmetics required a few hours every day that he was shot. Napolitano said that he observed this to be a test to the creation plan, clarifying that there would be talks about the measure of prosthetics important for Batung relying upon the scene. Batung's prosthetic work incorporated a tail that folded over his neck and shoulders; Lund was pushed around the set on a sled to impersonate the character's developments as a slug. Napolitano likewise determined that the patients required a comparable measure of time and work for their prosthetic cosmetics, for example, a man who has gills under his jaw.
