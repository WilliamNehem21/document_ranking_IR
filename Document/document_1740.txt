The pioneer high society of Antananarivo exhibited Rabearivelo's work as proof of the accomplishment of the French absorption arrangement and the gainful impacts of expansionism in Africa. In his diaries, the artist composed that he felt "utilized" by the French experts in Madagascar. Representative MontagnÃÂ© granted him an alliance ("membre correspondant") with the "AcadÃÂ©mie Malgache" in 1932. Be that as it may, in 1937, Rabearivelo's trust in the absorption messages and motions of Antananarivo's frontier high society was sold out. He was detained for three days for neglecting to make good on government expenses, a punishment from which he ought to have been exempted because of his status as a low-positioning worker of the pilgrim organization. He had likewise been guaranteed that he would speak to Madagascar at the 1937 Universal Exposition in Paris, yet in May 1937 the provincial specialists educated him that he would not be a piece of the island's appointment. Thusly, Rabearivelo progressed toward becoming disenchanted toward France and its pioneer message of digestion, a slant unequivocally communicated in his diaries. He was moreover dismissed by Malagasy high society, who denounced his unusual conduct and perspectives, especially in light of his job as spouse and father. His countrymen additionally held him in hatred for his apparent energy to grasp the French frontier principle and culture.
