At least 31Â mass graves were discovered in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war. In 1969, the historian Jozo Tomasevich wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300Â hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed that the number of victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put the figure at about 5,000. In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some estimates of the number of those killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav GliÅ¡iÄ, placed the figure at about 3,000. In 2007, Pavlowitch wrote that inflated figures of 6,000â7,000Â victims were advanced and widely believed for many years, but that German and Serbian scholars had recently agreed on the figure of 2,778. In the same year, the curator of the 21stÂ October Museum at Kragujevac, StaniÅ¡a BrkiÄ, published a book listing the names and personal data of 2,794Â victims. Of the total killed, 144Â were high school students, and five of the victims were 12Â years old. The last living survivor of the massacre, Dragoljub JovanoviÄ, died in October 2018 at the age of 94. He survived despite sustaining 11 bullet wounds and had to have one of his legs amputated. After the war, he was appointed the inaugural director of the 21stÂ October Museum.
