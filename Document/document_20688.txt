Childe's adherence to the culture-historical model is apparent in three of his booksâ"The Dawn of European Civilisation" (1925), "The Aryans" (1926) and "The Most Ancient East" (1928)âbut in none of these does he define what he means by "culture". Only later, in "The Danube in Prehistory" (1929), did Childe give "culture" a specifically archaeological definition. In this book, he defined a "culture" as a set of "regularly associated traits" in the material cultureâi.e. "pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms"âthat recur across a given area. He stated that in this respect a "culture" was the archaeological equivalent of a "people". Childe's use of the term was non-racial; he considered a "people" to be a social grouping, not a biological race. He opposed the equation of archaeological cultures with biological racesâas various nationalists across Europe were doing at the timeâand vociferously criticised Nazi uses of archaeology, arguing that the Jewish people were not a distinct biological race but a socio-cultural grouping. In 1935, he suggested that culture worked as a "living functioning organism" and emphasised the adaptive potential of material culture; in this he was influenced by anthropological functionalism. Childe accepted that archaeologists defined "cultures" based on a subjective selection of material criteria; this view was later widely adopted by archaeologists like Colin Renfrew.
