"Myst" was an immense commercial success. Along with "The 7th Guest", it was widely regarded as a killer application that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. By November 2000, it had sold above 6.3 million units worldwide, including more than 4.3 million in the United States. The game's success also led to a number of games which sought to copy "Myst"s success, referred to as ""Myst" clones". "Myst" was the bestselling PC game throughout the 1990s until "The Sims" exceeded its sales in 2002. "Myst"s success baffled some, who wondered how a game that was seen as "little more than 'an interactive slide show'" turned out to be a hit. Some developers of adventure games concurrent to "Myst"s release were somewhat critical of its success due to the number of subsequent video games that copied "Myst"s style compared to traditional adventure games, which diluted the market with poorly-received clones and which contributed to the waning popularity of the adventure game genre by 2000. Others criticized "Myst" as the "ultimate anti-arcade game", as it was much more relaxed and casual than anything that was released before since 1972, since "there were no lives, no dying, no score, and no time limit. No physical agility or reflexes were required. The only pressure was that which you imposed upon yourself to solve the puzzles and complete the storyline."
