Jackson's moves were extraordinarily disputable. He expelled McLane from the Treasury Department, having him serve rather as Secretary of State, supplanting Edward Livingston. He supplanted McLane with William J. Duane. In September, he terminated Duane for declining to evacuate the stores. Flagging his expectation to keep engaging the Bank, he supplanted Duane with Taney. Under Taney, the stores started to be expelled. They were put in an assortment of state banks which were well disposed to the organization's strategies, referred to commentators as pet banks.

The moves were proposed to constrain Jackson into a trade off. "Only the proof of enduring abroad will create any impact in Congress," he composed. At first, Biddle's methodology was fruitful, putting tremendous weight on Jackson. Be that as it may, Jackson dealt with the circumstance well. At the point when individuals came to him whining, he alluded them to Biddle, saying that he was the man who had "all the cash." Jackson's methodology worked. Biddle's system exploded backward, expanding hostile to Bank supposition.
