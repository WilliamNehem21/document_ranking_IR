A universal leap forward came in 1962 when Leonard Bernstein recorded the Fifth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for CBS. The chronicle helped Nielsen's music to accomplish gratefulness past his nation of origin and is viewed as one of the best recorded records of the orchestra. Nielsen's centennial in 1965 was broadly celebrated, both as far as exhibitions and productions, and Bernstein was granted the Sonning Prize for his chronicle of the Third Symphony. In 1988 Nielsen's journals and his letters to Anne Marie were distributed, and these, together with a 1991 life story by JÃÂ¸rgen Jensen utilizing this new material, prompted an overhauled target evaluation of the author's identity. Writing in "The New York Times" on the event of Nielsen's 125th commemoration in 1990, the music faultfinder Andrew Pincus reviewed that 25 years sooner Bernstein had trusted the world was prepared to acknowledge the Dane as the equivalent of Jean Sibelius, discussing "his unpleasant appeal, his swing, his drive, his cadenced astonishments, his weird intensity of consonant and tonal relationshipsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and particularly his steady unconventionality" (which Pincus accepted was as yet a test for groups of onlookers). Memoirs and concentrates in English during the 1990s built up Nielsen's status around the world, to the time when his music has turned into a customary component of show programming in Western nations.
