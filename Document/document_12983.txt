The rule of Cleopatra Selene likely finished in 75 BC as the adventure of Antiochus XIII to Rome demonstrates that he had just achieved his lion's share or was near it. Tigranes II, whose intrusion most likely occurred amid Antiochus XIII's nonattendance, never controlled the whole nation and took Damascus just in 72 BC. Cleopatra Selene opposed the Armenians in Ptolemais while Antiochus XIII most likely took haven in Cilicia. In 69 BC, Tigranes II assaulted Ptolemais; the city fell by Josephus, however Tigranes II needed to move north quick as the Romans began assaulting Armenia. As per Strabo, Tigranes II detained the ruler in Seleucia and later had her executed. Those records appear to repudiate one another, however in the perspective on the seventeenth century student of history William Whiston, they don't, since Josephus does not make reference to that Tigranes II caught the ruler in Ptolemais. History specialist John D. Grainger clarified Tigranes II' activity as a result of Cleopatra Selene's political significance; she was a triumphant card in the hands of her spouses, and Tigranes II looked to deny different yearning men from getting impact through her. Others see Cleopatra Selene as a pawn in political plans who later advanced into a rogue in her very own right, one who chose her activities successfully dependent on her own advantage.
