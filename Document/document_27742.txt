The flesh of the cap consists of a number of microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8â10Â Âµm thick, and is made of a loose "textura intricata", a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40â55 by 3.5â5.5Â Âµm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54â65Â Âµm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2â3Â Âµm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208â221Â Âµm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3â8Â Âµm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520Â Âµm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2â8Â Âµm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The flesh of the cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5â8Â Âµm. The flesh of the gills is similar to that of the lower cap.
