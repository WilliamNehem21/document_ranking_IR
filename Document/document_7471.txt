Frederick Shedden composed a paper putting the case for the Singapore methodology as a methods for protecting Australia. He contended that since Australia was likewise an island country, it pursued that it would likewise be helpless against a maritime barricade. On the off chance that Australia could be crushed without an intrusion, the protection of Australia must be a maritime one. Colonel John Lavarack, who had gone to the Imperial Defense College class of 1928 with Shedden, oppose this idea. Lavarack reacted that the huge coastline of Australia would make a maritime bar troublesome, and its significant inward assets implied that it could oppose financial weight. At the point when Richmond assaulted the Labor Party's situation in an article in "English Army Quarterly" in 1933, Lavarack composed an answer. In 1936, the pioneer of the resistance John Curtin read an article by Wynter in the House of Representatives. Wynter's candid analysis of the Singapore methodology prompted his exchange to a lesser post. Not long after the flare-up of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies designated a British officer, Lieutenant General Ernest Squires, to supplant Lavarack as Chief of the General Staff. Inside months, the Chief of the Air Staff was supplanted with a British officer also.
