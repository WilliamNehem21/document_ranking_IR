Just before midnight on 2 September, the rebels informed the Chilean government with an increasingly "complex" rundown of twelve requests. In the interim, further south, junior individuals from the naval force in the fundamental maritime base of Talcahuano joined the rebellion, taking a few vessels all the while. A few of these cruised north to join different dissidents, while two cruisers, a couple of destroyers and submarines stayed to monitor the base. Different bases joined the now-undeniable resistance also, including the Second Air Group situated in Quintero. With such huge numbers of radicals showing up, it was dreaded by numerous that the plenty of jobless specialists would join. The administration endeavored to request help from the United States as military intercession or war materiel (counting two submarines and bombs fit for entering the protective layer of "Almirante Latorre"), however they were rebuked both freely and secretly. Acting Vice President Manuel Trucco now wound up in a bothersome position; he needed to overcome the dissidents before more units joined and supported their powers, however in the event that he was excessively brutal, there was a hazard that the people would feel that his arrangements were excessively like the previous despot IbÃÂ¡ÃÂ±ez del Campo. Trucco settled on a way of compromise. He sent a maritime chief naval officer, Edgardo von Schroeders, to consult with the rebels. They met on board "Almirante Latorre", where von Schroeders, seeing a potential split between mariners irate over their compensation versus others with a progressively political plan, endeavored to partition them thusly and get them to surrender. Be that as it may, a request from the moving toward southern armada, requesting them to hold up before any conceivable settlement, fixed the issue until further notice and von Schroders flew back to the capital.
