Commentators have judged "Mother and Me and Mom" and Angelou's different collections of memoirs "in light of the first", and "Confined Bird" for the most part gets the most astounding acclaim. Marjorie Kehe of "The Christian Science Monitor", thinks about the book" "a continuation of "Confined Bird."" "Huge numbers of the occasions portrayed in Angelou's past collections of memoirs are returned to in this one, some with more detail than others, for example, her time of vagrancy, which was depicted in "Confined Bird," and her genuine beating by her envious beau, which was first uncovered in "Letter to My Daughter" (2008), Angelou's third book of articles. As indicated by Fiona Sturges, who assessed "Mother and Me and Mom" in the British distribution "The Independent", "As in her past books, these stories are told with clear-sightedness and a nonappearance of self indulgence, and they are no less dreary for their nature. Angelou has never been one for flowery composition, and here she keeps up an exact and practical style which makes these dreary minutes progressively distinctive, similar to a film from which you can't turn away". Sayers expresses that major sensational occasions, for example, the occurrence when Angelou was beaten, "are conveyed absent much enhancement or further reference".
