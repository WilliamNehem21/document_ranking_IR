GameSpot staff essayist James Mielke did not trust that the Dreamcast port was "a basic buy", yet considered it an "incredible amusement" at an alluringly low cost. The GameCube discharge was vigorously reprimanded at its staggering expense and dated designs.

Davis and 1UP.com's Mark MacDonald were disillusioned by the port's absence of highlights that were incorporated into the Nintendo 64 discharge. Friend Schneider of IGN found the 2.5D variant for the Game.com to disappoint and just "incompletely dependable" to the first arrival of "Occupant Evil 2". In spite of the fact that he trusted that its illustrations and audio effects figured out how to reproduce the first diversion's climate to a limited degree, he suspected that its controls were excessively "languid" to take into consideration a pleasant encounter.
