Writing in 1967, the folklorist Barnett Field guaranteed that sooner or later after Maylam's book was distributed, hoodening had "ceased to exist. The Horses were hung up in the stables, and when the tractors came, were taken out and consumed on the blaze." Doel and Doel later recommended that it was the effect of the First World War which adequately finished the custom. Field noticed that the main restoration of the custom after the war occurred at the 1936 Kent District Folk-Dance Festival at Aylesford. Another steed was uncommonly made for this celebration, and was displayed on a more seasoned model that had been utilized at Sarre. The pastime horse had not recently had any association with Morris moving, despite the fact that was received as a totem creature for a few Morris sides after the Second World War. This recovery in the utilization of the steed was vigorously affected by Maylam's book. The Aylesford horse was received by the Ravensbourne Morris Men, a Morris troupe situated in the West Kentish town of Keston, in 1947. The Ravensbourne Morris' hoodening convention is the soonest known variation of the custom to exist in West Kent, in spite of the fact that there are records of a hooden horse being situated at Balgowan School in the West Kentish town of Beckenham amid the 1930s. At the 1945 festival checking British triumph in the Second World War, a pony was brought out in Acol; this occurrence has been portrayed as "a sort of missing connection among convention and restoration" in light of the fact that the steed had been utilized as a major aspect of the authentic hoodening custom up until the mid-1920s.
