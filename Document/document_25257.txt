Twenty-first century critical opinion of the film is widely positive. "Eraserhead" holds an average rating of 91% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, representing the distillation of 56 reviews, with the critical consensus "David Lynch's surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and a creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man's fear of parenthood." Writing for "Empire" magazine, Steve Beard rated the film five stars out of five. He felt that it was "a lot more radical and enjoyable than [Lynch's] later Hollywood efforts" and highlighted its mix of surrealist body horror and black comedy. The BBC's Almar Haflidason awarded "Eraserhead" three stars out of five, describing it as "an unremarkable feat by [Lynch's] later standards". Haflidason felt that the film was a gathering of loosely related ideas, adding that it is "so consumed with surreal imagery that there are almost limitless possibilities to read personal theories into it"; the reviewer's own take on these themes were that they represented a fear of personal commitment and featured "a strong sexual undercurrent". A reviewer writing for Film4 rated "Eraserhead" five stars out of five, describing it as "by turns beautiful, annoying, funny, exasperating and repellent, but always bristling with a nervous energy". The Film4 reviewer felt that "Eraserhead" was unlike most films released to that point, save for the collaborations between Luis BuÃ±uel and Salvador DalÃ­; however, Lynch denies having seen any of these before "Eraserhead". Writing for "The Village Voice", Nathan Lee praised the film's use of sound, writing "to see the film means nothingâone must also "hear" it". He described the film's sound design as "an intergalactic seashell cocked to the ears of an acid-tripping gargantua".
