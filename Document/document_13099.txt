Du Bois was the principal African American welcomed by the American Historical Association (AHA) to show a paper at their yearly gathering. He read his paper, "Remaking and Its Benefits," to a bewildered group of onlookers at the AHA's December 1909 meeting. The paper conflicted with the standard verifiable view, advanced by the Dunning School of researchers at Columbia University, that Reconstruction was a catastrophe, brought about by the awkwardness and sloth of blacks. In actuality, Du Bois declared that the concise time of African-American administration in the South cultivated three vital objectives: popular government, free state funded schools, and new social welfare enactment. He declared that it was the national government's inability to deal with the Freedmen's Bureau, to disperse land, and to build up an instructive framework, that bound African-American prospects in the South. At the point when Du Bois presented the paper for distribution a couple of months after the fact in the "American Historical Review", he asked that the word Negro be promoted. The supervisor, J. Franklin Jameson, can't, and distributed the paper without the capitalization. The paper was generally overlooked by white students of history. Du Bois later built up his paper as his historic 1935 book, "Dark Reconstruction," which marshaled broad realities to help his declarations. The AHA did not welcome another African-American speaker until 1940.
