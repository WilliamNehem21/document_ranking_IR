Byrnes presented while on a watercraft journey on the Potomac River, and consented to update the Quebec Agreement, with the end goal of supplanting it with a looser type of co-task on atomic issues between the three governments. Forests, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Patterson's counselor George L. Harrison met with a British appointment comprising of Anderson, Wilson, Malcolm MacDonald, the High Commissioner to Canada, Roger Makins from the British Embassy in Washington, and Denis Rickett, Anderson's collaborator, on 15 November 1945 to draw up a report. They consented to hold the Combined Policy Committee. The Quebec Agreement's necessity for "common assent" before utilizing atomic weapons was supplanted with one for "earlier interview", and there was to be "full and powerful collaboration in the field of nuclear vitality", however in the more Memorandum of Intention, marked by Groves and Anderson, this was just "in the field of essential logical research". Patterson took the dispatch to the White House, where Truman and Attlee marked it on 16 November 1945. A draft understanding was affirmed by the Combined Policy Committee on 4 December 1945 as the reason for the renouncement of the Quebec Agreement.
