The idea of parenthood is additionally investigated in the scene. As indicated by Elyce Rae Helford, in her book "Dream Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television", Mrs. Peacock works as a being who has been decreased "to every single female capacity" by her children. She is "the peculiarly ready mother who has lost any feeling of individual reason" other than to do anything for her kids. Sonia Saraiya of "The A.V. Club" composes that "Scully's compassion toward a mother that she envisions to be mistreated is turned fiercely on its head, to uncover a beast whose needs are not exactly so clear." The scene is additionally one of the first to investigate Scully's longing to turn into a mother. Booker expresses that the scene displays the double idea of Scully's "cutting edge want for parenthood", rather than Mrs. Peacock's "debased thought of family". Helford composes that the section predicts "Scully's destiny as the mother of 'flawlessly' (innovatively) imagined and enormous descendants". In the fifth season, Scully in fact discovers that she is a mother, but coincidentally, after her ova was collected after her snatching in second season, and an outsider/human half breed named Emily is the outcome. With the disclosure that Scully is pregnant toward the finish of the seventh season finale, "Memorial", the idea rotating around Scully as a mother became the overwhelming focus in seasons eight and nine with the introduction of child William.
