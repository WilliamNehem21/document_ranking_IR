In 1902, Guillaume Grandidier described subfossil carnivoran remains from two caves on Madagascar as a larger "variety" of the living fossa ("Cryptoprocta ferox"), "C. ferox" var. "spelea". G. Petit, writing in 1935, considered "spelea" to represent a distinct species. Charles Lamberton reviewed subfossil and living "Cryptoprocta" in 1939 and agreed with Petit in recognizing two species, naming this species from a specimen found at Ankazoabo Cave near Itampolo. The specific name "spelea" means "cave" and was given because of the location of its discovery. However, Lamberton apparently had at most three skeletons of the living fossa, not nearly enough to capture the range of variation in that species, and some later authors did not separate "C.Â spelea" and "C.Â ferox" as species. Steven Goodman and colleagues, using larger samples, compiled another set of "Cryptoprocta" measurements that was published in a 2004 article. They found that some subfossil "Cryptoprocta" fell outside the range of variation of living "C.Â ferox", and identified those as representing "C.Â spelea". Grandidier had not designated a type specimen for the species, and to maintain "C.Â spelea" as the name for the larger form of the fossa, Goodman and colleagues designated a specimen to serve as the type specimen (specifically, a neotype).
