Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings aggregate independent from anyone else, taking not exactly an hour to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers needed to demonstrate "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting disaster". The main possibility came when Barnes intensely square slice Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. At the point when Young hit on bowl, his finger turn was required to inconvenience the batsmen on a downpour influenced surface, however he conveyed little variety in pace and direction and Barnes specifically hit him more than once through the off side field. Australia achieved 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. They took the score to 117 preceding Barnes was gotten behind from Eric Hollies for 61, finishing a 126-minute stand. Barnes staggered forward to a quick turning leg break that got his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been befuddled on the off chance that he had neglected to reach the ball. Australia completed at 389 on the second day and bowled out the hosts for 188 in the second innings, fixing triumph by an innings and 149 rushes to finish a 4Ã¢ÂÂ 0 arrangement win.
