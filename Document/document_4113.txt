While the big guns kept up their loud trade, holding the Duke's consideration, Frederick sent scouts to locate a better than average intersection of the Saale, since the one at Weissenfels was not usable. There was little he could do at the cut off tie; to cross the stream under Saxe-Hildburghausen's nose, even with flame, would have been absurd. Over the waterway, the Allies had a physical boundary to secure them; they could likewise utilize their situation to watch Frederick's development. Mysteriously, however, Saxe-Hildburghausen surrendered this favorable position and resigned toward Burgweben and Tagewerben, relying on the mediating slopes to secure him. Soubise had progressed from Reichardswerben through Kaynau, and they got together at Gross KÃÂ¶rbetha. Their propelled watchman watched Merseburg, and looked for some data from the nearby occupants. Despite the fact that the neighborhood Saxon laborers may have hated the Prussians, they disdained the French and Austrians more, and they surrendered little data. Neither Saxe-Hildburghausen nor Soubise had a thought what Frederick planned, or in reality, what he was doing. Marshal Keith came to Merseburg and found the scaffold there annihilated, with the Austrians and French arranged to hold the opposite side of the waterway. Constantly of 3 November, Frederick's designers completed their new scaffolds and the whole Prussian line progressed over the Saale. When Frederick had crossed the waterway, he sent 1,500 mounted force under the order of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz to strike the Allied camp. He intended to assault it the following day, however the unexpected strike unnerved Soubise into moving amid the night to a progressively secure position. On 4 November, Frederick moved to his camp at Rossbach.
