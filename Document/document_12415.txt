A province street along part of the course of H-58 was available no less than 1927; the street ran east and northeasterly from Munising to Kingston Corners where it pursued what is presently Adams Trail east to M-77. A second region street ran westbound from Grand Marais. By 1929, M-94 was rerouted through Alger County to pursue MunisingÃ¢ÂÂ Van MeerÃ¢ÂÂ Shingleton Road east from Munising to Van Meer and afterward south to Shingleton; that steering pursued what is presently H-58 and H-15. The segment of region street between Van Meer and Melstrand was surfaced in rock by 1936 with the rest of an earthen street. Before the year's over, an earthen street was developed east of Grand Marais to Deer Park. After the finish of World War II, the rock section was stretched out north of Melstrand to the Buck Hill zone, and the earthen street was reached out between the Adams Trail and Grand Marais by method for Au Sable Point. East of Grand Marais, the roadway was improved with rock to the region line. In late 1946 or mid 1947, the primary east of Grand Marais were cleared; extra segments in Luce County were improved to rock. The majority of the earthen street fragments of what is presently H-58 were improved to rock street by the center of 1958; the area between Van Meer and Melstrand just as a segment east of Grand Marais were cleared.
