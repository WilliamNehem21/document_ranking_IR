In 1930, Gernsback chose to blend "Science Wonder Stories" and "Air Wonder Stories" into "Marvel Stories". The explanation behind the merger is obscure, despite the fact that it might have been that he required the space in the printing plan for his new "Flying Mechanics" magazine. Bleiler has recommended that the merger was brought about by poor deals and an ensuing need to scale back. What's more, "Air Wonder Stories" was most likely centered around too specific a specialty to succeed. In a publication just before "Science Wonder Stories" changed its name, Gernsback remarked that "Science" in the title "has would in general retard the advancement of the magazine, on the grounds that numerous individuals had the feeling that it is a kind of logical periodical instead of a fiction magazine". Unexpectedly, the consideration of "science" in the title was the reason that sci-fi essayist Isaac Asimov started perusing the magazine; when he saw the August 1929 issue he got consent to peruse it from his dad in light of the fact that it was obviously instructive. Worries about the attractiveness of titles appear to have surfaced in the last two issues of "Science Wonder", which had "Science" imprinted in a shading that made it hard to peruse. On the highest point of the spread showed up the words "Puzzle Adventure-Romance", the remainder of which was an astounding method to promote a sci-fi magazine.
