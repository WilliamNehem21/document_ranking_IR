Worries about the ecological situation of the planet ("Blackened"), debasement ("Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All"), and boycotting and segregation ("The Shortest Straw") are underlined with customary existential subjects. Issues, for example, the right to speak freely and common freedoms are displayed from an inauspicious and negative perspective. "One" was informally nicknamed an "antiwar song of praise" as a result of the verses which depict the enduring of an injured warrior. "Dyers Eve" is an expressive tirade from Hetfield to his folks. Burton got co-composing credit on "To Live Is to Die" as the bass line is a mixture of unused accounts Burton had performed preceding his passing. Since the first accounts are not utilized on the track, the piece is credited as composed by Burton and played by Newsted. The expressed word area of the tune ("When a man lies, he kills some piece of the world. These are the pale passings which men mistake their lives.") was composed by German writer Paul Gerhardt, yet was mistakenly ascribed to Burton in the liner notes. The second 50% of the discourse ("All this I can't stand to observe any more. Can't the kingdom of salvation take me home?") was composed by Burton.
