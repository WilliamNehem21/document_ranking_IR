Amid the early long stretches of 28 June, a fight gathering of the first SS Panzer Division, "Kampfgruppe Frey", touched base at the front and was set under the direction of the twelfth SS Panzer Division. At 0810, General Friedrich Dollmann, the seventh Army officer, requested SS-ObergruppenfÃÂ¼hrer Paul Hausser to occupy the II SS Panzer Corps, to counter-assault south of Cheux. Hausser answered that no counter-assault could be propelled until the next day, as such a significant number of his units still couldn't seem to achieve the front. The German order was tossed into chaos by Dollmann's unexpected passing, when Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt (OB West) were on the way to a gathering with Hitler and distant from the circumstance. It was not until 1500 that Hausser was delegated leader of the seventh Army, with Willi Bittrich supplanting him as authority of II SS Panzer Corps. (Hausser was educated to hold control regarding the Corps until the next morning.) Pending the arrival of Rommel to Normandy, Hausser was likewise to be incomparable leader in the intrusion region. At 1700 the order structure was changed once more; the seventh Army under Hausser would be in charge of the attack forward looking the American armed force, while the Panzer Group West (General Geyr von Schweppenburg) was to be in charge of the intrusion forward looking the Anglo-Canadian powers.
