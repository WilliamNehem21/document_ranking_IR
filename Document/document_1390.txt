The nature of the magazine stayed high even as the monetary pressure was mounting in the late 1970s. White gained spread work of art by Stephen Fabian and Douglas Beekman, and stories by a portion of the new age of sf essayists, for example, George R. R. Martin and Charles Sheffield. White left in November 1978, yet the main issue of "Fabulous" under Elinor Mavor's article control was April 1979. Since White had returned unsold stories she had next to no to work with and was compelled to fill the magazine with reprints. This prompted reestablished strife with the sf network, which she did her best to defuse. At a tradition in 1979 she met Harlan Ellison, who griped about the republish approach; she clarified that it was brief and had the capacity to get him to consent to contribute stories, distributing two pieces by him in "Astounding" throughout the following three years. The January 1980 issue of "Incredible" (Mavor's fourth issue) was the last to contain republished stories. When the reprints had been eliminated, Mavor had the capacity to discover new authors to work with, including Brad Linaweaver and John E. Stith, both of whom sold their first stories to "Awesome". The most recent year of "Fabulous" indicated "an enduring improvement in substance", as per Mike Ashley, who refers to specifically "Daemon", a serialized realistic story, represented by Stephen Fabian. In any case, toward the finish of 1980 "Fantastic"s free presence stopped, and it was converged with "Astounding".
