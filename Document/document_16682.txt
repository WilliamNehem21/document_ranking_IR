The renewed interest in Axelrod's work prompted Stateside Records to reissue "Song of Innocence" in 2000. Reviewing the re-release, "Now" wrote that after sounding odd during the 1960s, the songs had become "a sampler's dream come trueÂ â who knew?" David Keenan attributed Axelrod's sampling legacy to "the original badass drummer" Palmer. In his appraisal for "The Wire", he facetiously critiqued that the songs "may reek of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern." "Pitchfork" journalist Sean Fennessey later said Axelrod's first two records were "essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip-hop", having "literally been a rap producer's delight for years". In a 2013 list for "Complex", DJ and production duo Kon and Amir named "Holy Thursday" the greatest hip hop sample of all time. In 2018, "Song of Innocence" was given another re-release, this time by Now-Again Records. It featured a new remaster by Randi, H. B. Barnum, and Axelrod's widow, Terri; and sleeve notes written by Eothen Alapat, Now-Again's CEO. According to Alapat's notes, Axelrod once told him that Miles Davis played the album before conceiving his own fusion of jazz and rock for "Bitches Brew" (1970).
