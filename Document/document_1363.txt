Douglas upholding a financial framework that he called social credit were drawing in notice in Alberta, and his disciples included numerous UFA individuals. Driven by George Bevington, they supported a goals at the UFA tradition in January 1923 requiring the formation of an administration claimed bank. After Bevington's presentation, support for the goals was running high; Brownlee cooled eagerness with his very own discourse cautioning delegates that Alberta's obligation burden couldn't deal with the projects that Bevington suggested that a commonplace bank ought to embrace. All things being equal, the tradition passed a goals approaching the common government to apply for a bank contract from the government, which was in charge of banking under the British North America Act, 1867. At Brownlee's suggestion, the Greenfield government struck a commission under the administration of University of Alberta financial specialist D. A. MacGibbon, which firmly suggested against the foundation of a commonplace bank. This reflected Brownlee's very own decision, came to subsequent to researching state-run banks in New Zealand and New South Wales. At the 1924 UFA tradition, Bevington and his devotees reaffirmed their requests; Brownlee reacted by indicating the discoveries of the MacGibbon commission and to his dispute that the proposition was unlawful and would bankrupt the territory. In this he was upheld by Henry Wise Wood, whom Bevington was trying for the UFA administration. Brownlee proposed rather that the administration's treasury branches should start to acknowledge stores.
