The recharged enthusiasm for Axelrod's work incited Stateside Records to reissue "Melody of Innocence" in 2000. Exploring the re-discharge, "Presently" composed that in the wake of sounding odd amid the 1960s, the tunes had turned into "a sampler's fantasy come trueÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ who knew?" David Keenan ascribed Axelrod's testing inheritance to "the first boss drummer" Palmer. In his evaluation for "The Wire", he playfully investigated that the melodies "may smell of stale joss sticks and patchouli-scented self-actualisation, however in their very datedness they some way or another sound exceptionally present day." "Pitchfork" columnist Sean Fennessey later said Axelrod's initial two records were "fundamental if just as a visit manage through mid 90s hip-bounce", having "truly been a rap maker's enjoyment for a considerable length of time". In a 2013 rundown for "Complex", DJ and creation pair Kon and Amir named "Sacred Thursday" the best hip jump test ever. In 2018, "Tune of Innocence" was given another re-discharge, this time at this point Again Records. It highlighted another remaster by Randi, H. B. Barnum, and Axelrod's widow, Terri; and sleeve notes composed by Eothen Alapat, Now-Again's CEO. As indicated by Alapat's notes, Axelrod once revealed to him that Miles Davis played the collection before imagining his very own combination of jazz and shake for "Bitches Brew" (1970).
