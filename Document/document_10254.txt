A noteworthy topic of Manning's works is the British realm in decay. Her fiction contrasts deterministic, imperialistic perspectives on history with one that acknowledges the likelihood of progress for those dislodged by expansionism. Keeping an eye on's works take a solid position against British government, and are brutally reproachful of bigotry, hostile to Semitism and persecution toward the finish of the British frontier time. "English government is appeared to be a degenerate and self-serving framework, which has the right to be disassembled as well as which is entirely the skirt of being destroyed", composes Steinberg. The British characters in Manning's books practically all accept the authenticity of British predominance and government and battle with their situation as oppressors who are unwelcome in nations they have been raised to trust welcome their colonizing impact. In this view, Harriet's character, minimized as an outcast and a lady, is both oppressor and persecuted, while characters, for example, Guy, Prince Yakimov and Sophie try to apply different types of intensity and specialist over others, reflecting in microcosm the national clashes and dominion of the British Empire. Phyllis Lassner, who has composed widely on Manning's composition from a pioneer and post-pilgrim point of view, takes note of how even thoughtful characters are not pardoned their complicity as colonizers; the reactions of the Pringles attest "the vexed connection between their own status as frontier banishes and that of the colonized" and local Egyptians, however given next to no immediate voice in "The Levant Trilogy", in any case attest subjectivity for their nation.
