Elizabeth Denlinger incorporates a comparable notion in her article, "The Garment and the Man": "This changed showcase of ladies to fulfill the 'incredible itch'ÃÂ ... is a basic part of the circle to which "Harris' List" offered British men a "carte d'entrÃÂ©e"".

She proposes that the yearly's motivation was to "direct the covetous to the grasp of a whore", and that its exposition was intended for "lone sexual happiness" (H. Officer additionally sold back-issues of "Harris' List"). Sold to a London open which was for the most part male centric, its postings mirror the partialities of the men who composed them.
