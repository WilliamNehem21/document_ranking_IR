War broke out among Pyrrhus and Demetrius in 290BC when Lanassa, spouse of Pyrrhus, girl of Agathocles of Syracuse, left him for Demetrius and offered him her settlement of Corcyra. The war delayed until 288BC, when Demetrius lost the help of the Macedonians and fled the nation. Macedonia was then separated among Pyrrhus and Lysimachus, the previous taking western Macedonia and the last eastern Macedonia. By 286BC, Lysimachus had ousted Pyrrhus and his powers from Macedonia. In 282BC, another war ejected among SeleucusI and Lysimachus; the last was murdered in the Battle of Corupedion, permitting SeleucusI to assume responsibility for Thrace and Macedonia. In two sensational inversions of fortune, SeleucusI was killed in 281BC by his officer Ptolemy Keraunos, child of PtolemyI and grandson of Antipater, who was then announced lord of Macedonia before being murdered fighting in 279BC by Celtic intruders in the Gallic intrusion of Greece. The Macedonian armed force broadcasted the general Sosthenes of Macedon as lord, in spite of the fact that he clearly declined the title. In the wake of vanquishing the Gallic ruler Bolgios and driving out the striking party of Brennus, Sosthenes kicked the bucket and left a disorderly circumstance in Macedonia. The Gallic intruders assaulted Macedonia until Antigonus Gonatas, child of Demetrius, crushed them in Thrace at the 277BC Battle of Lysimachia and was then declared lord Antigonus II of Macedon ().
