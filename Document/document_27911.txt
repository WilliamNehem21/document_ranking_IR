Franciscan friar AndrÃ©s AvendaÃ±o y Loyola recorded his own account of his late 17th century journeys to NojpetÃ©n, written in 1696 and entitled "RelaciÃ³n de las entradas que hize a la conversiÃ³n de los gentiles Ytzaex" ("Account of the expeditions that I made to convert the Itza heathens"). When the Spanish finally conquered PetÃ©n in 1697 they produced a vast quantity of documentation. Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor was a Spanish colonial official who first held the post of relator of the Royal Chancery of Vallodalid and later as that of the Council of the Indies. As such he had access to the large amount of colonial documents stored in the General Archive of the Indies. From these he produced his "Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la de el Lacandon, y otras naciones de indios barbaros, de la mediacion de el Reyno de Guatimala, a las provincias del Yucatan en la AmÃ©rica Septentrional" ("History of the Conquest of the Province of the Itza, reduction, and advances in that of the Lakandon, and other nations of barbarous indians, and the intervention of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and the provinces of Yucatan in Northern America"). This was first published in Madrid in 1701 and detailed the history of PetÃ©n from 1525 through to 1699.
