Among the Brazilian land aristocrats were David Canabarro and AntÃÂ´nio de Sousa Neto, the two partners of Flores and previous dissident radicals amid the Ragamuffin War that had attacked Rio Grande do Sul from 1835 until 1845. Canabarro, an outskirts military administrator, deceived Brazil's legislature by denying that Brazilians were crossing the fringe to join Flores. Sousa Neto went to the Brazilian money to demand quick government intercession in Uruguay, guaranteeing that Brazilians were being killed and their farms burglarized. The "way that Uruguayan residents had similarly as legitimate cases against Brazil as Brazilians had against Uruguay was disregarded", said student of history Philip Raine. In spite of the fact that Sousa Neto had ties with the administering ideological group, his cases, including that he could hoard a power of 40,000 to attack Uruguay, were not paid attention to by all. The Uruguayan emergency landed at a troublesome minute for Brazil, which was very nearly an all out war with the British Empire for inconsequential reasons. Brazil's administration chose to intercede in Uruguay, dreadful of demonstrating any shortcoming despite an approaching clash with Britain, and trusting that it would be better for the focal government to lead the pack instead of permit the Brazilian farmers on the boondocks to choose the course of occasions.
