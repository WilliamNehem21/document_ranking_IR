"Coprinellus micaeus" was represented in a woodcut by the sixteenth century botanist Carolus Clusius in what is seemingly the primary distributed monograph on growths, the 1601 "Rariorum plantarum historia. Fungorum in Pannoniis observatorum brevis historia" (History of uncommon plants. Brief history of growths saw in Pannonia [Hungary]). Clusius incorrectly trusted the species to be noxious, and characterized it as a sort of "Growths perniciales" (unsafe parasites). The species was first depicted experimentally by French botanist Jean Baptiste FranÃÂ§ois Pierre Bulliard in 1786 as "Agaricus micaceus" in his work "Herbier de la France". In 1801, Christian Hendrik Persoon gathered together the majority of the gilled organisms that auto-processed ("deliquesced") amid spore release into the segment "Coprinus" of the sort "Agaricus". Elias Magnus Fries later raised Persoon's area "Coprinus" to class rank in his "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici", and the species wound up known as "Coprinus micaceus". It was the sort types of subsection "Exannulati" in segment "Micacei" of the variety "Coprinus", a gathering of related taxa with shroud made of sphaerocysts (round swollen cells normally framed in bunches) solely or with slender filamentous connective hyphae intermixed. Atomic investigations distributed during the 1990s exhibited that a considerable lot of the coprinoid ("Coprinus"- like) mushrooms were in reality disconnected to one another. This finished in a 2001 update of the sort "Coprinus", which was part into four genera; "C.ÃÂ micaeus" was exchanged to "Coprinellus".
