Neither Ralph of Coggeshall nor William of Newburgh offer a clarification for the "bizarre and tremendous" occasion, as William calls it, and some cutting edge antiquarians have a similar hesitance: "I consider the way toward stressing over the suggestive subtleties of these superbly trivial supernatural occurrences with an end goal to discover normal or mental clarifications of what 'truly,' in the event that anything, occurred, to be pointless to the investigation of William of Newburgh or, so far as that is concerned, of the Middle Ages", says Nancy Partner, creator of an investigation of twelfth century historiography. In any case, such clarifications keep on being looked for and two methodologies have commanded clarifications of the secret of the green kids. The first is that the account slides from legends, depicting a nonexistent experience with the occupants of a "pixie Otherworld". In a couple of ahead of schedule just as present day readings, this other world is extraterrestrial, and the green youngsters outsider creatures. The second is that it is a distorted record of a genuine occasion, despite the fact that it is difficult to be sure whether the story as recorded is a true report given by the kids or a "grown-up innovation". His investigation of records of youngsters and workers escaping from their lords drove Charles Oman to presume that "there is plainly some riddle behind everything [the story of the green children], some account of tranquilizing and seizing". Jeffrey Jerome Cohen offers an alternate sort of chronicled clarification, contending that the story is a slanted record of the racial contrast between the contemporary English and the indigenous Britons.
