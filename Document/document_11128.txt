Bill and Jerri Osberg sued the state and seven different gatherings in April 2003 over overflow from the development, asserting that it executed many trees and contaminated lakes on their property. Later examination revealed harm to natural life territory in the Wisconsin River. Incorporated into the first claim were six individual WisDOT workers, the essential temporary worker and a nearby pet supply organization. The court of offers halfway maintained a decision by the area court expelling the representatives and the temporary worker from the claim in March 2006. The pet supply organization was restored for the situation by the interests court. The couple settled their cases, and the state sought after the issue against Pagel Construction in a related claim. WisDOT asserted that the temporary worker did not pursue appropriate disintegration controls and neglected to remediate the disintegration harm to the Osbergs' property. The state needed the development organization to relinquish their $70,000 retainer (identical to $ in ) and pay harms of $150,000 (proportional to $ in ). Pagel Construction blamed WisDOT's disintegration control plan and said that the state's specialists controlled the undertaking and was looking for the arrival of its retainer. In September 2007, a jury decided for Pagel Construction and granted them $70,898.13 in harms (comparable to $ in ).
