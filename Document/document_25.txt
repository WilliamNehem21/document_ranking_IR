The 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont's division walked from Haslach towards Ulm and kept running into four Austrian regiments holding Boefingen. The 32nd did a few fierce assaults, however the Austrians held firm and rebuffed each one. The Austrians overwhelmed the fight with more rangers and infantry regiments to Ulm-Jungingen planning to score a knockout pass up encompassing Dupont's power. Dupont detected what was going on and appropriated the Austrians by propelling an unexpected assault on Jungingen, amid which he took as prisoner somewhere around 1,000 of the Austrians. Restored Austrian assaults drove these powers back to Haslach, which the French figured out how to hold. Dupont was in the long run compelled to fall back on Albeck, where he joined Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers' foot dragoons division. The impacts of the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on Napoleon's arrangements are not completely clear, however the Emperor may have at long last discovered that most of the Austrian armed force was accumulated at Ulm. In like manner, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, which means he currently had four infantry and one mounted force corps to manage Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were all the while guarding the locale around Munich. Napoleon did not mean to battle a fight crosswise over waterways and requested his marshals to catch the imperative extensions around Ulm. He additionally started moving his powers toward the north of Ulm on the grounds that he expected a fight in that area instead of an encompassing of the city itself. These airs and activities would prompt an encounter at Elchingen on the fourteenth as Ney's powers progressed on Albeck.
