Amid this period, Parsons additionally composed an exposition on his independent reasoning and legislative issuesÃ¢ÂÂwhich he portrayed as meaning "progressivism and liberal standards"Ã¢ÂÂ titled "Opportunity is a Two-Edged Sword", in which he censured the tyranny, oversight, debasement, antisexualism and prejudice he saw as common in American culture. None of these works were distributed in his lifetime. Through Heinlein, Parsons got a visit from author L. Sprague de Camp, with whom he talked about enchantment and sci-fi, and uncovered that Hubbard had sent a letter offering him Sara back. De Camp later alluded to Parsons as "A genuine distraught virtuoso in the event that I at any point met one", and put together the character Courtney James with respect to him in his time travel story "A Gun for Dinosaur" (1956). Parsons was likewise visited by Jane Wolfe, who ineffectively claimed for him to rejoin the broken down O.T.O. He entered a short association with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan; they moved to a house on Redondo Beach, a structure referred to by them as the "Solid Castle". Cameron came back to Redondo Beach from San Miguel de Allende and savagely contended with Parsons after finding his unfaithfulness, before she again left for Mexico. Parsons reacted by starting separation procedures against her on the grounds of "extraordinary savagery".
