Archduke Charles saw that on the off chance that he could join with Wartenbsleben, he could pick off the French armed forces in progression. Having adequate fortifications and having exchanged his supply line from Vienna to Bohemia, he moved north to join with Wartensleben. With 25,000 of his best troops, Charles crossed toward the north bank of the Danube at Regensburg. On 22 August 1796, Charles and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, experienced Bernadotte's division at Neumarkt. The dwarfed French were driven north west through Altdorf bei NÃÂ¼rnberg to the Pegnitz River. Leaving Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze with a division to seek after Bernadotte, the Archduke push north at Jourdan's correct flank. The French fell back to Amberg as Charles and Wartensleben's powers joined on the Army of Sambre and Meuse. On 20 August, Moreau sent Jourdan a message vowing to intently pursue Charles, which he didn't do. In the Battle of Amberg on 24 August, Charles vanquished the French and annihilated two regiments of their back gatekeeper. The Austrians lost 400 slaughtered and injured out of 40,000 troops. Of an aggregate of 34,000 officers, the French endured more noteworthy misfortunes of 1,200 slaughtered and injured in addition to 800 men and two hues caught. Jourdan withdrew first to Sulzbach and afterward behind the Regnitz stream where Bernadotte went along with him on 28 August. Hotze and his Habsburg troops reoccupied NÃÂ¼rnberg and Jourdan, who had expected Moreau to keep Charles involved in the south, wound up dwarfed.
