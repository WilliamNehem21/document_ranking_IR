Beam Davies discharged the performance collection "Storyteller", a friend piece to "X-Ray", in 1998. Initially composed two years sooner as a supper club style appear, it commended his old band and his alienated sibling. Seeing the programming potential outcomes in his music/exchange/memory position, the American music broadcasting company VH1 propelled a progression of comparative tasks including set up shake craftsmen titled "VH1 Storytellers". Dave Davies talked positively of a Kinks gathering in mid 2003, and as the 40th commemoration of the gathering's leap forward neared, both of the Davies siblings communicated enthusiasm for cooperating once more. Notwithstanding, seeks after a gathering were dashed in June 2004 when Dave endured a stroke while leaving a lift, briefly impeding his capacity to talk and play guitar. Following Dave's recuperation, the Kinks were drafted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005, with each of the four of the first band individuals in participation. The honor was exhibited by The Who's guitarist and lyricist Pete Townshend, a long-term Kinks fan and companion of Ray Davies. The enlistment helped fuel deals for the gathering; in August 2007, a reentry of "The Ultimate Collection", an arrangement of material spreading over the band's vocation, achieved number 32 on the UK Top 100 collection diagram and number one on the UK Indie collection outline.
