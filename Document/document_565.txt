The plumage of the juvenile is a dim dark colored overlaid with muddled white streaking until the fifth (once in a while fourth, all around infrequently third) year, when it achieves sexual development. Juvenile bald eagles are discernable from the brilliant falcon ("Aquila chrysaetos"), the main other exceptionally substantial, non-vulturine raptorial flying creature in North America, in that the previous has a bigger, all the more jutting head with a bigger mouth, straighter edged wings which are held level (not marginally raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and plumes which don't totally cover the legs. At the point when seen well, the brilliant falcon is particular in plumage with a more strong warm darker shading than a juvenile bald eagle, with a rosy brilliant fix to its scruff and (in youthful fowls) a profoundly differentiating set of white squares on the wing. Another distinctive element of the juvenile bald eagle over the develop flying creature is its dark, yellow-tipped bill; the develop hawk has a completely yellow snout. The bald eagle has in some cases been viewed as the biggest genuine raptor (accipitrid) in North America. The main bigger types of raptor-like winged animal is the California condor ("Gymnogyps californianus"), a New World vulture which today isn't commonly viewed as an ordered partner of genuine accipitrids. In any case, the brilliant bird, averaging and in wing harmony length in its American race ("A. c. canadensis"), is only lighter in mean weight and surpasses the bald eagle in mean wing harmony length by around . Furthermore, the bald eagle's nearby cousins, the moderately longer-winged however shorter-followed white-followed falcon and the generally speaking bigger Steller's ocean hawk ("H. pelagicus"), may, infrequently, meander to waterfront Alaska from Asia.
