Bits of voices between and over the music are another remarkable component of the collection. Amid account sessions, Waters enlisted both the staff and the brief tenants of the studio to respond to a progression of inquiries imprinted on cheat sheets. The interviewees were set before a receiver in an obscured Studio 3, and demonstrated such inquiries as "What's your most loved shading?" and "What's your most loved sustenance?", before proceeding onward to subjects increasingly integral to the collection, (for example, franticness, viciousness, and demise). Questions, for example, "When was the last time you were rough?", pursued quickly by "Were you justified?", were replied in the request they were introduced. Roger "The Hat" Manifold demonstrated hard to discover, and was the main patron recorded in a regular sit-down meeting, as by then the cheat sheets had been misplaced. Waters got some information about a savage experience he had with another driver, and Manifold answered "...ÃÂ give them a brisk, short, sharp shockÃÂ ..." When gotten some information about death he reacted "live for now, gone tomorrow, that is meÃÂ ..." Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on visit with Pink Floyd, recorded the bit which opens the collection: "I've been frantic for screwing years Ã¢ÂÂ totally years". The band's street administrator Peter Watts (father of performing artist Naomi Watts) contributed the rehashed chuckling amid "Cerebrum Damage" and "Address Me". His second spouse, Patricia "Puddie" Watts (presently Patricia Gleason), was in charge of the line about the "geezer" who was "cruisin' for a bruisin utilized in the segue among "Cash" and "Us and Them", and the words "I never said I was alarmed of biting the dust" heard part of the way through "The Great Gig in the Sky".
