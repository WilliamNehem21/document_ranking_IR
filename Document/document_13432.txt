Lansdale's battle centered around northern Catholics, who were known for their emphatically hostile to socialist propensities. His staff printed a huge number of leaflets with trademarks, for example, "Christ has gone south" and "the Virgin Mary has left from the North", asserting enemy of Catholic oppression under Ho Chi Minh. Blurbs delineating socialists shutting a church building and driving the assemblage to supplicate before Ho, decorated with an inscription "settle on your decision", were glued around Hanoi and Haiphong. Diem himself went to Hanoi a few times in 1954 while the French were still garrisoned there to urge Catholics to move, depicting himself as a guardian angel of Catholics. The battle resounded with northern Catholic clerics, who told their supporters that Ho would end opportunity of love, that holy observances would never again be given and that any individual who remained behind would imperil their spirits. A review of outcasts nearly five decades later affirmed that they felt their interests would be best served under a Catholic chief and that Diem had significant individual intrigue because of his religion. Some have contended that the Catholics would have left paying little respect to Lansdale's exercises, as they had direct encounters of their ministers and co-religionists being caught and executed for opposing the socialist insurgency.
