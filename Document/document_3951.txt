In the late tenth century, the Western Chalukyas, otherwise called the Kalyani Chalukyas or 'Later' Chalukyas rose to control by toppling the Rashtrakutas under whom they had been filling in as feudatories. Manyakheta was their capital at an early stage before they moved it to Kalyani (current Basavakalyan). Regardless of whether the rulers of this domain had a place with a similar family line as their namesakes, the Badami Chalukyas is still discussed. Whatever the Western Chalukya starting points, Kannada remained their language of organization and the Kannada and Sanskrit writing of their time was productive. Tailapa II, a feudatory ruler from Tardavadi (current Bijapur area), restored the Chalukya rule by overcoming the Rashtrakutas amid the rule of Karka II. He coordinated his disobedience to match with the disarray brought about by the attacking Paramara of Central India to the Rashtrakutas capital in 973. This period delivered delayed fighting with the Chola administration of Tamilakam for control of the assets of the Godavari River-Krishna River doab locale in Vengi. Someshvara I, a daring Chalukyan ruler, effectively shortened the development of the Chola Empire toward the south of the Tungabhadra River district in spite of enduring a few annihilations while keeping up power over his feudatories in the Konkan, Gujarat, Malwa and Kalinga locales. For around 100 years, starting in the mid eleventh century, the Cholas involved substantial regions of South Karnataka district (Gangavadi).
