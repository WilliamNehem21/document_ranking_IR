Among the late piano works are two books of "PrÃÂ©ludes" (1909Ã¢ÂÂ 10, 1911Ã¢ÂÂ 13), short pieces that delineate a wide scope of subjects. Lesure remarks that they go from the skips of minstrels at Eastbourne in 1905 and the American trapeze artist "General Lavine" "to dead leaves and the sounds and aromas of the night air". "En blanc et noir" (In white and dark, 1915), a three-development work for two pianos, is a dominatingly solemn piece, mirroring the war and national risk. The "ÃÂtudes" (1915) for piano have separated feeling. Composing not long after Debussy's demise, Newman discovered them toiled Ã¢ÂÂ "an unusual last part in an incredible craftsman's life"; Lesure, composing eighty years after the fact rates them among Debussy's most prominent late works: "Behind an instructive outside, these 12 pieces investigate theoretical interims, or Ã¢ÂÂ in the last five Ã¢ÂÂ the sonorities and timbres curious to the piano." In 1914 Debussy began deal with an arranged arrangement of six sonatas for different instruments. His deadly ailment kept him from finishing the set, yet those for cello and piano (1915), woodwind, viola and harp (1915), and violin and piano (1917 Ã¢ÂÂ his last finished work) are for the most part compact, three-development pieces, more diatonic in nature than a portion of his other late works.
