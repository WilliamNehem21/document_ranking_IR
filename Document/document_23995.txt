Within three days of its release in Japan, "Final Fantasy VII" sold over two million copies. This popularity inspired thousands of retailers in North America to break street dates in September to meet public demand for the title. In the game's debut weekend in North America, it sold 330,000 copies, and had reached sales of 500,000 copies in less than three weeks. The momentum established in the game's opening weeks continued for several months; Sony announced the game had sold one million copies in North America by early December, prompting business analyst Edward Williams from Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. to comment, "Sony redefined the role-playing game (RPG) category and expanded the conventional audience with the launch of "Final Fantasy VII"." By the end of 2005, the game had sold over 9.8 million copies worldwide, making it the highest-selling game in the "Final Fantasy" series. By the end of 2006, "The Best", the bargain reissue of the game, had sold over 158,000 copies in Japan. "Final Fantasy VII" is credited as "the game that sold the PlayStation", as well as allowing Japanese role-playing games to find a place in markets outside Japan. By May 2010, it had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, making it the most popular title in the series in terms of units sold. The original PC version surpassed Eidos' expectations: while initially forecast to sell 100,000 units, it quickly exceeded sales of one million units, garnering royalties of over $2 million for Square. As of August 2015, all physical and digital versions have sold over 11 million units worldwide.
