The agreement among Woods and Rand enabled him to procure partners on the off chance that he thought it fundamental, paying them a restricted bit of the creator's eminences. He initially contracted John Hayden to immediate, paying him one rate point from Rand's 10-percent eminence. Despite the fact that Hayden was an effective Broadway executive, Rand despised him and later called him "a ratty Broadway holder on". As tryouts for the play started in Philadelphia, Woods requested further content changes and was disappointed by Rand's refusal to make some of them. He connected with Louis Weitzenkorn, the creator of the past hit "Five Star Final", to go about as a content specialist. Rand's association with Weitzenkorn was more regrettable than hers with Woods or Hayden; she and Weitzenkorn contended over political contrasts just as his thoughts for the play. Woods gave Weitzenkorn another rate point from Rand's eminences without educating her. Rand recorded a case against Woods with the American Arbitration Association; she questioned Weitzenkorn accepting any segment of her eminences, and told the mediation board Weitzenkorn had added just a solitary line to the play, which was cut after the tryouts. After hearing this declaration, one of the mediators reacted suspiciously, "That was he did?" In two hearings, the board decided that Weitzenkorn ought to get his settled upon one percent, however that Woods couldn't deduct the installment from Rand's sovereignties since she had not been told ahead of time. Regardless of the question among Rand and Woods, the play opened at Shubert's Ambassador Theater on September 16, 1935, where it ran effectively for seven months. It shut on April 4, 1936, after 283 exhibitions.
