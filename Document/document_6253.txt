The bill, as changed, passed the Senate without recorded vote on March 27, 1936. The House of Representatives got the bill on April 1, and alluded it to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was accounted for back to the House on April 16, having been changed to require the Cleveland board of trustees to buy at the very least 25,000 coins at one time, wiping out the likelihood that the advisory group could arrange an underlying 5,000 and afterward neglect to buy any more. The full House thought about the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill announced by John Joseph Cochran of Missouri as a crisis measure. When he requested consistent agree to pass the changed bill, Pennsylvania's Robert F. Rich asked what number of coinage bills would have been considered and in the event that it would not be conceivable to unite twelve of them into one bill. Cochran answered that he had counseled with Ohio's Robert Crosser and been educated that "in the event that we don't get the specialist to print the coins now it will be futile". The next day, Bulkley moved that the Senate agree in the House revisions, which it did, and the bill was marked into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 5, 1936.
