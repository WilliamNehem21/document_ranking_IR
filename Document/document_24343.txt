The capital's navy had played a central role in the repulsion of the Arab sieges of Constantinople, but the exact date of the establishment of the Imperial Fleet (Î²Î±ÏÎ¹Î»Î¹Îºá½¸Ï ÏÏÏÎ»Î¿Ï, "basilikos stolos", or Î²Î±ÏÎ¹Î»Î¹Îºá½¸Î½ ÏÎ»ÏÏÎ¼Î¿Î½, "basilikon ploÃ¯mon") as a distinct command is unclear. The Irish historian J. B. Bury, followed by the French Byzantinist Rodolphe Guilland, considered it "not improbable" that the Imperial Fleet existed as a subordinate command under the "stratÄgos tÅn karabisianÅn" already in the 7th century. Certainly the "droungarios" of the Imperial Fleet first appears in the "Taktikon Uspensky" of c. 842/3; and as there is little evidence for major fleets operating from Constantinople during the 8th century, the Greek Byzantinist HÃ©lÃ¨ne Ahrweiler dated the fleet's creation to the early 9th century. From that point on, the Imperial Fleet formed the main naval reserve force and provided the core of various expeditionary fleets.
The first and for a long time only maritime theme (Î¸Î­Î¼Î± Î½Î±ÏÏÎ¹ÎºÏÎ½, "thema nautikon") was the Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots (, "thema KibyrrhaiotÅn"). It was created from the "Karabisianoi" fleet, and assigned to the administration and defence of the southern coasts of Asia Minor. The exact date of its creation is unclear, with one view proposing c. 719 and another c. 727. Its "stratÄgos", first mentioned in 734, was based at Attaleia. His principal lieutenants were the "katepanÅ" of the Mardaites, an "ek prosÅpou" (representative) at Syllaeum and "droungarioi" of Attaleia and Kos. Being located closest to the Muslim Levant, it remained the Empire's principal naval fleet for centuries, until it was reduced with the decline of the Arab naval threat. The fleet is last mentioned in 1043, and thereafter the theme became a purely civilian province.
