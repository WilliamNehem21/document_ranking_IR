The Russians attacked on a wide front with three armies. KoÅciuszko proposed that the entire Polish army be concentrated and engage one of the Russian armies, in order to assure numerical parity and boost the morale of the mostly inexperienced Polish forces with a quick victory; but Poniatowski rejected this plan. On May 22, 1792, the Russian forces crossed the border in Ukraine, where KoÅciuszko and Poniatowski were stationed. The Crown Army was judged too weak to oppose the four enemy columns advancing into West Ukraine, and began a fighting withdrawal to the western side of the Southern Bug River, with KoÅciuszko commanding the rear guard. On June 18, Poniatowski won the Battle of ZieleÅce; KoÅciuszko's division, on detached rear-guard duty, did not take part in the battle and rejoined the main army only at nightfall; nonetheless, his diligent protection of the main army's rear and flanks won him the newly created Virtuti Militari, to this day Poland's highest military decoration. (StoroÅ¼yÅski, however, states that KoÅciuszko received the Virtuti Militari for his later, July 18 victory at Dubienka.) The Polish withdrawal continued, and on July 7 KoÅciuszko's forces fought a delaying battle against the Russians at Volodymyr-Volynskyi (the Battle of WÅodzimierz). On reaching the northern Bug River, the Polish Army was split into three divisions to hold the river defensive lineâweakening the Poles' point numerical superiority, against KoÅciuszko's counsel of a single strong, concentrated army.
