Since King was the significant pledge drive, his partners asked him to venture to every part of the nation to collect safeguard cash for those captured. He had, be that as it may, recently guaranteed to lead the marchers to imprison in solidarity, yet delayed as the arranged date arrived. Some SCLC individuals became disappointed with his uncertainty. "I have never observed Martin so grieved", one of King's companions later said. In the wake of King asked and reflected alone in his lodging, he and the battle heads chose to resist the order and arranged for mass captures of crusade supporters. To fabricate assurance and to select volunteers to go to imprison, Ralph Abernathy talked at a mass gathering of Birmingham's dark natives at the sixth Avenue Baptist Church: "The eyes of the world are on Birmingham today around evening time. Bobby Kennedy is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is taking a gander at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is taking a gander at Birmingham. Is it accurate to say that you are prepared, would you say you are prepared to make the test? I am prepared to go to imprison, are you?"
