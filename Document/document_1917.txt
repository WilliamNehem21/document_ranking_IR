The story starts in the pre-day break hours as the youthful Nick Adams, his dad, his uncle and their Indian aides push over a lake to an adjacent Indian camp. Scratch's dad, a specialist, has been shouted to convey a child for a lady who has been in the process of giving birth for a considerable length of time. At the camp, they discover the lady in a lodge lying on a base bunkbed; her better half lies over her with a harmed foot. Scratch's dad is compelled to play out a caesarian task on the lady with a folding blade in light of the fact that the infant is in the breech position; he requests that Nick help by holding a bowl. The lady shouts all through the activity, and when Nick's uncle attempts to hold her down, she nibbles him. After the child is conveyed, Nick's dad swings to the lady's significant other on the top bunk and finds that he lethally cut his throat with a straight razor from ear to ear amid the activity. Scratch is conveyed of the lodge, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story closes with just Nick and his dad on the lake, paddling far from the camp. Scratch gets some information about birth and demise, and ponders internally that he will never pass on, as he watches his dad push.
