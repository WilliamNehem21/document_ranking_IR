One of Godwin's hotspots for his Lunar language was Trigault's "De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas". Gonsales gives two instances of spoken expressions, recorded in a figure later clarified by John Wilkins in "Mercury, or The Secret and Swift Messenger" (1641). Trigault's record of the Chinese language gave Godwin doling out tonality to the Lunar language, and of valuing it in the language verbally expressed by the Chinese mandarins Gonsales experiences after his arrival to Earth. Gonsales claims that rather than the large number of dialects in China (making their speakers commonly incomprehensible), the mandarins' language is general by temperance of tonality (he stifles it in different assortments of Chinese). In this manner the mandarins can keep up a social and profound prevalence looking like that of the Lunar privileged, which is to be set interestingly with the assortment of dialects spoken in a broke and ethically degenerate Europe and somewhere else. Knowlson contends that utilizing the expression "language" is exaggerating the case, and that figure is the best possible term: "notwithstanding Godwin's cases, this melodic 'language' isn't in truth a language by any stretch of the imagination, yet basically a figure in which the letters of a current language might be translated". He recommends Godwin's source may have been a book by Joan Baptista Porta, whose "De occultis literarum notis" (1606) contains "a precise depiction of the technique he was to receive".
