A standout amongst the most well-known geebungs, "Persoonia linearis" is found from the Macleay River catchment on the New South Wales Mid North Coast to the Tambo River in eastern Victoria. It is found from ocean level to heights of with a normal yearly precipitation of . It is a part of dry sclerophyll backwoods on both sandstone and mud soils. It develops in radiant to gently shaded zones in open timberland or forest with a shrubby understory. In the Sydney Basin, it is related with so much trees as Sydney peppermint ("Eucalyptus piperita"), silvertop fiery remains ("E.ÃÂ sieberi"), blue-leaved stringybark ("E.ÃÂ agglomerata"), blackbutt ("E.ÃÂ pilularis"), dim ironbark ("E.ÃÂ paniculata"), smart gum ("E.ÃÂ rossii"), Sydney blue gum ("E.ÃÂ saligna"), limited leaved stringybark ("E.ÃÂ sparsifolia") and smooth-woofed apple ("Angophora costata") and bushes, for example, "Grevillea obtusiflora", "G.ÃÂ phylicoides", Kowmung ("Hakea dohertyi"), long leaf smoke shrub ("Conospermum longifolium") and solid geebung ("Persoonia rigida"). In the region of Nowra and Jervis Bay, it is an understory segment of the across the board Currambene Lowlands Forest people group, nearby such plants as gorse severe pea ("Daviesia ulicifolia"), whiskery heath ("Leucopogon juniperinus") and local daphne ("Pittosporum undulatum") with spotted gum ("Corymbia maculata"), white stringybark ("Eucalyptus globoidea") and woollybutt ("E.ÃÂ longifolia") as the overwhelming trees. The tall dry sclerophyll woodland is on sloping landscape with great waste. The basic soil is a yellow topsoil beginning from mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.
