John Robinson, the legislative head of Essex County Jail, was then called by the safeguard. Robinson affirmed that amid Lamb's time in the region prison, his lead had been flawless with the exception of an occurrence five weeks before the preliminary, on 10 December 1966, when he had, for no evident reason, gone on what Robinson called a "frenzy". In a scene enduring three hours, the litigant had crushed more than 100 windows, set flame to covers and broken pipes, making cells flood. "I was astounded by what I saw," Robinson said. "The students were enlarged like somebody who comes in overwhelming on opiatesÃ¢ÂÂaside from their eyes seem soaked in and his were swell out." George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary at that point told the court that Lamb lived in a dream world, which had existed in his brain since early youth, and had been in a pre-maniacal state when discharged from prison on 8 June 1966. This, he stated, had bubbled over into an "intense schizoid scene" the evening of the shootings. In interrogation, Scott was squeezed with respect to why he had permitted Lamb's discharge from Kingston if this was the situation; he answered that in spite of the fact that the jail officers had been worried about Lamb's psychological state on his discharge, there had not been decisive grounds to confirm him crazy around then.
