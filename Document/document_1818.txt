Moderate stock memberships postponed looking over until June 1875, when a line was situated among Xenia and the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad (M&C, later a B&O line) west of Norwood. Property proprietors in the towns of Norwood and Pleasant Ridge, wishing to build up their territory as rural areas, set forward a suggestion to move the line toward the east through their territory in return with the expectation of complimentary option to proceed, and to fabricate a steam sham line among Norwood and the pony vehicle lines in Walnut Hills, which would give Miami Valley travelers a more straightforward access to downtown Cincinnati than the winding M&C. Be that as it may, in August, a much more straightforward course south of Norwood, through the tough Deer Creek Valley, was proposed, by which the Miami Valley could get its very own entrance to Cincinnati. In the wake of forcing substantial confinements, which would require the development of a few trestles and a passage, the Cincinnati City Council conceded the option to proceed through the valley, including Eden Park, to the railroad organization. The proprietors of the old CL&X grade sold it in April 1876 for $8,000 in supply of the new organization, and a large portion of the land outside Cincinnati had been purchased by that mid year. The Miami Valley settled in May 1876 to assemble just north to Waynesville, a town southwest of Xenia, where the anticipated Waynesville, Port William and Jeffersonville Railroad and Jeffersonville, Mt. Sterling and Columbus Railroad would reach out to Columbus, crossing the D&SE at Octa. (The previous finished the vast majority of its line, however deserted it in 1887; the last was just ready to review a segment.)
