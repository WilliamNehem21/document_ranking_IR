Howarth said he wanted to depict a recovered Todd, and that the show would be in an ideal situation finding "a Todd who won't article to the material." He consequently left the arrangement for a year. In the October 24, 1995 "Cleanser Opera Digest" issue, he stated:In the starting, the character of Todd was fruitful. I'll generally be pleased with this story, since it was the consequence of a genuine collaboration. It was one of those terrific occasions when the essayist, maker, chief, grasps, designers and on-screen characters were all on a similar wavelength. Everyone was progressing in the direction of a shared objective. My assignment, at the time, was to demonstrate the humankind of somebody who was fundamentally barbaric. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, yet he was certainly a genuine maniac. Todd was a sequential attacker. He assaulted Carol Swift. At that point, he assaulted Marty Saybrooke, and that assault was severe, serious, fierce and reasonable. There were allusions he had assaulted other ladies previously. He stalked Nora, he stalked and attempted to assault Luna. [Then-Executive Producer] Linda Gottlieb let me know with sensible sureness that ["One Life to Live"] would not endeavor to reclaim Todd. Along these lines, I didn't figure the character would change. At that point about a year back, it turned out to be obvious to me they were taking the character on an alternate wayÃ¢ÂÂthey were reclaiming him. In my brain, I'd been procured to play Todd Manning, an extremely sensible, genuine insane person. However at this point, the forces that-be needed me to play Todd Lord. What's more, the narrative of Todd Lord isn't reasonableÃ¢ÂÂit's a fantasy. I figured, "It would be best for the show if I somehow happened to leave." That's the point at which I offered my renunciation.
