Very quickly after, the Spanish Army and the Spanish Ministry of Defense started to search for a future Spanish tank. This transformed into the Lince tank program. Regardless of various offers the Lince program fizzled, both for monetary reasons and as a result of the choice to rather modernize the current armada of AMX-30Es, and to obtain a substantial number of American M60 Patton tanks to supplant the armada of more seasoned Patton tanks. Over portion of the AMX-30Es were moved up to a standard known as the AMX-30EM2, while the rest endured a progressively limited alteration known as the AMX-30EM1. In any case, the M60s and modernized AMX-30Es did not give Spain an adequately current tank for the following century. In 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense started to consult with the German government over the buy of the Leopard 2. Eventually, 108 Leopard 2A4s were acquired and coordinated into the Spanish Army, while 219 Leopard 2Es were worked in Spain, in view of the German Leopard 2A6. The Leopard 2E and Leopard 2A4 supplanted the armada of M60 Patton tanks, while Spain's AMX-30EM2s were supplanted by Italian B1 Centauro against tank mounted force vehicles. By and by, the Spanish Army has 108 Leopard 2A4s and 219 Leopard 2Es.
