St. John and the writers received praise for the recast, and for successfully re-integrating Todd into the show's canvas. "Soap Opera Weekly" stated, "They said it couldn't be done. "One Life to Live's" Todd (previously played by Roger Howarth) could not be recast. But with an appealing actor and the right pacing, "One Life to Live" may just have done it". The magazine stated that the writers revealed Todd's identity slowly, letting Walker develop as a character before dropping hints that he might be Todd. By the time he disclosed who he really was to his daughter Starr, the audience had already suspected the truth. "Soap Opera Weekly" called the reveal scene between St. John and Alderson, who played Starr, "one of those great (and, these days, rare) must-see moments". "Soap Opera Digest" said that despite the recast, a difficult situation in and of itself, "St. John aptly distinguished between Walker, who's really Todd, as well as Flynn, who pretended to be Walker". The magazine stated that St. John revealed glimmers of Todd to the audience: "We could see Todd when Walker lowered his eyes while holding back from telling his sister, Viki; with fiancee Blair, Walker's gaze was always shifting, making sure nothing could clue her in to his secret". The article also credited St. John with maintaining "the [uniquely scheming] relationship of Todd and Starr" and for keeping their scenes touching and delightful.
