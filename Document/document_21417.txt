The dust is constantly being removed from the main ring by a combination of PoyntingâRobertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000Â years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1Â cm to 0.5Â km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrowâabout 1000Â kmâand bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5Â km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by "New Horizons" spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and "Cassini" observations, was near 4Â km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.
