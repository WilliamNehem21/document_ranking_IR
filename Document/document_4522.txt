In 1210 King John fined Neville 1,000 imprints since he had permitted Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, to encase some chasing grounds without imperial authorization; in spite of the fact that Roches was near the lord, his activity was an encroachment of the regal backwoods. Neville's extensive fine was most likely a notice that the lord was not kidding about upholding the woodland law; it was in the end repealed. In 1213 Neville was set accountable for the seaports along the southwest English coast from Cornwall to Hampshire, yet some time in 1213 it creates the impression that he tumbled from imperial support, despite the fact that the conditions are obscure. A fine of 6,000 imprints was evaluated on him for enabling two detainees to get away, just as other unrecorded offenses, despite the fact that the lord did therefore transmit 1,000 signs of the fine. In 1215 Neville lost his office of boss forester. He was available at Runnymede for the marking of "Magna Carta" and was referenced in the introduction as one of King John's councilors, just as filling in as an observer to the archive. Roger of Wendover, a writer writing in 1211, recorded Neville as one of King John's "detestable advisors".
