In the rest of the wartime months Ferrier kept on going all through the nation, to satisfy the developing requests for her administrations from show advertisers. At Leeds in November 1944 she sang the piece of the Angel in Elgar's choral work "The Dream of Gerontius", her first execution in what wound up a standout amongst her best-known jobs. In December she met John Barbirolli while taking a shot at another Elgar piece, "Ocean Pictures"; the conductor later wound up one of her dearest companions and most grounded backers. On 15 September 1945 Ferrier made her presentation at the London Proms, when she sang "L'Air des Adieux" from Tchaikovsky's musical drama "The Maid of Orleans". In spite of the fact that she frequently sang individual arias, musical drama was not Ferrier's common specialty; she had not delighted in singing the title job in a show adaptation of Bizet's "Carmen" at Stourbridge in March 1944, and for the most part maintained a strategic distance from comparative commitment. By and by, Benjamin Britten, who had heard her Westminster Abbey "Savior" execution, influenced her to make the job of Lucretia in his new musical drama "The Rape of Lucretia", which was to open the primary after war Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. She would impart the part to Nancy Evans. In spite of her underlying second thoughts, by early July Ferrier was keeping in touch with her operator that she was "getting a charge out of [the rehearsals] colossally and I should believe it's the best section one could have".
