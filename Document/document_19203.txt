At this point, Namco had not considered any Western release for the game. "Katamari Damacy" was first shown in the United States at the Experimental Gameplay Workshop during the March 2004 Game Developers Conference. A group of Western developers from the International Game Developers Association had previously brought "Mojib-Ribbon" to the 2003 Experimental Gameplay Workshop after seeing it demonstrated at the 2002 TGS, and had been at the 2003 TGS to look for a similar title to exhibit in 2004. Discovering "Katamari Damacy" as an ideal title to exhibit, the group arranged with Namco to have Takahashi come to the United States to present the game. The press reaction to the session was described as "electric", but were disappointed to learn from Takahashi that there were no plans for a Western release. Media attention to the game from the Workshop, often called "Namco's snowball simulator", led to more pressure on Namco for a Western release. Takahashi was again invited to come present the game at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Players wanting the game to release in the West also wrote to Namco for a release. By July 2004, Namco officially announced the game's in the United States in September 2004. The game was never officially released in Europe on the PlayStation 2, though its subsequent sequels would receive European releases.
