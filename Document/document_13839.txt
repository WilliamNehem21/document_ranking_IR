Amid the last Allied hostile in Italy, the contingent was appointed to the new ninth New Zealand Infantry Brigade, which was distributed as the divisional save in April for Operation Buckland. At first, the contingent secured the architects connecting the Senio. At the point when the extensions were done, it secured the open flank around Barbiano coming about because of a postponement to the third Carpathian Division. The force at that point assaulted Massa Lombarda in anticipation of an intersection of the Sillaro stream, boarding Kangaroo APCs and pushing ahead. Tiger tanks constrained the regiment to descent and delve in before the Tigers were thumped out by Allied ordnance. An and C Squadrons bolstered the 22nd Battalion in assaulting Squazzaloca. The unit achieved the Sillaro River, crossed it at first light and was eased by the 27th Battalion on 15 April. D Squadron cleared Sesto Imolese of Axis troops, with An and BÃÂ Squadrons securing the left flank. On 16Ã¢ÂÂ 17 April, the legion ensured the correct flank behind the 22nd Battalion. The assault over the Gaiana started with a huge ordnance flood amid the evening of 18 April. In spite of the fact that the legion crossed the waterway unopposed, it was counter-assaulted past the flood territory. Progressing against hardened Axis opposition, An and CÃÂ Squadrons were on the most distant side of the Quaderna Canal by 01:30 on 19 April. The brigade delved in there, opposing Axis counter-assaults; eleven men from the force were slaughtered and 47 injured.
