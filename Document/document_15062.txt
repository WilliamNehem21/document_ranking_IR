There was concern about events in Spain and about the legitimacy of local governors in Upper Peru as well. On MayÂ 25, 1809, the Chuquisaca Revolution deposed RamÃ³n GarcÃ­a de LeÃ³n y Pizarro as Governor of Chuquisaca and replaced him with Juan Antonio Alvarez de Arenales. On JulyÂ 16, the La Paz revolution, led by Colonel Pedro Domingo Murillo, deposed the Governor of La Paz and elected a new junta. A swift reaction from the Spanish authorities defeated those rebellions. An army of 1,000Â men sent from Buenos Aires found no resistance at Chuquisaca, took control of the city and overthrew the Junta. Murillo tried to defend La Paz, but his 800Â militiamen were completely outnumbered by the more than 5,000 soldiers sent from Lima. He and the other leaders were later beheaded, and their heads were exhibited as a deterrent. These measures contrasted sharply with the pardon that MartÃ­n de Ãlzaga and others had received after a short time in prison, and the resentment of criollos against the peninsulars deepened. Juan JosÃ© Castelli was present at the deliberations of the University of Chuquisaca, where Bernardo Monteagudo developed the "Syllogism of Chuquisaca", a legal explanation to justify self-governance. This influenced his ideas during the "May Week".
