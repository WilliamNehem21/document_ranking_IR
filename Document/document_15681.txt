The "WeilÃ¼e" by Yu Huan (c. 239â265 AD), preserved in annotations to the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" (published in 429 AD by Pei Songzhi), also provides details about the easternmost portion of the Roman world, including mention of the Mediterranean Sea. For Roman Egypt, the book explains the location of Alexandria, travelling distances along the Nile and the tripartite division of the Nile Delta, Heptanomis, and Thebaid. In his "Zhu Fan Zhi", the Song-era Quanzhou customs inspector Zhao Rugua (1170â1228 AD) described the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria. Both the "Book of the Later Han" and the "WeilÃ¼e" mention the "flying" pontoon bridge () over the Euphrates at Zeugma, Commagene in Roman Anatolia. The "WeilÃ¼e" also listed what it considered the most important dependent vassal states of the Roman Empire, providing travel directions and estimates for the distances between them (in Chinese miles, "li"). Friedrich Hirth (1885) identified the locations and dependent states of Rome named in the "WeilÃ¼e"; some of his identifications have been disputed. Hirth identified Si-fu () as Emesa; John E. Hill (2004) uses linguistic and situational evidence to argue it was Petra in the Nabataean Kingdom, which was annexed by Rome in 106 AD during the reign of Trajan.
