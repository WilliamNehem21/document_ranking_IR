The name "Oryzomys" was introduced in 1857 by Spencer Fullerton Baird for the marsh rice rat (now "Oryzomys palustris") of the eastern United States, which had been first described twenty years earlier by Richard Harlan. The name combines the Greek "oryza" "rice" and "mys" "mouse" and refers to the feeding habits of the marsh rice rat. Baird placed "Oryzomys" as a subgenus of the now-defunct genus "Hesperomys" and included only the marsh rice rat in it, a classification which was followed by Elliott Coues in 1874 and 1877. In 1890, "Oryzomys" was raised to generic rank, and in subsequent years numerous additional species were ascribed to it, many of which were soon moved to separate genera. In the 1898 "Catalogus Mammalium", Ãdouard Louis Trouessart listed 67Â species of "Oryzomys", including some that are now placed in "Calomys", "Necromys", "Thomasomys", and other genera unrelated to "Oryzomys". Some of the new genera proposed were soon subsumed in "Oryzomys" again, and in "The Families and Genera of Living Rodents" (1941), John Ellerman listed "Microryzomys", "Oligoryzomys", "Melanomys", "Nesoryzomys", and "Oecomys" as synonyms of "Oryzomys" and included about 127Â species in it. In 1948, Philip Hershkovitz suggested that other oryzomyines like "Nectomys" and "Megalomys" could as well be included in "Oryzomys", and Clayton Ray followed this suggestion in 1962.
