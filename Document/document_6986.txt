The skull of "Heterodontosaurus" was little yet powerfully assembled. The two most total skulls estimated (holotype example SAM-PK-K337) and (example SAM-PK-K1332) long. The skull was lengthened, tight, and triangular when seen from the side, with the most astounding point being the sagittal peak, from where the skull inclined down towards the nose tip. The back of the skull finished in a snare like shape, which was balanced to the quadrate bone. The circle (enlightening) was vast and roundabout, and a substantial goad like bone, the palpebral, jutted in reverse into the upper piece of the opening. Beneath the eye attachment, the jugal bone offered ascend to a sideways anticipating manager, or horn-like structure. The jugal bone additionally shaped a "sharp edge" that made a space together with a rib on the pterygoid bone, for controlling the movement of the lower jaw. Ventrally, the antorbital fossa was limited by a noticeable hard edge, to which the creature's beefy cheek would have been connected. The relatively huge lower worldly fenestra was egg-formed and tilted back, and situated behind the enlightening. The curved upper transient fenestra was unmistakable just taking a gander at the highest point of the skull. The left and right upper worldly fenestrae were isolated by the sagittal peak, which would have given horizontal connection surfaces to the jaw musculature in the living creature.
