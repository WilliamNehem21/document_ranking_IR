The 2017 traveler pigeon hereditary examination likewise discovered that, notwithstanding its substantial populace measure, the hereditary assorted variety was extremely low in the species. The creators proposed this was a reaction of common determination, which hypothesis and past observational examinations recommended could have a specific extraordinary effect on species with extensive and firm populaces. Regular choice can decrease hereditary assorted variety over expanded locales of a genome through 'specific breadths' or 'foundation determination'. The creators discovered proof of a quicker rate of versatile development and quicker expulsion of unsafe changes in traveler pigeons contrasted with band-followed pigeons, which are some of traveler pigeons' nearest living relatives. They additionally discovered proof of lower hereditary assorted variety in locales of the traveler pigeon genome that have lower rates of hereditary recombination. This is normal if common determination, by means of particular ranges or foundation choice, decreased their hereditary assorted variety, however not if populace unsteadiness did. The investigation presumed that before recommendation that populace unsteadiness added to the elimination of the species was invalid. Developmental researcher A. Townsend Peterson said of the two traveler pigeon hereditary examinations (distributed in 2014 and 2017) that, however the possibility of outrageous changes in the traveler pigeon populace was "profoundly settled in," he was induced by the 2017 investigation's contention, because of its "inside and out examination" and "huge information assets."
