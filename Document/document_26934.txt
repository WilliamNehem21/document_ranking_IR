Skiing resumed on Joppenbergh in the 1960s. The Rosendale Nordic Ski Club was organized on JanuaryÂ 11, 1964, and immediately created the Joppenbergh Mountain Corporation (JMC) to manage the Joppenbergh property. Three hundred shares of stock were issued for the JMC, priced at $100 per share, to build a new slopeand to buy the mountain itself for $20,000 from its owner, Mary Sammons. The JMC gained control of the property on AugustÂ 20, 1964, and immediately announced its intent to build a new ski slope on the site of the original one, as well as a parking lot capable of holding 10,000 cars. The goal of the club was to make Rosendale the "Nordic Ski Capital of the East". A new slope was completed on NovemberÂ 14, 1965, and augmented by a snowmaking system to provide artificial snow. When a ski jumping competition was held on JanuaryÂ 30, 1966, skier Leif Bringslimark achieved a jump from the new slope. Competitions were held JanuaryÂ 22, 1967 and JanuaryÂ 27, 1968. The winner of the 1968 tournament was Per Coucheron, a 22-year-old Dartmouth student who reached . The slope was icy prior to the competition; a snowmaking machine was used the night before the jump, and club members, as well as the competitors themselves, "help[ed] manicure the slope". When the jump began, the slope was in fine condition.
