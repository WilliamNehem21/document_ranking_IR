In Longacre's first years as boss etcher, no unique plans were required for coins. Gobrecht had updated each group of U.S. coinage somewhere in the range of 1835 and 1842, and his successor had sufficient energy to learn expressions essential for coin creation that he had not required as a creator of print inscriptions. These expressions included coin configuration, creation of punches for plan components, and pass on sinking. Longacre's work in the private area had included cutting lines into a copper plate which was then used to print proliferations. Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker that Longacre "is an honorable man of superb character, exceedingly respected in this network, and has gained some superstar as an etcher of copper; however he isn't a Die-Sinker. To be sure I don't have the foggiest idea about that he has ever constructed an endeavor in this workmanship." By December of that year, the Mint chief had kept in touch with Walker in acclaim for Longacre, expressing that the etcher had "more taste and judgment in making gadgets for an improved coinage here than have been displayed by any of his ancestors. He has indicated too that he is very capable to make the required model from his illustrations." Taxay ascribed Patterson's rich recognition of Longacre to proceeded with endeavors by Leonard to pick up the post of boss etcher.
