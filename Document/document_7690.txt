In 738 the interlinked fortunes of QuiriguÃÂ¡ and CopÃÂ¡n took a staggering alter of course when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, ruling master of QuiriguÃÂ¡, caught the incredible, however older thirteenth lord of CopÃÂ¡n, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who had introduced him on his royal position in 725. This overthrow does not appear to have influenced either CopÃÂ¡n or QuiriguÃÂ¡ physically, there is no proof that either city was assaulted right now and the victor appears not to have gotten any distinguishable tribute. QuiriguÃÂ¡ appears to be somewhat to have picked up its autonomy and the control of vital exchange courses. An engraving at QuiriguÃÂ¡, albeit hard to translate, proposes that the catch occurred on 27 April 738, when QuiriguÃÂ¡ seized and consumed the wooden pictures of CopÃÂ¡n's benefactor gods. The majority of this appears to infer that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat figured out how to by one way or another snare Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, as opposed to have vanquished him in out and out fight. In the Classic Period the statues of Maya gods regularly were conveyed into fight on palanquins, encouraging their catch in case of annihilation. It has been recommended that the lord of CopÃÂ¡n was endeavoring to assault another site so as to verify hostages for penance, and was trapped by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his QuiriguÃÂ¡ warriors.
