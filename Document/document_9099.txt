In mid-November Governor Viesca, who had been liberated by thoughtful fighters, came to Goliad. The leader at Goliad, Philip Dimmitt invited Viesca however would not perceive his position as senator. This caused a hubbub in the army; many upheld the senator, while others trusted that Texas ought to be an autonomous nation and ought to along these lines not perceive the Mexican representative. Viesca ventured out to San Felipe to meet with the General Council, who likewise would not perceive his power as representative. Viesca joined a few others in upholding an arrangement to assault centralist troops in Matamoros. They trusted this Matamoros Expedition would motivate other federalist states to revolt and keep the exhausted Texian troops from leaving the military. In particular, it would move the battle area outside of Texas. The senator at first bolstered the arrangement, and requested that Houston sort out the endeavor; Houston named James Bowie to lead the campaign, yet Bowie did not get his requests for half a month. The Council solicited Burleson, the leader of the volunteers at Bexar, to lead the endeavor. Burleson had just surrendered, and his chosen substitution, Johnson, rather got the message. While Johnson ventured to San Felipe to meet with the Council, on December 30, Johnson's confidant, James Grant drove 200 men from BÃÂ©xar to head out to Goliad to get ready for the undertaking. Just 100 Texians stayed at the Alamo Mission in Bexar, under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel James C. Neill. Neill was disturbed that Johnson had stripped the Alamo of practically all arrangements and most of the men and sent a solid message to Houston requesting fortifications and more supplies.36 individuals go to the discussion
