In 1881, Alphonse Milne-Edwards described two new species in the genus "Triaenops" on the basis of specimens supposedly collected by LÃ©on Humblot on Madagascar: the reddish "Triaenops rufus" and the larger, gray "T. humbloti". Jean Dorst, who reviewed Madagascan "Triaenops" in 1947, retained both as separate species; in another review, published in 1982, John Edwards Hill considered the two to represent the same species. In 1994, Karl Koopman considered "rufus" itself to be part of the Middle Eastern and mainland African species "Triaenops persicus", a possibility Hill had discussed, but most authors regarded the two as distinct species. In 2006, Julie Ranivo and Steven Goodman revised Madagascan "Triaenops" and found little variation among specimens of "T.Â rufus" from throughout the dry parts of the island. Three years later, they published another paper which showed that the original material of "T.Â rufus" and "T.Â humbloti" was distinct from Madagascan specimens identified as ""Triaenops rufus"" and more similar to "T.Â persicus". On his journey to Madagascar, Humblot had stayed in Somalia and Yemen, and Goodman and Ranivo concluded that he had probably collected the "Triaenops" there, after which their provenance was incorrectly recorded. Thus, "rufus" and "humbloti" cannot be used for the Madagascan species, and Goodman and Ranivo proposed the new name "Triaenops menamena" for the species formerly known as "T.Â rufus". The specific name "menamena" is Malagasy for "reddish", referring to the animal's coloration. "Rufous trident bat" has been used as a common name for "Triaenops rufus".
