Leaving Lebanon, the line climbed a little gorge and afterward traveled north-northeasterly over the good countries to Dodds. The never-utilized evaluation from Dodds to Waynesville dropped into the Little Miami River valley by means of Newman Run before turning north and completion at the last town. Bits of the option to proceed and stone projections for a few never-manufactured extensions stay on what is currently farmland. The line as finished turned north at Dodds, and required a few slices and fills to navigate the moving landscape. At Hempstead, only north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The first course proceeded with north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old Dayton and South Eastern Railroad (presently the Iron Horse Trail) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 augmentation was manufactured parallel to the ex-D&SE, and finished at the Panhandle Route (presently the Creekside Trail toward the east) at Clement. Some portion of this line is still worked by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and toward the south the option to proceed is being utilized for an expansion of the Iron Horse Trail. The other branch traveled northwesterly into downtown Dayton, relentlessly plunging as it passed south of the University of Dayton and close by the Great Miami River. The principle traveler and cargo warehouses were at Washington Street, which the CL&N disregarded on the main such level detachment in Dayton. The principal cargo stop opened with the line in 1912, and was supplanted in 1930 by a bigger structure, itself torn down in 1966.
