On OctoberÂ 9, the government of Belize issued the "all clear" signal, indicating that the storm had fully passed, and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment. The government declared Stann Creek and Toledo districts as disaster areas, and officials declared a nighttime curfew. By the day after the storm struck, the airport in Belize City had been reopened, and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal. Residents in the southern part of the country lost access to fresh water, forcing them to drink unclean water. Officials sent medical teams to southern Belize in the most affected areas. The Belmopan Red Cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money, clothing, and food for storm victims. The Red Cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000Â people. By OctoberÂ 19, most roads in southern Belize were reopened. The Belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs, and officials authorized spending $1.2Â million to rebuild damaged homes. To assist the farmers who lost crops, the Belize government provided of maize seeds, as well as fertilizer. After the storm, the World Food Programme and the Belize Red Cross collectively provided food for the 9,000Â families in need of subsidence. By OctoberÂ 31, the Red Cross had provided blankets, tarps, and hygienic supplies to 4,800Â people severely affected by the storm. Homes were gradually repaired, and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. Around Christmas of 2001, the Belize Red Cross provided presents to school children in 14Â villages affected by the storm. The lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22% in 2002, although sales gradually recovered.
