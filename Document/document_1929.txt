The upset had expansive help among U.S. legislators. Student of history Piero Gleijeses composes that the outside arrangement of both Republican and Democratic gatherings communicated an obstinate attestation of U.S. authority over Central America, making them inclined to seeing socialist dangers where none existed. Consequently Eisenhower's continuation of the Monroe Doctrine had proceeded with bipartisan help. The upset met with solid negative responses in Latin America; a rush of hostile to United States dissents pursued the oust of ÃÂrbenz. These feelings persevered for quite a few years a while later; students of history have indicated the upset as a purpose behind the antagonistic gathering given to U.S. VP Richard Nixon when he visited Latin America four years after the fact. A State Department examine found that negative open responses to the overthrow had happened in eleven Latin American nations, including a not many that were generally genius American. Student of history John Lewis Gaddis expresses that information of the CIA's job in overthrows in Iran and Guatemala gave the office "a practically mythic notoriety all through Latin America and the Middle East as an instrument with which the United States could remove governments it loathed, at whatever point it wished to do as such".
