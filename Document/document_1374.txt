Before the development of Wembley Stadium in 1923, the FA Cup Final was facilitated by various distinctive grounds around England including Old Trafford. The first of these was the 1911 FA Cup Final replay between Bradford City and Newcastle United, after the first tie at Crystal Palace completed as a no-score draw after additional time. Bradford won 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0, the objective scored by Jimmy Speirs, in a match viewed by 58,000 individuals. The ground's second FA Cup Final was the 1915 last between Sheffield United and Chelsea. Sheffield United won the match 3Ã¢ÂÂ 0 before about 50,000ÃÂ spectators, the greater part of whom were in the military, prompting the last being nicknamed "the Khaki Cup Final". On 27 December 1920, Old Trafford played host to its biggest pre-Second World War participation for a United class coordinate, as 70,504 observers viewed the Red Devils lose 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1 to Aston Villa. The ground facilitated its first worldwide football coordinate soon thereafter, when England lost 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 to Scotland before 49,429ÃÂ spectators on 17 April 1926. Strangely, the record participation at Old Trafford isn't for a Manchester United home diversion. Rather, on 25 March 1939, 76,962ÃÂ people viewed a FA Cup semi-last between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town.
