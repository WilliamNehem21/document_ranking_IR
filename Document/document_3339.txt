In mid 918, ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d verified the accommodation of Leicester without a battle, and the Danes of Northumbrian York offered her their devotion, likely for security against Norse (Norwegian) Vikings who had attacked Northumbria from Ireland, however she kicked the bucket on 12 June before she could take up the proposition. A similar offer isn't known to have been made to Edward, and the Norse Vikings took York in 919. As indicated by the principle West Saxon form of the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle", after ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d's passing the Mercians submitted to Edward, yet the Mercian rendition (the "Mercian Register") expresses that in December 918 her girl ÃÂlfwynn "was denied of all specialist in Mercia and taken into Wessex". Mercia may have made an offered for proceeded with semi-freedom which was smothered by Edward, and it at that point went under his immediate standard. Stamford had surrendered to Edward before ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d's demise, and Nottingham did likewise without further ado a while later. As per the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" for 918, "every one of the general population who had settled in Mercia, both Danish and English, submitted to him". This would imply that he governed all England south of the Humber, however it isn't evident whether Lincoln was a special case, as coins of Viking York in the mid 920s were likely printed at Lincoln. Some Danish jarls were permitted to keep their homes, in spite of the fact that Edward likely likewise compensated his supporters with land, and some he kept in his very own hands. Coin proof proposes that his power was more grounded in the East Midlands than in East Anglia. Three Welsh rulers, Hywel Dda, Clydog and Idwal Foel, who had recently been liable to ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d, presently gave their loyalty to Edward.
