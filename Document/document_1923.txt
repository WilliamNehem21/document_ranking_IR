Disagreements about the elucidation of the settlement drove the Spartans to dispatch diplomats to Athens with full powers to orchestrate every single agitated issue. The Athenians at first got these envoys well, however Alcibiades met with them in mystery before they were to address the ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) and revealed to them that the Assembly was haughty and had extraordinary desire. He asked them to disavow their strategic specialist to speak to Sparta, and rather enable him to help them through his impact in Athenian legislative issues. The delegates concurred and, awed with Alcibiades, they estranged themselves from Nicias, who really needed to achieve a concurrence with the Spartans. The following day, amid the Assembly, Alcibiades asked them what powers Sparta had allowed them to arrange and they answered, as concurred, that they had not accompanied full and free powers. This was in direct logical inconsistency to what they had said the day preceding, and Alcibiades seized on this chance to condemn their character, cast doubt on their points, and wreck their believability. This ploy expanded Alcibiades' standing while at the same time humiliating Nicias, and Alcibiades was along these lines delegated General. He exploited his expanding capacity to coordinate the production of a partnership between Argos, Mantinea, Elis, and different states in the Peloponnese, compromising Sparta's predominance in the locale. As per Gomme, "it was a pompous plan for an Athenian general at the leader of a for the most part Peloponnesian armed force to walk through the Peloponnese positioning a snook at Sparta when her notoriety was at its least". This partnership, in any case, would at last be crushed at the Battle of Mantinea.
