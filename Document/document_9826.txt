As Scott's men achieved an open prairie close to the Wea settlement of Ouiatenon on June1, they were found by a foe scout and rushed to assault the towns before the occupants could respond. At the point when the primary power achieved the towns, they found the inhabitants hastily escaping over the Wabash River in kayaks. Helped by spread flame from a Kickapoo town on the opposite side of the stream, they had the capacity to escape before Scott's men could assault. The stream was too wide to even think about fording at Scott's area, so he sent a separation under James Wilkinson one way and a separation under Thomas Barbee in the other to discover a spot to passage the waterway. Wilkinson did not locate an appropriate area, yet found and slaughtered a little band of Indians before returning. Barbee found an intersection and led a concise assault against the Indians on the opposite side before coming back to Scott. The following morning, Scott's fundamental power consumed the close-by towns and harvests, while a separation under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The occupants of this town had fled crosswise over Eel Creek, and after a brief and insufficient firefight, Wilkinson's men consumed the city and came back to Scott. In his official report, Scott noticed that a large number of Kethtippecannunk's occupants were French and guessed that it was associated with, maybe subordinate upon, the French settlement of Detroit.
