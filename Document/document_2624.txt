Canning returned at about 10ÃÂ pm on 29ÃÂ January 1753. At seeing her little girl, whom she had not seen for right around a month, Elizabeth Canning swooned. When recuperated she sent James Lord to get a few neighbors, and inside just a couple of minutes the house was full. Elizabeth was depicted as being in a "woeful condition"; her face and hands were dark with earth, she wore a move, a slip, and a bedgown. A messy cloth tied around her head was splashed with blood from an injured ear. As per her story she had been assaulted by two men close Bedlam Hospital. They had incompletely stripped her, ransacked her and hit her in the sanctuary, rendering her oblivious. She stirred "by a substantial street, where was water, with the two men that victimized me" and was compelled to stroll to a house, where an elderly person inquired as to whether she would "go their direction" (become a whore). Canning had cannot, and the lady remove her girdle, slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a space. There the youthful maidservant had stayed for just about a month, without any guests and existing just on bread and water. The attire she wore she had rummaged from a chimney in the space. Canning had inevitably made her break by pulling a few sheets from a window and strolling the five-hour venture home. She heard the name "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she perceived, thought she had been hung on the Hertford Road. On this proof, John Wintlebury and a neighborhood apprentice, Robert Scarrat, distinguished the house as that of "Mother" Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, about far off.
