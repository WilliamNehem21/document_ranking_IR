On the fundamental Union guarded line, beginning around 9ÃÂ a.m., Prentiss' and W. H. L. Wallace's divisions built up and held a position nicknamed the "Hornet's Nest", in a field along a street, presently prevalently called the "Indented Road," in spite of the fact that there is minimal physical defense for that name. The Confederates ambushed the situation for a few hours as opposed to just bypassing it, and endured overwhelming losses. Students of history's evaluations of the quantity of discrete charges go from 8 to 14. The Union powers to one side and right of the Nest were constrained back, making Prentiss' position an unmistakable point in the line. Coordination inside the Nest was poor, and units pulled back dependent on their individual administrators' choices. The weight expanded when W. H. L. Wallace, administrator of the biggest centralization of troops in the position, was mortally injured while endeavoring to lead a breakout from the Confederate enclosure. Association regiments wound up disarranged and organizations broke down as the Confederates, driven by Brig. Gen. Daniel Ruggles, collected in excess of 50 guns into "Ruggles' Battery", the biggest convergence of mounted guns at any point gathered in North America up to that point, to shoot the line at short proximity. Confederates encompassed the Hornet's Nest, and it fell in the wake of waiting for seven hours. Prentiss surrendered himself and the remaining parts of his division to the Confederates. A vast part of the Union survivors, an expected 2,200 to 2,400 men, were caught, however their penance purchased time for Grant to set up a last protection line close Pittsburg Landing.
