The Natchez were stationary and lived in nine semi-self-ruling towns; the French thought of them as the most humanized clan of the locale. By 1700 the Natchez' numbers had been diminished to around 3,500 by the ailments that attacked indigenous populaces in the wake of contact with Europeans, and by 1720 further plagues had divided that populace. Their general public was carefully isolated into an honorable class called "the Suns" (Natchez: ') and an average person class brought in French "the Stinkards" (Natchez: '). Somewhere in the range of 1699 and 1702, the Natchez got the traveler Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in harmony and enabled a French preacher to settle among them. As of now, the Natchez were at war with the Chickasaw individuals, who had gotten firearms from their English partners, and the Natchez expected to profit likewise from their connection with the French. Regardless, the British nearness in the region drove the Natchez to part into star British and genius French groups. The focal town, called Natchez or the Grand Village, was driven by the principal boss Great Sun (Natchez: "") and the war boss Tattooed ("Serpent PiquÃÂ©" in the French sources, Natchez "obalalkabiche"), both of whom were keen on seeking after a coalition with the French.
