The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13Â matches on tour, losingÂ 16 and drawingÂ 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1Â not out and in the second, 5Â runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28Â first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288Â runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52Â wickets at an average of 21.75. "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack" wrote, "Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal ofÂ ...Â Trumble" but his "straightness and regular length [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety".
