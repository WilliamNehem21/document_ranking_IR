The back spread is enlivened all the more basically, with no raised components and absolutely geometric beautification of engraved lines, which are filled in with two shades which currently show up as the brilliant yellow and the dim shading, when evidently blue. Inside a few confining lines making square shapes of comparative extents to the spread itself, a focal rectangular board is set apart with pricks to make a network of 3mm squares, 21 tall and 10 wide. Lines on the framework are engraved and hued in yellow to shape two ventured "crosses", or squares remaining on one corner, with extra ventured components in the four corners and most of the way up the vertical sides, between the two "crosses". The vertical hub line down the network and the two flat tomahawks through the crosses are likewise hued in the yellow color ideal to the edges of the framework. The rest of the lines on the lattice and every one of the lines along the edges of the network are shaded in obscurity shading. This is a straightforward rendition of the kind of configuration found on Insular rug pages, just as in Coptic composition enrichment and materials, and little ventured crosses enliven the primary boards of the popular Sutton Hoo bear catches. The arrangement of the different external surrounding lines with the deepest edge and the board with the lattice is recognizably blemished, as the top encircling line was stretched out excessively far to one side. Hints of an uncoloured first endeavor at this line can be seen on the correct hand side, over the hued line.
