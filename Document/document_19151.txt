After the war, Beach Thomas stayed in Germany until 1919 and returned there in 1923 at the time of the Occupation of the Ruhr. He also undertook a tour of the world for the "Daily Mail" and "The Times" in 1922. His main focus returned to his lifelong interest in matters of the countryside, notably in his writings for "The Observer" from 1923 to 1956. Beach Thomas was also a regular contributor of notes on nature, gardening and country life to "The Spectator" for almost 30 years, with some short breaks between 1935 and 1941, when H. E. Bates took responsibility. In 1928 he produced a history of the magazine under the title of "The Story of the 'Spectator", in commemoration of its centenary. He wrote many more books and articles in his later years, as well as two autobiographical books: "A Traveller in News" (1925) and "The Way of a Countryman" (1944). Fond of peppering quotations throughout his writing, his style was considered to be clear but his hand was poor; a profile of him in "The Observer" said "perhaps he gave less pleasure to those who had to decipher his handwriting. Rarely has more limpid English been conveyed in a script more obscure."
