On 1 January 1942, having changed over to P-40 Kittyhawks, No. 3 Squadron assaulted sixteen Junkers Ju 87 "Stuka" plunge planes and their escort of six Messerschmitt Bf 109 warriors close Agedabia in Cyrenaica; Spence was credited with shooting down a Ju 87. He handled his single-situate warrior in the desert on 26 January to get another No. 3 Squadron pilot, Sergeant Walter Mailey, whose Kittyhawk had been constrained down. On 14 February, No. 3 Squadron and No. 112 Squadron RAF caught more than thirty Italian and German air ship endeavoring to assault Tobruk. The Allied pilots asserted twenty foe flying machine pulverized, one of which, a Bf 109, was credited to Spence. He asserted a plausible Bf 109 on 15 March, and was elevated to flight lieutenant on 1ÃÂ April. In the first of his five forays in the Bir Hacheim territory on 16 June, Spence, alongside Nicky Barr, shelled and strafed a segment of German tanks and bolster vehicles, touching off shoot that sent the smell of copying substance into the cockpits of the low-flying air shipÃ¢ÂÂa "frightful repulsiveness", as per Spence, that made him physically sick. His many ground-assault missions and two flying triumphs earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross. Barr reviewed Spence similar to the "most sweltering plunge plane in the Desert" and "one of the stones of the squadron".
