HighwayÂ 420 begins in the west at a signalized intersection with Montrose Road (Regional RoadÂ 98), beyond which it continues as Watson Street through the residential neighbourhood of Greens Corners to Beaverdams Road (Regional RoadÂ 53).
East of Montrose Road, the highway is a four lane roadway divided by a raised paved median, and passes north of a forest as it approaches an interchange with the QEW. As well as a partial cloverleaf interchange that provides almost all directional movements, this four-level stack interchange features two flyovers that arc from south to east as well as a four lane mainline that curves from north to east, directing most westbound HighwayÂ 420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.
East of the QEW, HighwayÂ 420 encounters an interchange with Dorchester Road as both cross the Queenston-Chippawa Power Canal.
This interchange was originally a traffic circle that was removed in the early 1970s. The numerous lanes from the stack interchange to the west begin to converge between residential subdivisions east of Dorchester Road, gradually narrowing to four through lanes at the Drummond Road interchange. After passing beneath Portage Road, the route widens on approach to an at-grade intersection with Stanley Avenue. This intersection is the eastern end of both the freeway segment of the route and the signed King's Highway 420; east of Stanley Avenue the route is signed as Niagara Regional RoadÂ 420 and known as Falls Avenue.
