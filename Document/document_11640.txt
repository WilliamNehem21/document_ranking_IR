In 1940, another roadway was opened, finishing the third side of a triangle between the intersection with M-113, Walton Corners and Fife Lake. USÃÂ 131 was moved to the new interstate and the previous directing along the other opposite sides of the triangle turned out to be a piece of M-113 and M-186. A second realignment opened the next year between Fife Lake and Kalkaska. USÃÂ 131 never again turned east along Boardman Road between South Boardman and Lodi. Rather the MSHD rerouted the parkway legitimately toward the upper east, from the finish of the past new directing north of Fife Lake to Kalaska. By 1945, a Bypass USÃÂ 131 was made around the south and east sides of Grand Rapids, following 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue, while the primary interstate kept on going through downtown unaltered. After 10 years, mainline USÃÂ 131 was rerouted around Grand Rapids over the previous detour course, and Business USÃÂ 131 (Bus. USÃÂ 131) was made for the previous course through downtown. A second business circle was made in Three Rivers, Michigan, after an interstate detour of the city's downtown was opened in mid 1954. Another interstate segment was opened among Mancelona and the M-32 intersection west of Elmira in late 1956.
