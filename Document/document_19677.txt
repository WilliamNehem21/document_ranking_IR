Despite their efforts, the Nicaean emperors failed to successfully challenge the Venetian domination of the seas, and were forced to turn to the Genoese for aid. After regaining Constantinople in 1261 however, Michael VIII initiated a great effort to lessen this dependence by building a "national" navy, forming a number of new corps to this purpose: the "Gasmouloi" (), who were men of mixed Greek-Latin descent living around the capital; and men from Laconia, called "LakÅnes" (ÎÎ¬ÎºÏÎ½ÎµÏ, "Laconians") or "TzakÅnes" (Î¤Î¶Î¬ÎºÏÎ½ÎµÏ), were used as marines, forming the bulk of Byzantine naval manpower in the 1260s and 1270s. Michael also set the rowers, called "Prosalentai" (Î ÏÎ¿ÏÎ±Î»ÎµÎ½ÏÎ±Î¯) or "ProselÅntes" (Î ÏÎ¿ÏÎµÎ»á¿¶Î½ÏÎµÏ), apart as a separate corps. All these groups received small grants of land to cultivate in exchange for their service, and were settled together in small colonies. The "Prosalentai" were settled near the sea throughout the northern Aegean, while the "Gasmouloi" and "TzakÅnes" were settled mostly around Constantinople and in Thrace. These corps remained extant, albeit in a diminished form, throughout the last centuries of the Empire; indeed the "Gasmouloi" of Gallipoli formed the bulk of the crews of the first Ottoman fleets. Throughout the Palaiologan period, the fleet's main base was the harbour of Kontoskalion on the Marmara shore of Constantinople, dredged and refortified by Michael VIII. Among the provincial naval centres, probably the most important was Monemvasia in the Peloponnese.
