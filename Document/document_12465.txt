Taylor expressed in a meeting with "The Sun" that he was "so glad for [the album] expressively" and thought the melody "Made in the Dark" contained the best verses he had ever composed. Taylor clarified that it was "exceptionally simple" for him to concentrate on the "more genuine verses, similar to an affection tune extremely dear to [his] heart" yet expressed that "Wrestlers" was "similarly as imperative and feels like an altogether different style of music than we have ever got down on record previously." He talked about "Wrestlers" in the band's meeting with "The Sun", clarifying that the tune is "musically and expressively very immediate" on the grounds that "it doesn't have a large number of layers", as opposed to the melody "Bendable Poseable". The idea of the melody "Wrestlers", begins from an instant message from James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. After Doyle visited with Murphy, Murphy sent an instant message that stated, "Sorry you can't have Al back, I'll wrestle you for him. What's more, I'll beat you since I'm greater and more grounded than you." Goddard clarified that "the words in that melody are tied in with wrestling", and the band "have most likely" that Murphy would crush them in a wrestling battle.
