Some contact may have happened between Hellenistic Greeks and the Qin line in the late third century BC, following the Central Asian battles of Alexander the Great, ruler of Macedon, and the foundation of Hellenistic kingdoms generally near China, for example, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Unearthings at the entombment site of China's first Emperor Qin Shi Huang (r. 221Ã¢ÂÂ 210 BC) propose Greek complex and mechanical impacts in the fine arts found there, including the celebrated earthenware armed force. Social trades at such an early date are for the most part viewed as approximated in the scholarly community, yet unearthings of a fourth century BC tomb in Gansu area having a place with the territory of Qin have yielded Western things, for example, glass dabs and a blue-coated (perhaps faience) measuring utencil of Mediterranean inception. Exchange and strategic relations between China's Han Empire and remainders of Hellenistic Greek human progress under the standard of the traveling Da Yuezhi started with the Central Asian adventures of the Han agent Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC). He conveyed back reports to the court of Emperor Wu of Han about the "Dayuan" in the Fergana Valley, with Alexandria Eschate as its capital, and the "Daxia" of Bactria, in what is currently Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The main understood Roman explorer to have visited the easternmost edges of Central Asia was Maes Titianus, a contemporary of Trajan in either the late first or mid second century AD who visited a "Stone Tower" that has been distinguished by students of history as either Tashkurgan in the Chinese Pamirs or a comparative landmark in the Alai Valley only west of Kashgar, Xinjiang, China.
