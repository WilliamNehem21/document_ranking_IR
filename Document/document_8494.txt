The site has been politically vital since the mid eighteenth century, when King Andriamasinavalona (1675Ã¢ÂÂ 1710) separated the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants and relegated his child Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana to administer the northeastern quadrant, Avaradrano, from its recently assigned capital at Ambohimanga. The division of Imerina prompted 77 years of common war, amid which time the progressive leaders of Avaradrano drove military battles to extend their domain while undertaking adjustments to the barriers at Ambohimanga to more readily secure it against assaults. The war was finished from Ambohimanga by King Andrianampoinimerina, who effectively embraced arrangements and military battles that rejoined Imerina under his standard by 1793. After catching the notable capital of Imerina at Antananarivo, Andrianampoinimerina moved his illustrious court and every political capacity back to its unique locus at Antananarivo's imperial compound and proclaimed the two urban communities of equivalent significance, with Ambohimanga as the kingdom's otherworldly capital. He and later rulers in his line kept on leading regal customs at the site and consistently possessed and rebuilt Ambohimanga until French colonization of the kingdom and the outcast of the imperial family in 1897. The criticalness of chronicled occasions here and the nearness of illustrious tombs have given the slope a holy character that is additionally improved at Ambohimanga by the internment destinations of a few Vazimba, the island's most punctual occupants.
