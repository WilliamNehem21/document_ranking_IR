Puccini's score is worked around a progression of themes which repeat through the musical drama, for the most part speaking to characters, circumstances and dispositions however some of the time without explicit affiliations. The opening theme is a fast blasted of cadenced music, portrayed by Greenfield starting at "practically Stravinskian sharpness", which rapidly changes into a counterfeit grave lament delineating the dishonest pain of the Donati relatives. This juxtaposition of the clever and the serious infests the musical drama; pundit Ernest Newman proposes that it "keeps us ceaselessly suspended between the comic and the shocking". Other chief themes incorporate the subject related with the darlings Rinuccio and Lauretta, presented in Rinuccio's first solo "Salvati! Salvati!", and a short, formal woodwind explanation which speaks to Donati's will. Rinuccio sings the name "Gianni Schicchi" to a jolly four-note state which turns into Schicchi's own theme, and it is heard again as Schicchi thumps on the entryway before his first appearance. The best-known topic in the musical show, that related with Lauretta, is presented in the second piece of Rinuccio's aria "Avete torto". The subject is quickly played on clarinet and violin as Lauretta enters with Schicchi, before its full articulation in "O mio babbino caro".
