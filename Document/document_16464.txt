On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, "The Good Will Hour", hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on "Ask Mister Anthony", which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, "dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code." Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workâhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments. In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of "Les MisÃ©rables", produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersâMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, "The Shadow" came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of The Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston. He played the part anonymously at first. But, as one chronicler put it, "nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long."
