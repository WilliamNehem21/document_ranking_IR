Upon its discharge, "Sentiments" was met with for the most part positive surveys by music faultfinders. Terry Jenkins of AllMusic applauded the collective work of Silvetti and Manzanero and called "Sentiments" "an arousing, charming collection". Pain-filled Obejas of the "Chicago Tribune" considered Miguel's voice the collection's solid point and noticed the "nearness of electronic instruments and the darker, increasingly grave state of mind". Then again, she felt that Miguel was starting "to slip", refering to the tracks "Jurame" and "Por Debajo de la Mesa" as precedents. Fernando Gonzalez composed for the "Orange County Register" taking note of despite the fact that the collection is "Flawlessly created, masterminded and recorded", he felt that boleros "request more than that". Gonzalez explained: " He sounds basically uproarious, as opposed to sentimental, in "Sabor a Mi; he seems to be (cleanser) operatic instead of tormented in "El Reloj "; he is a star - not an unassuming understudy - in "Contigo Aprendi"." The "Corpus Christi Caller-Times" music pundit Rene Carbrera composed a positive survey of the collection adulating the string game plans as "carefully done" and complimented Miguel's interpretation of "Sabor a MÃÂ­" and "La Gloria Eres Tu" as he had done it "superbly done in the conventional way and enhanced with Trio Los Panchos requinto "stick" endings." Mario Tarradell of "The Dallas Morning News" composed a horrible audit of the account; he condemned its preparations for having every one of the tracks "inundated with plush consoles and vaporous strings with only a trace of percussion out of sight". He additionally panned its lead single "Por Debajo de la Mesa" for putting on a show of being an "adoration melody for the modest" because of its game plans being "so smothering, so valuable, it's hard to feel any exotic nature".
