MÃÂ¼ller made a third endeavor to near torpedo run, yet "Sydney" immediately dismissed. Soon after 10:00, a shell from "Sydney" exploded prepared ammo close to the starboard No. 4 weapon and began a genuine shoot. A fourth and last endeavor to dispatch a torpedo assault was made presently, yet "Sydney" had the capacity to keep the range open. By 10:45, "Emden"s firearms had to a great extent gone quiet; her superstructure had been destroyed and the two back most channels had been shot away, alongside the foremast. MÃÂ¼ller understood that his ship was never again ready to battle, thus he chose to shoreline "Emden" on North Keeling Island to spare the lives of his team. At 11:15, "Emden" was run onto the reef, and her motors and boilers were overwhelmed. Her breech squares and torpedo pointing gear were tossed over the edge to render the weapons unusable, and every single flag book and mystery papers were scorched. "Sydney" swung to catch the collier "Buresk", whose group left her when the Australian cruiser drew closer. "Sydney" at that point came back to the destroyed "Emden" and asked in the event that she surrendered. The flag books had been demolished by flame thus the Germans couldn't answer, and since her banner was all the while flying, "Sydney" continued flame. The Germans immediately raised white banners and the Australians stopped flame.
