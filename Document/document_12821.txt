Authoritatively, Wright was not an individual from the band, and said "It approached a point where I wasn't going to do the collection." However, he earned five co-composing credits on the collection, his first on a Pink Floyd collection since 1975's "Wish You Were Here". Another musician credited on the collection was Gilmour's future spouse, Polly Samson. She helped him compose a few tracks, including, "High Hopes", a collective course of action which, however at first tense, "pulled the entire collection together," as indicated by Ezrin. They procured Michael Kamen to organize the collection's symphonic parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas additionally returned. Essayist Douglas Adams gave the collection title and Thorgerson the spread work of art. Thorgerson drew motivation for the collection spread from the Moai stone monuments of Easter Island; two contradicting faces shaping a suggested third face about which he remarked: "the missing faceÃ¢ÂÂthe phantom of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger". Anxious to abstain from going up against other collection discharges, as had occurred with "A Momentary Lapse", Pink Floyd set a due date of April 1994, so, all in all they would continue visiting. The collection achieved number 1 in both the UK and the US. It went through 51 weeks on the UK graph.
