Inside the archipelago, up to 15 types of GalÃÂ¡pagos tortoises have been recognized, albeit just 11 make due right up 'til the present time. Six are found on discrete islands; five of them on the volcanoes of Isabela Island. A few of the enduring species are genuinely jeopardized. One of the animal varieties, "C. abingdonii" from Pinta Island, is viewed as terminated. The last known example, named Lonesome George, passed on in bondage on 24 June 2012; George had been mated with female tortoises of a few different animal categories, yet none of the eggs from these pairings brought forth. The species occupying Floreana Island ("G. nigra") is thought to have been chased to eradication by 1850, just 15 years after Charles Darwin's milestone visit of 1835, when he saw shells, however no live tortoises there. In any case, late DNA testing demonstrates that an intermixed, non-local populace as of now existing on the island of Isabela is of hereditary similarity to the species local to Floreana, recommending that "G. nigra" has not gone altogether terminated. The presence of the "C. phantastica" types of Fernandina Island is questioned, as it was depicted from a solitary example that may have been a fake prologue to the island; nonetheless, a live female was found in 2019, likely affirming the species' legitimacy.
