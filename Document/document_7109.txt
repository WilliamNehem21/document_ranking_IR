As per the "Life of William Marshal", which dates to not long after 1219, when word came to William Marshal, one of the most extravagant and most powerful nobles, that Richard was dead, he counseled with Walter and talked about whom to help as the following ruler. Marshal's decision was John, yet Walter at first inclined towards John's young nephew Arthur of Brittany. At the point when Marshall was unyielding on John, who was a grown-up, the creator of the "Life" has Walter state in answer " 'So be it at that point,' said the ecclesiastical overseer, 'yet mark my words, Marshal, you will never lament anything in your life as much as this.'" This is in all likelihood a review remark that has been embedded into the history, nonetheless, in view of John's later conduct. When John realized he had the help of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to demand every single free man to vow fealty to the new ruler. On 27 May 1199 Walter delegated John, as far as anyone knows delivering a discourse that proclaimed, once and for all, the hypothesis of a lord's decision by the general population. This story is just contained in the compositions of Matthew Paris, in any case, and in spite of the fact that it appears to be sure that Walter given a discourse, it isn't sure what the definite substance were. On his crowning liturgy day, John selected Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, history specialist and creator of an account of John, says of Walter that "Nobody living had a firmer handle of the complexities of illustrious government, yet even in seniority his brain was versatile and fruitful with recommendations for adapting to new issues."
