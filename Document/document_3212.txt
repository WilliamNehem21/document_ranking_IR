On October 13, Luce's broadcast report from Quebec was gotten at the Collins New York office. The updates on his survival was the reason for festivity and thanksgiving. In its first section Luce educated Edward Collins that the lost travelers likely "incorporated your better half, little girl and child, with whom I took a last leave the minute the ship was going down". That day, the "Baltimore Sun" detailed the loss of the whole Brown gathering. Luce's record of the surging of rafts, and the early takeoffs of officers and group, caused extensive frustration in New York, which immediately swung to outrage and judgment as it ended up clear that no ladies or kids had been spared, and that a large portion of the survivors were from the team. "The New York Times" detailed "a whole absence of restrained power over the entire of the ship", and that "the officers and group did not do their best towards sparing the vessel, which they left too soon". Paul Grann, from Dorian's pontoon, detailed that "all request and order stopped ready", and that Rogers had undermined travelers with guns. Later press accounts censured the group in progressively cruel terms; "The New York Times" alluded to "a terrible renunciation of obligation", and denounced the "fainthearted and devious direct of the team". "Logical American" decreed that the conduct of the group in sparing themselves before their travelers had "darkened the character of our marine according to the entire world". Skipper Luce, be that as it may, was to a great extent exonerated; he had not looked to spare himself, had run down with his ship, and had endure generally by possibility. When he touched base in New York via train from Quebec, on October 14, he was welcomed as a legend.
