Creators of the 2014 Isbister et al. paper reacted in a similar issue by proposing patients for whom counter-agent is considered ought to be completely educated "there is significant load of proof to recommend it is no superior to fake treatment", and in light of a danger of hypersensitivity and serum infection, "routine utilization of the counter-agent is subsequently not suggested".
