From 1942 onwards, HergÃ© began redrawing and colouring his earlier "Tintin" adventures for Casterman, but chose not to do so for "Tintin in the Land of the Soviets", considering its story too crude. Embarrassed by it, he labeled it a "transgression of [his] youth". Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier believed that another factor in his decision might have been the story's virulently anti-Marxist theme, which would have been unpopular amidst growing West European sympathies for Marxism following the Second World War. In an article discussing HergÃ©'s work which was published in the magazine "Jeune Afrique" ("Young Africa") in 1962, it was noted that despite the fact that fans of his work visited the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale to read the copy of "Land of the Soviets" that was held there, it "will never (and with good cause) be republished". In 1961, HergÃ© wrote a letter to Casterman suggesting that the original version of the story be republished in a volume containing a publisher's warning about its content. Louis-Robert Casterman replied with a letter in which he stated that while the subject had been discussed within the company, "There are more hesitant or decidedly negative opinions than there are enthusiastic ones. Whatever the case, you can rest assured that the matter is being actively considered".
