After Alexander's passing in 323ÃÂ BC, Demosthenes again asked the Athenians to look for freedom from Macedon in what wound up known as the Lamian War. Be that as it may, Antipater, Alexander's successor, suppressed all resistance and requested that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his solicitation, the ecclesia embraced a pronouncement censuring the most conspicuous enemy of Macedonian fomenters to death. Demosthenes got away to an asylum on the island of Kalaureia (present day Poros), where he was later found by Archias, a friend of Antipater. He ended it all before his catch by removing poison from a reed, imagining he needed to compose a letter to his family. At the point when Demosthenes felt that the toxic substance was chipping away at his body, he said to Archias: "Presently, when you please you may start the piece of Creon in the catastrophe, and cast out this body of mine unburied. In any case, O generous Neptune, I, as far as concerns me, while I am yet alive, emerge up and withdraw out of this sacrosanct spot; however Antipater and the Macedonians have but rather left the sanctuary unpolluted." After saying these words, he gone by the special stepped area, tumbled down and kicked the bucket. A long time after Demosthenes' suicide, the Athenians raised a statue to respect him and declared that the state ought to give dinners to his relatives in the Prytaneum.
