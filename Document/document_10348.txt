Castillo Armas' power of 480 men had been part into four groups, running in size from 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four powers left their bases in Honduras and El Salvador, and amassed in different towns simply outside the Guatemalan outskirt. The biggest power should assault the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others assaulted the littler towns of Esquipulas, Jutiapa, and Zacapa, the Guatemalan armed force's biggest outskirts post. The intrusion plan immediately confronted challenges; the 60-man constrain was caught and imprisoned by Salvadoran policemen before it got to the fringe. At 8:20ÃÂ am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas drove his attacking troops over the fringe. Ten prepared saboteurs went before the attack, with the point of exploding railroads and cutting transmit lines. At about a similar time, Castillo Armas' planes flew over an expert government rally in the capital. Castillo Armas requested ÃÂrbenz's prompt surrender. The attack incited a concise frenzy in the capital, which immediately diminished as the radicals neglected to make any striking moves. Stalled by provisions and an absence of transportation, Castillo Armas' powers took a few days to achieve their objectives, in spite of the fact that their planes exploded a scaffold on 19 June.
