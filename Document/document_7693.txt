Coonley influenced the executive of the Riverside program, Lucia Burton Morse, and her collaborator, Charlotte Krum, to help dispatch another school. Morse and Krum had gone to Elizabeth Harrison's Kindergarten College, which "advocated the idea of kindergarten instructing in America and was one of the main educator's schools in the nation to offer a four-year program coming full circle in the lone ranger of training degree". There they had examined the instructive speculations of John Dewey and others, who stood contradicted to the more customary academic practices of the day, which considered instruction to be the matter of transmitting long-standing assemblages of data to new ages and teaching moral preparing dependent on guidelines and gauges of lead. Their new dynamic perspectives on training underscored an individualized way to deal with instruction and an incorporated educational modules where kids gained for a fact and social connection. As per Dewey, "it is a cardinal statute of the more up to date institute of training that the start of guidance will be made with the experience students as of now have; that this experience and the limits that have been created amid its course give the beginning stage to all further learning." These thoughts established the frameworks of what might turn into the "dynamic development" in instruction. Coonley, Morse, and Krum conveyed these thoughts with them to the new school, which Coonley depicted as "a Children's Community. Its motivation was less to train what others had thought or adults had done, yet for the kids themselves to accomplish something."
