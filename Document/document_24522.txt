In the US, the film was not subject to any censorship at all, and was released virtually intact to AIP's usual mix of drive-ins and grindhouses. However, in an attempt to link the film with Roger Corman's earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled "The Conqueror Worm". Brief prologue and epilogue narrations (by Price) taken from Poe's poem were added to justify the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his "Cult Movies" book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics during its US release: "The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe seriesÂ â¦ and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce." "Hollywood Citizen News" was appalled by the film: "A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmakingÂ â¦ a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one wonders how it ever passed customs to be released in this country." The trade journal "Box Office" noted that: "Fans of the horror film will be glad to know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiendsÂ â¦ bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginableÂ â¦" "Variety" opined that "Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction." Despite the lack of critical support, the movie was a modest success stateside, earning $1.5 million for AIP according to "Cinefantastique" magazine. In his biography of Reeves, Benjamin Halligan claims the film made $10 million in the US.
