In 1795 the Proclamation Society, made quite a while before to help authorize King George III's decree against "free and prurient Prints, Books, and Publications, scattering Poison to the psyches of the Young and Unwary", and "to Punish the Publishers and Vendors thereof", brought Roach up on slander charges. In court he featured the rundown's life span, and asserted that "no one had ever been arraigned for distributing it; and, accordingly, he was unmindful it was a defamation." When Lord Chief Justice Kenyon referenced that a John Roach had recently been indicted for selling "Harris' List", Roach "guaranteed his Lordship, that he had never been prosecuted for this offense." He was by and by condemned to one year in Newgate Prison, with sureties of ÃÂ£150 for a long time, to guarantee his great conduct. Ruler Justice Ashurst called the List "a most obscene and improper production", and of Roach's wrongdoing said "an offense of more prominent monstrosity could scarcely be submitted." Aitkin, prosecuted as John Aitken, may have been fined ÃÂ£200 for selling a similar release, in spite of the fact that Rubenhold battles that by then he had kicked the bucket. After these preliminaries, the rundown was never again distributed. Just nine versions are surviving: those for 1761, 1764, 1773, 1774, 1779, 1788, 1789, 1790 and 1793.
