"Voalavo" is a small rodent resembling a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to "Monticolomys koopmani". In terms of external morphology, "Voalavo" is barely different from "Eliurus"; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) are all the same in both genera. However, all species of "Eliurus" have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs at the tip of the tail, a feature that is absent in "Voalavo", although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of "Eliurus", Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but "V.Â antsahabensis" has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in "Eliurus", and specifically, the thenar pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and fairly small in "Voalavo", but longer and larger in "Eliurus". On the chest, "Voalavo" species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in "Eliurus". Unlike all other nesomyines but "Brachyuromys", "Voalavo" lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).
