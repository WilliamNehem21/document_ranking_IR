Gretzky was the last Olympic torchbearer at the 2010 Winter Olympics. He was one of four who lit the cauldron at BC Place Stadium amid the opening function (albeit one didn't because of specialized challenges with one of the cauldron's "arms" which neglected to rise) and afterward run out of the arena, where he was then determined by police escorts through the boulevards of downtown Vancouver to light a second, outside cauldron close to the Vancouver Convention Center situated in the city's downtown waterfront region. Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be seen by those going to the opening service, inferring that it must be lit at the area where the function is occurring. Albeit another IOC decide states that the cauldron ought to be seen outside by the whole occupants of the whole host city, this was impractical since the function occurred inside. Be that as it may, VANOC covertly constructed a second outside cauldron alongside the West Building of the Vancouver Convention Center, and Gretzky was subtly picked to light this perpetual cauldron. Rapidly word spread through the downtown Vancouver territory that Gretzky was in fact the last torchbearer, and very soon a smash of individuals came pursuing the police escort to support Gretzky and ideally get a look at him leading to the open air cauldron. For the 2010 Winter Olympics, he was named Special Advisor to the Canada men's national ice hockey group.
