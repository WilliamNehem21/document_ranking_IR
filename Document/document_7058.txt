SMP2 underpins a preliminary of a unique class of "bigadv" work units, intended to mimic proteins that are bizarrely vast and computationally concentrated and have an extraordinary logical need. These units initially required at least eight CPU centers, which was raised to sixteen later, on FebruaryÃÂ 7, 2012. Alongside these additional equipment necessities over standard SMP2 work units, they require more framework assets, for example, irregular access memory (RAM) and Internet transfer speed. Consequently, clients who run these are remunerated with a 20% expansion over SMP2's reward point framework. The bigadv classification permits Folding@home to run particularly requesting reenactments for long occasions that had some time ago required utilization of supercomputing groups and couldn't be performed anyplace else on Folding@home. Numerous clients with equipment ready to run bigadv units have later had their equipment setup considered ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU center essentials were expanded, abandoning them just ready to run the typical SMP work units. This baffled numerous clients who put noteworthy measures of cash into the program just to have their equipment be out of date for bigadv purposes soon after. Therefore, Pande declared in January 2014 that the bigadv program would finish on January 31, 2015.
