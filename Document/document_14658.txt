In 1911 the city of York belatedly perceived Etty. A statue of Etty by G. W. Milburn was disclosed on 1ÃÂ February outside the York Art Gallery, and a review of 164 Etty depictions was held at the display regardless of restriction from a portion of Etty's relatives who wouldn't loan works for it. William Wallace Hargrove, owner of the "York Herald", gave a discourse reviewing his recollections of knowing Etty. Outside York, Etty for the most part stayed little-known, with most of those exhibitions holding his works, other than the Lady Lever Art Gallery, the Russell-Cotes Museum and Anglesey Abbey, tending to keep them away. Minor Etty presentations in London in 1936 and 1938 had little effect, and in like manner a display of 30 Etty artistic creations in 1948 to check the reviving of the York Art Gallery and another York show of 108 works of art the next year to stamp the century of his passing. In 2001Ã¢ÂÂ 02 five Etty depictions were incorporated into Tate Britain's milestone "Uncovered: The Victorian Nude" display, which did a lot to raise Etty's profile, and set up Etty as "the main British craftsman to paint the bare with both earnestness and consistency". The rebuilding of "The Sirens and Ulysses", finished in 2010, prompted expanded enthusiasm for Etty, and in 2011Ã¢ÂÂ 12 a noteworthy show of Etty's works was held at the York Art Gallery. The York Art Gallery keeps on holding the biggest gathering of Etty's works.
