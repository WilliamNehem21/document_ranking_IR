Particle Storm declared "Anachronox" in April 1997, and got ready for a second from last quarter 1998 discharge. Tom Hall, veteran architect and one of the organizers of Ion Storm, helmed the task and began a large portion of its story and structure. Other establishing individuals from the group were Todd Porter (maker), Jake Hughes (partner maker and executive of cinematics), Ben Herrera (craftsman), Brian Eiserloh (software engineer), and David Namaksy (lead mapper). Mapper Larry Herring was enlisted subsequent to being coached by John Romero and presenting a custom "Fate 2" guide to Tom Hall. Corridor initially considered "Anachronox" in his washroom, provoking him to introduce a whiteboard and sound-recorder in his shower, just as a few scratch pads around his home for future thoughts; he had imagined the character Sly Boots years sooner in school. He composed a 460-page configuration record (finished in May 1997) sketching out the universe of "Anachronox", past the diversion's degree; other amusement configuration archives of the period, he noted, were normally just 125 pages in size. He at that point dense the story, leaving a third past the planned amusement. The amusement's plan stage kept going three months. Corridor made arrangements for two extension packs from the start of advancement, attributable to the enormous story. Engineers told "People to come" the story would be "Campbellian" and highlight gigantic situations. Corridor noted in mid-1997, "Not since "Sharp" has a universe been so clear in my mind."
