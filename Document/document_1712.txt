Kamiya inevitably modified the story to be set in a world brimming with evil spirits, taking it from the Italian epic ballad "Divine Comedy" by Dante Alighieri; he changed the saint's name to "Dante". The title character from Buichi Terasawa's manga arrangement "Cobra" filled in as the reason for Dante's identity. Kamiya put together his concept of Dante with respect to what he saw as up-to-date: wearing a long coat to make the character "ostentatious" and a non-smoker, as Kamiya saw that as "cool". The character wears red in light of the fact that, in Japan, it is a conventional shading for a chivalrous figure. Kamiya has likewise expressed he sees Dante as "a character that you would need to go out drinking with", somebody who was not a hotshot but rather would rather "pull some ludicrous, naughty joke" to charm individuals to him. He included that this perspective was proposed to make the character feel recognizable to crowds. The cast of characters remained to a great extent indistinguishable to that in Sugimura's situation, despite the fact that appearances of the legend's mom and father were worked out of the story. The diversion's new title was uncovered as "Fiend May Cry" in November 2000.
