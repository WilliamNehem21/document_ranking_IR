The Ptolemaic Greek lords, who ruled Egypt as pharaohs from 305 to 30 BCE, built up a philosophy that connected them with both Egyptian and Greek divine beings, to reinforce their case to the honored position according to their Greek and Egyptian subjects. For quite a long time previously, Greek pioneers and guests to Egypt had drawn parallels between Egyptian divinities and their own, in a procedure known as "interpretatio graeca". Herodotus, a Greek who expounded on Egypt in the fifth century BCE, compared Isis to Demeter, whose legendary look for her little girl Persephone took after Isis' scan for Osiris. Demeter was one of only a handful couple of Greek divinities to be generally received by Egyptians in Ptolemaic occasions, so the comparability among her and Isis gave a connection between the two societies. In different cases, Isis was connected with Aphrodite through the sexual parts of her character. Expanding on these conventions, the initial two Ptolemies advanced the faction of the new god Serapis, who joined parts of Osiris and Apis with those of Greek divine beings like Zeus and Dionysus. Isis, depicted in a Hellenized structure, was viewed as the associate of Serapis just as of Osiris. Ptolemy II and his sister and spouse Arsinoe II built up a ruler clique around themselves, with the goal that they were loved in indistinguishable sanctuaries from Serapis and Isis, and Arsinoe was compared to the two Isis and Aphrodite. Some later Ptolemaic rulers distinguished themselves still more intimately with Isis. Cleopatra III, in the second century BCE, utilized Isis' name instead of her own in engravings, and Cleopatra VII, the last leader of Egypt before it was attached by Rome, utilized the sobriquet "the new Isis".
