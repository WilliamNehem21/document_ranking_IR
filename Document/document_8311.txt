The show, just as a lion's share of UPN's projects, was authoritatively dropped when the system converged with The WB Television Network (The WB) to shape The CW in 2006. Plant Gillespie of "The Crisis" was reproachful of UPN's choice to drop the arrangement given how the system "in one swoop, cleared out five of its eight African American comedies" with the production of The CW. Gillespie communicated frustration at the absence of African American sitcoms on the three noteworthy systems, saying: "Without that open door for a portion of the more youthful craftsmen to sharpen and build up their abilities, it will conceivably have a generational effect." IndieWire's Dara T. Mathis recognized "Eve" for instance of UPN's eminent dark sitcoms and compared the abrogations of a greater part of UPN's comedies as a sign that the class was in a condition of decay. Commentator Tim Goodman noticed that "Eve" was one of six shows "intended for an African American group of onlookers", highlighting "an African American lead on-screen character" that were dropped amid the merger. He saw these retractions as an indication of systems "eliminat[ing] specialty programming". Julian Kimble of "Complex" included "Eve" on a rundown of projects that "are regularly disregarded", close by other UPN sitcoms "Half and Half" and "We all". The arrangement has not been made accessible on Blu-beam or DVD, yet it was discharged on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.
