Cleopatra's own doctor Olympos, refered to by Plutarch, referenced neither a reason for death nor an asp chomp or Egyptian cobra. Strabo, who gives the most punctual known chronicled account, trusted that Cleopatra ended it all either by asp chomp or harmful salve. Plutarch makes reference to the story of the asp conveyed to her in a container of figs, despite the fact that he offers different choices for her reason for death, for example, utilization of an empty execute (), maybe a fastener, which she used to scratch open the skin and present the poison. As per Cassius Dio little cut injuries were found on Cleopatra's arm, however he resounded the case by Plutarch that no one knew the genuine reason for her passing. Dio referenced the case of the asp and even proposed utilization of a needle (), perhaps from a fastener, which would appear to substantiate Plutarch's record. Other contemporary students of history, for example, Florus and Velleius Paterculus bolstered the asp chomp rendition. Roman doctor Galen referenced the asp story, yet he propels a form where Cleopatra bit her arm and presented venom got a compartment. Suetonius transferred the narrative of the asp yet communicated uncertainty about its legitimacy.
