Poulenc said that he was not imaginative in his symphonious language. The arranger Lennox Berkeley composed of him, "Every single through hey life, he was substance to utilize customary agreement, however his utilization of it was so individual, so quickly unmistakable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and legitimacy." Keck considers Poulenc's consonant language "as excellent, intriguing and individual as his melodic writingÃÂ ... clear, basic harmonies moving in clearly characterized tonal zones with chromaticism that is seldom more than passing". Poulenc possessed no energy for melodic hypotheses; in one of his many radio meetings he required "a dÃÂ©tente to making by hypothesis, precept, rule!" He was pretentious of what he saw as the obstinacy of modern followers to dodecaphony, driven by RenÃÂ© Leibowitz, and extraordinarily lamented that the reception of a hypothetical methodology had influenced the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had before had high expectations. To Hell, practically the entirety of Poulenc's music is "straightforwardly or in a roundabout way roused by the absolutely melodic relationship of the human voice". Poulenc was a meticulous expert, however a fantasy developed upÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ ""la lÃÂ©gende de facilitÃÂ©""ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ that his music came effectively to him; he remarked, "The legend is understandable, since I do everything to cover my endeavors."
