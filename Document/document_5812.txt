In April 2000, shooting started on the Michael Bay film "Pearl Harbor". Prior to the shooting, the cast and team accumulated on the USS "Arizona" remembrance for a wreath-laying by an agent of Touchstone Pictures, Jerry Bruckheimer and Bay. The makers conveyed fifteen vintage planes to Ford Island, setting them in one shelter for the shooting. What's more, they took fifteen ships back to Pearl Harbor for live assault (without sinking them). The tasks room of the control tower was changed over into a sleeping enclosure for the taping. The Pacific Aviation Museum trusted that the film would expand open attention to the pinnacle and goad support for its reclamation. Straight pondered the notable essentialness of Ford Island: "I have a striking memory of demonstrating the team around Ford Island amid pre-generation. We happened upon a plaque legitimately opposite the depressed Arizona, denoting the spot where a torpedo hit almost six decades prior. My group remained peacefully for three minutes at seeing this little landmark. It was a serious minute for us all, and I think it helped the group welcome the endeavor were going to start." During shooting, a Vultee BT-13 Valiant utilized as a torpedo plane smashed on the island.
