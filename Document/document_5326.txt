In 1985, Ricky Vela joined Selena y Los Dinos as their keyboardist. Despite the fact that Vela was pulled in to the gathering's drummer, Suzette Quintanilla, he remained quiet about his sentiments. When he admitted his sentiments to Suzette's sibling, amass chief Abraham Quintanilla, III, he started prodding him about it. After Suzette's September 1993 marriage, Vela stated "No Me Queda MÃÂ¡s" and it was given to Selena to record for "Love Prohibido". Selena's sibling A.B. Quintanilla did not discover the tune to have any potential; he has said that he later had a difference in heart. Despite the fact that the melody was initially expected as a mariachi track, EMI Latin president Jose Behar trusted that a mariachi recording would not speak to the well known market. The gathering offered it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to revamp into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to "improve" the melody to support its airplay and diagram execution. The outcome upgraded Selena's pop-radio achievement. Behar said in an "Announcement" meet that the tune was "disguised" without influencing the creativity of its account. In a 2002 meeting, A.B. said that amid a chronicle session he had approached Selena to record the melody for a fifth time. The artist answered, "What you arrived is the thing that you got" and left to go out to shop. He pondered, "Presently thinking back, she truly completed an excellent activity when recording the tune, she had so much energy. The melody turned into a work of art."
