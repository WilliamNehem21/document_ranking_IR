In dinosaurs, the most imperative locomotor muscle was situated in the tail. This muscle, called the caudofemoralis, appends to the fourth trochanter, an unmistakable edge on the thigh bone, and pulls the thigh bone in reverse when contracted. Scott Persons and Phil Currie (2011) note that in the tail vertebrae of "Carnotaurus", the caudal ribs did not jut on a level plane ("T-molded"), however were calculated against the vertical pivot of the vertebrae, shaping a "V". This would have given extra space to a caudofemoralis muscle bigger than in some other theropodÃ¢ÂÂthe bulk was determined at per leg. In this manner, "Carnotaurus" could have been one of the quickest expansive theropods. While the caudofemoralis muscle was augmented, the epaxial muscles arranged over the caudal ribs would have been relatively littler. These muscles, called the longissimus and spinalis muscle, were in charge of tail development and strength. To keep up tail solidness notwithstanding decrease of these muscles, the caudal ribs bear forward anticipating forms interlocking the vertebrae with one another and with the pelvis, hardening the tail. As an outcome, the capacity to make tight turns would have been reduced, in light of the fact that the hip and tail must be turned all the while, dissimilar to in different theropods.
