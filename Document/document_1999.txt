Jean, duc de Berry (1340Ã¢ÂÂ 1416), or the "astounding puissant Prince Jehan filz de roy de France Duc de Berry" ("amazing and incredible ruler Jean, child of the lord of France, Duke of Berry"), as his secretary recorded one of his original copies, was the third of the four children of King John II of FranceÃ¢ÂÂCharles V, Louis I, Duke of Anjou (1339Ã¢ÂÂ 1384), Berry and Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy (1342Ã¢ÂÂ 1404). All dispatched incredible quantities of show-stoppers in different media, and specifically spent enormous totals on works in gold and silver. Despite the fact that it is Berry who is particularly recognized as a supporter, incompletely in light of the fact that he had some expertise in lit up original copies which have little an incentive in their materials thus have not been reused, his sibling Louis of Anjou had more than 3,000 bits of plate at a certain point. These included entirely mainstream pieces with figures in finish that must be envisioned by examination as respects method to the bunch of reliquaries, similar to the Holy Thorn Reliquary, that have made due from the period, and as respects topic to embroidered works of art and some common enlightened compositions. There are amazingly point by point inventories of Berry's assets including ones from 1401Ã¢ÂÂ 1403 and 1413Ã¢ÂÂ 1416, anyway none contain a passage whose portrayal coordinates the reliquary.
