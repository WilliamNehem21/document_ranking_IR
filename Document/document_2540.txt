The play had a decent beginning run, in spite of the fact that Horner's trap and the infamous china scene promptly raised offense. Wycherley dismissed such reactions in his next play, "The Plain Dealer" (1676), where he has the double-dealing Olivia shout that the china scene in "The Country Wife" "has very removed the notoriety of poor china itself, and sullied the most blameless and lovely furniture of a woman's chamber". Olivia's reasonable cousin Eliza demands that she'll go see "The Country Wife" at any rate: "This won't put me out of pride with china, nor the play, which is acted today, or one more of the equivalent savage author's, as you call him, which I'll go see." Writing himself into "The Plain Dealer" as the "brutal writer" of the china scene, Wycherley appears to be more diverted than apologetic. "The Country Wife" did in certainty endure the protests to turn into a trustworthy repertory play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, yet by then open taste had changed an excessive amount to endure the sex jokes any more. Its last eighteenth century execution in 1753 was trailed by a break of 171 years, until the fruitful Phoenix Society generation in 1924 at the Regent Theater in London. The principal ever American execution of Wycherley's unique "Nation Wife" occurred in 1931.
