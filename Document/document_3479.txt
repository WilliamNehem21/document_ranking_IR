The feeling of devastation returns, in what Hogwood calls the "remote and savage" key of B level minor, for the tenor recitative "All they that see him". The solemn succession at long last finishes with the Ascension theme "Lift up your heads", which Handel at first partitions between two choral gatherings, the altos serving both as the bass line to a soprano choir and the treble line to the tenors and basses. For the 1754 Foundling Hospital execution Handel included two horns, which participate in when the chorale joins towards the finish of the number. After the celebratory tone of Christ's gathering into paradise, set apart by the choir's D real recognition "Let every one of the blessed messengers of God adore him", the "Whitsun" segment continues through a progression of differentiating states of mindÃ¢ÂÂpeaceful and peaceful in "How wonderful are the feet", dramatically operatic in "For what reason do the countries so irately rage"Ã¢ÂÂ towards the Part II summit of "Thank heaven". This, as Young calls attention to, isn't the climactic theme of the work, albeit one can't get away from its "infectious excitement". It works from a misleadingly light instrumental opening, through a short, harmony cantus firmus entry on the words "For the Lord God transcendent reigneth", to the return of the long-quiet trumpets at "And He will rule for ever and ever". Reporters have noticed that the melodic line for this third subject depends on "Wachet auf", Philipp Nicolai's famous Lutheran chorale.
