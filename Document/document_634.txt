Preceding the 1913Ã¢ÂÂ 14 NHA season, Ross wouldn't sign an agreement for the Wanderers, mentioning a compensation increment. As one of the top players in the group, the Wanderers consented to his requests of $1,500 for the inevitable season, in which he completed with four objectives and nine of every eighteen diversions. The following season Ross, again worried about his compensation, started consulting with different players in the NHA to leave their groups and structure another alliance that would offer higher wages. These activities brought about his suspension in November 1914 by Emmett Quinn, leader of the NHA. Ross reacted by proclaiming himself a free specialist and guaranteeing his agreement with the Wanderers was never again substantial. Therefore, despite the fact that having no specialized capacity to do as such, Quinn suspended Ross from all composed hockey. The proposed new alliance neglected to appear and Ross connected for reestablishment to the NHA, which was conceded at a gathering of the group proprietors on December 18, 1914. The proprietors acknowledged whether they suspended Ross, they would likewise need to suspend each one of those he marked, harming the class. In any case, Ross' activities prompted his discharge by the Wanderers. At first he prepared with the Montreal Canadiens, at that point joined the Ottawa Senators.
