In June 1936, Herbert G. West, leader of the Whitman Centennial Celebration, wrote to Driggs illuminating him that his gathering had looked for and neglected to pick up (strangely for 1936) a memorial half dollar to back its exercises. West needed Driggs to arrange an exceptional issue of the Oregon Trail dedicatory for the Whitman association to sell. Driggs was hesitant, first revealing to West that he trusted they may at present be effective in picking up their very own half dollar, and after that that a unique issue would be hard to get as the mints had closed down for the late spring. He in the long run consented to give the Whitman assemble a thousand 1936-S half dollars, on condition they not be sold for under $1.60 so as not to undermine the OTMA's business endeavors. Truth be told, Driggs proposed a deal cost of $2, which was what the Whitman association sold them for. These were named the "Whitman Centennial Issue", or the "Whitman Mission Issue". The greater part of the 1936 pieces struck at Philadelphia were sold by the methods for a mailing to Scott's client list. Some bit of every one of the issues somewhere in the range of 1933 and 1937 were held available to be purchased by enthusiastic associations.
