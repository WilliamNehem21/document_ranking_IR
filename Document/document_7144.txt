The RAAF moved to redress the circumstance by re-shaping No.ÃÂ 2ÃÂ OTU on 1 March 1952 to change over RAAF pilots to stream flying machine and train them for contender activities. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was furnished with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deÃÂ Havilland Vampire planes. Cresswell took direction of No.ÃÂ 2 OTU on 21 May 1953. The unit stopped flying Mustangs that October, holding its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it started directing warrior battle teacher courses, just as supplemental classes on planes. Cresswell conveyed the main Australian-manufactured CAC Saber stream contender to No.ÃÂ 2 OTU in November, and that month set up the unit's Saber Trials Flight. The flight was in charge of execution testing and creating battle flying systems, working together with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3 December 1954, Creswell drove an arrangement of twelve No.ÃÂ 2 OTU Vampires in the state of two sevens over Sydney to welcome No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron upon its entry from administration in Korea on board the plane carrying warship HMAS "Retaliation". Instructional classes on the Saber started on 1 January 1955. When the Saber entered operational administration in March 1956, the Saber Trials Flight was broken down and its duties go to No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron. Pilots experienced first experience with planes and contender battle at No.ÃÂ 2 OTU, however completed their change to Sabers at a cutting edge squadron.
