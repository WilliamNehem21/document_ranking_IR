While youthful he was one of a moderately modest number of American painters whose work was named "innovator" and, as he developed, he developed to be a standout amongst the best known among them. By the mid 1930s commentators had started to observe Knaths and give his work in excess of a passing notice. In 1931 the pundit for the "New York Sun" could state that his work had been known in the craftsmanship world for many years and was decently generally gathered. While theoretical, his compositions had, this faultfinder expressed, "an individual sort of authenticity." "One feels in his work," he went on, "an affection for the medium, rich textural quality, and an extremely abnormal shading amicability which changes with the subject." By the late 1940s thankful notification, for example, this one turned out to be sensibly normal. Starting around 1944 paper workmanship pundits all the more habitually would break down and typically acclaim his work as opposed to just posting it as showing up in a show. For instance, in that year A. Z. Kruse composed a piece about his work in the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle" and in the late 1940s his work was highlighted in articles in "Craftsmanship News" and the "New York Times". In 1949 he was highlighted in an article by Elaine de Kooning, "Knaths Paints a Picture," in "Craftsmanship News".
