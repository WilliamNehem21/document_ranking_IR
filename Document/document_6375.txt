While Tyler wished to take care of his private life and family, he was before long busy with the presidential race of 1836. He had been proposed as a bad habit presidential hopeful since mid 1835, and that day the Virginia Democrats issued the canceling guidance, the Virginia Whigs assigned him as their applicant. The new Whig Party was not sufficiently composed to hold a national tradition and name a solitary ticket against Van Buren, Jackson's picked successor. Rather, Whigs in different locales set forth their very own favored tickets, mirroring the gathering's shaky alliance: the Massachusetts Whigs selected Daniel Webster and Francis Granger, the Anti-Masons of the Northern and outskirt states sponsored William Henry Harrison and Granger, and the states' rights promoters of the center and lower South assigned Hugh Lawson White and John Tyler. In Maryland, the Whig ticket was Harrison and Tyler and in South Carolina it was Willie P. Mangum and Tyler. The Whigs needed to deny Van Buren a lion's share in the Electoral College, tossing the race into the House of Representatives, where arrangements could be made. Tyler trusted voters would be unfit to choose a VP, and that he would be one of the main two vote-getters, from whom the Senate, under the Twelfth Amendment, must pick.
