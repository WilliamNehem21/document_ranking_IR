The brain of "Deinocheirus" was reconstructed through CT scans and presented at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the cerebrum was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The brain was proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large brains, and the small brain of "Deinocheirus" may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance would not have been as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone microstructure study presented at the 13th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists in 2015 showed that "Deinocheirus" probably had a high metabolic rate, and grew rapidly before reaching sexual maturity. In 2015, Akinobu Watanabe and colleagues found that together with "Archaeornithomimus" and "Gallimimus", "Deinocheirus" had the most pneumatised skeleton among ornithomimosaurs. Pneumatisation is thought to be advantageous for flight in modern birds, but its function in non-avian dinosaurs is not known with certainty. It has been proposed that pneumatisation was used to reduce the mass of large bones (associated with gigantic size in the case of "Deinocheirus"), that it was related to high metabolism, balance during locomotion, or used for thermoregulation.
