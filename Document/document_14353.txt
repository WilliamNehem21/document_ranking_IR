His batting normal likewise fell. Surrey experienced disciplinary issues with a few of their expert players amid the season. The club president, Lord Alverstone, favored novices, contending that a losing beginner group was desirable over an expert side that won; a few experts were forgotten for novices. Aside from antagonistically influencing a few players' vocations, this inclination had destabilized the group more than a few seasons. Crawford couldn't help contradicting Alverstone, yet in any case oftentimes expected the initiative without the ordinary chief Leveson Gower for a great part of the period. He captained Surrey to a success over the visiting Australian group right off the bat in 1909 after a solid act by the expert bowler Tom Rushby. Notwithstanding, his captaincy was emphatically scrutinized in the press, especially over his administration of the bowling. Around this time, Crawford's structure declined. With the bat, he was regularly expelled endeavoring forceful shots, and he lost his viability as a bowler. Therefore, he was not picked for the Gentlemen and missed determination in the Ashes arrangement. The press kept on reprimanding his captaincy, notwithstanding Surrey's great outcomes under his authority.
