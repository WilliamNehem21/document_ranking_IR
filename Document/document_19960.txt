In his first 12Â appearances of 2009, Rivera surrendered four home runs and had a 3.97Â ERA, leading to speculation about his cutter's effectiveness and his shoulder's health at age 39. As the season progressed, his numbers improved, and he reached a milestone on JuneÂ 28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500Â regular season saves. In the same game, while batting against fellow closer Francisco RodrÃ­guez, he collected his first career run batted in by walking with the bases loaded. With 23Â saves in 24Â opportunities and a 2.43Â ERA in the season's first half, Rivera was named an All-Star for the tenth time. At the 2009 MLB All-Star Game, he set a record by saving his fourth career All-Star Game. In the season's second half, Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40Â appearances, while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36. He finished the regular season with a 1.76Â ERA, 44Â saves in 46Â opportunities, and a 0.90Â WHIP. In the postseason, he pitched 16Â innings, allowing one earned run and saving five games, and he clinched the Yankees' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Philliesâhis fifth championship. He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason. Rivera collected several awards at season's end, including his third Delivery Man Award, his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award, and the 2009 "Sporting News" Pro Athlete of the Year Award. Reflecting on the decade's end, ESPN.com's Jerry Crasnick called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years.
