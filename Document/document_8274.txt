The endeavors of the Americans to select "Canadiens" (French-Canadians) for their motivation were commonly ineffective with Jeremy Duggan, an "Old Subject" Quebec City hair stylist who had joined the Americans just enlisting 40 "Canadiens". The Roman Catholic church lectured dependability to the Crown, yet the reluctance of Carleton to attack convinced many "Canadiens" that the British reason was a lost one. Given the American numerical prevalence, Carleton had chosen to remain on edge, a choice which anyway legitimized under military grounds, turned out to be politically harming. On 2 November 1775, Montgomery took the Fort St. Jean, which the Americans had been blockading since September, causing Carleton to choose to dismantle back to Quebec City, which he realized that Arnold was likewise drawing closer. On 11 November, the British hauled out of Montreal and on 13 November 1775, the Americans took Montreal. Like Carleton, Montgomery was an Irishmen, and the two commanders had a specific comprehension and regard for "Canadien" society, which was from multiple points of view like Irish society, making a special effort to be careful and gracious in their dealings with "Canadiens". Montgomery demanded that his men show "charitable friendship" for the "Canadiens" consistently. Notwithstanding, the man that Montgomery put accountable for Montreal, Brigadier General David Wooster, together with the recently liberated Thomas Walker who filled in as Wooster's boss political guide, showed intolerant enemy of Catholic and against French perspectives, with Wooster closing down all the "Mass houses" as he called Catholic chapels just before Christmas Eve, a move that profoundly annoyed the "Canadiens". The subjective and overbearing conduct of Wooster and Walker in Montreal together with their enemy of Catholicism undercut their cases to advance "freedom" and did a lot to turn "Canadien" assessment against their self-announced "heroes".
