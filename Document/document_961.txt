Dark colored came back to top notch cricket in 1947Ã¢ÂÂ 48, scoring 192 keeps running at 38.40 in the initial three matches of the period. The season saw an Indian voyage through Australia. The selectors at first dropped Barnes to match Brown with Morris to open the batting. Aside from two Tests amid the 1936Ã¢ÂÂ 37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil. He had just a single open door with the bat in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India tumbled to an innings rout. It was to be his solitary innings and Test coordinate on his home ground. Darker's investment in the arrangement was eclipsed by his dubious run out by Indian left arm customary spinner Vinoo Mankad in the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1947. Darker was run out for 18, when in the demonstration of conveying the ball, Mankad clutched it and whipped the safeguards off at the non-striker's end. Darker was well out of his wrinkle while he was backing-up the striker, so he could get a head begin on the off chance that he endeavored a run. This was the second time amid the season that Mankad had rejected Brown in this styleÃ¢ÂÂas he had recently done as such in a match against an Australian XI in November. On that event, Mankad had cautioned Brown before running him out. The neighborhood press emphatically blamed Mankad for being unsportsmanlike, albeit a few AustraliansÃ¢ÂÂincluding BradmanÃ¢ÂÂguarded Mankad's activities. As far as concerns him, Brown assumed full fault and downplayed the episode through hilarious motions in later matches, which alluded to the occasion. After this episode, if a batsman is given out along these lines, he is said to have been "Mankaded".
