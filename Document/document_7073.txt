Agony was too youthful to even think about serving King William Rufus, however as indicated by the later twelfth century compositions of Walter Map he may have been a chamberlainÃ¢ÂÂone of the authorities accountable for the imperial familyÃ¢ÂÂfor William's sibling, King Henry I (ruled 1100Ã¢ÂÂ 1135). There is no contemporary proof for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, that Pain was included with Henry's money related undertakings; rather it creates the impression that if without a doubt he was a chamberlain, he was a body worker. Guide relates an anecdote about Pain serving the ruler actually during the evening, furnishing Henry with wine if the lord called for it. The story proceeds with that Pain once drank the wine and was gotten out by Henry when the ruler in this manner requested his nightcap. Guide completes the story by saying that the ruler at that point requested that Pain ought to be allowed wine each night while anticipating the lord's pleasure. In spite of the fact that the story is probably not going to be valid in all subtleties, it recommends that Pain's support of the lord was close to home just as legal and administrative. Other proof against Map's case that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never verified an imperial contract in that office.
