In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant PeÄanac by air to Mehane (south-west of NiÅ¡ in the Toplica region) to prepare a guerrilla uprising in support of a planned Allied offensive. There, PeÄanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as "comitadji". PeÄanac joined forces with local leader Kosta VojinoviÄ, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because PeÄanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but VojinoviÄ was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in JanuaryÂ â February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, PeÄanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under PeÄanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on NiÅ¡ in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. PeÄanac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while VojinoviÄ ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. PeÄanac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.
