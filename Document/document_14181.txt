Weisman's science news-casting style utilizes interviews with scholastic and expert specialists to substantiate ends, while keeping up the "cool and impartial [tone]...of a logical spectator instead of a lobbyist". Weisman said he intentionally kept away from the dissident name: "A portion of our best science and nature authors just get perused by individuals who as of now concur with them. It's decent to get some insistence for whatever it is you accept is valid, regardless of whether it's very calming, yet I needed to compose something that individuals would peruse ... without limiting the essentialness of what's happening, nor trivializing it, nor distorting it." Richard Fortey looks at the book to crafted by Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and composes that "The World Without Us" "barely abstains from inducing the agony and-fate apathy that will in general overwhelm the poor peruser in the wake of perusing a list of human avarice". Imprint Lynas in the "New Statesman" noticed that "while most natural books list under the heaviness of their gathered awful news, "The World Without Us" appears to be refreshingly positive". Exhibiting the good faith on the inauspicious topic Appleton cites a biologist from the book saying "if the planet can recuperate from the Permian, it can recoup from the human".
