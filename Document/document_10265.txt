Nixon needed to dispose of Goodell, a Republican who had been delegated by Governor Rockefeller after the death of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had moved significantly to one side while in office. Goodell could be yielded as there was a Conservative Party applicant, James Buckley, who may win the seat. Nixon did not have any desire to be viewed as designing the annihilation of a kindred Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on an European excursion, trusting Agnew would be seen as following up on his own. In the wake of dueling long-remove with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on grounds savagery (Agnew thought of it as excessively lenient), Agnew gave a discourse in New York in which, without naming names, he made it obvious he bolstered Buckley. That Nixon was behind the intrigues did not stay mystery long, as both Agnew and Nixon guide Murray Chotiner uncovered it; Goodell expressed regardless he trusted he had Nixon's help. Despite the fact that it was by then esteemed impossible the Republicans could deal with the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the battle field for the last days before the race. The result was disillusioning: Republicans increased just two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one splendid spot was Goodell's annihilation by Buckley in New York, yet he was frustrated when his previous head of staff, Charles Blair, neglected to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.
