In 686, Mukhtar faked an idea of military help to Ibn al-Zubayr against a looming Umayyad assault on Medina with a definitive aim of removing him. Ibn al-Zubayr acknowledged and mentioned troops to Wadi al-Qura, a valley north of Medina, however rather, Mukhtar dispatched three thousand contenders under Shurahbil ibn Wars with requests to enter Medina until further notice. In the interim, Ibn al-Zubayr sent his partner Abbas ibn Sahl at the leader of a two thousand-in number power with directions to escort Ibn Wars and his men to Wadi al-Qura fully expecting the Syrian armed force and to murder Mukhtar's followers on the off chance that they won't. Ibn Wars to be sure won't and was murdered alongside the majority of his men. Mukhtar along these lines educated Ibn al-Hanafiyyah of his thwarted arrangement to catch the locale for the Alid and offered to send another military to Medina if Ibn al-Hanafiyyah informed the city's occupants that Mukhtar was dealing with his benefit. Ibn al-Hanafiyyah cannot, refering to his restriction to gore. In any case, Ibn al-Zubayr, subsequent to getting to be mindful of Mukhtar's aims and dreading an ace Alid revolt in the Hejaz, confined Ibn al-Hanafiyyah to persuasively pick up his devotion, trusting Mukhtar would stick to this same pattern. Ibn al-Hanafiyyah mentioned assistance from Mukhtar, who consequently dispatched a four thousand-in number power to free him. This caused a further disintegration in relations among Mecca and Kufa.
