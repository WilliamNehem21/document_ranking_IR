It is respectably serotinous, putting away just a single tenth the quantity of seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding "B.ÃÂ hookeriana" with which it coincides on sand hills in clean at Eneabba north of Perth. And still, at the end of the day, a significant number of its follicles don't discharge seed after a flame, yet rather after progressive harvest time downpours. A test mimicking wet climate following a flame saw a progression of "Banksia attenuata" cones with follicles exposed to twice week by week submersions in water in the wake of being warmed in a ring Bunsen fire to around for two minutes. Cones that had been presented to water for more weeks had more seed discharged from follicles after some time; around 40% discharged at threeÃÂ weeks, expanding consistently to practically 90% at tenÃÂ weeks, contrasted and a progression of controls (which were kept dry) of which less than 10% of seed discharged. In this way, the seed stays in the follicles until progressive downpours result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter (rather than dryer summer), expanding the opportunity of survival. After the follicle is part, the seed and separator are presented to the components. The wings of the woody separator are hygroscopic, and move together when wet, and spread and twist separated when dry. The seed is progressively drawn out by the development with each wetting.
