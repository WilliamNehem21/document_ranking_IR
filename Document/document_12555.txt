At St Peter's School, Crawford joined his instructing job with supervision of games, including going about as mentor for the cricket group. On a few events, he needed to demand leave from the director to play top of the line cricket. In the wake of touching base in Australia in December 1909, he was playing area cricket for East Torrens inside seven days, and played in South Australia's last three matches in the Sheffield Shield rivalry; the group proceeded to win the trophy out of the blue since 1893Ã¢ÂÂ 94. Crawford had an extensive influence in this achievement. There was some discussion over his qualification to play; New South Wales at first dissented, however there was a point of reference for disregarding the prerequisite of a three-month capability period, and the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) Executive Committee acknowledged this on account of Crawford, to the dismay of the full NSWCA. More than four seasons, Crawford played 22 matches for South Australia, scoring 1,512 keeps running at a normal of 40.86 and taking 120 wickets at 23.86. Green recommends that such an exhibition would have earned him Test choice in the event that he had been Australian, and "Wisden" noticed that his record in Australia was great.
