The dentary of the lower jaw extended in tallness towards the front (by the mandibular symphysis), where it was additionally leveled, and it had a downwards projection at the tip (which has been alluded to as a "jaw"). The lower side of the dentary was inward, the external side was raised in upper view, and a score kept running along it, which upheld foramina that sustained the teeth. The internal side of the dentary had a column of interdental plates, where every tooth had a foramen. The Meckelian groove kept running along the lower outskirt. The shape of the dentary demonstrates that the mouth of "Giganotosaurus" would have been wide. It is conceivable that each dentary had twelve alveoli (tooth attachments). A large portion of the alveoli were about 3.5ÃÂ cm (1.3ÃÂ in) long from front to back. The teeth of the dentary were of comparable shape and size, with the exception of the first, which was littler. The teeth were packed sideways, were oval in cross-area, and had serrations at the front and back outskirts, which is regular of theropods. The teeth were sigmoid-formed when found in front and back view. One tooth had nine to twelve serrations for every millimeter (0.039ÃÂ in). The side teeth of "Giganotosaurus" had bended edges of veneer, and the biggest teeth in the premaxilla (front of the upper jaw) had articulated wrinkles (with their most elevated help close to the serrations).
