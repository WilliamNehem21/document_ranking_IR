In a review survey for AllMusic, ErlewineÃ¢ÂÂthe site's senior supervisorÃ¢ÂÂasserted that "New York Dolls" was a more quintessential proto-punk collection than any of the Stooges' discharges in light of how it "loots history while commending it, making an unpleasant urban folklore en route". David Fricke contended that it was a more conclusive glitz shake collection than David Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust" (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan in light of how the band "caught both the magnificence and distress of glitz, the high curse and squandered youth, with electric photorealism". In "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" (2004), Joe Gross considered it a "significant" record and "epic scum, the sound of five young fellows forming the huge city in their own scuzzy picture". Sylvain credited its impact on punk shake to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the correct side, an introduction which he said more youthful groups, for example, the Ramones and the Sex Pistols embraced. Rundgren was diverted by how the record ended up thought about an antecedent to the punk development: "The incongruity is that I ended up delivering the original punk collection, yet I was never truly thought of as a punk maker, and I never got called by punk acts. They most likely idea I was unreasonably costly for what they were going for. Be that as it may, the Dolls didn't generally think about themselves punk."
