Known as "the Great Synthesizer", Childe is principally regarded for building up a combination of European and Near Eastern ancient times when most archeologists concentrated on provincial locales and groupings. Since his demise, this structure has been intensely modified after the disclosure of radiocarbon dating, his understandings have been "to a great extent rejected", and a considerable lot of his decisions about Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe have been observed to be mistaken. Childe himself trusted that his essential commitment to prehistoric studies was in his interpretative structures, an investigation bolstered by Alison Ravetz and Peter Gathercole. As indicated by Sherratt: "What is of enduring an incentive in his elucidations is the more definite dimension of composing, worried about the acknowledgment of examples in the material he portrayed. It is these examples which get by as great issues of European ancient times, notwithstanding when his clarifications of them are perceived as unseemly." Childe's hypothetical work had been to a great extent overlooked in his lifetime, and stayed overlooked in the decades after his passing, despite the fact that it would see a resurgence in the late 1990s and mid 2000s. It stayed best known in Latin America, where Marxism remained a center hypothetical current among archeologists all through the last twentieth century.
