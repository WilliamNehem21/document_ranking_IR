The species was first described in 1877, the first of many related species from the region described until the 1910s. In 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman consolidated most into the single species "Oryzomys couesi" and in 1960 Raymond Hall united this taxon with its United States relative, the marsh rice rat ("O.Â palustris"), into a single widespread species; subsequently, many related, localized species retained by Goldman were also included in this taxon. After studies of the contact zone in Texas, where "O.Â couesi" and the marsh rice rat meet, were published in 1979 and underscored the distinctness of the two, they were again regarded as separate. Since then, some of the peripheral forms of the group, such as "Oryzomys antillarum" from Jamaica and "Oryzomys peninsulae" from the Baja California Peninsula, have been reinstated as species. Nevertheless, "O.Â couesi" as currently constituted is likely a composite of several species; a 2010 study, using DNA sequence data, found evidence to recognize separate species from the Pacific and eastern sides of the distribution of "O.Â couesi" and two additional species from Panama and Costa Rica. Generally, "Oryzomys couesi" is common and of no conservation concern, and it is even considered a plague species in places, but some populations are threatened.
