From the get-go in 1940, the Paris Group settled on hypothetical grounds that substantial water would be a perfect mediator for how they proposed to utilize it. They solicited the French Minister from Armaments to get however much overwhelming water as could be expected from the main source, the extensive Norsk Hydro hydroelectric station at Vemork in Norway. The French at that point found that Germany had just offered to buy the whole supply of Norwegian substantial water, showing that Germany may likewise be inquiring about a nuclear bomb. The French told the Norwegian legislature of the conceivable military centrality of overwhelming water. Norway gave the whole supply of to a "DeuxiÃÂ¨me Bureau" operator, who subtly conveyed it to France just before Germany attacked Norway in April 1940. On 19 June 1940, after the German intrusion of France, it was sent to England by the Earl of Suffolk and Major Ardale Golding, on board the steamer . The substantial water, esteemed at ÃÂ£22,000, was at first kept at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, and was later covertly put away in the library at Windsor Castle. The Paris Group moved to Cambridge, except for Joliot-Curie, who stayed in France and ended up dynamic in the French Resistance.
