D. W. Griffith, the stroke of the Jesus College pontoon, was available at the debut meeting of the Oxford University Boat Club on 23 April 1839. In any case, Jesus College rowers had an inconsistent influence in college paddling in the nineteenth century. No Jesus College understudy served on the OUBC advisory group somewhere in the range of 1839 and 1899, the most recent year for which Sherwood gives records. Two understudies from the school (W.ÃÂ S.ÃÂ Thompson and E.ÃÂ W.ÃÂ Davies (cox)) were a piece of the losing Oxford team in the second OxfordÃ¢ÂÂ Cambridge vessel race in 1836. Somewhere in the range of 1858 and 1899, seven others trialed, ineffectively, for spots in the Oxford University team. From that point forward, school portrayal in the Boat Race has been progressively visit: M.ÃÂ L.ÃÂ Thomas and D.ÃÂ R.ÃÂ Glynne Jones (1952) and M.L. Thomas (President, 1953); Boris Mavra (1992, 1993 and 1995); the Canadian 2004 Olympic paddling silver medallist Barney Williams (2005 and 2006); and Brodie Buckland (2007). Justin Hutchinson paddled for Oxford's hold group, known as Isis, in the 2002 and 2003 Boat Races, as did Tim Farquharson, an undergrad considering Engineering Science, in 2009. Different ladies have won their "Blue" for contending in the Women's Boat Race against Cambridge: Anna Bean and Ann Bevitt (1989); Louise Sanford (1997); and Claire Weaver (1998).
