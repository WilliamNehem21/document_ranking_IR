The Xbox 360 was set as "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s base stage, being the "most straightforward to produce for", in the expressions of Pete Hines; the PC, being progressively similar to an "arbitrary amalgamation of illustrations cards and RAM and processors", and ineffectively "characterized". As they had finished with past amusements in the arrangement, Bethesda tossed out their old substance and innovation and started work again. Another motor was imagined, one which would exploit propelled lighting and shader schedules, similar to high-dynamic-go rendering and specular mapping. The last item was delivered with a motor shaped of a blend of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited's Gamebryo motor, "deceived out" in a joint effort with Bethesda's illustrations software engineers and NDL. Cheng has portrayed the diversion as "pixel-shader substantial", exploiting the element in rendering "metal, wood, stone, blood, skin", notwithstanding water, which was the main use "Morrowind" made of the innovation. Specifically, "Blankness" utilizes typical maps, diffuse maps, specular maps, and parallax maps, which Howard portrayed as "sort of like relocation mapping". "Insensibility" utilizes Radiant AI, another man-made reasoning framework that permits non-player characters to powerfully respond and collaborate with their general surroundings. General objectives, for example, "Eat at this city at 2pm" are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to decide how to accomplish them. The nonattendance of individual scripting for each character took into account the development of a world on an a lot bigger scale than different amusements had created, and helped in the formation of what Todd Howard depicted as a "natural feel" for the diversion.
