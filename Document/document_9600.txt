On March 6, 1922, Ruth marked another agreement for a long time at $52,000 every year. This was the biggest entirety at any point paid to a ballplayer up to that point, and it spoke to 40% of the group's player finance. In spite of his suspension, Ruth was named the Yankees' new on-field skipper before the 1922 season. Amid the suspension, he worked out with the group in the first part of the day and played presentation recreations with the Yankees on their off days. He and Meusel returned on May 20 to a sellout swarm at the Polo Grounds, however Ruth batted 0-for-4 and was booed. On May 25, he was tossed out of the diversion for tossing dust in umpire George Hildebrand's face, at that point moved into the stands to go up against a heckler. Boycott Johnson requested him fined, suspended, and deprived of position as group skipper. In his abbreviated season, Ruth showed up in 110 recreations, batted .315, with 35 grand slams, and drove in 99 runs, however the 1922 season was a mistake in contrast with his two past commanding years. In spite of Ruth's off-year, the Yankees figured out how to win the flag and confronted the New York Giants in the World Series for the second successive year. In the Series, Giants chief John McGraw educated his pitchers to toss him only curveballs, and Ruth never balanced. Ruth had only two hits in seventeen at bats, and the Yankees lost to the Giants for the second in a row year, by 4Ã¢ÂÂ 0 (with one tie amusement). Sportswriter Joe Vila called him, "a detonated marvel".
