Despite the fact that the synagogue had attempted advancements in certain zones of Jewish law, regardless it demanded exacting adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was expelled for administering at the marriage of a Jewish lady and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a period, the main assemblage in Brooklyn that observed Jewish occasions for the customary two days. In 1889 Baith Israel attested it was "the main standard gathering in the city", and that year the board constrained the acquiescence of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was ousted as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the "Brooklyn Eagle" campaigned nearby rabbis for their perspectives on the issue. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim expressed, "I don't trust my assembly would remove me in the event that I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander reacted, "While there are a few contrasts between the change and conventional Jews, I don't think it is the spot for any Jewish priest to eat ham. The reformers don't so carefully watch the old Mosaic law, yet it doesn't appear to me a genuine case for a rabbi to set to his gathering."
