On his return from Greece, Holst resumed his teaching and composing. In addition to his existing work he accepted a lectureship in composition at the University of Reading and joined Vaughan Williams in teaching composition at their "alma mater" the RCM. Inspired by Adrian Boult's conducting classes at the RCM, Holst tried to further pioneer music education for women by proposing to the High Mistress of St Paul's Girls' School that he should invite Boult to give classes at the school: "It would be glorious if the SPGS turned out the only women conductors in the world!" In his soundproof room at SPGS he composed the "Ode to Death", a setting of a poem by Whitman, which according to Vaughan Williams is considered by many to be Holst's most beautiful choral work.
Holst, in his forties, suddenly found himself in demand. The New York Philharmonic and Chicago Symphony Orchestra vied to be the first to play "The Planets" in the US. The success of that work was followed in 1920 by an enthusiastic reception for "The Hymn of Jesus", described in "The Observer" as "one of the most brilliant and one of the most sincere pieces of choral and orchestral expression heard for some years." "The Times" called it "undoubtedly the most strikingly original choral work which has been produced in this country for many years."
