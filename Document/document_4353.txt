While Ferdinand kept the French involved, Prussia needed to fight with Sweden, Russia, and Austria, all of which needed to cut out a bit of Prussia for themselves. Prussia could lose Silesia to Austria, Pomerania to Sweden, Magdeburg to Saxony, and East Prussia to Poland or Russia: a completely nightmarish situation. By 1758, Frederick was progressively worried by the Russian development from the east and walked to counter it. Only east of the Oder stream in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf, on 25 August 1758 a Prussian armed force of 35,000 men battled a Russian armed force of 43,000. The two sides endured overwhelming losses however the Russians pulled back, and Frederick guaranteed triumph. At the Battle of Tornow a month later, a Swedish armed force spurned the Prussian armed force, yet did not proceed onward Berlin. By pre-fall, battling had brought about a draw. None of Prussia's adversaries appeared to find a way to seek after Frederick into Prussia's heartland. The Austrian Feldmarshalleutnant Leopold Josef Graf Daun could have finished the war in October at Hochkirch, however he neglected to catch up on his triumph with a decided quest for Frederick's withdrawing armed force. This permitted Frederick time to enlist another military over the winter.
