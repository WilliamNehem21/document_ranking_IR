Headlam progressed toward becoming Officer Commanding North-Western Area in January 1946. Presented on Britain toward the year's end, he went to the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and presented with RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London. On his arrival to Australia, in November 1947, he moved toward becoming Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. In November 1950, Headlam was delegated to assume control over direction of No.ÃÂ 90 (Composite) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan.

The Lincolns directed region besieging missions over socialist held region, just as strikes against pinpoint targets. The Dakotas were entrusted with dispatch flights, VIP transport and restorative departures crosswise over South East Asia, and in Malaya with carrying troops and load, dropping supplies to benevolent powers and despatching promulgation handouts. Headlam was marginally harmed on 20ÃÂ December, when a No.ÃÂ 38 Squadron Dakota he was co-steering on a supply drop crash-arrived at Kampong Aur in Pahang, following motor disappointment.
