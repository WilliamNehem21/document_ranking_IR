Heinlein rapidly became one of the most prolific contributors to "Astounding", publishing almost two dozen short stories in the next two years, along with three novels: "If This Goes Onâ", "Sixth Column", and "Methuselah's Children". In September 1940, van Vogt's first novel, "Slan", began serialization; the book was partly inspired by a challenge Campbell laid down to van Vogt that it was impossible to tell a superman story from the point of view of the superman. It proved to be one of the most popular stories Campbell published, and is an example of the way Campbell worked with his writers to feed them ideas and generate the material he wanted to buy. Asimov's "Robot" series began to take shape in 1941, "Reason" and "Liar!" appearing in the April and May issues; as with "Slan", these stories were partly inspired by conversations with Campbell. The September 1941 issue included Asimov's short story "Nightfall", one of the most lauded sf stories ever written, and in November, "Second Stage Lensmen", a novel in Smith's "Lensman" series, began serialization. The following year saw the beginning of Asimov's "Foundation" stories, with "Foundation" appearing in May and "Bridle and Saddle" in June. Van Vogt's "Recruiting Station", in the March issue, was the first story in his "Weapon Shop" series, described by John Clute as the most compelling of all van Vogt's work.
