"ChÃ¡vez: Inside the Coup" aired on RTÃ One on 18Â February 2003, as an installment of the channel's "True Lives" documentary series. The broadcast prompted a passionate public and critical response, and "lively debate" on radio and in newspapers; RTÃ soon arranged for a repeat broadcast. In the United Kingdom, it aired on BBC Two on 16Â October 2003, as part of the channel's "Storyville" documentary strand, and on BBC Four on 18Â November 2003. "Chavez: Inside the Coup" also aired in Canada, Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark. The speed of the television broadcasts left a full theatrical run unlikelyâa fact the filmmakers later regretted. The film also failed to be picked up by a television company in the US, although HBO was interested at one point. In Venezuela, "La revoluciÃ³n no serÃ¡ transmitida" premiÃ¨red on 13Â April 2003, on state television channel Venezolana de TelevisiÃ³n (VTV). It has since been shown regularly on Venezuelan television; the state-funded community station Catia TVe often broadcasts the film during "contentious political conjunctures", such as the 2004 recall referendum, the 2006 presidential election, and in 2007 to "help build support" for the government's controversial attempt to not renew the license of private television network RCTV.
