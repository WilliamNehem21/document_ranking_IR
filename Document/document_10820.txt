In the mean time, the Willie and Martin organizations were coming up short on nourishment and experiencing harshly cool temperatures. On October 19, a snow squall struck the district, ending the two organizations and the help party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River moving toward the Continental Divide. An exploring party sent ahead by the principle salvage party found and welcomed the exiled people, gave them a little measure of flour, supported them that salvage was close, and after that surged forward to attempt to find the Martin Company. The individuals from the Willie Company had quite recently achieved the finish of their flour supplies. They started butchering the bunch of separated dairy cattle that still remained while their loss of life mounted. On October 20, Captain Willie and Joseph Elder proceeded by donkey through the snow to find the supply train and illuminate them of the organization's edgy circumstance. They touched base at the salvage gathering's campground close South Pass that night, and by the following night the salvage party achieved the Willie Company and gave them sustenance and help. Half of the salvage party stayed to help the Willie Company while the other half squeezed forward to help the Martin Company. The troubles of the Willie Company were not yet finished. On October 23, the second day after the principle salvage party had arrived, the Willie Company confronted the most troublesome segment of the trailÃ¢ÂÂthe climb up Rocky Ridge. The ascension occurred amid a wailing snowstorm through knee-profound snow. That night 13 exiled people kicked the bucket.
