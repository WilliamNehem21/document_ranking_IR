The Whigs, looking to recover Breckinridge's seat, named Kentucky State Attorney General James Harlan, however some Whig groups contradicted him, and he pulled back in March. Robert P. Letcher, a previous congressman and representative who had won 14 decisions in Kentucky without a misfortune, was the gathering's second decision. The two applicants crusaded enthusiastically all through the Eighth District, giving different addresses multi day among May and August. Letcher was an accomplished campaigner, yet his prominent, tale filled rhetoric was unpolished, and he was inclined to upheavals of displeasure when disappointed. On the other hand, Breckinridge conveyed quiet, all around contemplated talks. Cassius Clay, a political adversary of Letcher's for quite a long time, supported Breckinridge, regardless of their disparities on servitude. Refering to this support and the abolitionism of Breckinridge's uncles, Letcher attempted to paint Breckinridge as an adversary of servitude. Breckinridge indicated his reliable help for bondage and asserted Letcher was really unfriendly to the interests of slaveholders. In spite of the fact that the area had gone for Whig applicant Winfield Scott by more than 600 votes in the earlier year's presidential race, Breckinridge crushed Letcher by 526 votes. Indeed, he got an extensive edge in Owen County, which detailed 123 a bigger number of votes than qualified voters living in the province. Thankful for the help of the dependably Democratic district, he gave his child John Witherspoon Breckinridge the epithet "Owen".
