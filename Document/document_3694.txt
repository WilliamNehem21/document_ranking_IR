On the earthbound globe, tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the globe are set apart by red and blue lines separately. These lines were connected when the globe was first made. They are referenced in a portrayal of Molyneux's globes in "Blundeville His Exercises" (1594) by Thomas Blundeville, a nation respectable man who was an eager understudy of space science and route. Thomas Cavendish seems to have helped Molyneux with his globes, and it is conceivable that Molyneux went with him on his 1587 voyage the world over, which came back to England on 9 September 1588. In 1889, Sir Clements Markham, an English adventurer, creator and geographer, called attention to that a Latin legend on the earthly globe, set off the Patagonian coast, states: "Thomas Caundish "18 Dec. 1587 hÃÂ¦c land" sub nostris oculis "primum obtulit sub latitud 47 cujus seu admodum salubris IncolÃÂ¦ maturi ex parte proceri sunt gigantes et vasti magnitudinis"". In any case, Helen Wallis, previous Map Curator of the British Library, saw in 1951 this was impossible, in light of the fact that Molyneux erroneously plotted Cavendish's course in Maritime Southeast Asia. She recommended, notwithstanding, that another legend on the globe may demonstrate that he cruised on no less than one if not all of John Davis' voyages.
