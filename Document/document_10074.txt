Harvey required an approach to get individuals to Monte Ne. In 1900, there were not many satisfactory streets, and vehicles were not yet down to earth. The normal arrangement appeared to be to construct a railroad from Lowell, Arkansas to Monte Ne. The Arkansas Railroad Commission allowed a sanction on April 26, 1902, and the Monte Ne Railway Company was consolidated in May 1902, with a capital load of $250,000. Other than Harvey, the organization notwithstanding: Carl A. Starck, P. G. Davidson, A. L. Williams, B. R. Davidson, J. H. McIlroy, J. W. Kimmons, F. F. Freeman, J. F. Felker, Robert H. Harven and Thomas W. Harvey (Coin's sibling). Another of Harvey's siblings, a broker at Huntington, West Virginia, outfitted $25,000. Of the 250 offers in the organization, 240 were enlisted in Harvey's name. The five-mile (8ÃÂ km) private railroad goad began at the Lowell exchange station. Fourteen thousand oak railroad ties were laid going through Cross Hollows, south of Rogers, where two gorges met. It at that point went through Limedale, ending above Big Spring Lake at a log lodge terminal with outdoors lounge areas. Harvey rented a motor, a delicate, and a traveler mentor from the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad. The railroad opened on June 19, 1902. Harvey imported a 50-foot (15ÃÂ m) gondola from Venice in July 1901 to meet visitors touching base by rail and convey them to the hotel.
