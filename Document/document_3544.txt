Mouhot, as other early Western guests, thought that it was hard to trust that the Khmers could have fabricated the sanctuary and erroneously dated it to around a similar time as Rome. His reports enlivened the French government, as of now a set up nearness in Indochina, to start a deliberate investigation of the remains. The genuine history of Angkor Wat was sorted out from expressive and epigraphic proof amassed amid ensuing clearing and rebuilding work. There were no customary abodes or houses or different indications of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or things of dress generally found at antiquated locales. Rather there is just the proof of the landmarks themselves. An investigation commission started drawing up a rundown of essential landmarks. Ensuing missions duplicated engravings composed on Angkor structures so researchers may interpret them and pick up something of Angkor's history. By 1885 they had stirred up an order of the rulers and built up the layouts of a portrayal of the development that had delivered the sanctuary complex. In 1898 the French chose to submit considerable assets to Angkor's protection. Hundreds of years of disregard had allowed the wilderness to recover a large number of the more critical structures, and except if endeavors were made to free the structures from the grasp of immense banyan and silk-cotton trees, they may before long be squashed to pulverization.
