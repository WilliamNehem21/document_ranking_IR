Another attribute spinosaurs imparted to gharials was an expanded nose tip that used a rosette-formed cluster of interlocking teeth, adroit for skewering and getting fish. Despite the fact that to a lesser degree than most known spinosaurs, this component was additionally present in the "Angaturama limai" holotype. In 2002, Sues and associates called attention to, be that as it may, that there would be no motivation to accept that the Spinosauridae concentrated totally in angling. They pushed rather that this head morphology shows a generalistic bolstering, especially on little prey creatures. Truth be told, segments of a youthful "Iguanodon", an earthbound herbivore, were found inside the fossil skeleton of one "Baryonyx". Naish and partners in 2004 bolstered the hypothesis that "Irritator" chased both sea-going and earthly creatures as a generalist inside the beach front territory and what's more likely hunt down flesh. A tooth having a place with "Irritator" was found still embedded into the fossil neck vertebral segment of an ornithocheirid pterosaur, likely with a wingspan of . This demonstrates "Irritator" ate pterosaurs also, in spite of the fact that it isn't known whether it effectively chased these creatures or just searched the remaining parts. In 2018, Aureliano and associates displayed a conceivable situation for the nourishment web of the Romualdo Formation. The scientists recommended that spinosaurines from the development may have additionally gone after earthly and oceanic crocodyliforms, adolescents of their own species, turtles, and little to medium-sized dinosaurs. This would have made spinosaurines zenith predators inside this specific biological community.
