Rivera is all around regarded all through baseball for his demonstrable skill. Individual closer Joe Nathan stated, "I admire how he's dealt with himself on and off the field... You never observe him show up anybody and he regards the diversion. I've generally admired him and it's dependably a compliment to be simply referenced in a similar sentence as him." Michael Young said of Rivera, "I regard Mo more than anyone in the diversion. The person goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [Jorge] Posada's hand. You acknowledge somebody who regards the diversion as he does, regards the general population he plays with and against, and clearly his outcomes represent themselves." In a "Sports Illustrated" main story about Rivera that was distributed in the last seven day stretch of his vocation, Verducci said of the pitcher, "Couple of players in any game have resigned with more veneration from his friends." Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 all the time; at the season of his retirement, he was the main dynamic player still grandfathered by the association to wear Jackie Robinson's resigned number. Talking about Rivera's association with her better half, Robinson's widow Rachel stated: "[Rivera] conducted himself with nobility and effortlessness, and that made conveying the number a tribute to Jack... I've generally been glad and satisfied that Mariano was the one picked to wear that number since I think he conveyed something unique to it." Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig stated: "All through his distinguished vocation, he has spoken to his family, his nation, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the most extreme class and respect. It is entirely fitting that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacrosanct number 42."
