John Hillcoat's troupe wrongdoing spine chiller "Triple 9" (2016) included Winslet as Irina Vlaslov, a savage Russian-Israeli criminal. The pundit Ann Hornaday of "The Washington Post" felt that Winslet had neglected to successfully depict her. Her next arrival of the year, "Insurance Beauty", about a man (played by Will Smith) battling with the demise of his little girl, was panned by pundits. Composing for "New York" magazine, Emily Yoshida condemned it as a vacuous revamp of "A Christmas Carol" and composed that Winslet had "never looked progressively painted and tired". It was an unassuming worker in the cinematic world. Winslet consented to the sentimental catastrophe film "The Mountain Between Us" (2017) to assume the test of a job requiring physical effort. It included Idris Elba and her as two outsiders who crash arrive on a cold, separated mountain go. They recorded in the mountains of Western Canada at 10,000 feet above ocean level where the temperature was well beneath solidifying. Winslet played out her very own tricks and depicted it as the most physically exhausting background of her profession. "The Atlantic"s Megan Garber lauded the science among Elba and Winslet, and Moira Macdonald of "The Seattle Times" believed that their allure had upgraded an unremarkable picture.
