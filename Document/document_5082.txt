More noteworthy to the ruler than the budgetary parts of this offer were the weapons: he had at the time somewhere in the range of 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, however no ammo for them. The proposed game plan would extravagantly stock his weapons store with the two guns and projectiles, which may demonstrate conclusive in case of contention with the South African Republic.

Lobengula had Helm run over the archive with him a few times, in extraordinary detail, to guarantee that he legitimately comprehended what was composed.
