Some reviewers have likened "Ico" to older, simpler adventure games such as "Prince of Persia" or "Tomb Raider", that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player; IGNs David Smith commented that while simple, as an experience the game was "near indescribable." The game's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that "The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it." Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments, the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, as well as the use of lighting effects. "Ico"s ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. Charles Herold of "The New York Times" summed up his review stating that "Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments." Herold later commented that "Ico" breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions. In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non-playable characters' fate, but "Ico" creates the sense of "trust and childish fragility" around Yorda, and that these leads to the character being "the game's entire focus".
