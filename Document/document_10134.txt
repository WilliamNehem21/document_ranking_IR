RKO discharged a restricted slate of twelve highlights in its first year; in 1930, that figure dramatically increased to twenty-nine. At first sorted out as the unmistakable business elements RKO Productions Inc. what's more, RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a change into the new, brought together RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Energized by "Rio Rita"s achievement, RKO delivered a few exorbitant musicals fusing Technicolor arrangements, among them "Dixiana" and "Hit the Deck", both scripted and coordinated, similar to "Rio Rita", by Luther Reed. Following the case of the other real studios, RKO had wanted to make its own melodic revue, "Radio Revels". Advanced as the studio's most extreme creation to date, it was to be shot totally in Technicolor. The task was surrendered, in any case, as the open's desire for musicals incidentally died down. From a sum of in excess of sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and more than eighty the next year, the number dropped to eleven of every 1931. RKO was left in a sticky situation: despite everything it had an agreement with Technicolor to deliver two additional highlights with its framework. Muddling matters, crowds had come to connect shading with the quickly out-of-support melodic sort because of an excess of such preparations from the real Hollywood studios. Satisfying its commitments, RKO created two all-Technicolor pictures, "The Runaround" and "Fanny Foley Herself" (both 1931), containing no melodic groupings. Nor was a triumph.
