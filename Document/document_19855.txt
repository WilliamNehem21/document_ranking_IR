As well as entertaining old friends who came to visit her in her home, Cameron also met with younger occultists, such as the Thelemite William Breeze and the industrial musician Genesis P-Orridge. Cameron aided Breeze in co-editing a collection of Parsons' occult and libertarian writings, which were published as "Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword" in 1989. Cameron was acquainted with the experimental film-maker Chick Strand and appeared in the latter's 1979 project "Loose Ends", during which she narrated the story of an exorcism. In 1989, an exhibition of her work titled "The Pearl of Reprisal" was held at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. It included a selection of her paintings and a screening of "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome" and "The Wormwood Star", while Cameron attended to provide a candle-lit reading of her poetry. In the mid-1990s, Cameron was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent radiotherapy treatment, which she supplemented with alternative medicines. The tumor was cancerous and metastasized to her lungs. She died at the age of 73 in the VA Medical Center on July 24, 1995, and underwent the Thelemic last rites, carried out by a high priestess of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Her body was cremated and its ashes were scattered in the Mojave Desert. A memorial event was held at Venice's Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in August.
