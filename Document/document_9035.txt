"S. gracilis" was the littlest species, assessed at in weight, about the measure of a puma. It was like its ancestor "Megantereon" of a similar size, yet its dentition and skull were further developed, drawing closer "S. fatalis". "S. fatalis" was transitional in size between "S. gracilis" and "S. populator". It ran from . what's more, achieved a shoulder tallness of and body length of . It was like a lion in measurements, yet was progressively powerful and strong, and along these lines had a bigger weight. Its skull was likewise like that of "Megantereon", however increasingly enormous and with bigger canines. "S. populator" was among the biggest known felids, with a weight scope of , and one gauge proposing up to . It remained at a shoulder tallness of . Contrasted with "S.ÃÂ fatalis", "S.ÃÂ populator" was progressively vigorous and had an increasingly prolonged and thin skull with a straighter upper profile, higher situated nasal bones, an increasingly vertical occiput, progressively enormous metapodials and somewhat longer forelimbs in respect to hindlimbs. Substantial tracks from Argentina (for which the ichnotaxon name "Smilodonichium" has been proposed) have been credited to "S. populator", and measure by . This is bigger than tracks of the Bengal tiger, to which the impressions have been analyzed.
