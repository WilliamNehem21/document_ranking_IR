The Munshi was seen to have exploited his situation as the Queen's top pick, and to have transcended his status as a modest assistant, causing disdain in the court. On a voyage through Italy, he distributed a commercial in the "Florence Gazette" expressing that "<nowiki>[h]</nowiki>e is having a place with a decent and very conscious famiely". Karim wouldn't go with different Indians and appropriated the house cleaner's washroom for his elite use. On a visit to Coburg, he wouldn't go to the marriage of Victoria's granddaughter Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, on the grounds that her dad, Victoria's child Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, relegated him a seat in the exhibition with the hirelings. Defied by the restriction of her family and retainers, the Queen shielded her top pick. She kept in touch with her private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby: "to make out that the poor great Munshi is so "low" is extremely absurd and in a nation like England very out of placeÃÂ ... She has realized 2 Archbishops who were children individually of a Butcher and a GrocerÃÂ ... Abdul's dad saw great and good administration as a Dr and he [Karim] feels slice to the heart at being in this manner talked about."
