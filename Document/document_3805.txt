Under expanded weight from the United Nations, on 7ÃÂ May 1949 DutchÃ¢ÂÂ Indonesian exchanges brought about the RoemÃ¢ÂÂ van Roijen Agreement, a dubious measure which ensured Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta, among different focuses; The Dutch withdrawal started in late June, and the Indonesian authority started coming back to Yogyakarta from outcast toward the beginning of July. Sukarno requested Sudirman to come back to Yogyakarta also, however Sudirman would not give the Dutch a chance to pull back without a battle; he thought about the TNI to now be sufficiently able to overcome the dampened Dutch. In spite of the fact that he was guaranteed drug and backing in Yogyakarta, Sudirman would not come back to the political administration, whom he thought about passive to the Dutch. He just consented to return in the wake of getting a letter, in spite of the fact that sources differ on its sender. On 10 July, Sudirman and his gathering came back to Yogyakarta, where they were welcomed by a great many regular people and energetically gotten by the political first class there. The columnist Rosihan Anwar, who was available when the letter was conveyed, wrote in 1973 that "Sudirman needed to come back to Yogyakarta to maintain a strategic distance from any impression of a break among the republic's top chiefs".
