Such a large number of Southern Rhodesians were pulled back from the channels for officer preparing that in mid-1915 Brady offered through the Salisbury and Bulawayo presses for more volunteers to supplant the individuals who had been dispatched. A unit of Southern Rhodesians with the second Battalion, KRRC partook in the "huge push" of 1 July 1916, the main day of the Battle of the Somme, charging German positions somewhere else at stake early that morning. There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the assault and just 10 alive and unwounded a while later. On the Somme front line itself, Rhodesians were among those at Delville Wood, which started on 14 July. This was the South African first Infantry Brigade's first commitment, and a portion of the colonials blacked up and imitated Zulu calls to war and war moves. Regardless of enduring setbacks of disastrous extentsÃ¢ÂÂabout 80% of the detachment's staff were executed, injured or caughtÃ¢ÂÂthey took the Wood and held it as requested until they were calmed on 20 July. When of its withdrawal, the South African Brigade, initially numbering 3,155 (123 officers and 3,032 different positions), had been decreased to 19 officers and 600 men. Delville Wood was later portrayed by Sir BÃÂ H Liddell Hart as "the bloodiest fight hellfire of 1916". "God realizes I never wish to see such unpleasant sights again," a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the fight kept in touch with home; "on occasion I wished it would come quick, anything to escape that awful passing snare and lethal spot."
