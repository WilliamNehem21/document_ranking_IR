A green rosella example was gathered in Adventure Bay, Tasmania, by boats' specialist William Anderson on the third voyage of James Cook somewhere in the range of 26 and 30 January 1777. Cook composed of seeing "yellowish paroquets" in the forested areas there. Anderson gathered many winged animal examples while entrusted as the campaign's naturalist, in spite of the fact that he passed on of tuberculosis in 1778 preceding the arrival home. Numerous accumulation regions were wrong, and notes were lost or sorted out numerous years after the fact. The example, alongside numerous others, wound up in the gathering of British naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. English naturalist John Latham saw it there and expounded on the green rosella in his 1780s work "A General Synopsis of Birds". He considered it the Caledonian parrot as he accepted (erroneously) it originated from New Caledonia. He even associated it may be the female with the horned parakeet, which he likewise found in Banks' gathering. Latham did not give them binomial names, be that as it may. It was left to German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin to depict the species, which he did as "Psittacus caledonicus" in the thirteenth version of "Systema Naturae" in 1788.
