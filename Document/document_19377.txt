"Mad Max: Fury Road" was eventually filmed in 2012 in the Namibian desert. Miller had conceived Nux, a terminally ill slave, as a "quasi kamikaze pilot"; Hoult said of his character; "he's very enthusiastic and committed and affectionate but also kind of clumsy". Hoult shaved his head and followed a strict diet because his role required him to lose a lot of weight. He also talked about performing stunts in the film, describing the entire experience as "scary", but favourably compared the stunt crew and Miller's choice to incorporate real action sequences instead of using a green screen, saying it made the performance more believable because the actors are placed in a real situation. "Fury Road" opened to critical acclaim on 14 May 2015 and grossed more than $378 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the "Mad Max" franchise. The technical aspects and stunt sequences drew particular praise from film critics and it was credited for reviving interest in the series. Shalini Langer noted that while the real hero of the film was Theron, "[Hoult] is the closest in the acting department [...] as Joe's "war boy" chasing imagined glory". Hoult's "fabulously unhinged" performance was also praised by Robbie Collin of "The Daily Telegraph". Also in 2012, Hoult was included in the "Forbes" 30 under 30 list.
