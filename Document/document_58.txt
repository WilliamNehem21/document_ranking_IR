In 2008, the time of Lancaster's century, Peter York called him "A national fortune ... ostensibly Britain's most well known paper sketch artist, absolutely our best, famous building student of history and artist and a standout amongst the most propelled twentieth century theater, musical show and artful dance architects." But York included that as of late Lancaster had been to a great extent overlooked: "Individuals under 40 don't have any acquaintance with him", as despite everything they knew Betjeman from his numerous TV programs. The "Oxford Companion to English Literature" called Lancaster "an author, craftsman, visual artist, and theater fashioner, whose many showed works delicately mock the English lifestyle: he was especially great at countryÃ¢ÂÂhouse and upperÃ¢ÂÂclass engineering and peculiarities, yet additionally had a sharp eye for the suburbs." The tribute in "The Times" portrayed him as "the most obliging and unsplenetic of illustrators, he was never a crusader, remaining dependably a clever, cultivated faultfinder with a significant comprehension of the impulses of human instinct." Sir Roy Strong composed that Lancaster's kid's shows were those "of a respectable man of the old school ... He never crossed into the splendid viciousness of Gerald Scarfe or "Spitting Image". The jokes in his pocket kid's shows were Cowardesque".
