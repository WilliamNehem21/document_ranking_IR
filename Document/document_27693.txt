In 1920, at the age of 20, Coward starred in his own play, the light comedy "I'll Leave It to You". After a tryout in Manchester, it opened in London at the New Theatre (renamed the NoÃ«l Coward Theatre in 2006), his first full-length play in the West End. Neville Cardus's praise in "The Manchester Guardian" was grudging. Notices for the London production were mixed, but encouraging. "The Observer" commented, "Mr Coward... has a sense of comedy, and if he can overcome a tendency to smartness, he will probably produce a good play one of these days." "The Times", on the other hand, was enthusiastic: "It is a remarkable piece of work from so young a head â spontaneous, light, and always 'brainy'."
The play ran for a month (and was Coward's first play seen in America), after which Coward returned to acting in works by other writers, starring as Ralph in "The Knight of the Burning Pestle" in Birmingham and then London. He did not enjoy the role, finding Francis Beaumont and his sometime collaborator John Fletcher "two of the dullest Elizabethan writers ever knownÂ ... I had a very, very long part, but I was very, very bad at it". Nevertheless, "The Manchester Guardian" thought that Coward got the best out of the role, and "The Times" called the play "the jolliest thing in London".
