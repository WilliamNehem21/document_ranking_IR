Sunderland moved to Newcastle Road in 1886. By 1898, the ground achieved a limit of 15,000 after remodels, and its lease had ascended to ÃÂ£100 (ÃÂ£ today) a year. Close to the turn of the twentieth century, Sunderland required a greater arena. They came back to Roker and set up home in Roker Park. It was opened on 10 September 1898, and the home group played a match that day against Liverpool, which they won. The arena's ability expanded to 50,000 after redevelopment with modeler Archibald Leitch in 1913. Sunderland were almost bankrupted by the expense of revamping the Main Stand, and Roker Park was set available to be purchased however no further move was made. OnÃÂ 8 March 1933, a packed Roker Park recorded the most noteworthy ever participation at a Sunderland coordinate, 75,118 against Derby County in a FA Cup 6th round replay. Roker Park endured a shelling in 1943, in which one corner of the arena was decimated. A unique constable was slaughtered while watching the arena. By the 1990s, the arena was never again sufficiently huge, and had no space for conceivable development. In January 1990, the Taylor Report was discharged in the wake of congestion at the Hillsborough Stadium brought about 96 passings, an occurrence known as the Hillsborough Disaster. The report prescribed that all major arenas must be changed over to an all-seater structure. Subsequently, Roker Park's ability was diminished. It was destroyed in 1997 and a lodging home inherent its place.
