Entered through the opening in the West Range, that had been obstructed for more than 100 years before Sackville-West and Nicolson's entry, the Top Courtyard is ruled by the Tower. Planted against another divider built on old establishments is the Purple Border, a shading palette intentionally picked by Sackville-West in resistance of Gertrude Jekyll's announcement against massing purple blossoms. The planting essayist Tony Lord thinks of it as "the yard's most noteworthy greatness". The stature of the Tower draws in significant breeze which requires escalated staking of the plants, especially the taller examples, for example, Sackville-West's abundantly supported "Rosa moyesii". On the contrary side of the Tower is the Tower Lawn, otherwise called the Lower Courtyard; Nicolson underscored that "the English grass is the premise of our greenery enclosure structure". The west-east vista from the Top Courtyard, through the Tower passage, over the Tower Lawn, and to the statue of Dionysus over the channel, shapes a standout amongst the most critical level tomahawks. It cuts up the north-south pivot running from the White Garden, over the Tower Lawn, to the Roundel in the Rose Garden. In the southwestern corner of the Tower Lawn is a little greenery enclosure known as the Sunk Garden. It was made in 1930 as the Lion Pond, however the lake was inclined to releasing and was depleted in 1939. The site was in this way considered for planting what turned into the White Garden, however was eventually dismissed as excessively restricted, obscure, and clammy. The Trust is thinking about restoration of the pool.
