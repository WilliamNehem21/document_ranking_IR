In light of Clement's visit, also, the Pope had enabled the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews to make a move to save the ward. He told these priests that, Since the ceaseless consideration of the considerable number of temples is our every day load, we allow to the said Church [Dunblane], so far as we by and by can, and approve you, in the event that you observe the circumstance to be as depicted, to relegate to the said Bishop, in the event that it very well may be managed without embarrassment, a fourth of the teinds of all the area houses of worship of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your direction and that of upstanding men, he may set aside a reasonable segment of them for his own upkeep, and from there on dole out incomes for a senior member and groups whom we wish and approve you to establish there. Coming up short this, the Pope composed, The quarter teinds of the considerable number of temples of the Diocese doled out to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you will exchange with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese [i.e. to Inchaffray Abbey], who will have capacity to choose a Bishop in any opening.
