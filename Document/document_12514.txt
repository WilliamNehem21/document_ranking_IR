A crying, insubordinate Bosse went off without anyone else's input to the shoreline resort HornbÃÂ¦k in Denmark, an a lot shorter trek, however to her detects, a superbly reviving one. There, she was before long pursued by Strindberg's letters, loaded with struggled regret at having given her agony, and afterward by Strindberg himself, steeling himself to manage the public activity Bosse savored. In any case, the relationship immediately foundered on envy and doubt, as when Strindberg struck a picture taker over the head with his stick, unfit to bear any regard for Bosse.

At her request, Strindberg started separate from procedures.
