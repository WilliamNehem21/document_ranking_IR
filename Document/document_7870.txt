In southern Eaton County, the interstate parallels the Battle Creek River north of the intersection with M-78. Close Olivet, I-69 starts to turn a northeasterly way and bends around the north part of town. On the south side of Charlotte, I-69 turns northward, navigating a zone toward the east of downtown and intersection the previous steering of USÃÂ 27, which is presently part of the business circle for the city. More distant north, the road has an intersection with M-50, an extension over the Battle Creek River, and an exchange with the northern end of the business circle alongside Fitch H. Shoreline Airport. North of the airplane terminal, I-69 turns northeasterly again and parallels Lansing Road, the previous course of USÃÂ 27/M-78. The road meets the southern end of M-100 close Potterville and proceeds into the LansingÃ¢ÂÂ East Lansing metropolitan territory. Southwest of the state's capital city, I-69 traverses Lansing Road close Lansing Delta Township Assembly, a processing plant for General Motors; upper east of the intricate, I-69 converges into I-96. The consolidated I-96/I-69 runs northward through the rural edges of the Lansing territory, crossing the western closures of I-496 and the BL I-69 for Lansing. The interstate enters Clinton County, and only north of an intersection of the Grand River, I-69 diverts eastbound to isolate from I-96. As a piece of the bigger exchange with I-96, I-69 crosses BL I-96 (Grand River Avenue) with no associations.
