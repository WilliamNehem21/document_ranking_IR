Engineering was by all account not the only inheritance of the Normans. Standard over the workers (there was no settled white collar class) was likewise authorized by a primitive framework, unaltered since its presentation following the Norman triumph of 1071. Along these lines the Sicilian nobility had riches as well as huge labor at their order, something that had at this point declined in numerous different pieces of Europe. As in Southern Spain, the immense country domains remained nearly as concentrated as when they had been Roman "latifundi". The Sicilian economy, however in all respects to a great extent agronomically based, was extremely solid, and turned out to be all the more so amid the eighteenth century as transportation turned out to be progressively proficient and the risk of Muslim robbery withered away. The fare markets for lemons (for the extraordinary eighteenth century style for lemonade) and wines expanded enormously, and Sicilian wheat stayed, as it had been since Roman occasions, the foundation of the economy. The debacle that was to give Sicily its cutting edge notoriety of neediness, in particular the opening-up of the American Middle West to wheat-cultivating, was a century away. When it came, this for all time more than split the cost of wheat, and demolished the old economy for eternity.
