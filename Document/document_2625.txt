The Tech kickoff was returned 17 yards by Gilyard to the Cincinnati 40-yard line, giving the Bearcats great field position to begin their drive. Two surges by Goebel brought about 11 yards and a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. This accomplishment on the ground was trailed by progressively through the air, as Pike finished three continuous passes: a 16-yarder to Gilyard, a 3-yarder to Goodman, and a 14-yarder to Gilyard. Goebel then ran five yards to the Tech 11-yard line. Two Pike passes fell fragmented, setting up fourth down. Instead of endeavor to kick a field objective, Cincinnati head mentor Brian Kelly requested the offense to endeavor to change over the fourth down. This was done when Pike finished a seven-yard go to Goodman for a first down at the Virginia Tech four-yard line. Two more Pike passes fell inadequate before Goebel surged three yards to the Virginia Tech one-yard line. Cincinnati again confronted a fourth down, and once more, Kelly chose to endeavor to score a touchdown instead of kick a field objective. Pike endeavored to cross the objective line on a running play, yet was ceased by the Virginia Tech resistance. With 7:25 staying in the diversion, Cincinnati turned the ball over on downs to the Virginia Tech offense, which came back to the field.
