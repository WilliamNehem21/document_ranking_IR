The collection's work of art was structured by Japanese craftsman Tadanori Yokoo, who had been making silkscreen prints on topics of Agharta and the legendary kingdom of Shambhala the year prior to the Festival Hall show; his plan for Carlos Santana's "Lotus" (1974) included such subjects. In the mid 1970s, Yokoo had discovered his developing prevalence in Japan diverting and moved to the United States, where he had the capacity to get a greater amount of his work distributed. Subsequent to coming back to Japan, he got a telephone call from Davis, who had seen his craft and needed him to make a spread for "Agharta". Prior to structuring the spread, Yokoo tuned in to a starter tape of the show, pondered, and thought about his perusing of Raymond W. Bernard's 1969 book "The Hollow Earth". Bernard had composed that the city existed in an extensive natural hollow in the focal point of the Earth, while Yokoo said he trusted "Agharta could be down there under the ocean like Atlantis or even covered up in the wilderness like the lost city of El Dorado." He likewise drew on components from other Eastern underground fantasies and Afrofuturism in his plan. Pundits who in the end observed the collection's bundling thought he had been propelled rather by the hallucinogenic medications famous at the time.
