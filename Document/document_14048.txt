Give's armed forces merged on Chattanooga and intended to assault Bragg's military. Getting into spot required the XI and XII Corps to cross the Tennessee River at Bridgeport, Alabama, and walk quickly for Lookout Valley, opening the supply line to Chattanooga. They did as such, to the shock of the Confederate powers there, which had not anticipated an assault from that quarter. On October 28, Hooker's two corps were assaulted by a piece of Bragg's military, which had at this point been joined by Longstreet and a few units from the Army of Northern Virginia. Bragg requested Longstreet to drive the federals back and he assaulted. In the following Battle of Wauhatchie, the XII Corps took the brunt of the underlying attack. Hooker skirted Howard and requested Schurz to raise the XI Corps to join the battle. The commitment was befuddled on the two sides, yet the Union powers were triumphant, driving off the revolutionaries and dispensing double the setbacks they got. With the supply lines presently revived to Chattanooga, Grant wanted to oust Bragg's military. At the Battle of Lookout Mountain, the 68th was held available for later on the primary day, November 24. The fight proceeded with the following day and a piece of Howard's XI Corps, including the 68th, was moved to the most distant left of the Union lines to strengthen Sherman's assault on Missionary Ridge. There, the 68th skirmished with the adversary, yet was unfit to progress. The Confederates were compelled to withdraw, be that as it may, as Maj. Gen. George Thomas' troops' strike on their middle sent Bragg's military into retreat from the edge.
