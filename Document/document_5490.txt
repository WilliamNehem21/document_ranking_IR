Congress abrogated the twenty-penny piece on May 2, 1878. The earlier day, Linderman had requested the mints to liquefy down twenty-penny pieces close by, for recoinage into different categories. By at that point, powers for silver coinage had been successful in passing the BlandÃ¢ÂÂ Allison Act, requiring the legislature to buy huge amounts of silver bullion, and strike it into dollars. The piece kept on coursing in the West for a couple of years, yet by 1890 was infrequently observed. Of the 1,351,540 twenty-penny pieces printed for course, over a third were dissolved by the administration somewhere in the range of 1895 and 1954, most intensely in 1933. The most economical twenty-penny piece, as indicated by the 2014 version of R. S. Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins" (the "Red Book"), is the 1875-S, recorded at $110 in great 4 condition. As per editorial in the "Red Book", the twenty-penny piece fizzled in light of the fact that "the open was confounded over the coin's closeness to the quarter dollar, which was better settled as an establishment of American trade", that partial money fulfilled the requirement for little change in the East, and on the grounds that "the twenty-penny piece was basically only a substitute for two dimes".
