The aftereffects of the fight prompted further talk in the US Pacific Fleet about changes in strategic tenet and the requirement for specialized upgrades, for example, flashless powder. It was not until eight months after the fact that the maritime central leadership perceived there were not kidding issues with the working of the torpedoes. The Americans were as yet ignorant of the range and intensity of Japanese torpedoes and the viability of Japanese night fight strategies. Indeed, Wright guaranteed that his boats more likely than not been terminated on by submarines since the watched position of Tanaka's boats "make it impossible that torpedoes with speed-remove attributes like our own" could have caused such harm, however Tanaka states that his torpedoes were terminated at a range as short as three miles. The Americans did not perceive the genuine abilities of their Pacific foe's torpedoes (especially the surface-deliver terminated Type 93 "Long Lance") and night strategies until well into 1943. After the war, Tanaka said of his triumph at Tassafaronga, "I have heard that US maritime specialists commended my order in that activity. I am not meriting such distinctions. It was the sublime capability and commitment of the men who served me that created the strategic triumph for us."
