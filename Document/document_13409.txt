In a meeting with Pinter in 2006, directed by faultfinder Michael Billington as a major aspect of the social program of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Pinter affirmed that he would keep on composing verse yet not plays. Accordingly, the gathering of people yelled "No" as one, asking him to continue composing. Alongside the universal symposium on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, curated by Billington, the 2006 Europe Theater Prize showy occasions observing Pinter included new creations (in French) of "Decisively" (1983), "One for the Road" (1984), "Mountain Language" (1988), "The New World Order" (1991), "Gathering Time" (1991), and "Question and answer session" (2002) (French forms by Jean Pavans); and "Pinter Plays, Poetry and Prose", a night of sensational readings, coordinated by Alan Stanford, of the Gate Theater, Dublin. In June 2006, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) facilitated a festival of Pinter's movies curated by his companion, the dramatist David Hare. Bunny presented the determination of film cuts by saying: "To hop once more into the universe of Pinter's moviesÃÂ ... is to help yourself to remember an educated standard film, engaged as much as Bergman's is on the human face, in which strain is kept up by a deliberately created blend of picture and exchange."
