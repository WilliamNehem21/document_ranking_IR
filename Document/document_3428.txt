At the point when Khan's rest chamber breakdowns, he is transported to "Big business," where he stirs and learns he is in the 23rd century. Given open quarters while "Organic science Bay" is towed to a starbase, Khan entrances and charms the ship's history specialist, Marla McGivers (Madlyn Rhue), while utilizing his entrance to the ship's specialized manuals to figure out how to dominate and work "Undertaking". McGivers consents to enable Khan to restore the other supermen, enabling him to arrange an endeavored takeover. To constrain the "Undertaking" team to collaborate with him, Khan places Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) in the ship's decompression chamber and takes steps to slaughter Kirk except if the group submits. McGivers can't remain by as her Captain kicks the bucket and liberates Kirk, who kills Khan's men by utilizing a neural gas. Khan heads to designing and sets the ship's motors to self-destruct, whereupon he is debilitated by Kirk. Chief Kirk leads a meeting, condemning Khan and his adherents to oust on an uncolonized world, Ceti Alpha V. Khan acknowledges Kirk's testÃ¢ÂÂsummoning the fall of Lucifer in Milton's "Heaven Lost"Ã¢ÂÂ and McGivers joins Khan as opposed to confront court-military. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) ponders what the "seed" Kirk has planted will bear in a hundred years.
