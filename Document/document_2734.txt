The fight happened in stages: an underlying trade of ordnance fire, a minor charge by Confederate Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, and three progressive rushes of Confederate infantry charges activated by vague requests from Lee and the activities of Maj. Gens. Magruder and D. H. Slope, individually. In each stage, the viability of the Federal gunnery was the integral factor, spurning a great many attacks, bringing about a strategic Union triumph. After the fight, McClellan and his powers pulled back from Malvern Hill to Harrison's Landing, where he stayed until August 16. His arrangement to catch Richmond had been defeated. Over the span of four hours, a progression of bumbles in arranging and correspondence had made Lee's powers dispatch three fizzled frontal infantry strikes crosswise over several yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate mounted guns, rushing solidly settled in Union infantry and big guns barriers. These blunders gave Union powers a chance to exact overwhelming setbacks. In the fallout of the fight, in any case, the Confederate press proclaimed Lee as the hero of Richmond. As an unmistakable difference, McClellan was blamed for being missing from the front line, an unforgiving analysis that spooky him when he kept running for president in 1864.
