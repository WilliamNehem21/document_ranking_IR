The "retiarius" was customarily hollowed against a "secutor" or, conceivably on uncommon events, a "murmillo". Regardless of the difference between the almost naked net-contender and his vigorously protected foe, current re-establishments and analyses demonstrate that the "retiarius" was in no way, shape or form outmatched. His absence of overwhelming hardware implied that he could utilize speed and avoidance further bolstering his good fortune. He likewise battled with three hostile weapons to his rival's one. The net-contender needed to maintain a strategic distance from close battle no matter what, stay away, and trust that an opening will cut with his trident or toss his net. The name "secutor" signifies "follower" or "chaser", since this warrior needed to pursue down the "retiarius". They were otherwise called "contraretiarii" ("those against the net-man"). The "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s procedure was to keep behind his shield ("scutum") and compel his adversary into close battle so he could hit with his sword. Nearby other people, the net-man had just his "galerus" bear protect for barrier; its structure constrained him to keep his head dodged down behind it. The "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s protective cap significantly confined his sight, hearing, and wind current. Combined with the overwhelming load of his arms and coveringÃ¢ÂÂthe apparatus of a "murmillo", of which the "secutor" was a variation, gauged Ã¢ÂÂ this fighter was in more serious threat of depleting himself in a long battle. One of the "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strategies was to hit at the "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s shield (the heaviest piece of his gear), driving him to shut and destroy himself. Generally speaking, Roman oddsmakers gave favorable position to a "retiarius", in spite of the fact that ability and experience could influence the chances in individual matches.
