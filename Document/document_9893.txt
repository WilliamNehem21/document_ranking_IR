As October go without real progress, Rudd became on edge to come back to the Witswatersrand gold mines, yet Rhodes demanded that he couldn't leave Bulawayo without the concession. "You should not leave a vacuum," Rhodes trained. "Leave Thompson and Maguire if essential or hold up until I can joinÃÂ ... on the off chance that we get anything we should dependably have somebody occupant". Hence kept from leaving, Rudd enthusiastically endeavored to convince Lobengula to enter direct arrangements with him over a concession, yet was more than once rebuked. The ruler just consented to take a gander at the draft archive, for the most part composed by Rudd, just before Shippard was because of leave in late October. At this gathering, Lobengula examined the terms with Rudd for over 60 minutes. Charles Helm, an evangelist situated in the region, was gathered by the lord to go about as a mediator. As per Helm, Rudd made various oral guarantees to Lobengula that were not in the composed archive, including "that they would not convey in excess of 10 white men to work in his nation, that they would not burrow anyplace close towns, and so on., and that they and their kin would maintain the laws of his nation and in reality be his kin."
