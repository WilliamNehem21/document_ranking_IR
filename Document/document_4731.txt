The main known individuals from the class "Mammuthus" are the African species "Mammuthus subplanifrons" from the Pliocene, and "M. africanavus" from the Pleistocene. The previous is believed to be the predecessor of later structures. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years prior. The most punctual European mammoth has been named "M. rumanus"; it spread crosswise over Europe and China. Just its molars are known, which demonstrate that it had 8Ã¢ÂÂ 10 lacquer edges. A populace developed 12Ã¢ÂÂ 14 edges, dividing from and supplanting the prior kind, getting to be "M. meridionalis" about 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1.7 million years prior. Thusly, this species was supplanted by the steppe mammoth ("M. trogontherii") with 18Ã¢ÂÂ 20 edges, which developed in eastern Asia around 1 million years prior. The Columbian mammoth developed from a populace of "M. trogontherii" that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1.5 million years prior; it held a comparative number of molar edges. Mammoths got from "M. trogontherii" developed molars with 26 edges 400,000 years back in Siberia and turned into the wooly mammoth. Wooly mammoths entered North America around 100,000 years back. Asian elephants have a variable number of finish edges that is halfway between those of the Columbian/steppe mammoth and the wooly mammoth.
