The antbirds are a gathering of little to medium-sized passerines that run in size from the vast monster antshrike, which estimates 45ÃÂ cm (18ÃÂ in) and weighs 150ÃÂ  g (5.29ÃÂ  oz), to the modest 8-cm (3ÃÂ in) dwarf antwren, which weighs 7ÃÂ  g (0.25ÃÂ oz). All in all terms, "antshrikes" are moderately extensive bodied winged animals, "antvireos" are medium-sized and stout, while "antwrens" incorporate most littler species; "antbird" genera can differ enormously in size. Individuals from this family have short adjusted wings that give great mobility when flying in thick undergrowth. The legs are expansive and solid, especially in species that are commit subterranean insect devotees. These species are all around adjusted to grasping vertical stems and saplings, which are more typical than flat branches in the undergrowth, and in this manner the capacity to hold them is preference for fowls following swarms of armed force ants. The hooks of these antbirds are longer than those of species that don't pursue ants, and the bottoms of certain species have projections that are intense and holding when the foot is held. Bone structure length in antbirds is identified with rummaging technique. Longer bone structures commonly happen in genera, for example, the "Thamnophilus" antshrikes that rummage by roost gathering (sitting and inclining forward to grab creepy crawlies from the branch), while shorter bone structures ordinarily happen in those that get go after the wing, for example, the "Thamnomanes" antshrikes.
