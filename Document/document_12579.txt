In the wake of turning into a subtropical low, the violent wind followed northeastward through Georgia, before transforming eastbound and leaving South Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean. Its track was affected by the western outskirts of the subtropical edge, which is a substantial belt of high weight. While moving over land, the violent wind had turned out to be better sorted out, and on AugustÃÂ 15 it changed into a tropical wretchedness about 70ÃÂ miles (110ÃÂ kilometres) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The sadness fortified further, and dependent on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, it increased into Tropical Storm Charley late on AugustÃÂ 15. With a powerless edge to its north, the tempest at first followed gradually eastbound simply off the shoreline of North Carolina, before swinging toward the north-upper east as a trough drew closer from the west. A wide typhoon, Charley step by step increased, and a solitary ring of convection around the middle formed into an eyewall. At 1200ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃÂ 17, it accomplished tropical storm status about 13ÃÂ mi (21ÃÂ km) off the North Carolina coastline. Around two hours after the fact, Hurricane Charley made landfall close Cape Lookout, and it in this way moved over the eastern segment of the state.
