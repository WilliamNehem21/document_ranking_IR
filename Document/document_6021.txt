After Early and Breckinridge (who was presently ready to ride a steed) pursued Hunter in excess of sixty miles from the city, Lee arranged them to clear the Union powers from the Shenandoah Valley, at that point cross into Maryland and test the protections of Washington, D.C. Association powers' solitary genuine endeavor to turn back the campaign came at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9. Confederate troops were postponed, at the end of the day won and proceeded toward Washington. They were crushed at the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11Ã¢ÂÂ 12, somewhat with fortifications acquired by the United States Government with the time picked up from the Battle of Monocacy. Since Lincoln was watching the battle from the defenses of Fort Stevens, this checked just time in American history in which two previous rivals in a presidential race confronted each other crosswise over fight lines. Following the fight, Early chose to pull back as opposed to strike the all around strengthened government capital. Early and Breckinridge had the capacity to hold the Shenandoah Valley through July and August, yet on September 19, 1864, Philip Sheridan constrained their retreat at the Third Battle of Winchester. Reacting to General John Brown Gordon's counsel to be watchful in the battle, Breckinridge reacted, "Well, general, there is minimal left for me if our motivation is to come up short."
