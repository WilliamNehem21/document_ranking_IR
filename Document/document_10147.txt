The Holyrood site was not gone into the image until after the official conclusion date of the challenge between the three destinations. The date for declaring the victor overran and on the date of the normal declaration rather it was reported that they were going to "reconsider their choice" (deriving that undoubtedly a choice had been made) and include the Holyrood Brewery site into the running (which had just barely shut). Anyway dealings with the blending organization Scottish and Newcastle, who claimed the land, brought about the organization demonstrating that they would most likely empty the site in mid 1999. As a result, the Secretary of State for Scotland concurred that the Holyrood site justified consideration on the waitlist of proposed areas. The Scottish Office charged practicality investigations of the predetermined zones in late 1997 and in January 1998, the Holyrood site was chosen from the waitlist.
