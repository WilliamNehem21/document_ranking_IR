Because of fragmentary stays, there have been numerous conflicting size assessments for megalodon, as they must be drawn from fossil teeth and vertebrae. Likewise along these lines, the extraordinary white shark is the premise of its remaking and size estimation, as it is viewed as the best simple to megalodon. Different size assessments exist for megalodon; in 1973, Hawaiian ichthyologist John E. Randall assessed that the most extreme length accomplished by "C.ÃÂ megalodon" was about , while during the 1990s, sea life scientists Patrick J. Schembri and Stephen Papson opined that "C. megalodon" may have moved toward a limit of around in all out length; Gottfried and associates attested that "C. megalodon" could have achieved a limit of in absolute length. These days, the normally recognized most extreme complete length of "C.ÃÂ megalodon" is about , with the normal size being , contrasted with the greatest recorded sizes of the extraordinary white shark at and the whale shark (the biggest living fish) at . It is conceivable that diverse populaces of megalodon around the world had distinctive body sizes and practices because of various natural weights. On the off chance that it attained a size of over , it would have been the biggest known fish that has ever lived, outperforming the Jurassic fish "Leedsichthys".
