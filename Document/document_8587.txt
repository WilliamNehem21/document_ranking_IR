After the 1994 arrival of "The Downward Spiral", the live band set out on the Self Destruct Tour in help of the collection. The stage set-up contained messy blinds which would be pulled down and up for visuals appeared amid melodies, for example, "Hurt". The visit appeared the band's grungy and chaotic picture in which the individuals would turn out in worn out garments slathered in corn starch. The shows were rough and turbulent, with band individuals regularly harming themselves, and they would often devastate their instruments toward the finish of shows, assault one another, and organize jump into the group. The visit achieved its most extensive standard gathering of people with a mud-doused exhibition at Woodstock '94 that was communicated on Pay-Per-View and seen in the same number of as 24ÃÂ million homes. Nine Inch Nails got impressive standard achievement from there on, performing with essentially higher generation esteems and adding showy visual components to the live show. Supporting represents the visit incorporated The Jim Rose Circus and Marilyn Manson. Discharged in 1997, the "Conclusion" video archived features from the visit, including full live recordings of "Eraser", "Hurt" and a one-take "Walk of the Pigs" cut coordinated by Peter Christoperson. Around this time, Reznor's studio compulsiveness, battles with dependence, and episodes of an inability to write delayed the creation of "The Fragile".
