As Magdalen's Dean of Divinity (school minister), Lang had peaceful obligations with the school's students and duty regarding the house of prayer and its choir. Lang was charmed with this last commitment; his anxiety for the virtue of the choir's sound drove him to demand that guests "participate in the administration quietly". In 1894 Lang was approached to add to his remaining task at hand by going about as Vicar of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, where John Henry Newman had started his Oxford service in 1828. The congregation had nearly stopped to work when Lang took it over, however he restored customary administrations, picked evangelists with consideration and gradually remade the assemblage. In December 1895 he was offered the post of Vicar of Portsea, an expansive area inside Portsmouth on the south coast, however he was not prepared to leave Oxford and cannot. A few months after the fact he had further contemplations; the strain of his double arrangement in Oxford was starting to tell and, he asserted, "the possibility of this incredible area [of Portsea] and work going an asking pained my inner voice." After finding that the Portsea offer was as yet open, he chose to acknowledge, however with some second thought.
