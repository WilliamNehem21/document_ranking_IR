Hayward expressed that the authors diverted Todd from a practical cleanser musical show character into "the scoundrel appropriated from nineteenth-century acting" and Gothic fiction conventions. After Todd is sent to jail for Marty's assault, he pledges he will get away, and does as such by sedating himself and compelling himself to wake up from a state of unconsciousness, which enables him to escape from a speeding rescue vehicle. He comes back to Llanview to stalk and threaten Nora, the legal counselor who tossed his court case, who had gone incidentally visually impaired. He attempts to assault Marty for the third time, later unintentionally kills Marty's beau Suede amid a fight, captures the evangelist Rebecca Lewis, and is shot by the police, yet endures. The scholars additionally started to develop his character by stressing his delicacy towards Rebecca and appearing of the maltreatment he encountered from his receptive dad, which Hayward states does not "historicize the issue yet basically expels the reason for viciousness one stage". Laurie Stone of the "Town Voice" remarked that Howarth's execution directed Todd far from animation villainy, "increasing the character's ferocity as an avoid from wistfulness and nobility". Rather than slaughtering Todd off as other cleanser musical dramas had done to other unrepentant attackers, "OLTL" picked, as Stone put it, "to revamp the class: keeping up Todd as an attacker, while developing his human measurement".
