Their introduction for RCA, "Muswell Hillbillies", was loaded with the impact of music lobby and customary American melodic styles, including nation and twang. It is regularly hailed as their last incredible record, however it was not as effective as its ancestors. It was named after Muswell Hill, where the Davies siblings were raised, and contained melodies concentrating on common laborers life and, once more, the Davies' youth. "Muswell Hillbillies", notwithstanding positive audits and elevated standards, crested at number 48 on the "Record World" diagram and number 100 on the "Announcement" outline. It was followed in 1972 by a twofold collection, "Everyone's in Show-Biz", which comprised of both studio tracks and live numbers recorded amid a two-night remain at Carnegie Hall. The record included the anthem "Celluloid Heroes" and the Caribbean-themed "Supersonic Rocket Ship", their last UK Top 20 hit for over 10 years.

It denotes the change between the band's mid 1970s shake material and the dramatic manifestation in which they submerged themselves for the following four years.
