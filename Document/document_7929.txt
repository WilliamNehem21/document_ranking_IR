In the French sources, one essential discourse has fixated on the topic of whether the Natchez arranged a concurrent assault on the French with the other real clans of the area. French pilgrim senator ÃÂtienne PÃÂ©rier, in a report to bosses in France kept in touch with multi week after the revolt, asserted that a large number of the Indian countries in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to assault the French around the same time and that even the Choctaw, who had been close partners of the French, were a piece of the plot. PÃÂ©rier then dropped a gathering with the Choctaw got ready for the initial two days of December in New Orleans, fighting that it was to be the event for an assault. PÃÂ©rier along these lines shielded his activities as senator by implying that the consequences of the slaughter could have been more regrettable notwithstanding his brief activity. In any case, students of history Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have called attention to that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a volunteer army leader in the French reprisals following the slaughter, wrote in a 1730 unpublished account that PÃÂ©rier's cases were unfounded, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and different countries were not complicit and had no premonition of the assault. Another report in French, of unknown creation, attested that the Natchez revolt was a British intend to pulverize another French tobacco business in Louisiana.
