As indicated by Aidan Crawley, a British individual from the commission, Beadle started the procedure "as an extreme supporter of racial oppression" however later communicated notably unique perspectives. The chiefs "barely concurred on anything", in Beadle's memory. While not suggesting disintegration, the Monckton report was emphatically disparaging of the Federation. It upheld a wide scope of changes, dismissed any further development towards Federal freedom until these were executed, and required the regions to be allowed to withdraw whether restriction proceeded. Beadle was knighted in 1961 and that year selected Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia. An elementary school in Bulawayo was named after him. In "Mehta v. City of Salisbury" (1961), a case testing the racial isolation of an open pool, Beadle chose that politically-sanctioned racial segregation made points of reference in South African case law invalid, decided that the offended party's nobility had been unlawfully insulted, and granted him harms. Following proceeded with dark patriot resistance to the Federation, especially in Nyasaland, the British government reported in 1962 that Nyasaland would be permitted to withdraw. This was before long stretched out to Northern Rhodesia too, and toward the finish of 1963 the Federation was destroyed.
