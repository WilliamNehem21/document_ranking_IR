On March 9, 2015, Stephen DiDuro declared through Twitter that a form of the amusement for Nintendo's Wii U support was made arrangements for discharge on the eShop online store for late 2015, later indicated as August 13. A demo was discharged as a major aspect of an advancement titled "Nindies@home", wherein players were welcome to attempt a few up and coming Wii U amusements between June 15 and 22. On July 28, GalaxyTrail affirmed that generation of the last form of the diversion was taking longer than anticipated, recommending that the amusement's discharge would be later. DiDuro reported the reason for the deferral on August 18: the Wii U form had been set back by a "reassure solidifying bug", which would delay the Wii U discharge inconclusively until the issue was fixed. He later clarified that the bug had taken such a long time to identify on the grounds that it just happened in retail forms of the comfort, which had kept GalaxyTrail and Nintendo from learning of the issue. The bug required a hard reset of the framework to address the issue, which could conceivably make harm the Wii U equipment. The bug was in the long run fixed, and the amusement was effectively discharged on the eShop on October 1; clients who had attempted the diversion's demo were remunerated with a 15-percent markdown.
