At the Southern Railwayâs January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it was decided to use outside contractors to build the KÂ class, Maunsell received authority to retain one set of parts at Ashford works to construct a prototype 3-cylinder 2-6-4 tank. The modification was based upon that used on NÂ class No.Â 822 to produce a 3-cylinder locomotive in 1922, although it retained the driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of the KÂ class. The modification was the inclusion of an additional (inside) cylinder between the frames, and a crank axle was fitted to the middle driving wheels. The axle was connected to the inside cylinder assembly by a connecting rod inclined at 1 in 8 to clear the front driving axle. This arrangement was supplemented by two smaller-diameter outside cylinders with bore (compared to the cylinders of the KÂ class), and a greater chimney diameter. The resulting prototype 3-cylinder "K1" was narrower than the KÂ class and hence could work on routes with restricted loading gauge. As with No.Â 822, this locomotive used Holcroft's derivative of the Gresley conjugated valve gear to drive the inside cylinder. To accommodate this, the boiler had to be raised by above the inside gear, raising the centre of gravity on the locomotive.
