Their fight was accused for adding to the low spirit that hastened the alleged "Morotai Mutiny" of April 1945, when a gathering of senior pilots in the First Tactical Air Force presented their abdications as opposed to keep on assaulting what they accepted to be useless targets. Alarmed to the issue by No.ÃÂ 1 TAF's officer, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, Bostock spoke to the pilots to pull back their abdications. As per student of history Kristen Alexander, his techniques were interpreted as an endeavor to "influence the circumstance to leave or to in any event spread it up"; one of the "rebels", Squadron Leader John Waddy, cited Bostock as saying, "I will leave these applications on the table and on the off chance that you lift them up, all records and all notes of any of this undertaking will be canceled from Air Force records and documents and nothing will be caught wind of it". At the point when the pilots would not drop the issue, Bostock flagged Jones, prompting that he observed resolve on the island to be at a "hazardously low dimension" and suggesting the CAS supplant Cobby with Air Commodore Scherger. Kenney agreed with Bostock, and Jones sacked Cobby. A consequent examination vindicated the stand taken by the pilots; one of them, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the request of Jones and Bostock: "I lament the battling and wrangling between them which is normal information all through the Air Force. Consistently there are occasions of it."
