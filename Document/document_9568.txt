After the war, the GI Bill paid for his lease at a room on West 81st Street in New York City, a pay of simply over $100 per month, and four years of tutoring. He at first got a new line of work oiling machines and washing floors. He chose to go to a dramatization class, basically in view of its enrollment of alluring young ladies. Known as the Civil Service Little Theater gathering, it was directed by the Office of Dependants and Beneficiaries, where he was utilized at the time. This drove him to begin a two-year course at the New School for Social Research, kept running by German ÃÂ©migrÃÂ© Erwin Piscator. Amid one tryout, Steiger was cast after scarcely articulating a couple of words, the chief shouting he had a "crisp, brilliant quality". Another gifted student at the time was Walter Matthau, who named the foundation "The Neurotic School for Sexual Research". Steiger was astounded to find his own ability as an on-screen character, and he was urged to seek after further examinations at the Dramatic Workshop. One of the principle reasons he needed to be a performer was to recapture open regard for his family name, which had so embarrassed him amid adolescence. Another critical factor was his conviction that he didn't "have the demeanor for an ordinary occupation", and would have wound up a hopeless, rough drunkard.
