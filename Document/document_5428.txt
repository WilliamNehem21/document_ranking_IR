At the point when the Archduke knew about Hotze's accomplishment in taking Winterthur intersection, he guided his troops to expand Nauendorf's, and to take the town and the environs of Neftenbach, west-northwest of Winterthur. Nicolas Oudinot, whose men had verified Neftenbach as a feature of the French forward line, waited for the greater part of the day, yet was compelled to withdraw to Pfungen in the late evening; his situation there was not faultless and he was driven further back to the edges of ZÃÂ¼rich. By taking Neftenbach, Charles set an impressive gathering of troops between Ney's power and Hotze's flank and constrained an uneven French withdrawal toward ZÃÂ¼rich. Tharreau moved around the TÃÂ¶ss, endeavoring to restore his forward line, however MassÃÂ©na did not need a general commitment among ZÃÂ¼rich and Neftenbach, not there and not at that point. The Armies of Switzerland and the Danube were not prepared to take on Charles; MassÃÂ©na's powers were not set up for a fight on the scale required in confronting Charles' whole armed force, and he required the barriers offered by ZÃÂ¼rich to mount a legitimate line against the approaching Austrian assault. Inevitably, Tharreau pulled back the whole forward line to ZÃÂ¼rich. The conflict took 11 hours.
