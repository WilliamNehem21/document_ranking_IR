In the midst of decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation was looking always shaky and the possibility of "no freedom before lion's share rule" was increasing significant ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to surrender the Federation and "go only it". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian part of the Dominion Party embraced the strategy of "Southern Rhodesia first", provoking solid challenges from the gathering's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party fragmented into discrete Federal and regional elements a month later. At the point when dark patriot riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper censured the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the overseeing United Federal Party (UFP) as excessively permissive on the dissidents, and contended that giving concessions following political brutality would make dark Rhodesians trust that "inconvenience pays profits". Contending against dark portrayal in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were dark MPs "they will impart the eatery to us and they will impart the bars to us. We will live cheek by cheek with them, and what kind of enactment can the general population of this nation expect when we ourselves are being adapted to living cheek by cheek with Africans?"
