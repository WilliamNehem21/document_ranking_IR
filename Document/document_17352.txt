Evidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from ancient myths and legends. The rock overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. Paleo-Balkan tribes of Thracians and Dacians ruled this area prior to the Roman conquest. Belgrade was inhabited by a Thraco-Dacian tribe "Singi"; after the Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci took the city, naming it "SingidÅ«n" ("dÅ«n", fortress). In 34â33 BC, the Roman army, led by Silanus, reached Belgrade. It became the romanised "Singidunum" in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a "municipium" by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged "colonia" (highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome âConstantine I, also known as Constantine the Greatâwas born in the territory of Naissus in southern Serbia, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395Â AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.
