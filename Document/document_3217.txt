"Armillaria luteobubalina" has been recorded in southeastern Australia, from the southeastern corner of Queensland through eastern New South Wales and crosswise over Victoria into southeastern South Australia. It likewise happens in Tasmania and southwestern Western Australia. Those of the karri woodlands (comprising to a great extent of the species "E.ÃÂ diversicolor") of the southwest have paler and yellower tops than those in the jarrah timberlands (which contain dominatingly "Eucalyptus marginata") further north. The natural product bodies emerge on wood, particularly on stumps or around the base of trees, and frequently in immense numbers. They generally show up among April and July, albeit most creation happens in the second 50% of May. Copious in forests, it can attack greenery enclosures and plantations, where it can assault numerous woody plants. The nectar growth contaminated and murdered numerous plants close tuart trees ("Eucalyptus gomphocephala") which had been chopped down close Kings Park in rural Perth. "Armillaria luteobubalina" is generally found in eucalyptus woods in Australia, and is believed to be the most pathogenic and most broad "Armillaria" species in the real western Australian backwoods types. The mushroom has additionally been accounted for from southern South America, in Argentina and Chile. A 2003 investigation of the sub-atomic phylogenetics and example of its circulation in South America and Australia show that "A.ÃÂ luteobubalina" is an old species, beginning before the partition of the forerunner supercontinent Gondwana. Hereditary contrasts between segregates in the South American and Australian populaces demonstrate a significant lot of land division, and the creators propose that they "later may be viewed as autonomous taxa".
