The Cleveland Bay for the most part remains among , and is constantly inlet in shading. Splendid sound steeds (coves with a more rosy tint than typical) are the most favored by reproducers, trailed by normal inlet, dim straight and after that light narrows. This inclination for more brilliant shades of narrows was initially expressed in the official breed standard, in spite of the fact that this stipulation has since been evacuated. In certain bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a normal for unadulterated blood. White markings, with the exception of a little star on the brow, render the steed unacceptable to the stud book. Steeds are required to have total dark focuses, including totally dark lower legs. Legs that are red underneath the knees and sells are viewed as defective in shading, in spite of the fact that they don't preclude a pony from library. The intermittent red legs that show up in the breed are thought to originate from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at certain focuses ever of breeds. The consistency in shading is empowered as it makes making coordinating driving groups and matches extremely simple. At the point when the breed was first built up, the steeds quite often had a countershaded dorsal stripe, yet these vanished with the outcrossings of the eighteenth century.
