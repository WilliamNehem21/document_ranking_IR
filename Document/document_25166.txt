A review of the "Birthday of the World" volume in "Booklist Review" commented that it offered a "change of pace" from the rest of the collection, and that in contrast to many of the other stories, which are set in the Hainish Universe, it "stood well on its own". Suzy Hansen, writing in "Salon", said that the novella allowed the reader to imagine the process of designing a part of the world. Hansen went on to say that "Paradises Lost" allowed "reality architects" to ponder questions such as how to form language, and what environmental constraints shaped human beings. Hansen described the relationship between Hsing and Luis as a "wonderful love story", and also praised the characterization of Bliss as a "remarkable twist on organized religion", saying that the "conflict [made] logical sense". Writing in 2015, Haiven called "Paradises Lost" a "telling narrative" and described it as a "grim and timely warning" about religious fundamentalism, and its power to shape society. He compared the struggle of the protagonists to that of the anarchist society of "The Dispossessed", and went on to say it was a "a chastening lesson in both the potential and the perils of freedom, [and] the secret life of authority".
