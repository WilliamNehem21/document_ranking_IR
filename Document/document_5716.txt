The first named example currently credited to "Triceratops" is a couple of forehead horns appended to a skull rooftop, found close Denver, Colorado in the spring of 1887. This example was sent to American scientist Othniel Charles Marsh, who trusted that the development from which it came dated from the Pliocene, and that the bones had a place with an especially substantial and strange buffalo, which he named "Buffalo alticornis". He understood that there were horned dinosaurs by the following year, which saw his production of the variety "Ceratops" from fragmentary remains, yet regardless he trusted "B. alticornis" to be a Pliocene well evolved creature. It took a third and significantly more total skull to alter his opinion. The example, gathered in 1888 by John Bell Hatcher from the Lance Formation of Wyoming, was at first portrayed as another types of "Ceratops". After reflection, Marsh altered his opinion and gave it the conventional name "Triceratops", tolerating his "Buffalo alticornis" as another types of "Ceratops" (it would later be added to "Triceratops"). The tough idea of the creature's skull has guaranteed that numerous models have been saved as fossils, enabling varieties among species and people to be contemplated. "Triceratops" remains have along these lines been found in the American conditions of Montana and South Dakota (notwithstanding Colorado and Wyoming), and in the areas of Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada.
