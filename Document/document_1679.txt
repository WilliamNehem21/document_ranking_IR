In the wake of changing over to the jump plane, the squadron was utilized on routine watch and pursuit and-salvage errands off the shore of the Northern Territory. On 18 June 1943, twelve Vengeances from the squadron, escorted by six No. 31 Squadron Bristol Beaufighters, were dispatched to assault two towns on Selaru island in the involved Netherlands East Indies that were accepted to house specialists occupied with developing a landing strip. This task was fruitful, and all the plunge planes came back to base. In July 1943 the squadron started moving from Darwin to Merauke in Netherlands New Guinea, where it was to work as a component of No. 72 Wing. A gathering of 270 ground team touched base at Merauke early that month, however little of the framework expected to help the unit's air ship was prepared. Accordingly, No. 12 Squadron's Vengeances and air team were positioned at Cooktown, Queensland, from where they directed enemy of submarine watches and escorted transporting. The flying machine were redeployed to Merauke through the span of September, and started standard watch obligations on the 28th of the month. No. 12 Squadron's solitary battle amid this sending happened on 9 October 1943, when a Vengeance traded assault rifle discharge with a Japanese Aichi E13A surveillance flying machine. The Vengeances demonstrated unsuited to the sea watch errands they were alloted while at Cooktown and Merauke.
