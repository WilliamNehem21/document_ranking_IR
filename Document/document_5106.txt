On April 6, 1998, Melissa Reed recorded a rape grumbling against Howard and Webber after a gathering at Howard's home. Legal counselors for both offered distinctive records. Howard's legal advisor said that Reed had started an unspecified consensual sex act with one of the men, however Reed, who couldn't bear the cost of a legal counselor, professed to have gone into a live with Webber before being struck and controlled preceding being explicitly attacked. Neither Howard nor Webber affirmed for the situation, and in spite of the fact that the informer and around 40 of the gathering participants showed up before an excellent jury, the Montgomery County State's Attorney reported that arraignment was not justified and shut the case in May. This came soon after the Wizards' general director Wes Unseld isolated Webber and Howard on May 15 by exchanging Webber to the Sacramento Kings, getting Mitch Richmond and Otis Thorpe in return. In June, Howard documented suit against Reed, looking for remuneration for enthusiastic pain for harm to his notoriety and picture. The informer was missing amid the procedure and neglected to react to the claim for maligning. In November, Howard was granted the $1 in compensatory harms that he tried to demonstrate his innocence and $100,000 in correctional harms in addition to legitimate expenses.
