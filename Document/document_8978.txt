In May 1942 the Australian Minister for External Affairs H.V. "Doc" Evatt ventured out to the United States and Britain to look for extra air ship for the RAAF. Evatt first visited the United States, where the administration consented to build the quantity of airplane it would give to Australia. He at that point went to London and met with Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In this gathering, Evatt mentioned that Britain furnish a plane carrying warship to present with the Royal Australian Navy, and a portion of Spitfire warriors for the RAAF. Evatt had not gotten exhortation from the RAAF on the Spitfire's reasonableness for Australian conditions, and seems to have expected that it would execute too in Australia as it had in Europe. While Britain couldn't extra a plane carrying warship, following a few days of dialogs Churchill conceded to 28ÃÂ May to send three completely prepared Spitfire squadrons to Australia. The squadrons chose were No. 452 Squadron RAAF, No. 457 Squadron RAAF and No. 54 Squadron RAF, all of which had seen battle over Europe against the Luftwaffe. Under the understanding every squadron would be at first outfitted with 16 Spitfires and a further 15 air ship would be sent to Australia every month as substitutions. Churchill's job in sending Spitfire units to Australia prompted No. 1 Wing regularly being alluded to as the "Churchill Wing".
