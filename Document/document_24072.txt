Klepacki has also played in and produced albums for several Las Vegas bands. I AM's "There's a Home" is his first full-length CD appearance. The band featured Greg Greer on vocals, Rod Arnett on bass, Dan Ryan on guitar, and Klepacki on drums. Formed from the rhythm section of local band "Shatterbone", I AM released one album in 1995 and broke up. Described as alternative progressive rock, the band's music drew influences from Tool and Soundgarden. The song "Destructible Times" was used for the Brotherhood of Nod ending in the original "Command & Conquer". After the break-up, Klepacki joined Home Cookin', a ten-member ensemble which played funk and soul in the tradition of Tower of Power. Founded in 1989, Home Cookin' commercially debuted with "Mmm, Mmm, Mmm," in 1997 (which featured a number one hit) and released a second album ("Pink in the Middle") in 2000 before disbanding following a tour in California. Towards the end of its run, the band played at Quark's Bar in and at the Boston Grill and Bar. The group sometimes opened shows with a four-member funk act named "Junkfood". Home Cookin' was popular by readers of Las Vegas Weekly, winning several awards over its historyâincluding "Best Horns" in a band. Klepacki boasted that turnout for the band at clubs was usually above four hundred people. In 2003, he formed "The Bitters", a trio composed of Klepacki, bassist Vinny Moncada, and guitarist Jeff Murphy. With a style described as metal and jazz fusion, the group has released one album as of August 2006. Klepacki is also member to the group "Mo Friction", supported by former Home Cookin' members. Their debut album will mark Klepacki's first outing as a band's lead vocalist.
