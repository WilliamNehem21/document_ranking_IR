The Federal Highway Administration endorsed the Georgetown Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2014. Similarly as with the Ellendale zone, DelDOT plans to update US 113 along its present arrangement from south of Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro to south of Redden Road. Exchanges are arranged close Piney Grove Road and Avenue of Honor north of Millsboro; at Governor Stockley Road at Stockley; close Speedway Road, Alms House Road, and Kruger Road north of Stockley; at Shortly Road and South Bedford Street on the southern edge of Georgetown; at Arrow Safety Road in Georgetown; at US 9 in Georgetown; at DE 18 and DE 404 in Georgetown; and at Wilson Road north of Georgetown. The U.S. Expressway's convergence with DE 18 and DE 404 has the most elevated accident rate and the largest amount of traffic clog in the examination region, so crossing point will be supplanted with an exchange first. US 113 will be extended to six paths all through the hallway, and right-in/ideal out access to bordering organizations would be kept up, with endeavors to diminish the quantity of contact focuses. The exchange at DE 18 and DE 404 is at present in the plan stage, with development expected to start in 2023.
