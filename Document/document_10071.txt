In 1189 Coutances held a clerical synod which administered, in addition to other things, that the ministry ought not hold mainstream workplaces, despite the fact that Coutances himself had held and kept on holding such workplaces. On 9 November 1189 Richard designated Coutances to a commission entrusted with choosing the question between Baldwin of Forde and the priests of his house of God section over Baldwin's arrangement to make a congregation devoted to Thomas Becket, the killed Archbishop of Canterbury, and to staff this congregation not with priests, however with groups. The priests of Canterbury Cathedral protested Baldwin's arrangement, expecting that it was a piece of a plot to exchange the privilege of race from the devout house of God part to the new church's groups. Sitting on the commission with Coutances were Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, Godfrey de Lucy, the Bishop of Winchester, Hubert Walter, the Bishop of Salisbury, Peter de Leia, the Bishop of St David's, Richard fitzNigel, the Bishop-choose of London, William Longchamp, the Bishop-choose of Ely, and a few abbots. The commission headed out to Canterbury, and on 29 November 1189, figured out how to verify a trade off between the gatherings, which endured until Hubert Walter, by then Archbishop of Canterbury, restored the arrangement. In the trade off, Baldwin consented to surrender the possibility of another ascetic establishment around Canterbury and the priests consented to submit to the diocese supervisor's position.
