"Kaiser Friedrich II" at last expected her job as the II Division lead on 24 January 1900, when BÃÂ¼chsel exchanged his banner to the ship. On 2 April, the I Squadron steamed to Danzig Bay, where they remained for four days. The following month, they started a journey into the North Sea on 7 May; amid the trek, the boats made stops in Lerwick in the Shetland Islands from 12 to 15 May and Bergen, Norway, from 18 to 22 May. They landed back in Kiel four days in the wake of leaving Bergen. Toward the beginning of July, the four "Brandenburg"- class war vessels were sent to Asia to stifle the Boxer Rebellion, inciting a redesign of the "Heimatflotte". "Kaiser Friedrich III" and were the main ships accessible for the yearly armada moves, which were directed from 15 August to 15 September. They were joined by the heavily clad frigates and six and s. All through the moves, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was allocated to the "German" compel, which needed to battle an unfriendly "Yellow" squadron. From there on, BÃÂ¼chsel turned into the representative leader of the I Squadron, yet he stayed on board "Kaiser Friedrich III" just quickly before exchanging his banner to the ironclad "WÃÂ¼rttemberg". "Konteradmiral" Max von Fischel supplanted him on 30 September, yet "Kaiser Friedrich III" went into drydock for her yearly upgrade presently.
