The all out expense of "Kronan" was evaluated at 326,000 silver dalers in contemporary money, and about portion of the cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the combat hardware. It was along these lines in light of a legitimate concern for the Swedish Navy to rescue whatever number of the guns as could be expected under the circumstances. In the mid 1660s practically every one of the firearms from "Vasa" had been raised through enormously improved innovation. Leader Paul Rumpf and Admiral Hans Wachtmeister were placed responsible for the rescue of "Kronan's" guns. With the assistance of jumping ringers, they had the capacity to raise 60 guns worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. JuneÃ¢ÂÂ August) of 1679Ã¢ÂÂ 86, starting when the war with Denmark had finished. During the 1960s, jumping master Bo Cassel made some effective plummets to "Vasa" with a plunging ringer made by seventeenth century details. In 1986, further investigations were done on "Kronan". The tests demonstrated fruitful and the end was that the seventeenth century activities more likely than not required impressive experience, expertise and positive climate conditions. In spite of the fact that the conditions off ÃÂland were frequently troublesome, with virus water and capricious climate, and required a huge group, the undertakings were entirely gainful. Student of history BjÃÂ¶rn Axel Johansson has determined that the complete expense for the whole team for each of the eight plunging seasons was under 2,000 dalers, the estimation of one of "Kronan's" 36-pounder weapons.
