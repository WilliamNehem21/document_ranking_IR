After a prematurely ended endeavor by Kennedy to bring one more studio that had swung to him for help, First National, into the Photophone crease, RCA was prepared to venture back in: the organization obtained Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA reported the formation of the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp. holding organization, with Sarnoff as director of the board. Kennedy, who pulled back from his official positions in the blended organizations, kept PathÃÂ© separate from RKO and under his own control. RCA claimed the overseeing stock enthusiasm for RKO, 22 percent (in the mid 1930s, its offer would ascend as high as 60 percent). On January 25, 1929, the new organization's creation arm, directed by previous FBO VP Joseph I. Schnitzer, was revealed as RKO Productions Inc. After seven days, it petitioned for the trademark "Radio Pictures". Hoping to escape the film business the next year, Kennedy organized in late 1930 for RKO to buy PathÃÂ© from him. On January 29, 1931, PathÃÂ©, with its agreement players, all around respected newsreel task, and Culver City studio and backlot, was converged into RKO as Kennedy sold off the remainder of his stock in the organization he had been instrumental in making.
