Napoleon set out on board the brig "ÃÂpervier" promptly toward the beginning of the day of 15 July, and advanced out to the "Bellerophon". As he drew closer, the 74-firearm "Radiant", flying Vice-Admiral Hotham's banner, was located drawing nearer. Worried that the brig probably won't achieve "Bellerophon" before the "Wonderful" arrived, and that subsequently Hotham would dominate and get Napoleon himself, Maitland sent "Bellerophon"s flatboat to gather the previous Emperor and exchange him to the ship. Sooner or later somewhere in the range of 6 and 7 a.m., the flatboat pulled nearby "Bellerophon" and General Henri Gatien Bertrand moved on board, trailed by Napoleon. The marines stood ready, and Napoleon strolled to the quarterdeck, showed some respect for Maitland and in French declared "I am come to toss myself on the insurance of your Prince and your laws." Maitland bowed accordingly. With the previous head in care on board a British warship, the Napoleonic Wars were at long last finished. To sea antiquarian David Cordingly, this minute was "Bellerophon"s "delegated magnificence [when] a month and a half after the clash of Waterloo,ÃÂ ... Napoleon, caught in Rochefort, surrendered to the skipper of the ship that had hounded his means for over twenty years."
