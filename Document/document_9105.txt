Amid the decade Shaw voyaged generally and as often as possible. The majority of his adventures were with Charlotte; she delighted in voyages on sea liners, and he discovered harmony to compose amid the long spells adrift. Shaw met an excited welcome in South Africa in 1932, in spite of his solid comments about the racial divisions of the nation. In December 1932 the couple set out on a round-the-world journey. In March 1933 they landed at San Francisco, to start Shaw's first visit to the US. He had before would not go to "that terrible nation, that unseemly spot", "unfit to administer itself... illiberal, superstitious, unrefined, savage, anarchic and discretionary". He visited Hollywood, with which he was unmoved, and New York, where he addressed to a limit gathering of people in the Metropolitan Opera House. Harried by the nosy considerations of the press, Shaw was happy when his ship cruised from New York harbor. New Zealand, which he and Charlotte visited the next year, struck him as "the best nation I've been in"; he encouraged its kin to be increasingly sure and release their reliance on exchange with Britain. He utilized the weeks adrift to finish two playsÃ¢ÂÂ"The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles" and "The Six of Calais"Ã¢ÂÂ and start chip away at a third, "The Millionairess".
