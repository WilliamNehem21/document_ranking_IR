By the mid-1950s, the state of the Spanish Army's tanks was deteriorating. Spain's armored force composition remained the same until February 1954, when the United States delivered the first twelve M47 Patton tanks to the Spanish Army. These were a product of a military aid program the United States had signed with Spain in 1953. By 1957, the Spanish Army had received a total of 29 M47 tanks. Over the course of the 1950s, Spain received a total of 389 M47 Patton tanks. Throughout the 1960s, Spain received 65 M48 Patton tanks and 66 M48A1s. The M47 and M48 tanks were an important modernization of Spain's armored firepower. For example, while the T-26 was armed with a cannon, the American tanks were armed with the much more powerful tank gun. While a Panzer IV's ("Ausf." G) L/43 tank gun could penetrate of steel armor at (using the "Panzergranate" 39), the M47 (using the M348 HEAT warhead) could penetrate from its tank gun. Furthermore, the M47's armor was thick on the glacis plate, and thick on the turret front. Spain also received a number of M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks. These were organized into the "Villaviciosa" Light Armored Cavalry Regiment, while four were also organized into the "AlcÃ¡zar de Toledo" Armored Infantry Regiment as reconnaissance tanks.
