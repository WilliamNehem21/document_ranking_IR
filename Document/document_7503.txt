In "Dermotherium fabrication", the p4 and m1 through m3 are like one another (and dissimilar to the i3, canine, and p3) and seem to shape a progression of diminishing size from front to back. In "D.ÃÂ major", just m2 and m3 are known, yet they are comparative in morphology and m3 is littler than m2. In the Sunda colugo, be that as it may, the teeth get bigger from p4 to m3. The p4 and molars have a particular trigonid (a triangular gathering of cusps at the front of a tribosphenic tooth) and talonid. The trigonid contains solid protoconid and metaconid cusps. The metaconid is more grounded than the protoconid in the molars, yet it isn't certain whether this is the situation in the p4. In the living colugos, the protoconid is higher than the metaconid in both p4 and m1. The trigonid is longer in the p4 than in the molars. In "D.ÃÂ chimaera", the trigonid is more extensive than in "D.ÃÂ major". A low peak, the paracristid, slides from the protoconid lingually and towards the front, framing the front edge of the trigonid; there is no particular cusp (a paraconid) at the front of the trigonid on the p4, yet this cusp is available in the molars.
