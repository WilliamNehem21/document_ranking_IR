The zone that would move toward becoming Monte Ne was known to have had two foundations frequently viewed as fundamental to a pioneer settlement, a grist plant and a refinery. It is obscure when the refinery was manufactured. It was claimed during the 1830s by Abe McGarrah and his brother by marriage; they likewise worked a little store. The refinery's yield every day was given as thirty gallons by the Federal bourbon gauger who lived in the region. The grist plant was worked in 1856, and was possessed by J.R. Pettigrew. It would later be claimed by James Wyeth and Amelia Crowder Blake, the guardians of Betty Blake, who is regularly alluded to as the "Main Lady" of Rogers, and who wedded performer Will Rogers in 1908. In 1875, the mail station in the region changed its name from Mountain Springs to Pettigrew's Mill. The Blakes claimed the factory until 1882, when James Blake kicked the bucket. The factory was later worked by David Portnell from 1889 to 1895. He sold his enthusiasm for the plant to a resigned Congregational priest J.G. Bailey. Bailey later moved toward becoming postmaster. He requested of the Post Office Department to change the name of the workplace to Vinola, to pay tribute to a notable vineyard that had a place with his neighbor Carl A. Starek. The letter was written in longhand, and the o and l were divided excessively near one another. Thus, the agent misread the name as "Vinda", which is the manner by which it was recorded. The region's name was later changed to Silver Springs. Bailey sold 325 sections of land of land and a lodge to Harvey.
