The arena legs of the visit got more reliable acclaim than the field appears. Commentators noticed that while the show and its setlist were generally equivalent to previously, the visit for the most part profited by the expanded scale. The "New York Daily News" said that the stage "resembled a city made of TVsÃ¢ÂÂan electronic Oz" and that "marvelousness was utilized not as an insignificant diversion (as it has been by such a significant number of video-age specialists), yet as a decided arrogance". Gundersen likewise made the correlation with Oz, saying that despite the fact that the band was overshadowed by the setting, their brave musicianship still shone through. She inferred that the gathering had "deliver[ed] a splendid high-wire act" among taunting and misusing rock music buzzwords, an examination likewise made by stage originator Willie Williams. Robert Hilburn of the "Los Angeles Times" said of the open air American leg, "Zoo TV is the measuring stick by which all other arena shows will be estimated." David Fricke of "Moving Stone" said that the band had "recovered basic and business support by arranging a roused harmony between shake's modest rushes and its own feeling of good weight". He commended the band for "retool[ing] themselves as wiseacres with heart and elephant bucks to consume". Fricke noticed that the expanded special visualizations for the "Outside Broadcast" leg expanded the shows' "mind-fuck" factor. Numerous commentators portrayed the visit as "post-current". The journalists of "Moving Stone", in a best-of-1992 issue, named U2 co-victors of "Best Band", while granting the Zoo TV Tour respects for both "Best Tour" and "Most exceedingly terrible Tour".
