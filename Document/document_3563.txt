Following Terry-Thomas' demise, Lionel Jeffries called him "the remainder of the extraordinary honorable men of the film", while the chief Michael Winner remarked that "regardless of what your position was in connection to his, as the star he was in every case frightfully decent. He was the kindest man and he delighted in life to such an extent". Evaluating his vocation in "The Guardian", Adrian Turner thought about that "we underestimated him and he was perfect for his time. Not to put too genuine a point on it, his depiction of coarse idiocy and barefaced naughtiness hit home with British gatherings of people amid the fifties as they encountered the awkward evisceration of the Empire and the 'never had it so great' ethos of the Macmillan period. Amid the sixties he turned into a great chronological error, much sought after in America, who found in him the insignificant pomp of Britain"; he likewise said that Terry-Thomas was "a national fortune". Gilbert Adair, writing in "The Independent", thought about that "for three decades, and in actually scores of movies, he embodied the Englishman as agreeable bounder"; Adair composed that "the characterisation he was to expect spoken to the very substance of patrician, twofold barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas' companion Jack Lemmon called him "a quintessential professionalÃÂ ... he was a man of his word, an enjoyment to be with by and by, not to mention expertly, or more all as a performing artist he had one of the characteristics that I respect so muchÃ¢ÂÂhe made it look straightforward".
