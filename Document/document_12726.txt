Somewhere around two periods of volcanic movement have been distinguished at The Volcano. Every occasion was trailed by the emission of protracted basaltic magma streams that streamed down soak granitic flanks of the mountain edge on which The Volcano lies. After this occurred, they went through the Lava Fork valley for . Here, the streams crossed the British Columbia outskirt into the U.S. territory of Alaska and obstructed the Blue River, a tributary of the Unuk River, shaping a few lakes. The magma streams altogether are about long and still contain their unique highlights from when they cooled, including weight edges and magma channels. A progression of expansive trees were overwhelmed by the magma streams amid ejection. The bases of the trees consumed and the upper trunks and branches crumbled into the setting magma, leaving the trees installed on the outside of the magma streams. After the streams cemented, tree molds and magma tubes fallen to shape volcanic pits. At the southern end of one of the magma streams, it spreads into a wide terminal projection on the level alluvial plain of the Unuk River. Volcanic powder and magma from The Volcano still wait on little ice sheets close Mount Lewis Cass, a mountain close to the Alaska-British Columbia fringe.
