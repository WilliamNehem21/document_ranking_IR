On 17 December, "KÃ¶nigsberg" was tasked with another goodwill visit, this time escorting the Kaiser's brother, Prince Heinrich, and a delegation of naval officers to MalmÃ¶, Sweden to meet King Oscar II. The visit lasted until 20 December. "KÃ¶nigsberg" participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual and squadron training for 1908 without incident. The year ended with a major training cruise, first in the Baltic and North Sea and later into the Atlantic, that ended in early December. The ship then went into drydock over the winter of 1908â09 for periodic maintenance, emerging for service again in early February 1909. A typical training routine followed for the next two years, interrupted only by a collision with the new cruiser on 16 February 1910 in the Kiel Bay, and two trips escorting the Kaiser in 1910; the first to Helgoland on 9â13 March and the second to Britain from 8 to 27 May. The collision with "Dresden" caused significant damage to both ships, though no one on either vessel was injured. Both ships were repaired in Kiel. "Dresden" also won the Kaiser's "SchieÃpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the reconnaissance force during this period. From December 1909 to September 1910, "FregattenkapitÃ¤n" (Frigate Captain) Adolf von Trotha served as the ship's commander.
