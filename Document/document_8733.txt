The season got for the most part ideal surveys. IGN's Jeremy Conrad, who was at first against the possibility of "rethinking" the Superman folklore, gave the main season a 7/10 rating. In the wake of looking into the whole season, Conrad expressed the main period of "Smallville" was "a strong begin to what will be an extraordinary Superman TV arrangement". "Amusement Weekly" Bruce Fretts trusts the arrangement may seem "silly" superficially, however indicates "rebelliously clever turn on the comic-book legends". Clint Morris, originator of Moviehole.net, expressed the arrangement was "all the while discovering its feet in season one"; despite the fact that, he complimented the acting, refering to explicitly Michael Rosenbaum's "wildly amiable Lex Luthor". "The Free-Lance Star's" Rob Hedelt complimented the giving a role as well, looking at Welling's depiction of a young Clark Kent to that of Christopher Reeve's depiction in the movies. Hedelt considered John Schneider and Annette O'Toole to be perfect picks for Jonathan and Martha Kent, yet felt Allison Mack and Sam Jones III, essential characters, were the weakest piece of the troupe. Judge Byun, of DVD Verdict, felt having Clark Kent and Lex Luthor begin their relationship as closest companions was a "splendid idea" that moved the show past a ""Dawson's Creek" with super powers" tone the reason of the show recommended. Byun trusts the primary season had "strong composition and incredible exhibitions", however is debilitated by the monstrosity of the week storylines that tormented the early scenes of the period; the season works best when the scenes center around character advancement and not super powers.
