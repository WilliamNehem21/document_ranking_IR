On account of Cope's notoriety for being a splendid scientist, it has been addressed why he would make such an undeniable anatomical blunder. It has been recommended that, as an extraordinary example in 1868, the first "Elasmosaurus" may have been difficult to translate dependent on the learning accessible at the time. Likewise, Cope at first idea it comprised of two examples of various animalsin a 1868 letter to LeConte, Cope had alluded to the alleged "littler example" as "Discosaurus carinatus". Adapt was just in his late twenties and not formally prepared in fossil science, and may have been impacted by Leidy's mix-up of turning around the vertebral segment of "Cimoliasaurus". In 2002 the American craftsmanship history specialist Jane P. Davidson noticed that the way that different researchers at an early stage had brought up Leidy's blunder contends against this clarification, including that Cope was not persuaded he had committed an error. Plesiosaur life structures was adequately outstanding at the time that Cope ought not have committed the error, as indicated by Davidson. Adapt did little chip away at the example since his 1870 portrayal, and it was kept away for about 30 years. It was just redescribed in detail in 2005 by the German scientist Sven Sachs.
