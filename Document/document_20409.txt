The praemaxillae have seven (tooth sockets) on each side, the same number found in "Angaturama", "Cristatusaurus", "Suchomimus", and MNHN SAM 124 (referred to "Spinosaurus"); MSNM V4047, another upper jaw specimen from "Spinosaurus", had only six. It cannot be confirmed whether this lower number of teeth is due to ontogeny; for that, a larger sample size is necessary. A large diastema (gap in tooth row) separates the third tooth socket from the fourth; this is observed in all other spinosaurids, being smaller in "Suchomimus". Another diastema of nearly equal length is found between the fifth and sixth alveolus; this diastema is seen in MNHN SAM 124 and is much longer in MSNM V4047 but is absent from "Suchomimus" and "Cristatusaurus". The maxilla fragment referred to "Oxalaia" (MN 6119-V) has two alveoli and a broken third one that includes a partial tooth. Like the praemaxilla, it had preserved nutrient canals. It also features a shallow dent in the middle, suggesting it was located near the (bony nostrils). Small fragments inside some of the remaining alveoli show that unlike its Early Cretaceous relatives "Suchomimus" and "Cristatusaurus", "Oxalaia" lacked on its teeth. Apart from the single, functional tooth in each socket, there were two replacement teeth, which according to Kellner are "a common feature in sharks or in some reptiles, but not in theropods". A cross-section of the teeth showed the typical oval shape exhibited by spinosaurs rather than the lateral compression of other theropod teeth.
