Angelou perceives that there are anecdotal angles to every one of her books, which separate her work from progressively customary "honest" collections of memoirs. Her methodology parallels the traditions of numerous African-American life accounts composed amid the abolitionist time frame in the US when truth was regularly blue-penciled for motivations behind self-insurance. Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the convention of African-American life account, yet demands that she has made a one of a kind understanding of the personal structure. In a 1998 meeting with writer George Plimpton, Angelou examines her composition procedure, and "the occasionally dangerous idea of truth in verifiable" and journals. Whenever inquired as to whether she changed reality to improve her story, she states, "Here and there I make a distance across from a composite of three or four individuals, on the grounds that the embodiment in just a single individual isn't adequately solid to be expounded on." Angelou has never confessed to changing the actualities in her accounts. Hagen states, "One can expect that 'the embodiment of the information' is available in Angelou's work", and that Angelou utilizes parts of fiction writing to make her portrayals of occasions and individuals all the more fascinating. Angelou's long-term supervisor, Robert Loomis, said that she could rework any of her books by changing the request of her certainties to have an alternate effect on the peruser.
