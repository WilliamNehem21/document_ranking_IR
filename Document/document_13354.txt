The RUF was going under expanding weight from political edges just as from the British-prepared SLA. It was vigorously subject to Sierra Leone's south-eastern neighbor Liberia, driven by Charles Taylor, and inferred most of its pay from the clearance of precious stones pirated through Liberia, which wound up known as blood jewels. In late 2000, the Sierra Leone governmentÃ¢ÂÂupheld by the British, UNAMSIL, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)Ã¢ÂÂ went into chats with the RUF. On 10 November, the two gatherings marked a 30-day truce that given to UNAMSIL to send all through the whole nation (it had recently been kept from working in numerous RUF-controlled regions), for the RUF to return caught weapons and gear to UNAMSIL, and for the RUF to enter the DDR procedure. The truce was later reached out by a further 90 days. The UN Security Council banned Liberian precious stones in Resolution 1343 in March 2001. In a matter of seconds a short time later, the RUF started vast scale demobilization and consented to a synchronous demilitarization with the Civil Defense Force, a volunteer army assemble faithful to the administration. By September, more than 16,000 volunteer army individuals (counting around 6,500 RUF) had experienced the DDR procedure and the soldiers in the precious stone delivering zones had all incapacitated.
