After Austin surrendered his order to turn into an official to the United States, fighters chose Edward Burleson as their new authority. On November 26, Burleson got word that a Mexican pack train of donkeys and ponies, joined by 50Ã¢ÂÂ 100ÃÂ Mexican warriors, was inside of BÃÂ©xar. After a close uprising, Burleson sent Bowie and William H. Jack with rangers and infantry to capture the provisions. In the resulting conflict, the Mexican powers were compelled to withdraw to BÃÂ©xar, abandoning their payload. To the mistake of the Texians, the saddlebags contained grub for the ponies; thus the fight was later known as the Grass Fight. In spite of the fact that the triumph quickly inspired the Texian troops, assurance kept on falling as the climate turned colder and the men became exhausted. After a few proposition to take BÃÂ©xar by power were voted against by the Texian troops, on December 4 Burleson recommended that the military lift the attack and retreat to Goliad until spring. In a last exertion to maintain a strategic distance from a retreat, Colonel Ben Milam by and by enlisted units to take an interest in an assault. The next morning, Milam and Colonel Frank W. Johnson drove a few hundred Texians into the city. Throughout the following four days, Texians battled their way from house to house towards the strengthened squares close to the focal point of town.
