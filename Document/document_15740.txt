Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy offers a deal to Sweet: she will take the place of her sister if she canât kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what sheâs done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke â on the verge of combusting as Sweetâs other victims have been shown to do â until Spike stops her, telling her that the only way to go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his marriage plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's âbrideâ, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You FeelâReprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").
