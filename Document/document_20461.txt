In April 2006, GameTap announced it was relaunching "Uru Live" as "". A major reason for the resurrection of the game was the fan support. According to GameTap's vice president of content Ricardo Sanchez, "One of the reasons [GameTap was] so attracted to "Uru Live" is that it had this persistent group that kept it alive during the dark days of its absence." While Cyan devoted its time to "Myst Online", it promised not to shut down "Until Uru" in the meantime, although it would offer no new authentication keys. GameTap released "Myst Online" in February 2007. A Macintosh version, using the Cider translation layer engine so that Intel-processor Macs did not need a Windows installation to run the game, was released in March. At the time, "Myst Online" was the only Mac-compatible game on GameTap. New content for the game was released in the form of online "episodes", adding new Ages, puzzles, and plot continuation with each episode. For business reasons GameTap announced in February 2008 that the game would go offline in April; Cyan reacquired the rights to the game and announced that it would give the "Myst Online" source code and tools to the fans, making the game an open-source project.
In 2010, Cyan Worlds released the game free of charge, under the name "Myst Online: Uru Live again" ("MO:ULagain"). It is currently hosted on Cyan-maintained servers.
