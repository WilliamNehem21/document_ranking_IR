Subsequent to leaving the Forest Service in 1928, Marshall attempted to finish his examinations for a PhD in plant physiology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. The next year he made his first excursion to Alaska, visiting the upper Koyukuk River and the focal Brooks Range, and planning for a lengthy visit for study. The logical goal of the excursion was to consider tree development at the northern timberline close to the Arctic Divide. For his 15-month visit in the community of Wiseman, Alaska, Marshall leased a one-room lodge by the main roadhouse in the town. He outfitted it with books, records, a phonograph player, and a composition work area. He set the work area so he could sit by the lodge's single window and respect the perspective on the Koyukuk River and the scope of soak, snow-canvassed mountains out of sight. His movements incited in him an extraordinary love for the focal Brooks Range in the Alaskan wild. Marshall was one of the first to investigate a great part of the range, particularly the headwaters of the North fork of the Koyukuk River, where he offered the name "Entryways of the Arctic" on a couple of mountains, Boreal Mtn. (6,375ÃÂ ft) and Frigid Crags (5,501ÃÂ ft.).
