The Percheron breed began in the Huisne waterway valley in France, which emerges in Orne, some portion of the previous Perche region, from which the breed gets its name. A few hypotheses have been advanced with regards to the lineage of the breed, however its precise inceptions are obscure. One wellspring of establishment bloodstock may have been horses caught by from the Bretons some time after 496 AD, and another may have been Arabian stallions conveyed to the region by Muslim trespassers in the eighth century. Different potential outcomes are caught Moorish mounted force ponies from the Battle of Poitiers in 732 AD, some of which were taken by warriors from Perche. A last hypothesis sets that the Percheron and the Boulonnais breed are firmly related, and that the Boulonnais affected the Percheron when they were conveyed to Brittany as fortifications for the armies of Caesar. It is realized that amid the eighth century, Arabian stallions were crossed with female horses local to the zone, and increasingly Oriental steed blood was presented by the Comte du Perche upon his arrival from the Crusades and endeavors into an area asserted by Spain. Blood from Spanish breeds was included when Rotrou III imported ponies from Castile. Regardless of the hypothesis of source, breed antiquarians concur that the landscape and atmosphere of the Perche zone had the best impact on the improvement of the breed. A conceivable reference to the steed is made in the thirteenth century sentiment "Guillaume de Dole", in which the title character requests "the Count of Perche's steed" to be made prepared, perhaps demonstrating the "'extraordinary pony,' which could oblige a shielded knight" and was reared in the topographical setting of the sonnet.
