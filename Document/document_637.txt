Theramenes' first appearance in the verifiable record accompanies his contribution in the oligarchic upset of 411 BC. In the wake of the Athenian annihilation in Sicily, revolts started to break out among Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and the Peace of Nicias came apart; the Peloponnesian War continued in full by 412 BC. In this unique situation, various Athenian blue-bloods, driven by Peisander and with Theramenes noticeable among their positions, started to scheme to topple the city's majority rule government. This interest was started by the ousted aristocrat Alcibiades, who was around then going about as an associate to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes. Guaranteeing that he had incredible impact with Tissaphernes, Alcibiades guaranteed to come back to Athens, carrying Persian help with him, if the majority rules system that had banished him were supplanted with a theocracy. In like manner, various trierarchs and different pioneers of the Athenian armed force at Samos started arranging the oust of the majority rules system. They in the long run dispatched Peisander to Athens, where, by promising that the arrival of Alcibiades and a partnership with Persia would pursue if the Athenians would supplant their majority rule government with a theocracy, he convinced the Athenian "ecclesia" to send him as an emissary to Alcibiades, approved to make whatever plans were vital.
