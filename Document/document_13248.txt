Arrangement maker Mike Bullen's working association with Granada Television started in 1994 when his operator sold his first screenplay, an irregular parody dramatization called "The Perfect Match", to the organization's head of satire Andy Harries. Harries had been searching for TV contents that would mirror the lives of individuals from his ageÃ¢ÂÂindividuals in their 30s who were under-spoken to on TV. "The Perfect Match", about a man who proposes to his better half at the FA Cup Final and needs to manage consistent media consideration a short time later, was made and afterward communicate in 1995. Harries approached Bullen to pitch more thoughts for TV to "The Perfect Match"s aide maker Christine Langan. As an enthusiast of American TV, for example, "Thirtysomething", "Frasier" and "Slope Street Blues", Bullen pitched "Cold Feet", a conventional "kid meets-young lady, kid loses-young lady, kid wins-young lady back" story told from the two sides of the relationship yet utilizing components of imagination and flashback to misshape occasions to fit a character's perspective. The underlying pitch focused on Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), which Harries accepted would lessen the narrating potential if the ITV Network Center authorized a full arrangement after the pilot, so Bullen "attached" plots for two different couplesÃ¢ÂÂAdam and Rachel's particular companions Pete and Jenny Gifford (John Thomson and Fay Ripley) and David and Karen Marsden (Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris).
