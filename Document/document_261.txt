"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" was composed by BeyoncÃÂ©, Terius "The-Dream" Nash, Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell, and Christopher "Dubious" Stewart, and was delivered by Nash and Stewart. BeyoncÃÂ© recorded the melody in May 2008 at the Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was blended by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with help from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized "Single Ladies" after BeyoncÃÂ©'s mystery marriage to hip jump recording craftsman Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart remarked that the melody was "the main open proclamation that [BeyoncÃÂ© and Jay-Z had] ever constructed about marriage", and that while in the studio recording the tune BeyoncÃÂ© had stayed tightlipped, even to the point of evacuating her wedding ring. BeyoncÃÂ©'s marriage motivated Nash to create a melody around an issue that influenced numerous individuals' connections: the dread or reluctance of men to submit. In a meeting with "Announcement" magazine, BeyoncÃÂ© added that she was attracted to the melody on account of the all inclusiveness of the point, an issue that "individuals are energetic about and need to discuss and discuss". She expressed that albeit "Single Ladies" is an energetic uptempo melody, it tends to an issue that ladies experience each day.
