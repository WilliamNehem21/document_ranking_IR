"Banksia aquilonia" develops as a tall bush or little tree up to high, however plants up to have been recorded. It has hard, fissured, dim bark, and limited elliptic or lanceolate leaves estimating long by wide with whole (straight) edges and intense tips. They are a smooth sparkly green above and white underneath with a conspicuous midrib canvassed in red-dark colored hair. The tanish new development shows up in summer. The plant is in sprout from March to June. Blossoms happen in "Banksia" trademark vertical bloom spike, an inflorescence made up of many sets of blossoms thickly stuffed in a winding around a woody pivot. "B.ÃÂ aquilonia" blossom spike is a light yellow shading, generally round and hollow, high, and up to in distance across. The rounded perianths of the individual blossoms are long. These open at development (anthesis) to discharge the styles. All old blossom parts fall away as up to 50 oval follicles create on the exposed woody spike. The follicles measure long, high, and wide. Textured at first, they become smooth with age and open when ready, and their two half-oval valves split to discharge the a couple of seeds they contain. The obovate dull dim dark colored to dark seeds sandwich a woody separator. Estimating long, they are comprised of a wedge-molded seed body, long by wide. The woody separator is a similar shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies alongside it. Seedlings have brilliant obovate green cotyledons around long. Adolescent leaves are smaller, estimating long and wide, and frequently have serrate (toothed) edges.
