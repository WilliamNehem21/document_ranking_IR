The preliminary was shrouded in startling point of interest, particularly by the "Edmonton Bulletin", which called it "the best show ever to be heard in an Alberta court". The "Release" was a Liberal paper, and MacLean had given it a development duplicate of his announcement of case, which enabled MacMillan's charges to be distributed and scattered before the announcement of case was recorded. The "Notice" was vehemently thoughtful to MacMillan in its inclusion, and printed her point by point declaration (which incorporated the dates and times of explicit experiences) practically verbatim. Under the feature "Vivian Testifies to Harrowing Ordeal", it applauded the youthful offended party as "persevering with superb backbone" and confronting the trial "with bold manner". Brownlee, conversely, was an "affection torn, sex crazed casualty of enthusiasm and desire, constraining his will upon her in stopped automobiles and on nation interstates". The jury was not sequestered and was allowed to peruse these records. Edmontonians were no less excited than their paper, and many appeared at the town hall right off the bat the times of preliminary, planning to get a seat. Towards the finish of the preliminary, Ives denied the "Notice's" press benefits at the preliminary and fined its distributer $300 and a correspondent $100 for distributing expressing "prone to aggravate popular sentiment and meddle with the fair course of equity."
