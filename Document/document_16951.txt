Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch "from the striking simplicity of "Ma mÃ¨re l'Oye" to the transcendental virtuosity of "Gaspard de la nuit"." Ravel's earliest major work for piano, "Jeux d'eau" (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later. When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity. The authors of "The Record Guide" consider that works such as "Gaspard de la Nuit" and "Miroirs" have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration "in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself."
Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, "A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in "Alborada del gracioso"... and the two outer movements of "Gaspard de la nuit". Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale." This balance caused a breach between the composer and ViÃ±es, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in "Gaspard de la nuit", "Le gibet" would "bore the audience to death". Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.
