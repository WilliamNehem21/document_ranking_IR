Of different drivers in the Chase, Kyle Busch was thirteenth quickest and Martin set the nineteenth quickest time. Amid the second practice session, Scott Riggs (who had the forty-third snappiest time) had a motor disappointment in the session's opening minutes and changed motors. Soon thereafter, Johnson paced the last practice session with a period of 19.722; Harvick was second and Biffle third. Marlin was fourth-quickest, in front of David Stremme and Hamlin. Earnhardt was seventh-quickest, Kyle Busch eighth, Gordon ninth and Mears tenth. Other Chase drivers included Jeff Burton in seventeenth and Kahne in seventeenth; all were inside one-tenth of a second of Johnson's time. The session was suspended when Kenny Wallace's motor exploded, since the track at that point should have been checked and cleaned, and Wallace changed motors. Jarrett spun out with a brake issue, however since he reached the divider he didn't need to change to a back-up vehicle. After a comparable impact, Michael Waltrip additionally did not need to switch vehicles.
