The Yugoslav boats served in a coastal and second-line escort role with the Royal Italian Navy () in the Adriatic under their Yugoslav designations, and were fitted with two L/30 anti-aircraft guns in place of their 66Â mm guns, but no other significant alterations were made to them. After the Italians capitulated in September 1943, they transferred "T1" back to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year. "T3" was seized by the Germans at Rijeka on 16 September 1943 and was renamed "TA48". She was commissioned on 15 August 1944, and was used for patrol and escort work in the northern Adriatic. The Germans added to her armament, fitting her with two single anti-aircraft guns in addition to the guns fitted by the Italians, and removing two of her torpedo tubes. There are two versions of how "TA48" was employed. The first version indicates that she was crewed exclusively by Croatian officers and sailors, but remained under German control, and the second states that she was handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, but was repossessed by the Germans on 14 December 1944 because they considered the Croatians unreliable. Her complement was also increased to 52 during her German-Croatian service. She was sunk in the port of Trieste by Allied aircraft on 20 February 1945.
