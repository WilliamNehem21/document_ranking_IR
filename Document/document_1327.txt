The rails are a winged creature family containing about 150 species. Despite the fact that the birthplaces of the gathering are lost in classical times, the biggest number of species and the most crude structures are found in the Old World, recommending that this family started there. The scientific classification of the little crakes is confounded, yet the nearest relative of the African crake is the corn crake, "C. crex", which breeds in Europe and Asia, yet winters in Africa. The African crake was first depicted as "Ortygometra egregia" by Wilhelm Peters in 1854 from an example gathered in Mozambique, yet the family name neglected to end up built up. For quite a while it was set as the sole individual from the variety "Crecopsis" however along these lines moved to "Crex", made for this species by German naturalist and ornithologist Johann MatthÃÂ¤us Bechstein in 1803. Richard Bowdler Sharpe thought about that the African winged creature varied adequately from the corn crake to have its own sort "Crecopsis", and later creators here and there put it in "Porzana", in view of a likeness to the fiery debris throated crake, "P. albicollis". Basic contrasts preclude "Porzana", and the arrangement in "Crex" is currently the most widely recognized and best-bolstered treatment. Phylogeny and morphology affirm that the "Porzana" crakes are the nearest relatives of the family "Crex". The variety name is onomatopoeic, alluding to the tedious grinding call of the corn crake, and the species name "egregia" gets from Latin "egregius", "extraordinary, unmistakable".
