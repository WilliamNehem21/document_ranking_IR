The grade's unique steam motor was detached on JanuaryÃÂ 6, 1912, and supplanted with an electric engine. The vehicles utilized on the grade were initially twofold deckers, however were reconfigured into a solitary decker plan in 1921. The twofold decker vehicles had steeds and wagons riding on the fundamental, upper deck and travelers riding in a compartment beneath. Just a single human casualty has happened at the slope, however it was resolved that the episode was not brought about by the grade itself. There were two occurrences during the 1920s when ponies on board the grade progressed toward becoming frightened and jumped from the vehicle onto the tracks beneath. Bethlehem Steel, the successor to Cambria Iron, sold the Johnstown Inclined Plane to the district of Westmont in April 1935. On MarchÃÂ 17, 1936, about 4,000ÃÂ people were emptied from Johnstown to higher ground through the grade as the Stoneycreek and Conemaugh Rivers flooded their banks. The floodwaters proceeded with downstream and inevitably achieved Pittsburgh. From FebruaryÃÂ 1938 to JulyÃÂ 1953, the Johnstown Traction Company worked travel transports from Johnstown to Westmont with the "completely stacked open transports" being conveyed by the slope. Bethlehem Steel quit providing power to the Johnstown Inclined Plane when the production line changed to "an inconsistent power framework", constraining the slope to close on JanuaryÃÂ 31, 1962. In light of open strain to keep the grade working, it was revived in JulyÃÂ 1962 after a broad redesign, in which the electric engine was rewound, ties were supplanted, and the vehicles were repainted.
