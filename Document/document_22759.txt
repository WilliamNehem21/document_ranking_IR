"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)" was received positively by contemporary critics. In an article for "The Source", The Ghetto Communicator wrote "This record is harsh, but so is the world that we live in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". "Entertainment Weekly" said, "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, "Enter" has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret." TourÃ© was less enthusiastic in "Rolling Stone", praising the album's sound, but noting that "Wu-TangÂ ... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvasâthe self." He added, "This is hip-hop you won't find creeping up the "Billboard" charts but you will hear booming out of Jeep stereos in all the right neighborhoods." However, "Enter the Wu-Tang" had surprising chart success, despite its raw, underground sound. It peaked at number 41 on the "Billboard" 200 chart and reached number eight on "Billboard"s Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album continued to sell steadily and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 15, 1995.
