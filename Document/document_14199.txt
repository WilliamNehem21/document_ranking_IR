Both Ben and Brother Justin would have been alive in the third season. Daniel Knauf would have composed Brother Justin as a man "with an inoperable piece of shrapnel close to his heart", which the blessed edge had caused in the last season 2 scene. Sibling Justin would have been "seriously debilitated and inclined to weariness, filling in as an empty nonentity in his blossoming service. Sofie and Iris would be competing for the power behind the position of authority, with Sofie by a long shot the more risky of the two, despite the fact that Iris is a power to be figured with." Knauf had the aim of wedding Brother Justin to Sofie sooner or later, and the third season would have appeared three-year-old kid in the midst of Sofie and the Crowes. Knauf left the inquiry concerning the tyke's folks open. Ben's future would confront different hardships. As per Knauf, Ben's injuries of the period 2 finale would require continued suturing, making him lose his "Vitae Divina" and depleting him of solidarity. Ben would be an unexpected man in comparison to he was previously, with an identity closer to Management, and keeping in mind that he and Sofie would be bound together by affection, their definitive destinies stay unsure.
