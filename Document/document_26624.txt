MÃ¼ller made a third attempt to close to torpedo range, but "Sydney" quickly turned away. Shortly after 10:00, a shell from "Sydney" detonated ready ammunition near the starboard No. 4 gun and started a serious fire. A fourth and final attempt to launch a torpedo attack was made shortly thereafter, but "Sydney" was able to keep the range open. By 10:45, "Emden"s guns had largely gone silent; her superstructure had been shredded and the two rear-most funnels had been shot away, along with the foremast. MÃ¼ller realized that his ship was no longer able to fight, and so he decided to beach "Emden" on North Keeling Island to save the lives of his crew. At 11:15, "Emden" was run onto the reef, and her engines and boilers were flooded. Her breech blocks and torpedo aiming gear were thrown overboard to render the weapons unusable, and all signal books and secret papers were burned. "Sydney" turned to capture the collier "Buresk", whose crew scuttled her when the Australian cruiser approached. "Sydney" then returned to the wrecked "Emden" and inquired if she surrendered. The signal books had been destroyed by fire and so the Germans could not reply, and since her flag was still flying, "Sydney" resumed fire. The Germans quickly raised white flags and the Australians ceased fire.
