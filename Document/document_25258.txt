In November 1942, "Argus" was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded Algiers, Algeria, during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 Supermarine Seafire IICs of 880 Squadron aboard. The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men. She and the escort carrier joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. torpedoed "Avenger", right behind "Argus" in the convoy, later that morning. The ship was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom, but she required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943. Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit, she was relegated to deck-landing training. She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944, but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was made from her deck. In March, she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year, but this plan was also apparently cancelled. "Argus" became an accommodation ship at Chatham in December and she was approved for scrapping on 6 May 1946. She was sold to Thos W Ward on 5 December 1946 and arrived at Inverkeithing later that month to be broken up.
