"Astraeus hygrometricus" is an ectomycorrhizal growth and develops in relationship with a wide scope of tree species. The mutualistic relationship between tree roots and the mycelium of the parasite enables the trees to extricate supplements (especially phosphorus) from the earth; in return, the organism gets sugars from photosynthesis. In North America, relationship with oak and pine are regular, while in India, it has been noted to develop normally with chir pine ("Pinus roxburghii") and sal ("Shorea robusta"). The bogus earthstar is found on the ground in open fields, regularly dissipated or in gatherings, particularly in supplement poor, sandy or loamy soils. It has likewise been accounted for to develop on rocks, inclining toward corrosive substrates like slate and stone, while maintaining a strategic distance from substrates wealthy in lime. In Nepal, organic product bodies have been gathered at heights of . Natural product bodies commonly show up in harvest time, despite the fact that the dry organic product bodies are constant and may last as long as quite a long while. "Gelatinipulvinella astraeicola" is a leotiaceous parasite with moment, coagulated, pulvinate (pad molded) apothecia, known to become just on the inward surface of the beams of dead "Astraeus" species, including "A.ÃÂ hygrometricus".
