The spores are elliptical to oblong, smooth, and have dimensions of 7â10 by 3â4Â Âµm. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are thin-walled, club-shaped to roughly cylindrical, and measure 2â25 by 5â7Â Âµm. They bear either two or four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia that are found on the face of a gill) are roughly cylindrical with rounded ends, thin-walled, and 40â55 by 5â8Â Âµm. The cells often have brown contents, and in the presence of 2%Â potassium hydroxide (KOH) will appear hyaline (translucent) or vinaceous (red wine-colored); in Melzer's reagent they become pale yellow or brown. The cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the edge of a gill) are 30â60 by 7â10Â Âµm, club-shaped to almost cylindrical, thin-walled, with brown incrusting material at the base, and arranged like a bundle of fibers. In KOH they appear hyaline, and are pale yellow in Melzer's reagent. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are 60â90 by 7â9Â Âµm, mostly cylindrical with rounded ends, and arranged in bundles with brown pigment particles at the base. The caulocystidia stain vinaceous in KOH. The cuticle of the cap is made of a layer of interwoven gelatinous hyphae that are individually 2â5Â Âµm thick; the gelatinous hyphae are responsible for the sliminess of the cuticle. There are no clamp connections in the hyphae.
