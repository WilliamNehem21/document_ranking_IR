Updates on the sinking was transmitted back to the focal point of London, and before long sifted through to those hanging tight at Swan Pier for the steamer's arrival. Relatives advanced toward the London Steamboat workplaces close Blackfriars to hang tight for more news; many took the train from London Bridge to Woolwich. The groups developed amid the night and into the next day, as the two relatives and tourists made a trip to Woolwich; extra police were drafted in to help control the groups, and manage the remaining parts that were being landed. Reports came in of bodies being done as far upstream as Limehouse and down to Erith. At the point when bodies were landed, they were put away locally for distinguishing proof, as opposed to halfway, albeit most wound up at Woolwich Dockyard. Relatives needed to go between a few areas on the two sides of the Thames to scan for missing relatives. Nearby watermen were procured for ÃÂ£2 every day to look for bodies; they were paid at least five shillings for every one they recouped, which now and then prompted battles about the bodies. One of those grabbed was that of Grinstead, "Princess Alice"s chief.
