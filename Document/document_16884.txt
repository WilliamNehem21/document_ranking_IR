Shelley's stated aim in "Rambles" is to raise awareness of the political situation in Italy and to convince readers to aid the revolutionaries in their fight for independence. She addresses her readers as English citizens, arguing that they in particular "ought to sympathise in [the Italians'] struggles; for the aspiration for free institutions all over the world has its source in England". On a general level, she articulates an "opposition to monarchical government, disapproval of class distinction, abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties" similar to that in her historical novels "Valperga" (1823) and "Perkin Warbeck" (1830). The central theme of the second journey is "the tyranny of Austrian and French imperialism, and the abuses of papal and priestly authority". The solution to Italy's problems, according to Shelley, is neither "subjugation" nor "revolution" but rather "peaceful mediation". Ultimately, it is the lessons learned from history that Shelley feels are the most important, which is why she compares the past and present. "Rambles" articulates the "Whiggish ideology of political gradualism", and is similar to Wollstonecraft's "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792) in that it argues that "a reformation of culture is necessary to reform oppressive and degrading power relations".
