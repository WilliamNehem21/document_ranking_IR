Merciful, moved by his visitor's stories of enduring because of the Roman popes, stacked him with blessings and respects and sent him north to Paris. There, King Charles VI of France in like manner arranged a triumphal welcome for his distinguished visitor. Paul was an extraordinary and mainstream locate in the French capital, and was sumptuously facilitated and engaged. He clearly made the most of his long visit there, "safe in a spot where his past was obscure and his duplicity was probably not going to be found", as per Nicol. For further security, he conveyed just by means of a mediator in his utilize. On his visit to the Abbey of Saint-Denis, he asserted that there were a few relics of the convent's supporter holy personÃ¢ÂÂusually mistook for the Athenian holy person Dionysius the Areopagite at the timeÃ¢ÂÂto be found back in Greece, and guaranteed to enable the priests to convey them to France. His proposition was energetically taken up, and two priests got consent and assets from the ruler to go with Paul back to Greece. At the point when the gathering touched base in the port in Italy from which they would cruise for Greece, in any case, Paul renumerated the chief of the ship to imagine that awful climate would defer their flight. Around the same time, he and his hirelings set sail with their whole things, deserting the two priests. It was just in Rome, where the priests went looking for answers for Paul's conduct, that they took in the genuine character of their voyaging sidekick. From them the writer of the convent later gotten his data.
