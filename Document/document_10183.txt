The new proprietors, the Haas family, proprietors of Levi Strauss, were unpracticed in baseball. They named Martin general administrator, giving him unlimited authority of the baseball side of the activity. Martin brought his forceful style of play, which was named "Billyball" by a sportswriter from the get-go in the 1981 season, and the name stuck. The A's started the season going 18Ã¢ÂÂ 3, and Martin showed up on the front of "Time" magazine. He was acclaimed by baseball fans the nation over notwithstanding when he was kicked out of a diversion and suspended by the class for seven days for kicking earth on the umpire. The Oakland energy was at long last checked by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, which shut down baseball for about two months middle of the season. The season was part into two parts, the division chiefs at the season of the strike (in the AL West, the A's) to play the second-half victors (the Royals) in an extraordinary division arrangement. The A's won in three straight amusements to confront the Yankees in the 1981 American League Championship Series. The chance to beat the Yankees implied a lot to Martin, and Steinbrenner, seeing the Oakland achievement, was secretly expressing that he may have rushed to flame Martin after the marshmallow sales rep occurrence. Be that as it may, the veteran New York lineup and pitching staff had the capacity to command the An's as the Yankees won the initial three amusements to take the arrangement. The A's done a consolidated 64Ã¢ÂÂ 45, the second-best record in baseball, and expectations were high for 1981.
