While at peak intensity, Rusa struck the Japanese island of Amami Åshima. After maintaining the peak winds for about 12Â hours, Rusa weakened slightly as it continued to the west-northwest, but on AugustÂ 28 the JMA again reported the typhoon attained winds of 150Â km/h (90Â mph ). Despite forecasts that it would weaken, Rusa maintained its intensity while passing south of Japan, due to minimal wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of up to . The typhoon again weakened slightly on AugustÂ 29 while passing between the Amami Islands and Japan. Thereafter, Rusa turned to the north toward the Korean Peninsula. Warm, moist air blew across the peninsula ahead of the storm, which prevented significant weakening, and an approaching cold front contributed to atmospheric instability. At around 0800Â UTC on AugustÂ 31, Rusa made landfall on Goheung, South Korea, with winds of 140Â km/h (85Â mph ). According to the JTWC, Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to hit the country since 1959. The typhoon rapidly weakened while crossing the country, deteriorating into a tropical depression early on SeptemberÂ 1. Around that time, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the system. The depression turned to the northeast, and after moving through the Sea of Japan, Rusa became extratropical over Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East late on SeptemberÂ 1. The extratropical remnants continued northeast and dissipated on SeptemberÂ 4 over the Kamchatka Peninsula.
