The talonid contains a hypoconid, hypoconulid, and entoconid and is a lot more extensive than the trigonid in light of the fact that the hypoconid is uprooted buccally. A cristid obliqua drops from the hypoconid and scopes the protoconid. Despite the fact that a peak, the postmetacristid, slides from the rear of the metaconid, finishing in a little cusp, the metastylid, it is isolated from the entoconid by a score. The living colugos need such a solid postmetacristid. The hypoconulid is close to the back lingual edge of the tooth, behind the entoconid. In "D.ÃÂ major", this cusp is further to the back than in both "D.ÃÂ chimaera" and the Sunda colugo, while the two cusps are converged in the Philippine colugo. In "D.ÃÂ chimaera", a low peak, the post-hypoconulid cristid, comes to from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth, where a little cuspule, the distocuspid, is found. A long peak, the postcristid, associates the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the back side of the tooth. The Philippine colugo is comparative, however in "D.ÃÂ major", both the distocuspid and the post-hypoconulid cristid are missing, and the Sunda colugo has a flimsier distocuspid and a postcristid that does not achieve further lingually than the hypoconulid.
