The full JWP reports were distributed in January 2016. The JWP perceived the disclosure of component 113, appointing need to Riken. They noticed that while the individual rot energies of each nuclide in the rot chain of 113 were conflicting, their whole was currently affirmed to be reliable, emphatically recommending that the underlying and last states in 113 and its little girl Db were the equivalent for every one of the three occasions. The rot of Db to Lr and Md was recently known, solidly tying down the rot chain of 113 to known locales of the graph of nuclides. The JWP thought about that the JINRÃ¢ÂÂ LLNL coordinated efforts of 2004 and 2007, delivering component 113 as the girl of component 115, did not meet the disclosure criteria as they had not convincingly decided the nuclear quantities of their nuclides through cross-bombardments, which were viewed as important since their rot affixes were not moored to recently known nuclides. They likewise thought about that the past JWP's worries over their synthetic distinguishing proof of the dubnium little girl had not been satisfactorily tended to. The JWP perceived the JINRÃ¢ÂÂ LLNLÃ¢ÂÂ ORNLÃ¢ÂÂ Vanderbilt joint effort of 2010 as having found components 117 and 115, and acknowledged that component 113 had been delivered as their girl, however did not give this work shared credit.
