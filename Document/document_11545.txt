In spite of the fact that Sibelius educated his secretary in late August 1945 that the ensemble had been scorched, the issue remained a mystery kept to the author's private circle. Amid the rest of the long periods of his life, Sibelius now and again implied that the Eighth Symphony venture was as yet alive. In August 1945 he kept in touch with Basil Cameron: "I have completed my eighth orchestra a few times, yet I am as yet not happy with it. I will be charmed to hand it over to you when the time comes." truth be told, after the consuming he had out and out relinquished innovative creating; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society mentioned a work to stamp the 1951 Festival of Britain, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was chipping away at the ensemble "in his psyche"; just in 1954 did he concede, in a letter to the widow of his companion Adolf Paul, that it could never be finished. Sibelius passed on 20 September 1957; the following day his little girl Eva Paloheimo declared freely that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The consuming of the original copy turned out to be by and large known later, when Aino uncovered the reality to the writer's biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna.
