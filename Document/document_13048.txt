The species was named by the Unitarian pastor John Lewis Russell of Salem, Massachusetts, in light of examples found in Brattleboro, Vermont. He named the parasite after his companion, individual novice American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost, who distributed a portrayal of the animal types in his 1874 overview of the boletes of New England. At the point when the name of an animal groups is contributed by an individual, yet the name is formally distributed by another, the benefactor's name can be refered to, isolated from the distributing writer as "apud"; hence, the name and specialist are stated "Boletus Frostii" Russell "apud" Frost in some more established writing. Bernard Ogilvie Dodge made reference to "B.ÃÂ frostii" in 1950 amid a location to the Mycological Society of America, in which he talked about the job of the beginner in finding new species: "They would have educated every one of us about the man Russell, who named a fine new bolete for his companion Frost, and about the man Frost, who named a fine new bolete for his companion Russell. "Boletus Frostii" and "Boletus Russellii" are mushrooms with "character", despite the fact that they were depicted by novices." However, in endeavoring to build up a lectotype example, mycologist Roy Halling inspected both Russell's unique material and his going with notes; he reasoned that it was Frost who made the first species conclusions, further proposing that "there is no proof to demonstrate that Russell at any point gathered "B.ÃÂ frostii" or composed a portrayal of it."
