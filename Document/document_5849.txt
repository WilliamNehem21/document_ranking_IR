"Droits de l'Homme" was hopelessly harmed, and a large number of the men on board were fighters with no preparation for what to do in case of a wreck. Each progressive wave cleared more men into the water and frantic endeavors to dispatch vessels fizzled when the little specialty were cleared away by the waves and broken in the surf. Pontoons were developed, yet a few were overwhelmed in endeavors to convey a rope to the shore. The men on the one pontoon that stayed upstanding were compelled to slice the rope to keep them from foundering in the overwhelming oceans. A portion of the men on this pontoon achieved the shoreline, the primary overcomers of the disaster area. Ensuing endeavors were made by people to swim to shore with ropes, yet they were either suffocated or driven back to the ship by the power of the ocean. With no guide conceivable from the shore, night fell on 14ÃÂ January with the vast majority of the team travelers still on board. Amid the night, the waves stove in (crushed in) the stern of the ship, flooding a significant part of the inside. On the morning of 15ÃÂ January, a little vessel conveying nine British detainees (some portion of the group of the "Cumberland", caught by "Droits de l'Homme" prior in the battle) figured out how to achieve shore. Seeing the British-kept an eye on vessel achieving shore incited a mass propelling of little pontoons from the disaster area with expectations of picking up the shoreline. Anyway the waves expanded yet again, and not one of these little art endure the entry.
