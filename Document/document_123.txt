Katsura's investment in the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards title denoted the first occasion when that a lady had vied for any world billiards title. This was just ten years after Ruth McGinness turned into the main lady to have at any point been welcome to play in any men's expert billiard title (the New York State Championship of 1942). The guarding champion was the then 64-year-old globally eminent Willie Hoppe, who might resign soon thereafter with 51 world titles to his name somewhere in the range of 1906 and 1952 of every three types of carom billiards, three-pad, (four sub-orders of) balkline and pad caroms. Prior to the competition, theory had it that when Hoppe met Katsura in the title in the to 50 design, he would vanquish her with Katsura as yet requiring no less than 40. In the wake of seeing her play, Hoppe said "she has a fine stroke and can make shots with either hand. I anticipate playing with her." The open was intrigued by the oddity of a lady player. "Life" magazine revealed that "San Franciscans who did not know a signal from a cucumber packed in to see her... Katy ... stole the show."
