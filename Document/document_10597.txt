The skull of "Nemegtomaia" was profound, thin, and short (contrasted with the remainder of the body), and achieved 179ÃÂ mm (7ÃÂ in) long. It had an all around created peak, shaped by the nasal and premaxilla bones (for the most part the last mentioned) of the nose. The about vertical front edge of the holotype's peak framed a practically 90degree point with the upper edge of the skull. Contrasted with different oviraptorids, the nasal procedures (projections) of the premaxillae were scarcely unmistakable when seen from above (where they associated with the nasal bones on the most astounding purposes of the peak). The peak expanded hindwards and down, framing a round curve at the most noteworthy point. The distance across of the circle (enlightening) was 52ÃÂ mm (2ÃÂ in); the eyes looked huge because of the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity before the eye comprised of two fenestrae (openings); a substantial antorbital fenestra at the back, and a little maxillary fenestra at the front. "Nemegtomaia" was particular from different oviraptorids in that the frontal bone on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the parietal bone from front to back. The nares (outer nostrils) were moderately little and put high on the skull.
