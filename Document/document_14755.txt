The foundation of a visitor course along the seaside street among Australind and Mandurah was proposed in the late 1930s by the Harvey Road Board. The Bunbury Road Board upheld the thought, with the magnificence and joy of the course talked about at a gathering of the street board in January 1939; the absence of a legitimate street surface was viewed as the main hindrance. Traffic was anticipated to develop throughout the following five years to a degree that would legitimize a second course to Perth, especially as the traffic volume on the current inland street was at that point overwhelming and causing mishaps. The Minister for Works, Harry Millington, considered the proposition in July 1939, and by mid 1940 various bits of gossip developed with respect to the fast approaching beginning of works; notwithstanding, the Main Roads Department had no aim to attempt them. The Harvey Road Board chose to shun seeking after the issue until World War II had finished up. By 1943, vegetation was congesting the street, making it hard to spot in spots, and in December 1946 about was immersed by water profound. Exchanges between Main Roads and the street sheets recommenced in 1947, and by October 1948 the arrangement of an appropriate street was cost at ÃÂ£280,000. Given that a decent quality street effectively connected Perth and Bunbury, and there was probably going to be minimal quick advantage, Main Roads did not believe the proposition to be justified.
