The strongest support for Diá»m came from the Australian Catholic media. Diá»m was a Catholic in a majority Buddhist country, and he had close religious links with the Vatican, who had helped him rise to power. He had stayed in a seminary run by Cardinal Francis Spellman in the United States in the early 1950s before his elevation to power. Diá»m's elder brother Archbishop NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Thá»¥c was the leading Catholic figure in Vietnam and a classmate of Spellman when the pair studied in Rome. Spellman was widely regarded as the most powerful Catholic figure in the United States and he helped to organise support for Diá»m among American politicians, particularly Catholics. In 1957, Diá»m dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary and ruled on the basis of a Catholic doctrine known as personalism. His younger brother NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Nhu ran the secret and autocratic Catholic Cáº§n Lao Party (Personalist Labor Party), which provided a clandestine network of support and police-state mechanisms to protect Diá»m's rule. It counted many leading public servants and military officers among its members. Diá»m also maintained land policies that were preferential to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest property owner in the country. Their holdings were exempt from redistribution under land reform schemes, while the construction of Buddhist temples was restricted; military and civil service promotions were given preferentially to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.
