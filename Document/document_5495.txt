Mendes called "American Beauty" a transitional experience film about detainment and getaway from detainment. The tedium of Lester's presence is set up through his dark, unexceptional working environment and characterless dress. In these scenes, he is regularly encircled as though caught, "emphasizing ceremonies that barely please him". He strokes off in the bounds of his shower; the shower slow down brings out a prison cell and the shot is the first of numerous where Lester is kept in the slammer or to outlines, for example, when he is reflected behind segments of numbers on a PC screen, "restricted [and] about crossed out". The scholarly and creator Jody W. Pennington contends that Lester's adventure is the story's middle. His sexual stiring through gathering Angela is the first of a few defining moments as he starts to "[throw] off the obligations of the agreeable life he has come to detest". After Lester shares a joint with Ricky, his soul is discharged and he starts to oppose Carolyn. Changed by Ricky's "alluring, significant certainty", Lester is persuaded that Angela is achievable and sees that he should scrutinize his "worn-out, numbingly realist rural presence"; he accepts a position at a cheap food outlet, which enables him to relapse to a moment that he could "see as long as he can remember in front of him".
