In the scene, McClure starts an association with Selma Bouvier, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The relationship resuscitates his vocation, driving him to star in "Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!", a phase melodic variant of the film "Planet of the Apes". To additionally support McClure's vocation, McClure's operator proposes that he get hitched. Unconscious of McClure's inspiration, Selma acknowledges his proposition, and moves into McClure's home, a Modernist building which takes after the Chemosphere. At his lone wolf party, a plastered McClure discloses to Homer Simpson that the marriage is only a trick to support his profession. Homer says nothing at the wedding, however later casually specifies McClure's admission to Marge, who at that point educates her sister. Selma chooses to stay with McClure in any case, yet she winds up exasperates when McClure's specialist encourages the pair to have a kid (since "all the huge parts nowadays are going to family men"). Having a kid will verify McClure's giving a role as McBain's sidekick in "McBain IV: Fatal Discharge", yet Selma is reluctant to bring a kid into a cold relationship and chooses to leave McClure. McClure at last gets the job, yet turns it down so as to direct and star in his own pet undertaking, a twentieth Century Fox movie called "The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel".
