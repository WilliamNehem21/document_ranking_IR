Since he was an injured fighter, Pestek was qualified for a long leave and mentioned it for 6 April 1944. On 3 April, he stole a SS uniform, gun, and paybook for Lederer, who shrouded them in a twofold divider. Prior to standing gatekeeper at the door of the family camp the evening of 5 April, Pestek left a bike by Lederer's garisson huts as a flag for him to turn out. Pestek gave the right passwords, telling different gatekeepers Lederer was on uncommon obligation, and the two men bicycled out of the front door. They went to the railroad station outside Auschwitz and got a train to Prague, dodging fringe control by professing to be gear investigators. Lederer's nonappearance was found toward the beginning of the day of 6 May by a SS man assessing the family camp who had seen a lady leaving Lederer's square and ventured in to explore, just to find Lederer missing. At 11:30, "SS-SturmbannfÃÂ¼hrer" Friedrich Hartjenstein, the commandant of Auschwitz II-Birkenau, sent a message to the German police informing them that Lederer had gotten away, most likely masked as a "SS-RottenfÃÂ¼hrer". Another message four hours after the fact detailed that a SS manÃ¢ÂÂprobably PestekÃ¢ÂÂwas under doubt as a suspect for supporting the break. Cierer and others associated with being near Pestek or Lederer were examined.
