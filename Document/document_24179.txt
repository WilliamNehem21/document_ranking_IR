Another of Todd's comedic pairings is his friendship with a parrot he names Moose. Todd is closer to Moose than he is to most humans. He tells the bird his private thoughts and secrets, which causes conflict and antagonism between Moose and his wife at the time, TÃ©a. Florencia Lozano, TÃ©a's portrayer, stated, "My characterÂ ... has a very adversarial relationship with the birdÂ ... It's sort of jealous of me, I'm jealous of the bird. We're both trying to get close to Todd." The bird was portrayed by two South American blue and gold macaws named Flash and Lucky, and an Animal Planet documentary stated that they had developed an "impressive rÃ©sumÃ©" by the time they appeared on "OLTL." They were trained by Ed Richman, who had worked with the birds for fifteen years in TV shows such as "Magnum, P.I." and "Jake and the Fatman. "Richman stated that Howarth caught on "real quick" regarding his interaction with Flash and Lucky and said that he was the best actor he had worked with in the industry. The parrots were used for different purposes: for intimidating scenes where it looked like Moose "was going to kill somebody", Richman used Flash, and Lucky was used for the "loving, very caring, physically close" portrayal of Moose. Like other actors, the parrots were able to connect, in character, with their fellow castmembers and achieve comedic timing with them. Voice actor Ron Gallop was hired to deliver Moose's lines, which were crafted to help demonstrate Todd's train of thought, signified Todd and Moose's close bond, and consisted of funny or insulting remarks aimed at anyone causing problems for Todd.
