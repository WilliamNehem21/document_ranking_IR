In spite of Lang's long association with the most unfortunate of society, in the wake of getting to be Archbishop of York he progressively segregated himself from regular day to day existence. The history specialist Tom Buchanan composed that Lang's compassion for normal individuals was supplanted by "a privileged artificiality and a take pleasure in the high society in which his office enabled him to move". No diocese supervisor has been as close as Lang to the Royal Family; a Channel Four TV history of the British government kept up that Lang "held a perspective on Christianity in which the government, as opposed to the cross, stood the focal point of the audience as the image of the country's confidence". Progressive ages of the Royal Family thought of him as their companion and regarded him. Ruler George V designated him to the to a great extent stately post of Lord High Almoner, and after the 1937 Coronation George VI made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO), an uncommon respect which, similar to the Royal Victorian Chain, lay in the private endowment of the Sovereign. A companion, remarking on the change of Lang's point of view, said of him: "He may have been Cardinal Wolsey or St Francis of Assisi, and he was Cardinal Wolsey."
