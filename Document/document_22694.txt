Koechlin has been acknowledged in the media for her unconventional roles in films and her straightforward personality. Reviewing her work in "Printing Machine", film critic and journalist Subhash K. Jha deemed her the "free-thinking actress this industry [Bollywood] needs". Megha Shah of the "GQ" called her "someone who can speak her mind, sound intelligent and also look stunning in a bikini". Members of the media have subsequently labelled her as a role model for women across the country. Bhavya Sadhwani, describing her as "a real life heroine", lauded her for "voicing her opinions without an iota of inhibition". Another editorial in "The Week" stated that with her powerful performances, and by voicing her opinions, she "has always stayed ahead of her contemporaries in the industry".
Following her portrayal of such characters as those in "Dev.D", "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara", "Shaitan", and "Margarita With a Straw", Koechlin gained wider recognition and earned the tag of a "nonconformist". Clarisse Loughrey of "The Independent" described her as a pioneer for the Indian film industry owing to her unconventional roles and outspoken public presence. Don Groves of "Forbes" wrote that she has "managed to subvert stereotypes by playing characters who are nothing like each other". The columnist and film critic Vinayak Chakravorty cites Koechlin as one of the "new 'new wave' actors" who has proved her easy screen presence in her short time in the film industry.
