Henneberger offered ten weeks advance pay, however made it a condition that Lovecraft move to Chicago, where the magazine was headquartered. Lovecraft portrayed Henneberger's arrangements in a letter to Frank Belknap Long as "a fresh out of the plastic new magazine to cover the field of Poe-Machen shivers". Lovecraft did not wish to leave New York, where he had as of late moved with his new lady of the hour; his abhorrence of chilly climate was another obstruction.

Before the year's over Wright had been enlisted as the new editorial manager of "Unusual Tales". The last issue under Baird's name was a consolidated May/June/July issue, with 192 pagesÃ¢ÂÂan a lot thicker magazine than the prior issues. It was collected by Wright and Kline, as opposed to Baird.
