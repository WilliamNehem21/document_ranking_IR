Soon after taking the royal position, Ranavalona invalidated the Anglo-Merina arrangement that had been finished up among Radama and British emissaries, and would not keep getting yearly installments from Britain in return for adherence to the stipulations of the settlement. The most critical of these conditions was the kingdom's non-investment in the universal slave exchange, which had truly been a noteworthy wellspring of income for the kingdoms of Imerina, Betsimisaraka, Sakalava and others over the island. One outcome of the end of the Anglo-Merina companionship settlement was a conclusion to the conveyance of British weaponry, which rendered the ruler defenseless against structures against her from remote powers and pockets of nearby obstruction alike. This weakness was underscored in 1829 when an armada of six French boats propelled an unjustifiable assault against the fortress of Foulpointe and the adjacent town of Ivondro on the eastern shoreline of Madagascar. The ruler's military effectively repulsed the French at the following port, compelling the boats to ÃÂle Sainte-Marie, where they drew in a political agent sent from Antananarivo by Ranavalona. The extended arrangements guaranteed the French experienced the jungle fever predominant in seaside territories, until the expanding losses constrained the boats' withdrawal from Ranavalona's region.
