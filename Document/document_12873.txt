The Aetolian League finished up a harmony concurrence with PhilipV in 206BC, and the Roman Republic arranged the Treaty of Phoenice in 205BC, finishing the war and enabling the Macedonians to hold some caught settlements in Illyria. In spite of the fact that the Romans dismissed an Aetolian demand in 202BC for Rome to announce war on Macedonia indeed, the Roman Senate gave genuine thought to the comparative offer made by Pergamon and its partner Rhodes in 201BC. These states were worried about PhilipV's collusion with Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire, which attacked the war-fatigued and monetarily depleted Ptolemaic Empire in the Fifth Syrian War (202Ã¢ÂÂ 195BC) as PhilipV caught Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea. In spite of the fact that Rome's emissaries assumed a basic job in persuading Athens to join the counter Macedonian partnership with Pergamon and Rhodes in 200BC, the "comitia centuriata" (individuals' get together) rejected the Roman Senate's proposition for an announcement of war on Macedonia. Then, PhilipV vanquished regions in the Hellespont and Bosporus just as Ptolemaic Samos, which drove Rhodes to shape a coalition with Pergamon, Byzantium, Cyzicus, and Chios against Macedonia. In spite of PhilipV's ostensible collusion with the Seleucid ruler, he lost the maritime Battle of Chios in 201BC and was barricaded at Bargylia by the Rhodian and Pergamene naval forces.
