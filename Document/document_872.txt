Utilizing an expansive cast of charactersÃ¢ÂÂa wide arrangement of identities and societiesÃ¢ÂÂenables Lat to remark on a more extensive scope of subjects than is conceivable with a little gathering of characters. Malaysian funnies researcher Muliyadi Muhamood remarked that the diversion in Lat's kid's shows is evoked through graphical and literary signifies; "short, minimized discoursed" and plays on words structure the content while "outward appearances and activities" of the characters help to draw out the clever side of things. Muliyadi further expressed that Lat's works offer numerous dimensions of elucidation; one peruser would giggle at Lat's animation for its droll, while another would locate a similar work amusing for its unpretentious scrutinize of society. For instance, Muliyadi alluded to a "Keluarga Si Mamat" strip distributed in 1972. Malaysia was confronting a deficiency of qualified physical instruction instructors at that point, and such obligations were frequently put on the shoulders of educators of different resources. Lat represented a corpulent educator who directed physical instruction session to his possible breakdown. Muliyadi recommended that the animation could be deciphered as a straightforward bother of the educator's predicament, a recommendation to look at the educational programs instructed (change physical training to a casual session), a comment on the lack of instructors, or all the more incredibly, an analysis of the administration's inability to keep the circumstance from occurring.
