The 2001 film "Lawfully Blonde" denoted a defining moment in Witherspoon's profession; she featured as Elle Woods, a style marketing real who chooses to turn into a law understudy so as to pursue her ex to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the job, "When I read "Lawfully Blonde", I resembled, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has an incredible beau. Gracious better believe it, she gets dumped. What difference does it make? Despite everything I detest her.' So we needed to ensure she was the sort of individual you can't despise." "Lawfully Blonde" was a film industry hit, earning US$96 million locally. Witherspoon's execution earned her applause from faultfinders as the press started alluding to her as "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert remarked, "Witherspoon easily vivified this material with daylight and speedy mind", and Salon.com noticed that "she [Witherspoon] depicts Elle's character perfectly". In the mean time, the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" finished up, "Witherspoon is a gifted humorist who can liven up a scene just by walking in loaded with enthusiasm and drive and she controls this unobtrusive little parody practically without any assistance." For her work, Witherspoon earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress selection and a MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.
