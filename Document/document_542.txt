Davison joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in November 1906. Framed in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst, the WSPU united the individuals who felt that activist, angry strategies were expected to accomplish their definitive objective of ladies' suffrage. Davison participated in the WSPU's crusading, and turned into an officer of the association and a central steward amid walks. In 1908 or 1909 she relinquished her profession educating and committed herself full-time to the association. She started taking progressively angry activities, which provoked Sylvia PankhurstÃ¢ÂÂthe girl of Emmeline and a full-time individual from the WSPUÃ¢ÂÂto portray her as "a standout amongst the most brave and heedless of the aggressors". In March 1909 she was captured out of the blue; she had been a piece of a nomination of 21 ladies who walked from Caxton Hall to see the head administrator, H. H. Asquith, the walk finished in a fracas with police, and she was captured for "ambushing the police in the execution of their obligation". She was condemned to a month in jail. After her discharge she wrote to "Votes in favor of Women", the WSPU's paper, saying that "Through my modest work in this noblest of all causes I have come into a totality of employment and an enthusiasm for living which I at no other time experienced."
