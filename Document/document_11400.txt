Altdorfer's essential perspective in his exploration was most likely Hartmann Schedel's "Nuremberg Chronicle" ("Schedelsche Weltchronik"), an outlined world history distributed in Nuremberg in 1493. Schedel was a doctor, humanist, history specialist and cartographer, and his "Annal" was one of the principal books created on the printing press. With an overwhelming dependence on the Bible, it relates the seven periods of mankind's history, from Creation to the introduction of Christ and closure with the Apocalypse. Altdorfer's measurements for the clash of Issus reflect those of Schedel. Besides, the mistakes in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are additionally present in "The Battle of Alexander at Issus": the island of Cyprus is perceptibly curiously large, and both the mountain ascend in the work of art's middle and the range contiguous the Nile don't exist. Since the "Annal" depicts Alexander's triumph over the Persians as far as its nearness to Tarsus and discards notice of Issus, almost certainly, the cityscape by the ocean is proposed to be the previous city instead of the last mentioned. Issus in the sixteenth century was minor and moderately obscure, though Tarsus was eminent for its having been a noteworthy focus of learning and rationality in Roman occasions. Bone structure was additionally said to be the origination of the Apostle Paul, which may clarify the nearness of the congregation towers in Altdorfer's depiction. Another source may have been the compositions of Quintus Curtius Rufus, a first century Roman history specialist who presents swelled figures for the quantity of slaughtered and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armed forces.
