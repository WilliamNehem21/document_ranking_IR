From Saltillo, the military had three options: advance along the coast on the Atascocita Road from Matamoros to Goliad, or walk on BÃÂ©xar from the south, along the Laredo street, or from the west, along the Camino Real. Santa Clause Anna requested General JosÃÂ© de Urrea to lead 550 troops to Goliad. Albeit a few of Santa Anna's officers contended that the whole armed force should progress along the coast, where supplies could be picked up through ocean, Santa Anna rather centered around BÃÂ©xar, the political focus of Texas and the site of Cos' thrashing. His brother by marriage surrender was viewed as a hit to the respect of his family and to Mexico; Santa Anna was resolved to reestablish both. Santa Clause Anna may likewise have thought BÃÂ©xar would be simpler to overcome, as his covert agents had educated him that the vast majority of the Texian armed force was along the coast, getting ready for the Matamoros Expedition. Santa Clause Anna drove the greater part of his men up the Camino Real to approach BÃÂ©xar from the west, puzzling the Texians, who had anticipated that any propelling troops should come closer from the south. On February 17, they crossed the Nueces River, authoritatively entering Texas.
