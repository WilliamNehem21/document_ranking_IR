The appendage bones are additionally strong. Inside Apatosaurinae, the scapula of "Apatosaurus louisae" is transitional in morphology between those of "A.ajax" and "Brontosaurus excelsus". The arm bones are heavy, so the humerus of "Apatosaurus" looks like that of "Camarasaurus", just as "Brontosaurus". Be that as it may, the humeri of "Brontosaurus" and "A.ajax" are more like each other than they are to "A.louisae". In 1936 Charles Gilmore noticed that past recreations of "Apatosaurus" forelimbs mistakenly suggested that the range and ulna could cross; in life they would have stayed parallel. "Apatosaurus" had a solitary huge paw on every forelimb, a component shared by all sauropods more inferred than "Shunosaurus". The initial three toes had hooks on every hindlimb. The phalangeal recipe is 2-1-1-1-1, which means the deepest finger (phalanx) on the forelimb has two bones and the following has one. The single manual paw bone (ungual) is somewhat bended and soundly truncated on the foremost end. The pelvic support incorporates the strong ilia, and the combined (co-hardened) pubes and ischia. The femora of "Apatosaurus" are extremely heavy and speak to probably the most powerful femora of any individual from Sauropoda. The tibia and fibula bones are unique in relation to the slim bones of "Diplodocus" however are almost vague from those of "Camarasaurus". The fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia. The foot of "Apatosaurus" has three paws on the deepest digits; the digit recipe is 3-4-5-3-2. The primary metatarsal is the stoutest, an element shared among diplodocids.
