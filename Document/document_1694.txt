"Stay in Light" includes new wave, post-punk, worldbeat, move shake, and distinctive sorts of funk, explicitly afrofunk and avant-funk. Commentator Stephen Thomas Erlewine depicted the collection as a "thick amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and consoles, pop melodies, and hardware." It contains eight tunes that have a "striking free-acquainted feel" as indicated by psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog, in that there is no durable intelligent manner of thinking that can be followed in the continuous flow verses. David Gans taught Byrne to be more liberated with his expressive substance by exhorting him that "balanced reasoning has its cutoff points". The frontman incorporated a reference index with the collection press pack alongside an explanation that clarified how the collection was motivated by African legends and rhythms. The discharge focused on that the real motivation to the verses was Professor John Miller Chernoff's "African Rhythm and African Sensibility", which inspected the melodic improvement of life in the mainland's country networks. The scholarly ventured out to Ghana in 1970 to think about local percussion and expounded on how Africans have confounded discussions through drum designs. One of the tunes, "The Great Curve", epitomizes the African topic by including the line "The world proceeds onward a lady's hips", which Byrne utilized in the wake of perusing Professor Robert Farris Thompson's book "African Art in Motion". He furthermore contemplated straight discourse, from John Dean's Watergate declaration to the tales of African American previous slaves.
