Tip soundness is influenced by water conditions. Tips 4, 5 and 7 had been sited on streams or springs. The nearness of the springs was basic learning in the region, and they had been set apart on the Ordnance Survey and Geological Society maps since 1874. Tip 4 at Aberfan, which had been utilized somewhere in the range of 1933 and 1945, was vast, and had been begun on boggy ground between two streams. At the season of its arranging, the Merthyr Tydfil precinct engineer believed that in spite of the position, it is probably not going to torrential slide. Following some ground developments in the tip in the mid 1940s, a seepage divert was delved in mid 1944. In November that year part of the tip slid down the mountain to stop roughly over the town. In May 1963 Tip 7 moved marginally; in November that year there was an increasingly considerable slide. The NCB expressed that the development had not been a "slide", however was rather a "tailings run"Ã¢ÂÂ a run-off of tailings from the outside of the tipÃ¢ÂÂwhich left its dependability unaffected. After the slide, the NCB quit tipping tailings on number 7, yet ordinary ruin kept on being saved.
