The composition style mirrors the creator's aim to utilize the content for an address arrangement. The portrayal tends to the gathering of people while directing it through clarifications of the issues and episodic delineations. Lewis' charming, expressive, and vivacious discourse style is reflected in the composition. The tone has been portrayed as noisy and enticing. One commentator called it "vintage Lewis Ã¢ÂÂ sharp analysis raised with high-blown talk". The book concentrates more upon certifiable human encounters, instead of numbers and insights, in talking about the impact of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the world's reaction. Lewis' onlooker accounts are real to life and distinctive. For instance, he relates voyages through medical clinics and schools as he clarifies the desperate straits of national wellbeing and training divisions, and he portrays gatherings with ambassadors and staff from the UN, World Bank, and IMF as he clarifies their impact on outside guide approaches. The book is composed from a hopeful point of view and, notwithstanding the outrage and hidden feeling of blame, Lewis stays idealistic. While he was an expert ambassador, his diary style reflections on explicit individuals, for example, Michel Camdessus, Carol Bellamy, and Thabo Mbeki were called undiplomatic. Regardless of the book's undiplomatic style, Lewis held his post as an UN Special Envoy until the term finished in December 2006.
