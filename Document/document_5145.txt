On 8ÃÂ January 1952, Susans drove the squadron on its first ground-assault mission in Meteors, which were furnished with eight rockets under the wings just as their four inward 20ÃÂ mm gun, at Chongdan. They kept on working basically in the ground-assault job until the finish of the war, yet enrolled two additional triumphs over MiGs close Pyongyang on 4ÃÂ and 8ÃÂ May 1952. The squadron participated in a mass air strike on 29ÃÂ August, when 420 UN air ship assaulted Pyongyang. One Meteor was shot down and another harmed by MiGs following a ground-assault mission on 2ÃÂ October 1952. The squadron assumed a main job in the pulverization of a substantial North Korean guard on 16ÃÂ March 1953: two Meteors found a line of approximately 140 vehicles in a mountain pass south of Wonsan, ended it by devastating trucks at the front and back of the caravan, and after that brought in further help from Kimpo and the USAF. The Australian air ship in the end guaranteed twenty-four trucks out of a sum of ninety vehicles crushed or harmed by UN powers. No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron was credited with bringing down its last MiG southeast of Pyongyang on 27ÃÂ March. Squadron Leader Len McGlinchey turned into its last wartime casualty when his Meteor slammed while taking off from Kimpo on 16ÃÂ July.
