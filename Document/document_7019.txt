At the point when the tradition suspended after the seventh ticket, Pillow, who had been trusting that an open door will squeeze Polk's name, consulted with George Bancroft of Massachusetts, a government official and antiquarian who was a long-term Polk journalist, and who had intended to assign Polk for VP. Bancroft had bolstered Van Buren's application, and was eager to see New York Senator Silas Wright head the ticket, yet Wright would not consider taking a designation that Van Buren needed. Pad and Bancroft chose if Polk were designated for president, Wright may acknowledge the second spot. Prior to the eighth vote, previous Attorney General Benjamin F. Steward, leader of the New York designation, read a pre-composed letter from Van Buren to be utilized in the event that he couldn't be named, pulling back to support Wright. Yet, Wright (who was in Washington) had likewise endowed a pre-composed letter to a supporter, in which he would not be considered as a presidential hopeful, and expressed in the letter that he concurred with Van Buren's situation on Texas. Had Wright's letter not been perused he in all probability would have been designated, yet without him, Butler started to rally Van Buren supporters for Polk as the most ideal applicant, and Bancroft put Polk's name before the tradition. On the eighth tally, Polk got just 44 votes to Cass' 114 and Van Buren's 104, yet the stop hinted at breaking. Head servant formally pulled back Van Buren's name, numerous assignments announced for the Tennessean, and on the ninth tally Polk got 233 tickets to Cass' 29, making him the Democratic chosen one for president. The selection was then made consistent.
