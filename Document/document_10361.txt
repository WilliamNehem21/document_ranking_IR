Gediminas' girl Elzbieta wedded WacÃÂaw of PÃÂock, one of the dukes of Masovia in current eastern Poland. Her second name is recorded in works by Maciej Stryjkowski as "Danmila" and Teodor Narbutt as "Damila". It has been proposed these names are misread forms of "DanutÃÂ", a name got from "Daniel". Another understanding is that history specialists confounded DanutÃÂ of Lithuania, girl of KÃÂstutis, with Elzbieta. As a collusion, the marriage was huge in light of the fact that entries to and from western Europe needed to go through Masovia; it very well may be viewed as an endeavor to restore Grand Duke Traidenis' and his girl Gaudemunda's connection with Masovia during the 1270s. The marriage's significance is verified by Elzbieta's share: 720 KrakÃÂ³w silver imprints and nine characteristics of gold Ã¢ÂÂ multiple times in excess of a normal recorded endowment of the time. This marriage most likely occurred around 1316, when Gediminas upheld WacÃÂaw amid a common war in the isolated Duchy of Masovia. After WacÃÂaw's demise in 1336, Elzbieta dealt with her own riches. She is referenced once and for all in 1361, when her sibling KÃÂstutis got away from Marienburg and looked for shelter at his sister's home; antiquarians put her date of death at around 1364. In 1337 Elzbieta's little girl Anna, first referenced in late 1323, wedded Henry of ÃÂ»agaÃÂ, in cutting edge western Poland. Her child BolesÃÂaw III or Bolko passed on without a male beneficiary in 1351 and his territory was partitioned among different dukes.
