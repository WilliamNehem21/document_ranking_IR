The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for "Dogs", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part "Pigs on the Wing". Wright commented: "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my materialÂ ... but Dave "did" have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there." Mason recalled: "Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward "Animals"; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. "Animals" is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: ""Animals" ...Â wasn't a fun record to makeÂ ... this was when Roger "really" started to believe that he was the sole writer for the bandÂ ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still goingÂ ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me."
