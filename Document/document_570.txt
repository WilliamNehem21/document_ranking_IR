Sandia's compound and materials examination gathering, headed by James Borders, researched further the hypothesis about a synthetic igniter. Naval force specialists expressed that the disclosure under the inside weapon's shot's pivoting band of moment steel-fleece strands that were encrusted with calcium and chlorine, a part of polyethylene terephthalate (generally utilized in plastic packs), and distinctive glycols, including brake liquid, hypochlorite, radiator fluid, and Brylcreem together showed the utilization of a concoction igniter. The Navy was unfit to find the steel-fleece fiber proof for Borders to inspect. No immaculate bits of the pivoting band remained and Sandia was furnished with a segment to look at that had just been analyzed by the FBI. Fringes' group analyzed the pivoting band and did not discover any hints of polyethylene terephthalate. The group found that the glycols present really originated from the Break-Free cleaning arrangement which had been dumped into the middle firearm's barrel to help free the shot after the blast. The group additionally discovered that calcium and chlorine were available in "Iowa"s other weapon turrets and in the firearm turrets of the other "Iowa"- class war vessels, and this was demonstrative of routine presentation to an oceanic situation. Fringes presumed that common sources represented the majority of the "outside materials" found by the Navy on the inside firearm shot, and that the hypothesis that a synthetic igniter had been utilized to cause the blast was incredibly far fetched.
