He ceases from a reliance on "shoddy, simple lines" that give minimal more profound knowledge; his mantra amid his initial grown-up dramatization profession was "no exhausting issues". "Eccentric as Folk" is the essential vehicle for his social discourse of homosexuality and advocation of more prominent acknowledgment. He utilized the arrangement to challenge the "basic ... gut intuition" of homophobia by acquainting gay symbolism interestingly with the hetero "essential picture of life, of family, of youth, [and] of survival". His next arrangement, "Bounce and Rose", inspected the issue of a gay man who begins to look all starry eyed at a lady, and the response of the couple's individual groups of friends. "Torchwood", in Davies' own words, is "an extremely indiscriminate program", and exhibits a liquid way to deal with both sex and sexuality "nearly from its opening minutes": for instance, the lead character Captain Jack Harkness apathetically specifies he was once pregnant; and later, the other lead characters talk about Jack's sexuality. The gay site AfterElton opined that "Torchwood"s greatest leap forward could be "eccentric portrayal" by indicating Captain Jack as a character whose promiscuity is investigated however not his solitary character quality.
