After the decay of the Cholas, Tiruchirappalli was vanquished by the Pandyas, who ruled from 1216 until their thrashing in 1311 by Malik Kafur, the officer of Allauddin Khilji. The successful multitudes of the Delhi Sultanate are accepted to have looted and assaulted the area. The icon of the Hindu god Ranganatha in the sanctuary of Srirangam disappeared at about this time and was not recuperated and reestablished for over fifty years. Tiruchirappalli was managed by the Delhi and Madurai sultanates from 1311 to 1378, however by the center of the fourteenth century the Madurai Sultanate had started to break apart. Step by step, the Vijayanagar Empire set up matchless quality over the northern pieces of the kingdom, and Tiruchirappalli was taken by the Vijayanagar sovereign Kumara Kampanna Udaiyar in 1371. The Vijayanagar Empire governed the area from 1378 until the 1530s, and assumed a noticeable job in restoring Hinduism by reproducing sanctuaries and landmarks wrecked by the past Muslim rulers. Following the breakdown of the Vijayanagar Empire in the early piece of the sixteenth century, the Madurai Nayak kingdom started to attest its autonomy. The city thrived amid the rule of Vishwanatha Nayak (c. 1529Ã¢ÂÂ 1564), who is said to have ensured the zone by developing the Teppakulam and building dividers around the Srirangam sanctuary. His successor Kumara Krishnappa Nayaka made Tiruchirappalli his capital, and it filled in as the capital of the Madurai Nayak kingdom from 1616 to 1634 and from 1665 to 1736.
