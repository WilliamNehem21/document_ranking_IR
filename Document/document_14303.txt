Other surely understood identities from the 12thÃÂ century incorporated a few Jain scholars. These incorporate Aggala, who composed "Chandraprabhapurana" (1189), a record of the life of the eighth Jain tirthankar Chandraprabha; Sujanottamsa, who composed a laudatory on Gomateshwara of Shravanabelagola; and Vritta Vilasa, who wrote "Sastra sara" and "Dharmaparikshe" (1160). The last was Vilasa's variant of the Sanskrit unique of a similar name composed by Amitagati c.ÃÂ 1014. In this "champu" composing, the creator portrays the tale of two Kshatriya princess who went to Benares and uncovered the indecencies of the divine beings after discourses with the brahmins there. The creator addresses the believability of Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god) and the Vanaras (monkey-like humanoids in the Hindu epic Ramayana). Albeit questionable, the work sheds helpful data on contemporary religious convictions. Kereya Padmarasa, a Veerashaiva artist belittled by King NarasimhaÃÂ I, expressed "Dikshabodhe" in the "ragale" meter in 1165. He would later turn into the hero of a personal work called "Padmarajapurana" composed by his relative Padmanaka in c.ÃÂ 1400. The brahmin artist Deva Kavi created a sentiment piece called "Kusumavali" (1200), and brahmin writer Kavi Kama (12thÃÂ century) composed a treatise called "Sringara-ratnakara" on the "rasa" (season) of poetical assumption. Sumanobana (1170) was a writer grammarian and the "Katakacharya" ("military educator") under King NarasimhaÃÂ I. He was likewise a minister in Devagiri, the Seuna Yadava capital.
