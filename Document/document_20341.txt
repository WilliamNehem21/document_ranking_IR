Pete Paphides, writing for "The Times", said that the songs were performed "with power and restraint" and that the "arrangements by Jon Cohen suggest some kind of aesthetic endeavour beyond the basic thing for which they exist". He compared it favourably to three other Mothering Sunday releases: Lionel Richie's "Just Go", Ronan Keating's "Songs for My Mother" and Barry Manilow's "The Greatest Songs of the Eighties". He awarded "Faryl" 3 out of a possible 5, the highest rating of the four. Retailers in the United Kingdom ordered more than 80,000 copies of the album in the week before release, which Simon Cable, writing for the "Daily Mail", noted was more copies than U2's recent "No Line on the Horizon". It also topped the Amazon.co.uk presale chart. On the day of the release the album was at the number one spot on the UK Albums Chart, based on presales alone. The album became the fastest-selling classical solo album in British history, selling 20,000 copies in the first four days. The previous record holder had been Hayley Westenra's "Pure". The first week resulted in sales of 29,200 copies, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. "Faryl" officially entered the charts at number six and rose to fourth place the next week. The success of the album left Smith the third "Britain's Got Talent" contestant to achieve a top ten album, after Potts (with "One Chance") and Johnston (with "One Voice").
