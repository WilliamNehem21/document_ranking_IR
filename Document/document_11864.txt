In 52 AD King Vologases I of Parthia accepted the open door to attack Armenia, vanquishing Artaxata ("Artashat" in Armenia) and announcing his more youthful sibling Tiridates I as ruler. This activity disregarded the bargain that had been marked by the Roman sovereign Augustus and Parthian lord Phraates IV which gave the Romans the unequivocal appropriate to designate and crown the rulers of Armenia. Vologases I considered the position of royalty of Armenia to have been previously the property of his precursors, presently usurped by an outside ruler in ideals of a wrongdoing. A winter plague just as an uprising started by his child Vardanes constrained him to pull back his troops from Armenia, permitting Rhadamistus to return and rebuff local people as deceivers; they in the end revolted and supplanted him with the ruler Tiridates I in mid 55. Rhadamistus got away alongside his better half Zenobia who was pregnant. Unfit to keep escaping, she requested that her better half take her life as opposed to be caught. Rhadamistus wounded her with a Median knife and flung her body into the waterway Araxes. Zenobia was not lethally harmed and was recouped by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates. Tiridates I got her generous and regarded her as an individual from the government. Rhadamistus himself came back to Iberia and was before long killed by his dad Pharasmanes I of Iberia for having plotted against the illustrious power.
