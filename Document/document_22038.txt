On 15 March 1944, BÃ¤r, now a "Major" and rehabilitated from the demotion, was given command of II./"Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JGÂ 1). This was after the death of Hauptmann Hermann Segatz on 8 March 1944. JGÂ 1 was tasked with "Reichsverteidigung" (Defense of the Reich) and equipped with the Focke Wulf 190 A-7 fighter. Morale of the group soared following his appointment. He was considered the unofficial leader of the group and the best officer in the entire "Geschwader". On 11 April 1944, BÃ¤r achieved his 199th aerial victory over a B-17 near Fallersleben. His 200th aerial victory, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator, was claimed on 22 April accompanied by his regular wingman Warrant Officer ("Oberfeldwebel") Leo Schuhmacher, who would be awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 March 1945 as a fighter pilot in II./JGÂ 1. BÃ¤r had just landed at StÃ¶rmede airfield from a II./JGÂ 1 intercept when a smoking United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24 of the 458th Bombardment Group passed overhead. BÃ¤r and his wingman quickly got into their aircraft and intercepted the B-24. The bomber's gunners had already bailed out of the aircraft, making it an easy aerial victory. BÃ¤r returned to StÃ¶rmede airfield to the congratulations of his men. This double century victory earned BÃ¤r his third and final reference in the "Wehrmachtbericht" on 24 April 1944. After Oesau's death on 11 May 1944, BÃ¤r was made acting Wing Commander of JGÂ 1. In June, he was appointed Wing Commander of "Jagdgeschwader" 3 (JGÂ 3) following the death of Friedrich-Karl MÃ¼ller. By the end of 1944, BÃ¤r's score had risen to 203.
