On 25â26 September, "ThÃ¼ringen" and the rest of I Squadron covered an advance conducted by the second commander of the torpedo-boat flotillas (II "FÃ¼hrer der Torpedoboote") to the Terschelling Bank. Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18â20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank, though rudder damage prevented "ThÃ¼ringen" from participating. For the majority of 1917, "ThÃ¼ringen" was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During Operation Albion, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, "ThÃ¼ringen" and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on the 29th. On 2 November the operation was completed and "ThÃ¼ringen" and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23â24 April 1918. "ThÃ¼ringen", "Ostfriesland", and "Nassau" were formed into a special unit for Operation "SchluÃstein", a planned occupation of St. Petersburg. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.
