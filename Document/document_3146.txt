The scene nears the end with "What would be an ideal next step?", as the Scoobies stand entranced and perplexed, confronting diverse bearings. As they sing "Comprehend we'll go connected at the hip/But we'll walk alone in dread", they line up, clasp hands, at that point hurl each other's hands away in a bit of what Whedon calls "exacting movement". Every one of the eight characters in this line wears a shading in the noticeable range, a cognizant choice by the outfit planner. The couples in the gathering wear inverse hues (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox deciphers the shading coding and movement to speak to the "strain between the individual and the gathering". The characters as a chorale sing "The drapes close on a kiss, God knows/We can tell the end is close", minutes before Buffy heads out to kiss Spike and the show closes with real window ornaments. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music goes with them, like the closure of "Run with the Wind". Verses sung minutes prior, be that as it may, estimate the vulnerability of the connection among Spike and Buffy, just as their differentiating purposes behind starting any sentiment; Spike needs to feel love from Buffy, while she essentially needs to feel.
