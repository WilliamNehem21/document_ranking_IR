In 2002, Crawley, Anderson, Kiersten Clark, and their colleagues conducted another study on the effects of "Blue's Clues", this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension, but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of "Blue's Clues" interacted more with other children's TV shows and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from "Blue's Clues" could be transferred to other shows. They found that although experienced viewers of "Blue's Clues" interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, "It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so." The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them. They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend to pay more attention to novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. The researchers predicted that since shows like "Blue's Clues" help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and provide them with a lifelong love of learning.
