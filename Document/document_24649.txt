After struggling for a breakthrough in film, Chastain had six releases in 2011, and received wide recognition for several of them. The first of the roles was as the wife of Michael Shannon's character in Jeff Nichols' "Take Shelter", a drama about a troubled father who tries to protect his family from what he believes is an impending storm. The film was screened at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, and critic Tim Robey of "The Daily Telegraph" noted how much Chastain's supporting part aided the narrative. In "Coriolanus", an adaptation of the Shakespearian tragedy from actor-director Ralph Fiennes, Chastain played Virgilia. Her next role was opposite Brad Pitt, as the loving mother of three children in Terrence Malick's experimental drama "The Tree of Life", which she had filmed in 2008. Chastain signed on to the film without receiving a traditional screenplay from Malick, and she improvised several scenes and dialogues with Pitt. She considered her part to be "the embodiment of grace and the spirit world"; in preparation, she practiced meditation, studied paintings of the Madonna, and read poems by Thomas Aquinas. The film premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival to a polarized reception from the audience, although it was praised by critics and won the Palme d'Or. Justin Chang of "Variety" termed the film a "hymn to the glory of creation, an exploratory, often mystifying [...] poem" and credited Chastain for playing her part with "heartrending vulnerability".
