For a long time it was accepted that Monteverdi had composed a significant part of the music for "Licori" before its abrupt retraction; Redlich says the music was done by 10 September 1627. The work's dismissal and consequent vanishing have been accused on Striggio's negligence for Monteverdi's endeavors. Be that as it may, Tomlinson's perusing of the correspondence proposes an alternate end: Monteverdi, in his view, "did not verge on finishing the score" and may have composed next to no of the music. All things considered, he quit making toward the end out of July, having turned out to be suspicious of Striggio's actual duty to the work. Tomlinson proposes that, aware of Mantua's prior crossing out of "Le nozze di Tetide", Monteverdi abstained from broadening himself on the new task, while keeping up a conciliatory impression of movement. Tomlinson states: "[I]t would barely be astonishing if Monteverdi were supernaturally delicate to indications of Mantuan instability [and] if, at the principal such signs in 1627, he chose to move warily in the sythesis of "Licori"." Strozzi's lyrics has evaporated alongside whatever music Monteverdi figured out how to compose, however Strozzi composed a second lyrics under a similar name, which was set by Francesco Sacrati and delivered in Venice in 1641.
