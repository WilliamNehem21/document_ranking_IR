This stretch of USÂ 41 runs north through the western edge of the Hiawatha National Forest. At Trenary, USÂ 41 turns northwest through the southwest corner of Alger County, crossing into Marquette County north of Kiva. M-94 follows USÂ 41 for approximately near Skandia, before it turns westward to provide access to K. I. Saywer, a former air force base. USÂ 41 continues northerly into the Chocolay Township community of Harvey. It meets the eastern junction with M-28 in Harvey, and the two highways run concurrent for nearly , during which they follow the Lake Superior Circle Tour.
USÂ 41/M-28 runs north along the Lake Superior shoreline, passing the Marquette Branch Prison and crossing the Carp River before cresting Shiras Hill on the way into the city of Marquette, entering town on Front Street. South of downtown, the highway turns west on the Marquette Bypass, a four-lane expressway complete with two overpasses. The bypass moves traffic around the former routing of USÂ 41/M-28 along Front and Washington streets, a routing that was used for Business USÂ 41 (Bus. USÂ 41) until 2005. West of Washington Street, USÂ 41/M-28 follows a heavily trafficked business corridor. The 2006 average annual daily traffic (AADT, the yearly traffic count divided by 365) along this corridor ranged from 31,700 to 34,700Â vehicles. USÂ 41/M-28 climbs hilly terrain into the cities of Negaunee and Ishpeming, running west and slightly south. The two cities host Bus. M-28, which was once designated as ALTÂ USÂ 41 as well. Between the twin cities, USÂ 41/M-28 skirts the shores of Teal Lake in Negaunee and then narrows to two lanes west of Ishpeming.
