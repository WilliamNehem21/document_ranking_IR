Advancement on a fifth film in the "Outsider" establishment was in advancement by 2002. Scott considered coming back to the arrangement he made with his 1979 sci-fi blood and gore movie "Outsider", to seek after a continuation that would investigate the designed inceptions of the arrangement's Alien animals, and the "space racer"Ã¢ÂÂ the extraterrestrial being, who quickly shows up in "Outsider", as the expired pilot of a neglected spaceship. "Outsider" star Sigourney Weaver likewise communicated enthusiasm for coming back to the arrangement. "Outsiders" chief James Cameron talked about the potential for a continuation with Scott, and started working with another essayist on a story for the film. It was then that twentieth Century Fox drew nearer Cameron with a content for a hybrid film that would set the arrangement's beasts against the title characters of the "Predator" films; this venture turned into the 2004 sci-fi film "Outsider versus Predator". After Fox affirmed that it would seek after the hybrid, Cameron quit chipping away at his very own undertaking, trusting the hybrid would "murder the legitimacy of the establishment." In 2006, Cameron affirmed that he would not come back to the "Outsider" continuation venture, trusting that the arrangement was Fox's benefit, and he was reluctant to manage the studio's endeavors to impact the potential spin-off.
