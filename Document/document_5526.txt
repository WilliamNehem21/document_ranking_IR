The Spanish Ministry of Defense consented to modernize the Army's AMX-30Es in 1987 and distributed 16ÃÂ billion pesetas (155ÃÂ million dollars) to the program. From , the Army overhauled its whole AMX-30E armada to EM1 and EM2 norms. This overhauled program represented a danger to the Lince program. Around a similar time, the Spanish government communicated enthusiasm for securing American M60 Patton tanks that were being resigned from Central Europe, as per the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. In October and November, the Spanish government started to consult for 400 to 500 M60A1 and M60A3 tanks, and intended to overhaul its obtained M60A1 tanks to M60A3 guidelines. In December, the United States consented to exchange 532 M60A1 and M60A3 tanks to supplant Spain's M47s and M48s. In the wake of getting 50 of the 272 A1s, Spain dropped acquisition of these tanks and selected to get just the 260 M60A3s. As a result of the modernisation of the AMX-30, the choice to supplant more established Patton tanks with the M60A3 and Krauss-Maffei's analysis of the administration of the indigenous tank program, the Lince was dropped in 1989. The board issues in Santa BÃÂ¡rbara Sistemas likewise had an influence, including yearly contrary adjusts and the decrease of production line work force. Notwithstanding, dissimilar to the arranged Lince, the M60s just fulfilled Spain's prompt need to modernize the Army's tank armada for the time being. They were not a long haul modernisation arrangement as Spain's M47s and M48s had just been moved up to reciprocals of the M60.
