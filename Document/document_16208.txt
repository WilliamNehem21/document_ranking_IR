According to Nicholson, "Agharta" and other jazz-rock recordings such as "Emergency!" (1970) by the Tony Williams Lifetime suggested the genre was progressing toward "a whole new musical languageÂ ... a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before". This development dwindled with the commercialism of jazz in the 1980s, although "Agharta" remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s, especially on artists in the experimental rock genre. It became one of the favorite albums for English musician Richard H. Kirk, who recalled playing the record often while working at Chris Watson's loft during their early years in the band Cabaret Voltaire. "I can see how this album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal", Kirk later told "The Quietus". Along with "On the Corner", it was also a major influence on the Beastie Boys' 1994 album "Ill Communication". In 1998, composer and bandleader David Sanford completed his dissertation on "Agharta" as a doctoral student in composition at Princeton University. In it, he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences "to evolve or modernize itself". In an interview several years later, Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the "fringes of jazz" and a place most other music has not explored since. In the "All Music Guide to Jazz" (2002), Thom Jurek considered the album inarguably the "greatest electric funk-rock jazz record ever" and declared, "there is simply nothing like "Agharta" in the canon of recorded music."
