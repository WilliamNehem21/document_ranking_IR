In spring 669, subsequent to accepting extra troops, Fadhala entered Asia Minor and progressed similar to Chalcedon, on the Asian shore of the Bosporus opposite the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Arab assaults on Chalcedon were repulsed, and the Arab armed force was pulverized by starvation and infection. Mu'awiya dispatched another military, driven by his child (and future Caliph) Yazid, to Fadhala's guide. Records of what pursued contrast. The Byzantine recorder Theophanes the Confessor reports that the Arabs stayed before Chalcedon for some time before coming back to Syria, and that on their way they caught and garrisoned Amorium. This was the first run through the Arabs attempted to hold a caught stronghold in the inside of Asia Minor past the battling season, and likely implied that the Arabs proposed to return one year from now and utilize the town as their base, however Amorium was retaken by the Byzantines amid the consequent winter. Middle Easterner sources then again report that the Muslims traversed into Europe and propelled an ineffective assault on Constantinople itself, before coming back to Syria. Given the absence of any notice of such a strike in Byzantine sources, it is most plausible that the Arab writersÃ¢ÂÂassessing Yazid's quality and the way that Chalcedon is a suburb of ConstantinopleÃ¢ÂÂ"redesigned" the assault on Chalcedon to an assault on the Byzantine capital itself.
