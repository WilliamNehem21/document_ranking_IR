With respect to why Proba masterminded in the ballad in any case, researchers are as yet isolated. The Latinist R. P. H. Green contends that the work was a response to the Roman ruler Julian's law precluding Christians from instructing writing that they didn't accept to be valid (or, in other words, established Greek and Latin folklore). Proba's objective, Green composes, was to exhibit Virgil "without [pagan] divine beings, and [thus] a [Virgil] no longer defenseless against Christian analysis". Along these lines, a Christian instructor could utilize the content to examine Virgil without trading off their religious and good respectability. Clark and Hatch, then again, propose that Jesus' Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's endeavor to counter the unflattering, vilifying depictions of Jesus in Julian's "Caesares" and "Contra Galilaeos". They reason that the theory is charming yet strange because of the absence of data about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her aims. At long last, the classicist Aurelio Amatucci recommends that Proba made the cento to show her kids stories from the Bible, in spite of the fact that there is no strong proof that the ballad was ever planned to be an educating apparatus.
