Kelley reintroduced the bill in the House when Congress reconvened in December 1871. Administrator Kelley was from Philadelphia, and was affected by industrialist Joseph Wharton, who claimed a nickel refinery in adjacent Camden, New Jersey, from which the Mint bought, without aggressive offering, a significant part of the metal for the three-penny and five-penny base metal coins. The bill around then suggested that the penny, at that point made of bronze, be made of nickel combination tooÃ¢ÂÂwhen it was bantered on January 9, 1872, Wharton's advantage was a quick target. Kelley was tested by New York Representative Clarkson Potter, who called the bill "this Pennsylvania invention" which would give "a syndication to the man of honor in Pennsylvania [Wharton]." Another New Yorker, Dwight Townsend, moved to leave the bill in disturb over to what extent it was taking to pass; his movement on voice vote would have succeeded, yet there was no majority and it flopped on a move call vote. On January 10, Missouri Congressman James R. McCormick, who spoke to nickel makers in his home state, presented an alteration for aggressive offering for nickel buys by the Mint. Instead of acquiesce to McCormick's correction, Kelley sent the bill back to board of trustees.
