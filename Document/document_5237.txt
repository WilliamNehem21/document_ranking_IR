As the amusement opens, Naija has lost practically every last bit of her recollections, and is unconscious of the world outside of her home as she "lives as a straightforward animal". The player is told this in voice-over portrayals as a story told by a future Naija. These portrayals fill in as the essential wellspring of data about Naija all through the diversion, however there are incidental cutscenes. In the wake of being stood up to by a shadowy figure and being demonstrated a progression of flashbacks she doesn't comprehend, Naija stirs. Feeling dejection as the main individual from her species, Naija chooses to investigate her general surroundings. As the player investigates, Naija finds increasingly more about the historical backdrop of the world, "Aquaria", and about her very own past. The player isn't compelled to experience the plotline in a set grouping. The main restricting component is physical hindrances, for example, zones that must be gotten to by utilizing a particular structure. Blends of these physical confinements place some plot components later in the amusement. The story for most of the amusement is fixated on Naija's investigation of a progression of destroyed human advancements that she finds, each with an extensive beast in them. These human advancements make up the diverse locales of the amusement.
