Initially named "Netjer-isut-Menkauhor" by the Ancient Egyptians, signifying "The perfect spots of Menkauhor", the pyramid is referred to today as Lepsius XXIX after the number given to it by the prehistorian Karl Richard Lepsius who found the pyramid in 1843. Inferable from the destroyed condition of the structure, it is referred to in Arabic as the "Headless Pyramid", a name that has been held. The pyramid was lost under moving sands in the mid twentieth century and its attribution to Menkauhor was thusly discussed. Rather, it was recommended that the Headless Pyramid was that of Merikare, a structure dating to the First Intermediate Period and which still can't seem to be found. In 2008, the structure recognized by Lepsius was rediscovered by a group of archeologists under the bearing of Zahi Hawass, and unearthings at the site immediately settled a Fifth Dynasty date as demonstrated by the development systems utilized in its creation. In spite of the fact that the unearthings neglected to yield the name of the lord who constructed the pyramid, Menkauhor was the last pharaoh of the tradition whose pyramid stayed unfamiliar. In this way, continuing by disposal, archeologists and egyptologists have formally perceived the Headless Pyramid as that of Menkauhor.
