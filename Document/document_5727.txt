At first Albert was not mainstream with the British open; he was seen to be from a ruined and undistinguished minor state, scarcely bigger than a little English province. The British Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, prompted the Queen against allowing her significant other the title of "Ruler Consort"; Parliament likewise protested Albert being made a companionÃ¢ÂÂsomewhat in view of hostile to German slant and a longing to avoid Albert from any political job. Albert's religious perspectives gave a little measure of contention when the marriage was bantered in Parliament: despite the fact that as an individual from the Lutheran Evangelical Church Albert was a Protestant, the non-Episcopal nature of his congregation was viewed as troubling. Of more prominent concern, nonetheless, was that a portion of Albert's family were Roman Catholic. Melbourne drove a minority government and the restriction exploited the marriage to debilitate his position further. They restricted the ennoblement of Albert and allowed him a littler annuity than past consorts, ÃÂ£30,000 rather than the typical ÃÂ£50,000. Albert guaranteed that he had no need of a British peerage, expressing: "It would nearly be a stage downwards, for as a Duke of Saxony, I feel myself a lot higher than a Duke of York or Kent." For the following seventeen years, Albert was formally titled "HRH Prince Albert" until, on 25 June 1857, Victoria formally allowed him the title Prince Consort.
