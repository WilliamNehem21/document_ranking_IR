The RUF kept on progressing, bringing about sporadic encounters with UNAMSIL and government powers, until on 17 May they came into direct contact with British powers. The Pathfinder Platoon had positioned itself at Lungi Lol, a town north of Freetown near Lungi air terminal, and soon after were gone up against by a gathering of RUF individuals. The subsequent arrangement of firefights kept going a few hours, after which the RUF pulled back, having endured 30 setbacks. As indicated by Richards, the British accomplishment in the encounter gave a "massive" mental triumph and a hindrance against further assaults. Foday Sankoh, pioneer of the RUF, was caught later that day by powers faithful to President Kabbah and gave over to the Sierra Leone Police, yet must be emptied by a RAF Chinook after an antagonistic group accumulated outside the structure in which he was held. Sankoh's catch made a power vacuum at the highest point of the RUF and the consequent in-battling gave a chance to the MoD to arrange a revolution of powers conveyed in Sierra Leone. The 1 PARA battlegroup was requested back to the United Kingdom to continue its initiate job as the perpetual remain by force that would shape the premise of any crisis sending, while 42 Commando, Royal Marines, came aground to supplant the warriors.
