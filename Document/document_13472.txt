In 2003, Nesbitt played covert police analyst Tommy Murphy in the main arrangement of "Murphy's Law", subsequent to featuring in an effective pilot scene in 2001. The arrangement was considered when Nesbitt was chipping away at "Playing the Field"; he and maker Greg Brenman moved toward creator Colin Bateman about making a TV arrangement for Nesbitt in a comparable vein to Bateman's Dan Starkey books. Bateman and Nesbitt were at that point very much familiar; Nesbitt had been considered for a principle job in "Separating from Jack" (David Caffrey, 1998), in light of Bateman's unique novel. An hour and a half pilot of "Murphy's Law" was appointed by the BBC, at first as a "parody activity experience". Bateman made a complex backstory for Murphy, which was cut in line with the makers. After the communicate of the pilot, "Watchman" pundit Gareth McLean stated, "the affable James Nesbitt turned in a solid, incredibly watchable focal execution, however once in a while did he look exhausted by his endeavors, and his science with [Claudia] Harrison was promising and once in a while electric." In 2003, Nesbitt won the Irish Film and Television Award (IFTA) for Best Actor in a TV Drama for the job. The second arrangement was communicated in 2004.
