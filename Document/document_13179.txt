In the eighth century, Mercia was the most dominant kingdom in southern England, however in the early ninth Wessex ended up prevailing. During the 820s King Egbert of Wessex vanquished south-east England (Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Essex). His rule saw the start of Viking assaults, however Egbert and his child ÃÂthelwulf, who prevailing in 839, had the capacity to oppose them. ÃÂthelwulf kicked the bucket in 858, and he was trailed by four children in progression. Ruler ÃÂthelbald kicked the bucket in 860, and King ÃÂthelberht in 865; ÃÂthelwold's dad, ÃÂthelred, at that point prevailing to the position of royalty. Around the same time the Viking Great Heathen Army attacked England. Inside five years they had vanquished Northumbria and East Anglia, and constrained Mercia to pay them off. In late 870 the Vikings attacked Wessex, and in mid 871 they battled armed forces under ÃÂthelred and Alfred in four fights with hardly a pause in between, the last two of which Wessex lost. ÃÂthelred kicked the bucket soon after Easter that year, leaving youthful children. Primogeniture was not set up in this period, and it was trusted that rulers ought to be grown-ups, so he was prevailing by his more youthful sibling Alfred.
