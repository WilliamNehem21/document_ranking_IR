The span of the RAAF was set at 53 squadrons and the RAN was constrained to the boats which were in administration or wanted to be worked at the time. In mid 1944 everything except two of the Army's divisions were pulled back to the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland for preparing and restoration. A few new legions of Australian-drove Papuan and New Guinea troops were framed amid 1944 and sorted out into the Pacific Islands Regiment, in any case, and generally supplanted the Australian Army units disbanded amid the year. These troops had seen activity nearby Australian units all through the New Guinea battle.
