A few commentators have called "The Good Terrorist"s title an ironic expression. Robert Boschman proposed it is demonstrative of Alice's "conflicting identity" Ã¢ÂÂ she redesigns the squat's home, yet is set on devastating society. In "The Hudson Review", George Kearns composed that the title "drifts over the novel withÃÂ ... incongruity". The peruser accept that Alice is the "great psychological oppressor", yet that while she might be a decent individual, she is "spoiled at being a fear monger". Writing in "World Literature Today", Mona Knapp presumed that Lessing's champion, the "great fear based oppressor", is neither a decent individual, nor a decent progressive. She realizes how to remodel houses and control individuals further bolstering her good fortune, yet she is jobless and takes cash from her folks. At the point when genuine progressives begin utilizing the squat to send arms, she freezes and, going behind her confidants' backs, makes a phone call to the experts to caution them. Knapp called Alice "an awful psychological militant and a hindered individual". Fishburn proposed that it is Lessing herself who is the "great psychological oppressor", symbolized here by Alice, yet that hers is "political fear mongering of an artistic kind", where she as often as possible camouflages her thoughts in "exceptionally household looking fiction", and "direct[ly] challenge[s]ÃÂ ... our feeling of the real world".
