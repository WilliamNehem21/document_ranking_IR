A few wooly mammoth examples show proof of being butchered by people, which is demonstrated by breaks, cut stamps, and related stone instruments. How much ancient people depended on wooly mammoth meat is obscure, since numerous other vast herbivores were accessible. Numerous mammoth bodies may have been searched by people instead of chased. Some cavern artistic creations show wooly mammoths in structures deciphered as entanglement traps. Hardly any examples show immediate, unambiguous proof of having been chased by people. A Siberian example with an initiate inserted in its shoulder bone demonstrates that a lance had been tossed at it with incredible power. An example from the Mousterian time of Italy indicates proof of lance chasing by Neanderthals. The adolescent example nicknamed "Yuka" is the principal solidified mammoth with proof of human communication. It demonstrates proof of having been executed by a substantial predator, and of having been rummaged by people not long after. A portion of its bones had been expelled, and were discovered close-by. A site close to the Yana River in Siberia has uncovered a few examples with proof of human chasing, however the finds were translated to demonstrate that the creatures were not chased seriously, yet maybe fundamentally when ivory was required. Two wooly mammoths from Wisconsin, the "Schaefer" and "Hebior mammoths", show proof of having been butchered by Palaeoamericans.
