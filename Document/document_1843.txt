After the Terhunes kicked the bucket, Sunnybank gradually disintegrated, with the house and a great part of the grounds wrecked. Substantial pieces of the property were sold by the Albert Payson Terhune, Inc, an association set up in the wills of Bert and Anice Terhune to give assets to an altruistic association, the Terhune Foundation. The last ten sections of land of the property were in the end sold to a lodging designer, which incorporated the house, the graves of the Terhune collies and the mutts' old pet hotels. In 1967, this outstanding lump of Sunnybank was censured by Wayne Township. The following year, the township made the rest of the sections of land a chronicled park, Terhune Memorial Park. The Van Riper-Hopper Historic House Museum, found a few miles away, shows Terhune's compositions, the honors won by the Sunnybank collies and other memorabilia. The graves of Lad, Lady, Wolf and the other Sunnybank hounds are saved there and accessible for survey by guests. Clippings of Lad's jacket are put away at the Library of Congress, having been given by Anice. Yearly social occasions to Sunnybank are sorted out by the Collie Health Foundation on the third end of the week in August, amid which speakers acquainted with Terhune and his mutts talk, courses and visits are directed and different collie-centered occasions and rivalries are led. In 2005, Marilyn R. Horowitz distributed a Sunnybank date-book, the returns of which were utilized by the Terhune Sunnybank Memorial to reestablish Lad's grave, which had fallen into decay, and to help in keeping up the grounds of Sunnybank.
