Palairet was chosen for the college cricket group amid his first year at Oxford, and made his top of the line debut against the visiting Australians in May 1890. Palairet scored six and nothing and took one wicket in the match which Australia won by an innings. In his next match, Palairet improved, top-scoring for Oxford in their first innings against the Gentlemen with his first 50 years in top of the line cricket, 54 runs batting at number eight. He just passed 50 keeps running in one different innings for Oxford that late spring, a score of 72 against the MCC, and in all counterparts for the college that season scored 285 keeps running at a normal of 19.00. Batting midpoints in 1890 were lower than expected because of the poor climate, and Palairet's normal put him fourth among Oxford's group; his 285-run all out was the group's second most noteworthy total. Palairet won his BlueÃ¢ÂÂthe granting of the Oxford "hues" to sportsmenÃ¢ÂÂby showing up in the 1890 University coordinate against Cambridge, a diversion in which he had little achievement. Somerset played thirteen matches in the season, won twelve of them and tied the other. Palairet played in ten of these amusements, and on his first appearance scored a century against Leicestershire. Somerset's accomplishments prompted their admission to top notch cricket for 1891.
