The writer Thomas Hood, in his own diary, composed that "If Christmas, with its old and affable traditions, its social and magnanimous observances, were ever in risk of rot, this is the book that would give them another rent." The commentator for "Tait's Edinburgh Magazine"Ã¢ÂÂ Theodore Martin, who was normally reproachful of Dickens' workÃ¢ÂÂsaid favorable things about "A Christmas Carol", taking note of it was "an honorable book, finely felt and determined to work much social great". After Dickens' passing, Margaret Oliphant regretted the turkey and plum pudding parts of the book yet conceded that in the times of its first production it was viewed as "another gospel" and noticed that the book was one of a kind in that it influenced individuals to act better. The religious press commonly disregarded the story in any case, in January 1884, "Christian Remembrancer" thought the story's old and worn out subject was treated in a unique way and adulated the creator's comical inclination and emotion. The essayist and social mastermind John Ruskin told a companion that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had envisioned it as "mistletoe and pudding Ã¢ÂÂ neither restoration from the dead, nor ascending of new stars, nor instructing of savvy men, nor shepherds".
