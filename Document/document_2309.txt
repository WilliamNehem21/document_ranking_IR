The site had been based upon at any rate as ahead of schedule as the sixteenth century, when the bequest was called Well Street. The starting point of the name is the Chart Well, a spring toward the north of the present house, Chart being an Old English word for unpleasant ground. Henry VIII was rumored to have remained in the house amid his romance of Anne Boleyn at close-by Hever Castle. Components of the Tudor house are as yet noticeable, the Historic England posting for Chartwell takes note of that sixteenth (or potentially seventeenth) century brickwork can be found in a portion of the outer dividers. In the seventeenth and eighteenth hundreds of years, the house was utilized as a farmhouse and its proprietorship was liable to visit change. In 1848, it was bought by John Campbell Colquhoun, a previous MP; the Campbell Colquhouns were a group of Scottish landowners, legal advisors and legislators. The first farmhouse was amplified and altered amid their possession, including the expansion of the ventured peaks, a Scottish baronial genuflection to the place that is known for their dads. When of the deal to Churchill, it was, in the expressions of Oliver Garnett, writer of the 2008 manual to the house, a case of "Victorian engineering in any event appealing, a heavy red-block nation manor of tile-hung peaks and poky oriel windows".
