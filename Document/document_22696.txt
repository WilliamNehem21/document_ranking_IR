Conflicting reports have been made as to its preferred habitat; two papers suggest it preferred channels to floodplains, but another suggests it preferred the opposite. The possible preference for channels is based on the relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones, representing channel environments, in comparison to mudstones, representing floodplain environments. No bonebeds or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported. Dale Russell, in a popular work, noted that "Thescelosaurus" was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to bald cypress, to ferns and ginkgos. Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, "Thescelosaurus" skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a "Thescelosaurus" died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization. Russell tentatively compared it to the capybaras and tapirs. Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the ceratopsids "Triceratops" and "Torosaurus", hadrosaurid "Edmontosaurus", ankylosaurid "Ankylosaurus", pachycephalosaurian "Pachycephalosaurus", and the theropods "Ornithomimus", "Troodon", and "Tyrannosaurus". "Thescelosaurus" was also abundant in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of "Triceratops" and "Edmontosaurus", and it may have been the most common dinosaur there in life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals.
