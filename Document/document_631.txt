Physicist Isidor Rabi saw Oppenheimer's unsettling triumphalism: "I'll always remember his walk; I'll always remember the manner in which he ventured out of the carÃÂ ... his walk resembled "High Noon"ÃÂ ... this sort of swagger. He had done it." At a gathering at Los Alamos on August 6 (the night of the nuclear shelling of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer made that big appearance and fastened his hands together "like a prize-winning fighter" while the group cheered. He noticed his lament the weapon had not been accessible so as to use against Nazi Germany. Be that as it may, he and huge numbers of the venture staff were very vexed about the shelling of Nagasaki, as they didn't feel the second bomb was vital from a military perspective. He made a trip to Washington on August 17 to hand-convey a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson communicating his aversion and his desire to see atomic weapons restricted. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was allowed a meeting with President Harry S. Truman. The gathering, in any case, went severely, after Oppenheimer commented he believed he had "blood staring me in the face". The comment enraged Truman and put a conclusion to the gathering. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson "I would prefer not to see that bastard in this office until kingdom come."
