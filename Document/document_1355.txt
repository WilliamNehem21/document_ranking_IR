Rabi was designated an individual from the Science Advisory Committee (SAC) of the Office of Defense Mobilization in 1952, filling in as its administrator from 1956 to 1957. This agreed with the Sputnik emergency. President Dwight Eisenhower met with the SAC on 15 October 1957, to look for counsel on conceivable US reactions to the Soviet satellite achievement. Rabi, who knew Eisenhower from the last's time as leader of Columbia, was the first to talk, and set forward a progression of recommendations, one of which was to fortify the advisory group so it could give the President auspicious exhortation. This was done, and the SAC turned into the President's Science Advisory Committee half a month later. He likewise turned into Eisenhower's Science Advisor. In 1956 Rabi went to the Project Nobska against submarine fighting meeting, where talk extended from oceanography to atomic weapons. He filled in as the US Representative to the NATO Science Committee at the time that the expression "programming designing" was authored.
