Having succeeded Anderson at Louisville, Sherman currently had chief military duty regarding Kentucky, an outskirt state in which Confederate troops held Columbus and Bowling Green and were available close to the Cumberland Gap. He turned out to be exceedingly critical about the viewpoint for his order and he whined every now and again to Washington, D.C. about deficiencies while giving misrepresented evaluations of the quality of the renegade powers. Basic press reports showed up about him after an October visit to Louisville by the secretary of war, Simon Cameron, and toward the beginning of November 1861 Sherman demanded that he be alleviated. He was speedily supplanted by Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell and exchanged to St. Louis, Missouri. In December, he was put on leave by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, leader of the Department of the Missouri, who thought him unqualified for obligation. Sherman went to Lancaster, Ohio, to recover. While he was at home, his significant other Ellen kept in touch with his sibling, Senator John Sherman, looking for counsel. She grumbled of "that despairing madness to which your family is subject". Sherman later composed that the worries of order "separated me", and he conceded thinking about suicide. His issues were exacerbated when the "Cincinnati Commercial" portrayed him as "crazy".
