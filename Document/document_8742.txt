The rough looking bat ("Myotis mystacinus") and comparative species in Eurasia (by and large known as "unshaven bats") are hard to recognize from one another; for instance, the indirectly related Brandt's bat ("Myotis brandtii") was not perceived as particular from "M.ÃÂ mystacinus" until the 1970s. Little, bizarre "M.ÃÂ mystacinus"- like bats were first recorded in Greece during the 1970s, yet it was not until the approach of hereditary examinations that these bats could be affirmed as speaking to a particular animal groups, named "Myotis alcathoe". In 2001, the species was depicted by German zoologists Otto von Helversen and Klaus-Gerhard Heller based on examples from Greece and Hungary. Despite the fact that it likewise varies from other rough looking bats by morphological characters, "Myotis alcathoe" is most plainly unmistakable in its hereditary qualities, including DNA groupings and the area of the nucleolus coordinator locales. Two examinations utilized microsatellite markers on European rough looking bats: the first utilized western European examples and recouped three all around characterized species groups for "M. alcathoe", "M. brandtii" and "M. mystacinus"; the other one, directed in Poland, recommending an abnormal state of hybridization with other rough looking bats that would additionally convolute endeavors to distinguish "M.ÃÂ alcathoe" morphologically.
