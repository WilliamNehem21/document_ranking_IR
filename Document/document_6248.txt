Further unification of the Lithuanian clans was encouraged by the social changes that occurred in Lithuania amid this period. Private land proprietorship was built up (allodiums, Lithuanian: "atolai"), which would later advance into a medieval framework. As verified by numerous annals, it was the primary type of association administering land possession in the thirteenth century. Under this framework, referred to in England as primogeniture, just the oldest child could acquire lands, which enabled dukes to merge their possessions. Social classes and divisions of work additionally started coming to fruition. There were classes of experienced troopers (bajoras), of free workers (laukininkas), and of "unfree" individuals (kaimynas and ÃÂ¡eimynykÃÂ¡tis). So as to authorize this social structure, an assembled state was required. Another power behind unification was the longing to exploit Ruthenian lands, which were experiencing the Mongol attack. Impermanent unions among Lithuanian dukes regularly got the job done for military endeavors into, and pillaging of, these terrains (counting Pskov, looted in 1213). Through and through, somewhere in the range of 1201 and 1236, Lithuanians propelled no less than 22 invasions into Livonia, 14 into Rus, and 4 into Poland. The continuous organization of vanquished domains, be that as it may, required a solid and bound together focal power.
