In 2009, after the declaration that "As the World Turns" would be dropped in 2010, bits of gossip that Howarth would come back to "OLTL" recovered energy. The bits of gossip were additionally powered by an August 2010 scene of "OLTL," in which Howarth's image was appeared and an incoherent TÃÂ©a expressed that the present Todd (St. John) was not Todd Manning. This brought about what Dan Kroll of the site Soap Opera Central.com portrayed as fans "rac[ing] to their PCs to make sense of the significance of the scene". Kroll conjectured that the scene was "made simply to get fans talking, or was it an insight to watchers something significant was waiting to be addressed?" Soap Opera Network, refering to anonymous sources and indicating the 2010 scene, provided details regarding their site that they had "adapted only Howarth [would] to be sure be returning" to the arrangement sooner rather than later. "Cleanser Opera Digest" journalist Carolyn Hinsey expelled the report, expressing on her Facebook page, "Genuinely, stop with the Howarth falsehood here please. He isn't returning to "OLTL." Case shut." Some fans were persuaded that St. John's character was an impostor, while others were not; despite the fact that Howarth in the end returned as Todd in 2011, his arrival was at first went with fan banter in regards to what job he would play, Todd Manning or another character.
