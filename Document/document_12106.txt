Leno made his introduction as a performance entertainer in 1869, coming back to the Britannia music corridor in Hoxton, where he wound up known as "The Great Little Leno, the Quintessence of Irish Comedians". The name was recommended by his stepfather, William, who figured the Irish association would engage gatherings of people on their up and coming visit to Dublin. Touching base in Ireland that year, the Lenos were battling monetarily and remained with William's relatives. Notwithstanding his exhibitions as a major aspect of the family demonstration, youthful Leno showed up as a performance demonstration under an Irish-sounding stage name, "Dan Patrick". This enabled him to procure a different charge of 23 shillings for every execution in addition to everyday costs. The name "Dan" was picked to respect Dan Lowery, a northern music lobby humorist and music corridor owner whom the Lenos had met a couple of months sooner. Amid this voyage through Ireland, the Lenos showed up in Dublin in an emulate composed by Leno's dad: "Old King Humpty; or, Harlequin Emerald Isle and Katty of Killarney" (1869), in which Leno got acclaim from Charles Dickens, who was in the group of onlookers and let him know: "Great little man, you'll make progress!"
