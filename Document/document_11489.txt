Somewhere in the range of 1963 and 1965, the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences sorted out the Polish-Mongolian palaeontological campaigns to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Among the dinosaur stays found in sand beds of the Nemegt Basin were various ornithomimids at various development stages from the Nemegt, Tsaagan Khushuu, Altan Ula IV and Naran Bulak areas. Three in part total skeletons, two with skulls, just as numerous fragmentary remains, were gathered. The biggest skeleton (later to turn into the holotype of "Gallimimus bullatus") was found by scientist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska in Tsaagan Khushuu in 1964; it was protected lying on its back, and the skull was found under its pelvis. One little example was additionally found in Tsaagan Khushuu that year, and another little example was found in the Nemegt territory. A little skeleton without forelimbs was found in 1967 by the Mongolian palaeontological endeavor in Bugeen Tsav outside the Nemegt Basin. The fossils were housed at the Mongolian, Polish and USSR Academy of Sciences. The Polish-Mongolian campaigns were prominent for being driven by ladies, some of which were among the main ladies to name new dinosaurs. The fossils found in these undertakings shed new light on the exchange of fauna among Asia and North America amid the Cretaceous time frame. A portion of the skeletons were displayed in Warsaw in 1968, mounted in tall, semi-erect stances, which was acknowledged at the time, however increasingly even stances are supported today.
