On 9 December, she go back around Cape Horn to come back to the Pacific. That day, she secured in Sholl Bay, with just 160ÃÂ t (160ÃÂ long tons; 180ÃÂ short tons) of coal on board. "Oberleutnant zur See" (lieutenant adrift) Wilhelm Canaris persuaded the Chilean maritime delegate for the district to allow "Dresden" to stay in the zone for an additional twenty-four hours so enough coal could be taken on board to reach Punta Arenas. She touched base there on 12 December, and got of coal from a German steamer. The "Admiralstab" trusted that "Dresden" would most likely leap forward to the Atlantic and come back to Germany, however the poor state of her motors blocked this. LÃÂ¼decke rather chose to endeavor to cross the Pacific through Easter Island, the Solomon Islands, and the Dutch East Indies and assault business in the Indian Ocean. "Dresden" took on another of coal on 19 January. On 14 February, "Dresden" left the islands off the South American coast for the South Pacific. On 27 February, the cruiser caught the British barque "Conway Castle" south of MÃÂ¡s a Tierra. From December to February, the German liner had provided "Dresden" and had went with her northward to a last coaling at Juan FernÃÂ¡ndez Islands just before the cruiser was sunk.
