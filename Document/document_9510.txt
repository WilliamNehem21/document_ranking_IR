He drove the gathering behind the adversary lines, to Keetsville (presently Washburn)MO, where they accumulated knowledge, crushed a few wagonloads of grocery store supplies, caught 60 steeds and donkeys, and took 11 detainees. The next month, the regiment was appointed to Earl Van Dorn, presently a Major General, with whom Ross had served amid the fight at the Wichita Village. Under Van Dorn, the gathering endured an annihilation at the Battle of Pea Ridge; Ross credited their misfortune exclusively to Van Dorn, and reprimanded him for overmarching and starving his troops, and for neglecting to appropriately organize the arrangement of assault. In April, the gathering was sent to Des Arc, Arkansas. Due to the shortage of scrounge, Ross' mounted force troop was requested to get off and send their ponies back to Texas. The unit, presently by walking, went to Memphis, Tennessee, arriving two weeks after the Battle of Shiloh. Ross before long came down with a terrible bug joined by a waiting fever, and was incredibly sick for about two months.
