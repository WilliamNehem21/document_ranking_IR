"Slava"s 40-bore 12-inch weapons were mounted in two twin-firearm turrets, one every fore and behind. They had a rate of flame of around one round every moment. Sixty rounds for every weapon were conveyed. The twelve 45-bore weapons were mounted in six electrically controlled twin-firearm turrets carried on the sides of the ship. They had a down to earth rate of shoot of around three rounds for each moment and were furnished with 180 rounds for every firearm. Four of the twenty weapons utilized against torpedo pontoons were mounted in casemates just underneath the forward principle firearm turret, two on each side. These weapons were put well over the waterline for use in any climate, in contrast to the staying sixteen firearms, which were mounted in casemates one deck lower and disseminated over the length of the ship, near the water. This was graphically exhibited when "Slava"s sister dispatch made a fast turn amid her preliminaries, behaving 15ÃÂ°, and started taking water through the lower casemates. Each weapon had 300 rounds accessible. Everything except four of her Hotchkiss weapons were expelled before she was finished and the rest of the firearms were utilized as saluting weapons. She conveyed four torpedo tubes, one above water in the bow and one in the stern with two torpedoes each, and a submerged cylinder on each side forward with three torpedoes each. Two of these were expelled before 1914, despite the fact that it isn't known which ones were held.
