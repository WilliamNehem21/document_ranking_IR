In the wake of finishing everything except its last shed, the caterpillar turns a case out of silk. The cover can be in the tree crown or between two leaves, yet is regularly close to the ground, among greenery and bark. It is an open system casing with vast and sporadic work. In the warm season, the case takes around 10 hours to turn, the transformation happens around 29 hours after the fact and endures around 6 minutes. These terms are somewhat longer exposed to the harsh elements season. The chrysalis organize keeps going 17 days in November, the hottest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the themes of the wings begin to wind up unmistakable. The moth develops amid the night or in low light, by part the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a level surface, from which it suspends itself by its four front legs. The wings are sent in around 10 minutes, by siphoning haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth at that point beats them a couple of times, holds up 45 minutes to give them a chance to solidify, at that point beats them gently once more. The moth at last takes off among one-and-a-half and after two hours.
