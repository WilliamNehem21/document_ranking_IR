Although "Dresden" had not completed the required testing, her trials were declared over on 7 September, as she had been ordered to visit the United States. The purpose of the voyage was to represent Germany at the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York; "Dresden" was joined by the protected cruisers and and the light cruiser . "Dresden" left Wilhelmshaven on 11 September and stopped in Newport, where she met the rest of the ships of the squadron. The ships arrived in New York on 24 September, remained there until 9 October, and arrived back in Germany on 22 October.
"Dresden" then joined the reconnaissance force for the High Seas Fleet; the following two years consisted of the peacetime routine of squadron exercises, training cruises, and annual fleet exercises. On 16 February 1910, she collided with the light cruiser . The collision caused significant damage to "Dresden", though no one on either vessel was injured. She made it back to Kiel for repairs, which lasted eight days. "Dresden" visited Hamburg on 13â17 May that year. From 14 to 20 April 1912, she was temporarily transferred to the Training Squadron, along with the armored cruiser and the light cruiser . For the year 1911â12, "Dresden" won the Kaiser's SchieÃpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery amongst the light cruisers of the High Seas Fleet. From September 1912 through September 1913, she was commanded by "FregattenkapitÃ¤n" (Frigate Captain) Fritz LÃ¼decke, who would command the ship again during World War I.
