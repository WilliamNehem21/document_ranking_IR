A get-together scene was guessed after the fifth arrangement finished; in the 2003 narrative "Cold Feet: The Final Call", official maker Andy Harries expressed, "By killing a character, you are really saying 'this arrangement is finished' Ã¢ÂÂ¦ until, obviously, in 10 years time when cash is running somewhat short for us all, we bring it back. What we do with Rachel, I don't have the foggiest idea yetÃ¢ÂÂyet I have a couple of speculations." In a meeting distributed in October 2003, Harries told "The Daily Telegraph" that ITV would "most likely" bring back "Cool Feet" ten years after it finished, and stated, "There's an implicit comprehension with the on-screen characters that we will return to it at the proper time." In 2007, a newspaper paper cited an ITV "insider" as saying that a gathering scene would be communicated to stamp a long time since the pilot broadcast. The report ended up being a manufacture. At the 2010 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Harries expressed that talks about the arrangement's arrival were "continuous", however featured various variables that would keep a gathering sooner rather than later. The next day, Harries told Kate Silverton that he had discourses with Mike Bullen about the arrangement returning, yet that it would not be back on TV screens in 2011 or 2012.
