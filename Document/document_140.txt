The ambitious siblings screened an all around utilized duplicate of "The Great Train Robbery" all through Ohio and Pennsylvania before leasing an empty store in New Castle, Pennsylvania. This temporary theater, called the Bijou, was outfitted with seats obtained from a nearby funeral director. Jack, who was all the while living in Youngstown at the time, touched base on ends of the week "to sing outlined melody slides amid reel changes". In 1906, the siblings acquired a little auditorium in New Castle, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace. They kept up the performance center until moving into film dissemination in 1907. That year, the Warner siblings built up the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement Company, a circulation firm that demonstrated worthwhile until the coming of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company (otherwise called the Edison Trust), which charged merchants over the top expenses. In 1909, Harry consented to carry Jack into the privately-run company; he sent his more youthful sibling to Norfolk, Virginia, where Jack helped Sam in the task of a second film trade organization. Soon thereafter, the Warners sold the privately-owned company to the General Film Company for "$10,000 in real money, $12,000 in favored stock, and installments over a four-year time span for a sum of $52,000" (proportionate to $ today).
