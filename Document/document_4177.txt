The best-archived celebration concentrated on Hathor is another Ptolemaic festival, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It occurred more than fourteen days in the long stretch of Epiphi. Hathor's clique picture from Dendera was conveyed by vessel to a few sanctuary locales to visit the divine forces of those sanctuaries. The endpoint of the voyage was the Temple of Horus at Edfu, where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were put together. On one day of the celebration, these pictures were done to a hallowed place where primordial divinities, for example, the sun god and the Ennead were said to be covered. The writings state the celestial couple performed offering customs for these buried divine beings. Numerous Egyptologists see this celebration as a custom marriage among Horus and Hathor, in spite of the fact that Martin Stadler challenges this view, contending that it rather spoke to the restoration of the covered maker divine beings. C. J. Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another festival of the arrival of the Distant Goddess, refering to inferences in the sanctuary's celebration writings to the fantasy of the sunlight based eye. Barbara Richter contends that the celebration spoke to every one of the three things immediately. She calls attention to that the introduction of Horus and Hathor's child Ihy was praised at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, suggesting that Hathor's visit to Horus spoke to Ihy's origination.
