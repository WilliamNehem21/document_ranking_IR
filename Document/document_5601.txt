Highlighting a delicate shake and pop shake sound, "Gossipy tidbits" is worked around a blend of acoustic and electric instrumentation. Buckingham's guitar work and Christine McVie's utilization of Fender Rhodes piano or Hammond B-3 organ are available on everything except two tracks. The record frequently incorporates focused on drum sounds and unmistakable percussion, for example, congas and maracas. It opens with "Second Hand News", initially an acoustic demo titled "Strummer". Subsequent to hearing Bee Gees' "Jive Talkin'", Buckingham and co-maker Dashut developed the tune with four sound tracks of electric guitar and the utilization of seat percussion to summon Celtic shake. "Dreams" incorporates "ethereal spaces" and a common two note design on the bass. Scratches composed the melody in an evening and drove the vocals, while the band played around her. The third track on "Gossipy tidbits", "Failing to go Back Again", started as "Brushes", a basic acoustic guitar tune played by Buckingham, with catch moves by Fleetwood utilizing brushes; the band included vocals and further instrumental sound tracks to make it progressively layered. Motivated by triple step moving examples, "Don't Stop" incorporates both ordinary acoustic and tack piano. In the last instrument, nails are put on the focuses where the mallets hit the strings, creating an increasingly percussive sound. "Go Your Own Way" is more guitar-situated and has a four-to-the-floor move beat affected by The Rolling Stones' "Road Fighting Man". The collection's pace backs off with "Lark", imagined exclusively by Christine McVie utilizing a nine-foot Steinway piano.
