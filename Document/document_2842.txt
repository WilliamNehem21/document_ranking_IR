Before the slope fortress was manufactured, a Neolithic causewayed walled in area was developed on the site. Dating from around 4000ÃÂ BC, it was an oval region encased by two trench, It is known as a causewayed walled in area on the grounds that the manner in which the trench were burrowed implied that there would initially have been holes. These holes, and the bank being just high, demonstrate the site would not have been guarded. Rather the trench may have been representative, isolating the inside of the fenced in area and its exercises all things considered. Classicist Niall Sharples, who was engaged with exhuming the slope post during the 1980s, has recognized the ridge perspectives on the encompassing scene as a feasible factor for the walled in area's position. Arranged in favor of the slope, it would have been noticeable from a few miles away, and when originally cut the trench would have uncovered the hidden white chalk and emerged against the green slope. The inside of the fenced in area has been bothered by later residence and cultivating. The site does not seem to have been occupied, in spite of the fact that a grave containing the remaining parts of two kids, matured 6Ã¢ÂÂ 7, has been found. The walled in area is the soonest proof of human movement on the site.
