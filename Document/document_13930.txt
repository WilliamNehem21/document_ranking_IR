Edward was conceived on 12 October 1537 in his mom's room inside Hampton Court Palace, in Middlesex. He was the child of King Henry VIII by his third spouse, Jane Seymour. All through the domain, the general population welcomed the introduction of a male beneficiary, "whom we yearned for so long", with happiness and help. "Te Deums" were sung in houses of worship, campfires lit, and "their was shott at the Tower that night over two thousand gonnes". Ruler Jane, seeming to recuperate rapidly from the birth, conveyed by and by marked letters reporting the introduction of "a Prince, imagined in most legitimate marriage between my Lord the King's Majesty and us". Edward was initiated on 15 October, with his relatives, the 21-year-old Lady Mary as back up parent and the 4-year-old Lady Elizabeth conveying the chrisom; and the Garter King of Arms announced him as Duke of Cornwall and Earl of Chester. The Queen, be that as it may, became sick on 23 October from assumed postnatal difficulties, and passed on the next night. Henry VIII wrote to Francis I of France that "Divine ProvidenceÃÂ ... hath blended my delight with harshness of the passing of her who presented to me this satisfaction".
