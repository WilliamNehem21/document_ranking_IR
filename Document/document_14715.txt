"KÃÂ¶nig Albert" and her four sisters were to have made part in a last armada move toward the finish of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to produce results. The greater part of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to connect with the British Grand Fleet; ScheerÃ¢ÂÂat this point the Grand Admiral ("GroÃÂadmiral") of the armadaÃ¢ÂÂplanned to exact however much harm as could reasonably be expected on the British naval force, so as to hold a superior dealing position for Germany, in spite of the normal setbacks. Be that as it may, a considerable lot of the war-tired mariners felt the task would disturb the harmony procedure and draw out the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the request was given to cruise from Wilhelmshaven the next day. Beginning the evening of 29 October, mariners on and after that on a few different warships mutinied. The ship stayed on picket obligation in the Bight until 10 November. This fended off her from the mutinous vessels, until she came back to port and her team joined the insurrection. The distress at last constrained Hipper and Scheer to drop the activity. Educated of the circumstance, the Kaiser expressed "I never again have a naval force."
