According to Salyer, the San Francisco attorney George Collins had tried to persuade the federal Justice Department to bring a Chinese birthright citizenship case before the Supreme Court. An article by Collins was published in the May/June 1895 "American Law Review", criticizing the "Look Tin Sing" ruling and the federal government's unwillingness to challenge it, and advocating the international law view of "jus sanguinis" citizenship. Eventually, Collins was able to convince U.S. Attorney Henry Foote, who "searched for a viable test case and settled on Wong Kim Ark".
With the assistance of legal representation by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, Wong Kim Ark challenged the refusal to recognize his birth claim to U.S. citizenship, and a petition for a writ of "habeas corpus" was filed on his behalf in federal district court. The arguments presented before District Judge William W. Morrow centered on which of two competing interpretations of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in the Citizenship Clause should govern a situation involving a child born in the United States to alien parents. Wong's attorneys argued that the phrase meant subject to the laws of the United States,' comprehending, in this expression, the allegiance that aliens owe in a foreign country to obey its laws"âan interpretation, based on the common law inherited by the United States from England, that would encompass essentially everyone born in the U.S. via the principle of "jus soli" (citizenship based on place of birth). The U.S. government claimed that "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" meant "to be subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States"âan interpretation, based on international law, which would exclude parents and their children who owed allegiance to another country via the principle of "jus sanguinis" (citizenship inherited from a parent).
