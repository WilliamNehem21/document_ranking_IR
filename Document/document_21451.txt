The first named specimen now attributed to "Triceratops" is a pair of brow horns attached to a skull roof, found near Denver, Colorado in the spring of 1887. This specimen was sent to American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, who believed that the formation from which it came dated from the Pliocene, and that the bones belonged to a particularly large and unusual bison, which he named "Bison alticornis". He realized that there were horned dinosaurs by the next year, which saw his publication of the genus "Ceratops" from fragmentary remains, but he still believed "B. alticornis" to be a Pliocene mammal. It took a third and much more complete skull to change his mind. The specimen, collected in 1888 by John Bell Hatcher from the Lance Formation of Wyoming, was initially described as another species of "Ceratops". After reflection, Marsh changed his mind and gave it the generic name "Triceratops", accepting his "Bison alticornis" as another species of "Ceratops" (it would later be added to "Triceratops"). The sturdy nature of the animal's skull has ensured that many examples have been preserved as fossils, allowing variations between species and individuals to be studied. "Triceratops" remains have subsequently been found in the American states of Montana and South Dakota (in addition to Colorado and Wyoming), and in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada.
