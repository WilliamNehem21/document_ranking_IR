Other "Famitsu" commentators appreciated Treasure's mark robot plans and were bewildered by the organization's decision to utilize catches rather than the 3D simple stick. "Nintendo Life" Jamie O'Neill lauded the amusement's characters and disdained the controls. He contrasted the Calina character with the job of Shadow Mario in "Super Mario Sunshine".

He included that the mind boggling controls considered experimentation that prompted new and fun ongoing interaction, and however the tossing foes specialist appeared to pursue from "Gunstar Heroes", the Clanball platforming was unintuitive. John Harris of "Gamasutra" composed that the diversion acquired different components from "Gunstar Heroes", as the recreations were comparative in heroes, collectible diamonds, and managers. As the diversion set aside effort to learn and comprehend, O'Neill left the peruser to choose whether the amusement was "at last tangled or verging on refinement and virtuoso".
