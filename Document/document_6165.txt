In 1929, after monetary issues had constrained the BNOC to disband, the Covent Garden the executives set up a visiting organization to fill the hole, and delegated Barbirolli as its melodic chief and director. The musical dramas in the organization's first commonplace visit included "Pass on Meistersinger", "Lohengrin", "La bohÃÂ¨me", "Madama Butterfly", "The Barber of Seville", "Tosca", "Falstaff", "Faust", "Cavalleria rusticana", "Pagliacci", "Il trovatore", and the primary exhibitions in English of "Turandot." In later visits with the organization Barbirolli got the opportunity to direct a greater amount of the German musical drama repertory, including "Der Rosenkavalier", "Tristan und Isolde", and "Bite the dust WalkÃÂ¼re". Amid his years with the visiting musical show organizations Barbirolli did not disregard the show corridor. In 1927, nominating at short notice for Sir Thomas Beecham, he directed the London Symphony Orchestra in an exhibition of Elgar's Symphony No. 2, winning the thanks of the author. Barbirolli likewise won warm applause from Pablo Casals, whom he had went with in Haydn's D significant cello concerto at a similar show. He directed a Royal Philharmonic Society show at which Ralph Vaughan Williams was given the general public's Gold Medal, and another RPS show at which Gustav Mahler's music, once in a while heard around then, was given Ã¢ÂÂ "Kindertotenlieder", with Elena Gerhardt as soloist. In spite of the fact that Barbirolli later came to adore Mahler's music, during the 1930s he thought it sounded dainty.
