Conversely, Andy Webster of "The New York Times" said, "Its bargain-basement production values and lack of wit unexpectedly prove a greater liability than an asset". Robert Abele of the "Los Angeles Times" criticized its characters, costumes, and dialogue; he said it "so desperately wants to be cultishly admiredÂ ...Â that it forgets to be genuinely offbeat or funny". Scott Tobias of "The A.V. Club" gave the film a C+, mentioning the influences of John Carpenter, "The Warriors", "Mad Max 2", and "A Clockwork Orange", and criticizing Jason Trost's performance. He said the film was "a junky, disposable lark, created for a midnight audience to swallow, belch, and forget about the next morning". Nick Schager of "Slant Magazine" gave it 1Â½ stars out of 4, and called it a "humorless void" and a "wannabe cult hit". Eric Hynes of "The Village Voice" said, "the film's charm fades fast" and , "[t]he problem with paying such dogged homage to shitty movies is that integrity is best achieved by producing a shitty movie in turn. Mission accomplished, for whatever that's worth." Ethan Gilsdorf of "The Boston Globe" gave the film 1 star out of 4, saying it was not "obliviously dreadful enough to be 'so bad it's good'". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press echoed this opinion, giving it 1 star out of 4; she said the film is "just plain badand boring, and repetitive" and that "as comedy, it just feels numbing". Max Nicholson of IGN said the film "is by no means the worst thing I've ever seen", but that it "should have been a three-minute sketch on Funny or Die".
