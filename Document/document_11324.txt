Joseph Parkes, Lord Wilton and William Rathbone were the first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had ignored his correct calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself immaculate. A fold of skin on his upper leg had been reduced, uncovering the muscles, and the uncovered veins had not been separated but rather were straightened, beating with Huskisson's pulse. The harmed leg shook wildly. Spectators noticed that Huskisson did not seem, by all accounts, to be in torment, and rather lay viewing the leg shake. Huskisson yelled "This is the passing of me". Parkes endeavored to console him, yet Huskisson answered "Truly, I am kicking the bucket, call Mrs Huskisson". A man tossed his jacket over William Huskisson's leg to save Emily Huskisson from seeing the degree of his wounds, and she was helped from the carriage in which she had been sitting. In hysterics, she endeavored to toss herself onto Huskisson, yet was limited by individual travelers as Lord Wilton connected an improvised tourniquet he had made utilizing cloths and an older traveler's strolling stick. Different travelers tore the entryway of an adjacent railroad storeroom from its pivots, to fill in as an alternative stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the entryway, shaking his head and saying "Where is Mrs Huskisson? I have met my passing, God excuse me." (Garfield, writing in 2002, gives his words as "This is my demise, God pardon me".)
