There are a large number of mixes of resonators and transducers that can be utilized to build a mechanical channel. A determination of a portion of these is appeared in the charts. Figure 6 demonstrates a channel utilizing plate flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the focal point of the main resonator, making it vibrate. The edges of the plate move in antiphase to the middle when the driving sign is at, or near, reverberation, and the flag is transmitted through the interfacing bars to the following resonator. At the point when the driving sign isn't near reverberation, there is little development at the edges, and the channel rejects (does not pass) the flag. Figure 7 demonstrates a comparative thought including longitudinal resonators associated together in a chain by interfacing bars. In this chart, the channel is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could similarly well have utilized magnetostrictive transducers. Figure 8 demonstrates a channel utilizing torsional resonators. In this graph, the information has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the yield has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be very unordinary in a genuine plan, as both info and yield as a rule have a similar kind of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is just appeared at exhibit how longitudinal vibrations might be changed over to torsional vibrations and the other way around. Figure 9 demonstrates a channel utilizing drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the circles are fixed to the packaging of the channel (not appeared in the chart) so the vibration of the plate is in indistinguishable modes from the layer of a drum. Collins calls this sort of channel a plate wire channel.
