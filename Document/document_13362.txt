Bader depicted his circumstance as "unthinkable", seeing that Meyszner was questioning his requests through the police hierarchy of leadership however that he, Bader, was considered in charge of all issues concerning the involved region. From that point, Bader was never again Meyszner's partner and this did not look good for any future conflicts with other influential people in the occupation routine. NediÃÂ kept on railing against German occupation strategy and the way that he needed to answer to four distinct specialists, who issued here and there opposing requests. In May, Meyszner went to a gathering at the Foreign Office, at which he derided NediÃÂ and his dependability to Germany, expressing that he could be viewed as solid just in battling the socialists. In July and August, some improvement happened, when Neuhausen was selected as head of the military organization staff, however Meyszner remained to a great extent free. Meyszner's police and security mechanical assembly kept on doing backlashes when mentioned by the "Wehrmacht".
