Silver coins kept on streaming out of the U.S. in 1852, and the three-penny silver saw its most astounding mintage, 18,663,500, all from Philadelphia. The estimation of these pieces was bigger than that of all other silver coins struck by the mints in 1852. The turbulent condition of business, with no circling government coin esteemed between the three-penny piece and gold dollar, was a wellspring of concern, and mint authorities and congressmen related in 1852 concerning a decrease in weight of silver coins, for example, the half dime and half dollar. Congress finally reacted by laws passed on February 21, 1853 and March 3, 1853. These decreased the heaviness of every silver coin with the exception of the silver dollar. The three-penny piece had its weight diminished from .8 grams to .75, however its fineness expanded to .900. Despite the fact that the other diminished weight silver coins were given legitimate delicate points of confinement of five dollars, that of the three-penny piece stayed at thirty pennies. Carothers conjectured, "Congress, most likely understanding that the 3 penny piece was a loner, best case scenario, liked to abandon it with a harsh legitimate delicate esteem". Compliant with these congressional demonstrations, mintage of the sort 1 three-penny silver ceased on March 31, 1853. These progressions to the silver coinage lightened the issue of little change, as the new lightweight coins stayed available for use and were not then stored.
