As indicated by Wilson, Robey respected Shakespeare and had a "great perusing learning of the Bard" despite the fact that the entertainer had never observed a Shakespeare play. As a tyke, he had focused on memory the "apparition" scene in "Hamlet". Writing in 1933, Cochran communicated the supposition that Robey had been a casualty of a to a great extent traditionalist and "grandiose" demeanor from theater administrators, that the comic was "ready to deal with Shakespeare", and that on the off chance that he had been oftentimes occupied with playing the Bard's works, at that point "Shakespeare would most likely have been prominent." In 1934, the theater chief Sydney Carroll offered Robey the opportunity to show up as Nick Bottom in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Open Air Theater, Regent's Park, however he at first declined the offer, refering to a feverish calendar, incorporating a contention with his appearance in that year's Royal Variety Performance on 8 May. He was likewise worried that he would not be paid attention to by authentic theater commentators and realized that he would not have the capacity to incorporate a comic sketch or to participate in his standard ingenious choking. Around the same time, Robey featured in a film form of the hit melodic "Chu Chin Chow". "The New York Times" called him "an adorable and ridiculous Ali Baba".
