In 1953 Bolikango became a substitute member of the Conseil de la province de LÃ©opoldville. He served in the post for three years. In December 1957 he unsuccessfully entered LÃ©opoldville's first municipal elections. The Bangala as a whole did not do well in the campaign; their only form of organisation was Bolikango's Liboka Lya Bangala, an association with little cohesion. Following the electoral defeats, Bolikango decided to organise the InterfÃ©dÃ©rale, a federation among various regional and ethnic groups of the northern Congo that became the basis of his new Parti de l'unitÃ© Congolaise. Almost immediately after its creation the party collapsed due to ethnic differences. In April 1959 Patrice Lumumba asked Bolikango to become director of his nationalist political party, the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), but he never committed to a decision. In the autumn of 1959 the InterfÃ©dÃ©rale became a part of the Parti National du ProgrÃ¨s (PNP). Bolikango did not follow them, instead founding the Front de l'unite Bangala (FUB), a political party representing the Bangala people of the northeastern Congo. Among them he was a popular figure; Bangala nicknames for him included "the Sage" and even "Moses". He hoped that by promoting the idea of a "grande ethnie bangala" he could enhance his political prospects. The Bangala were only unified as a political faction in the capital, so he began to look elsewhere for support. He was also a cofounder of the short-lived Mouvement pour le Progres National Congolais, a party formed by attendees of the Brussels exposition.
