On March 20, they cruised first to England, where Crane was energetically gotten. They landed in Athens toward the beginning of April; between April 17 (when Turkey announced war on Greece) and April 22, Crane composed his initially distributed report of the war, "An Impression of the 'Concert'ÃÂ ". When he left for Epirus in the northwest, Taylor stayed in Athens, where she turned into the Greek war's first lady war journalist. She composed under the alias "Carter" for the "New York Journal", an occupation that Crane had verified for her. They composed regularly, going all through the nation independently and together. The main expansive fight that Crane saw was the Turks' ambush on General Constantine Smolenski's Greek powers at Velestino. Crane expressed, "It is an incredible thing to study the military of the adversary. Exactly where and how it grabs hold upon the heart is troublesome of portrayal." During this fight, Crane experienced "a fat waddling pup" that he promptly guaranteed, naming it "Velestino, the Journal hound". Greece and Turkey marked a peace negotiation on May 20, finishing the 30-day war; Crane and Taylor left Greece for England, accepting two Greek siblings as workers and Velestino the puppy with them.
