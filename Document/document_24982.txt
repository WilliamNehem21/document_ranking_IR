Soejima's first major work for the series was working on side characters for "Persona 2" alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima in charge of the series' art direction after "Persona 2" as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the "Persona" series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the "Persona" series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on "Persona Q", his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the "Etrian Odyssey" series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.
