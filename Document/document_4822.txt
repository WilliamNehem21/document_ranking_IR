While Dilkes was proceeding onward Ruffin's situation on Barrosa Ridge, Barnard and the light organizations progressed through the forested areas towards Leval's division. Unconscious of the approaching British ambush, the French had avoided potential risk and were progressing in two segments of walk, with no forward line of "voltigeurs". The surprising appearance of British skirmishers caused such disarray that some French regiments, thinking there were mounted force present, shaped square. These were practical objectives for shrapnel rounds terminated by the ten gun under Major Duncan which, having gained quick ground through the forested areas, touched base so as to help the conflict line. As the circumstance moved toward becoming more clear, the French sorted out themselves into their standard assaulting arrangementÃ¢ÂÂthe 'section of divisions'Ã¢ÂÂ all the time enduring an onslaught from Barnard's light organizations and Duncan's cannons. At long last, with the French now in their battling sections and starting their development, Barnard was compelled to move back. Leval's men at that point experienced Bushe's organizations of the twentieth Portuguese, who bolstered the light legion's retreat and kept the French drew in until Wheatley's detachment had shaped up in line on the edge of the forested areas. The withdrawing light organizations joined Wheatley's troops; Leval's division of 3,800 men was currently walking on an Anglo-Portuguese line of 1,400 men bolstered by gun.
