Another factor that brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the prospect of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of "The Sunday Times" was assumed to be imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and made it clear that he would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder. Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London "Evening Standard" to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his "Autobiography", published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950â51 in Australia, writing about the 1950â51 England v. Australia Test series for the "Sydney Morning Herald", London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with "The Manchester Guardian". In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.
