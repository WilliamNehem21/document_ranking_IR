Ceawlin is the second lord in Bede's rundown. All the consequent bretwaldas pursued pretty much successively, however there is a long hole, maybe fifty years, between ÃÂlle of Sussex, the first bretwalda, and Ceawlin. The absence of holes between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been utilized to argue for Ceawlin's dates coordinating the later sections in the "Narrative" with sensible exactness. As per this investigation, the following bretwalda, ÃÂthelberht of Kent, more likely than not been as of now an overwhelming lord when Pope Gregory the Great kept in touch with him in 601, since Gregory would have not kept in touch with an underking. Ceawlin crushed ÃÂthelberht in 568 as per the "Narrative". ÃÂthelberht's dates involve banter, yet later insightful agreement has his rule beginning no sooner than 580. The 568 date for the fight at Wibbandun is believed to be improbable as a result of the statement in different variants of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin's rule endured either seven or seventeen years. In the event that this fight is put close to the year 590, preceding ÃÂthelberht had built up himself as an amazing ruler, at that point the consequent archives identifying with Ceawlin's thrashing and passing might be sensibly near the right date. Regardless, the fight with ÃÂthelberht is probably not going to have been in excess of a couple of years on either side of 590. The hole among ÃÂlle and Ceawlin, then again, has been taken as supporting proof for the story told by Gildas in "De Excidio" of a harmony enduring an age or all the more after a Briton triumph at Mons Badonicus.
