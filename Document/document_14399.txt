Around 4:00, "Relentless" was hit around the back turret by a few shells from "Von der Tann". She dropped out of development to starboard and began sinking towards the stern and inclining to port. Her magazines detonated at 4:03 after more hits, one on the forecastle and another on the forward turret. Smoke and blazes spouted from the forward piece of the ship and substantial pieces were tossed into the air. The probably reason for her misfortune was a deflagration or low-request blast in 'X' magazine that smothered her base and disjoined the directing control shafts, trailed by the blast of her forward magazines from the second volley. "Von der Tann" shot just fifty-two shells at "Inexhaustible" before she detonated. Of her team of 1,019, just three endure. While still in the water, two survivors found "Indefatigable's" commander, C. F. Sowerby, who was seriously injured and passed on before they could be saved. Two survivors, Able Seaman Frederick Arthur Gordon Elliott and Leading Signalman Charles Farmer, were safeguarded by the German torpedo vessel . A third survivor, Signalman John Bowyer, was gotten by another obscure German ship. He was mistakenly detailed as a team part from HMS "Nestor" in "The Times" on 24 June 1916.
