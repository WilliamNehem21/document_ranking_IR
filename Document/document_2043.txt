As student of history Richard Beeman put it, Henry was a man who "did not try to record quite a bit of anything", an impairment while being assessed by history. The absence of essential source materials with respect to HenryÃ¢ÂÂjust a bunch of papers and a couple of his talks endureÃ¢ÂÂhas baffled Henry's biographers from Wirt (1817) to Beeman (1974): Wirt remarked two years before distributing his book, "It is all talking, talking, talking. 'Tis genuine he could talkÃ¢ÂÂGods! how he "could" talk! butÃÂ ... to aggravate the issue, from 1763 to 1789ÃÂ ... not one of his discourses lives in print, composing or memory". Beeman, as far as it matters for him, closed, "the Revolutionary torch, whatever his accomplishments, had a hopeless feeling of history". This was an insufficiency not controlled by Jefferson, who endure Henry by 25 years, yet who got the opportunity to fill the vacuum of data about Henry with his own memories and assessments. Wirt did not print a large number of Jefferson's reactions of Henry, who had bothered Jefferson to such a degree he was all the while scrutinizing Henry to visitors at Monticello in 1824. Jefferson's negative evaluations of Henry, regardless of whether defended or not, have unfavorably influenced Henry's recorded notoriety.
