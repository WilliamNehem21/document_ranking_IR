The directorate named Ross the treasurer of the school, and he posted a $20,000ÃÂ personal security "for the unwavering execution of his obligation". In the break between school years, Ross established various changes. At the point when understudies returned for the 1891Ã¢ÂÂ 1892 school year, they found another three-story quarters with 41 rooms (named Ross Hall), the start of development on another home for the president, and another structure to house the machine and metalworker shops. The base age for enlistment diminished from 16 to 15, and Ross presently actually talked with every single imminent understudy to decide whether they ought to be conceded. Charges and costs ascended by $10 per session, and the quantity of hours required for graduation expanded, incorporating extra hours in English sentence structure, sciences, arithmetic, and history. Furthermore, Ross would now designate the officers for the Corps of Cadets, and the name of the organization of best-bored cadets in the Corps would change to the Ross Volunteers (from Scott Volunteers). At long last, Ross established an official forbiddance against preliminaries, vowing to remove any understudy discovered blameworthy of the training. Despite the fact that Ross affirmed to make the most of his new position, he kept in touch with a few people that coordinating the school "made me turn dark quick."
