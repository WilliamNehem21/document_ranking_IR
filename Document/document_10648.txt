Demetrius ( ) is a Greek name that signifies "having a place with Demeter", the Greek goddess of richness. Seleucid rulers were for the most part named Seleucus and Antiochus; "Demetrius" was utilized by the Antigonid line of Macedonia as an imperial name, and its utilization by the Seleucids, who had Antigonid plummet, likely connoted that they were beneficiaries of the last mentioned. Greek rulers did not utilize regnal numbers, which is a cutting edge practice; rather, they utilized designations to separate themselves from likewise named rulers. Demetrius III's most utilized designations are Theos (divine), Philopator (father adoring) and Soter (guardian angel); the previously mentioned sobriquets seem together on the majority of his Damascene and Antiochene coins. In Cilicia, two designations were utilized related: Philometor (mother-adoring) and Euergetes (advocate). The coins from Seleucia Pieria bear three designations together: the ones showing up on the coins of Cilicia, joined with the sobriquet Callinicus (honorably successful). Theos Philopator Soter served to stress Demetrius III's drop from the line of his granddad Demetrius II who bore the designation Theos; Soter was an appellation of Demetrius III's extraordinary granddad Demetrius I, while Philopator spoke to his commitment to his perished dad Antiochus VIII. With Philometor, Demetrius III likely tried to stress his Ptolemaic regal Egyptian plummet through his mom Tryphaena.
