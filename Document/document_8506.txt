In May 1936 Olivier and Richardson mutually coordinated and featured in another piece by J.ÃÂ B. Priestley, "Honey bees on the Boatdeck". The two performing artists won amazing notification, yet the play, a moral story of Britain's rot, did not draw in general society and shut following a month. Later around the same time Olivier acknowledged an encouragement to join the Old Vic organization. The theater, in an unfashionable area south of the Thames, had offered economical tickets for musical show and dramatization under its owner Lilian Baylis since 1912. Her show organization had practical experience in the plays of Shakespeare, and many driving performing artists had taken extremely extensive slices in their compensation to build up their Shakespearean procedures there. Gielgud had been in the organization from 1929 to 1931, and Richardson from 1930 to 1932. Among the performers whom Olivier participated in late 1936 were Edith Evans, Ruth Gordon, Alec Guinness and Michael Redgrave. In January 1937 he played the title job in a whole form of "Hamlet", in which by and by his conveyance of the section was horribly contrasted and that of Gielgud, who had assumed the job on a similar stage seven years beforehand to colossal approval. "The Observer's" Ivor Brown adulated Olivier's "attraction and strength" yet missed "the sort of poignancy so lavishly settled by Mr Gielgud". The commentator in "The Times" found the execution "brimming with imperativeness", yet on occasion "too lightÃÂ ... the character slips from Mr Olivier's grip".
