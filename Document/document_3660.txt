In "Brideshead", the ordinary junior officer Hooper delineates a topic that continues in Waugh's after war fiction: the ascent of unremarkableness in the "Age of the Common Man". In the set of three "Sword of Honor" ("Men at Arms", 1952; "Officers and Gentlemen", 1955, "Unequivocal Surrender", 1961) the social inescapability of unremarkableness is exemplified in the semi-diverting character "Trimmer", a sloven and an extortion who triumphs by invention. In the novella "Scott-King's Modern Europe" (1947), Waugh's negativity about what's to come is in the schoolmaster's reprobation: "I figure it would be underhanded, for sure, to effectively fit a kid for the advanced world". In like manner, such pessimism infests the novel "Love Among the Ruins" (1953), set in a tragic, welfare-state Britain that is so socially obnoxious that killing is the most looked for after of the administration's social administrations. Of the after war books, Patey says that "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold" (1957) emerges Ã¢ÂÂ³a sort of counterfeit novel, a guileful welcome to a gameÃ¢ÂÂ³. Waugh's last work of fiction, "Basil Seal Rides Again" (1962), highlights characters from the prewar books; Waugh conceded that the work was a Ã¢ÂÂ³senile endeavor to recover the way of my youthÃ¢ÂÂ³. Elaborately this last story starts in a similar manner as the principal story, Ã¢ÂÂ³The Balance" of 1926, with a "fusillade of unattributed discourse".
