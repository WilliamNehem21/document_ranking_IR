The arrangement joined the two states, leaving Abkhazia as a "bargain republic" ostensibly subservient to Georgia. The exceptional status of Abkhazia inside Georgia was strengthened in the 1922 Georgian constitution, which referenced the "extraordinary association arrangement" between the two. The 1925 Abkhazian constitution noted it was joined with Georgia "on the base of an exceptional settlement". On 13 December 1922, while joined with Georgia, Abkhazia joined the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (TSFSR), alongside Armenia and Azerbaijan. This new league was made apparently for monetary purposes, however was almost certain done to merge Soviet power over the locale, which had been quarrelsome. Abkhazia was for the most part treated as an independent area of Georgia, however dissimilar to different self-ruling states in the Soviet Union, it had its own national imagesÃ¢ÂÂa banner and escutcheonÃ¢ÂÂand national armed force units, a privilege just given to full republics. The escutcheon was at first depicted in the 1925 constitution as being "made out of a brilliant sledge and sickle on the foundation of the Abkhazian scene with engraving in the Abkhaz language 'SSR Abkhazia'". This was marginally changed in 1926, when the republican (and Soviet-wide) witticism "Proletarians everything being equal, join together!" was written in Abkhaz, Georgian, and Russian (already it had just been written in Abkhaz). It likewise had its own constitution, made on 1 April 1925, another privilege just conceded to full republics.
