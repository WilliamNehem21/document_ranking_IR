The White City Amusement Park had been built up in 1906 in what is presently Broad Ripple Village, nearby the White River. In 1908 a flame caused harm all through the recreation center, and just the pool stayed solid. The recreation center shut for a long time until its buy by the Union Traction Company, which reestablished it and worked it for a long time.
