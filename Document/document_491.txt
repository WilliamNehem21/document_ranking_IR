Rotheram's order went on for two and half years, until he was supplanted on 8 June 1808 by Captain Samuel Warren. Warren was requested to take "Bellerophon" and join the armada in the North Sea, barricading the Dutch ports. She framed piece of Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner's squadron. By 1809 the vital circumstance in the Baltic had disintegrated after Russia marked the Treaties of Tilsit and started to help France. "Bellerophon" was requested to join the armada positioned in the Baltic under Admiral Sir James Saumarez. Saumarez dispatched "Bellerophon" and north to the Gulf of Finland in June, and on 19 June the two boats went over three suspicious looking luggers, moored off Hango. The water was too shallow to even think about allowing them to approach the luggers, so a vessel party was dispatched under "Bellerophon"s Lieutenant Robert Pilch. The British boarded the luggers, however wound up in a snare, when various Russian shore batteries and a few gunboats opened shoot on them. Pilch expeditiously requested the luggers to be singed, reboarded his men and landed them beside the closest Russian shore battery. The battery, guarded by 100 mariners, was raged and conveyed, the British spiked the weapons and wrecked the magazine, before coming back to the boats with just five men injured.
