On 1 November, "Vizeadmiral" Prince Heinrich, who had supplanted Hoffmann as the I Squadron officer, raised his banner on board "Kaiser Friedrich III"; the ship held the job as squadron leader for the following three years, hindered just amid the yearly armada practices led in August and September, when Admiral Hans von Koester, the "Generalinspekteur der Marine" (Inspector-General of the Navy), told the armada from "Kaiser Wilhelm II". Through November, the boats of the squadron were busy with individual preparing. On 17 November 1900, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was steaming to Kiel in the wake of directing preparing works out. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" endeavored to pass "Kaiser Friedrich III", so the last halted and enabled the previous to go to port. Be that as it may, the request to continue steaming was given too rapidly, and the ship coincidentally smashed "Kaiser Wilhelm II". "Kaiser Friedrich III" endured minor harm to her bow, while her sister was somewhat harmed in the compartment that housed the controlling motors. Fixes were finished inside three days, without the requirement for either vessel to enter drydock. On 4 December, the boats started a winter preparing journey, amid which they halted in Larvik, Norway, from 10 to 12 December. The squadron came back to Germany three days after the fact.
