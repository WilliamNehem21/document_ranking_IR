Waugh landed at Boa Vista on 4 February 1933, to discover no vessels accessible to take him on to Manaus. Long stretches of latency and fatigue pursued, with "nothing to peruse aside from certain existences of the Saints in French and Bossuet's lessons". Waugh relaxed by composing a short story; despite the fact that not recognized in the journals, this story has been commonly acknowledged as "The Man Who Liked Dickens". Aside from utilizing distinctive names and some minor subtleties this story is equivalent to the scene that Waugh later utilized as the peak to "A Handful of Dust": an old pilgrim (demonstrated in way, discourse and appearance on Christie), protects and holds hostage a lost pioneer and expects him to peruse out loud the books of Dickens, in interminability. The story was distributed in 1933, in America in "Hearst's InternationalÃ¢ÂÂ Cosmopolitan", and in Britain in "Nash's Pall Mall Magazine". In an article composed numerous years after the fact, Waugh clarified how the story turned into the reason for his next novel: "The thought [for the short story] came normally from the experience of visiting a forlorn pilgrim [Christie]ÃÂ ... also, reflecting how effectively he could hold me detainee. At that point, after the short story was composed and distributed, the thought continued working in my brain. I needed to find how the detainee arrived, and in the long run the thing developed into an investigation of different sorts of savage at home and the socialized man's powerless situation among them."
