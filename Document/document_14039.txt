The creation form of the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza's HS-110 diesel motor, situated in the back of the frame. The motor could be supplanted on the field in 45 minutes, and delivered , offering the tank a most extreme speed of on streets. The eco-friendly motor, related to an absolute fuel limit of , gave the AMX-30 a greatest street scope of up to . The motor's drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate outward grasp. The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward riggings and five invert gears. This transmission was intensely affected by that of the German Panther tank and depended on a venture which had started in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's real blames and caused an assortment of mechanical issues, including that the driver would need to physically switch gears at explicit occasions, regardless of whether the tank was moving over unpleasant territory. The tank's weight is appropriated more than five twofold, aluminum-composite, elastic tyred street wheels on either side, impelled on wide tracks. The tank could portage profound water deterrents without arrangement, up to with minor planning, and up to with full readiness. Full planning for water tasks comprised of the expansion of a snorkel tube, the establishment of blanking plates, carried on the facade of the frame, over the motor compartment's air admission louvers, and the portion of infra-red driving gear, including a searchlight. In 1969 a solitary uncommon plunge preparing vehicle was adjusted, nicknamed the "AMX 30 Gloutte" (from French "faire glouglou", "sputter"), without motor and tracks, that over a slope could rapidly be brought down into a supply by a winch; it was furnished with a break tube.
