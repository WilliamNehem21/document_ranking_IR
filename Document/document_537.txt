The ecclesiastical overseer's next adversary was the ecclesiastical legate of the new Pope Honorius II, Cardinal John of Crema, who landed in England in 1125. A trade off among York and Canterbury was arranged, which included Canterbury permitting York the supervision of the bishoprics of Bangor, Chester, and St Aspah as an end-result of Thurstan's verbal accommodation and the composed accommodation of his successors. The pope, in any case, dismissed the understanding, likely on the grounds that he wished to safeguard his own power, and substituted his own. The ecclesiastical arrangement was that Honorius would select William ecclesiastical legate in England and Scotland, which was done in 1126, giving William the situation over York, however it was reliant on the desire of the pope, and would slip by on the pope's passing. The course of action just deferred the issue be that as it may, as neither Thurstan nor William disavowed their cases. That Christmas, at an illustrious court, Thurstan ineffectively endeavored to guarantee the privilege to ritualistically crown the ruler just as have his episcopal cross conveyed before him in Canterbury's territory. Because of his protracted debate with Thurstan, William made a trip to Rome more as often as possible than any religious administrator before him aside from Wilfrid in the seventh century.
