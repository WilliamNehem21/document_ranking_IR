Like the greater part of the Malaysian youngsters during the 1950s, Lat viewed Hanna-Barbera kid's shows ("The Flintstones" and "The Jetsons") on TV and read imported British funnies, for example, "The Dandy" and "The Beano". He contemplated them and utilized their styles and topics in his initial doodles. After the remote impacts in his works were seen by a family companion, Lat was prompted by his dad to watch and draw upon thoughts from their surroundings. Paying attention to the guidance, the youthful illustrator implied himself with neighborhood happenings. "Tiga Sekawan" was considered as a diverting wrongdoing battling story of a neighborhood season. "Keluarga Si Mamat" and its hero were named after his most youthful sibling Mamat, its accounts dependent on Lat's perceptions of his kindred residents and classmates. The motivation for his kid's shows about "Bersunat" came about when he was on task at an emergency clinic. As he was taking breaks from examining the dead casualties of wrongdoing conveyed to the mortuary, Lat risked upon the circumcisions performed by the emergency clinic on ethnic Malay young men. He found their encounters clinical, without the intricate and individual services that praised his own custom to masculinity in the town. Lat felt constrained to show the contrasts between life in his "kampung" and the city.
