In the wake of voicing in Walt Disney Pictures' enlivened satire film "Dark horse" (2007), Adams featured as an exceptionally hopeful and blissful Disney Princess named Giselle in the melodic lighthearted comedy "Charmed". She was among 250 performers who tried out for the prominent part; the studio supported the throwing of a greater star, however the chief Kevin Lima demanded Adams because of her pledge to the part and her capacity to not be judgmental about her character's identity. Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden included as her sentimental advantages. A ballgown that she needed to wear for the film weighed 45 pounds, and Adams fell a few times under its weight. She likewise sang three tunes for the film's soundtrack"True Love's Kiss", "Glad Working Song", and "That is How You Know". The commentator Roger Ebert complimented Adams for being "new and winning" in a job that "completely relies upon easy adorableness", and Wesley Morris of "The Boston Globe" composed that she "shows a genuine entertainer's inventiveness for comic planning and physical expressiveness". Todd McCarthy believed the job to be Adams' leap forward and contrasted her ascent with fame to that of Julie Andrews. "Charmed" was a business achievement, earning over $340 million around the world. Adams got a Golden Globe Award designation for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.
