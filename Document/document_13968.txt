Parsons accommodated with Cameron, and they continued their relationship and moved into a previous mentor house on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons changed over its extensive, first-floor pantry into a home research center to take a shot at his concoction and pyrotechnic ventures, homebrew absinthe and store his materials. They let out the upstairs rooms and started holding parties that were gone to a great extent by bohemians and individuals from the Beat Generation, alongside old companions including Forman, Malina and Cornog. They likewise congregated at the home of Andrew Haley, who lived on a similar road. In spite of the fact that Parsons in his mid-thirties was a "prewar relic" to the more youthful participants, the boisterous socials regularly endured until first light and as often as possible pulled in police consideration. Parsons likewise established another Thelemite amass known as "the Witchcraft", whose convictions spun around an improved adaptation of Crowley's Thelema and Parsons' very own Babalon predictions. He offered a course in its lessons for a ten dollar charge, which incorporated another Thelemic conviction framework called "the Gnosis", a variant of Christian Gnosticism with Sophia as its godhead and the Christian God as its demiurge. He likewise teamed up with Cameron on "Melodies for the Witch Woman", a gathering of lyrics which she represented that was distributed in 2014.
