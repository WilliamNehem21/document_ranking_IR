The hostile against the Third Romanian Army started at 08:50, driven by the 21st and 65th Soviet Armies and the fifth Tank Army. The initial two ambushes were repelled by the Romanian protectors, and the impacts of the overwhelming mounted guns assault had really made it increasingly troublesome for Soviet shield to explore through the minefields and territory. Be that as it may, the absence of overwhelming enemy of tank mounted guns made the Romanian resistance breakdown; a leap forward by the fourth Tank Corps and third Guards Cavalry Corps was built up by early afternoon. Before long, the fifth Tank Army had the capacity to pick up a leap forward against the Second Romanian Corps, trailed by the Eighth Cavalry Corps. As Soviet protective layer explored through the thick mist by compass, overwhelming Romanian and German ordnance positions, three Romanian infantry divisions started to fall back in chaos; the Third Romanian Army had been defeated toward the West and East. Subsequent to accepting the updates on the Soviet assault, Sixth Army central station neglected to arrange the sixteenth and 24th Panzer Divisions, heretofore occupied with Stalingrad, to reorient themselves to reinforce the Romanian guards; rather the errand was given to the genuinely understrength and ineffectively prepared 48th Panzer Corps.
