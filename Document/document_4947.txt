On June 29, 2008, Clark made remarks on "Face the Nation" that were disparaging of Republican John McCain, raising doubt about the idea that McCain's military administration alone had given him experience applicable to being president. "I surely respect [McCain's] administration as a POW", Clark stated, "however he hasn't held official obligation. That substantial squadron in the Navy that he toldÃ¢ÂÂit wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and requested the bombs to fall." When arbitrator Bob Schieffer noticed that Obama had no military experience to set him up for the administration nor had he "ridden in a military aircraft and gotten shot down", Clark reacted that, eventually, Obama had not put together his presidential offer with respect to his military experience, as McCain has done all through his crusade. Clark's answer, in any case, is the thing that drew reproach. In alluding to McCain's military experience, he expressed: "Well, I don't think riding in a military aircraft and getting shot down is a capability to be president." Both the McCain and Obama battles in this manner discharged explanations dismissing Clark's remark. In any case, Clark has gotten the support of a few conspicuous liberal gatherings, for example, MoveOn.org and military veteran gatherings, for example, VoteVets.org; Obama eventually expressed that Clark's remarks were "inartful" and were not expected to assault McCain's military administration. In the days following the disputable meeting, Clark went on a few news projects to repeat his actual reverence and ardent help for McCain's military administration as a kindred veteran who had been injured in battle. In each program, Clark reminded the reporter and the review open that while he respected McCain's administration, he had genuine worries about McCain's judgment in issues of national security strategy, calling McCain "untested and untried".
