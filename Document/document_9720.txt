In 1922, a challenge was propelled by the trustees of the Melbourne Public Library for a wall painting to celebrate the Great War. Rix Nicholas scholarly of the challenge and immediately arranged and presented a section. Three judges, all regarded Melbourne scholastic specialists, presented a report to the trustees, who met to consider the sections got. The trustees casted a ballot six to five to allow the commission to Harold Septimus Power, notwithstanding the way that he had not satisfied the states of passage; they at that point retained the judges' report from distribution, chose not to show any of the challenge sections, and deferred granting any prize. One paper revealed that Rix Nicholas' entrance had been one of the best three. Rix Nicholas was irate, just like some previous troopers who composed letters to papers about the episode. Pigot recommends that sexual orientation was a factor: "While Rix Nicholas' case to be a war craftsman was authentic, the way that she was a lady implied that she was denied an equivalent spot inside the talk". Later that equivalent year, the Australian War Memorial chose to buy a work by Rix Nicholas depicting a French lady (titled "A Mother of France" (1914)), yet not to obtain the other work offered, appearing Australian fighter ("A Man" (1921)); as indicated by Pigot, this mirrored the gendered approach taken by foundations, which thought about that subjects appropriate for depiction by specialists were needy upon their sex.
