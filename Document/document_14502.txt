The sensitive lower jaw, comprising of meager bones, was thin and shallow at the front, extending towards the back. The front of the mandible was scoop like, bringing about a hole between the tips of the jaws when closed. The scoop like shape was like that of the basic seagull, and the lower mouth may have had a shape like that of this winged animal. The retroarticular procedure at the back of the jaw (where jaw muscles joined) was very much created and comprised mostly of the precise bone. The surangular was the biggest bone of the lower jaw, which is normal in theropods. The mandibular fenestra, a sidewards-confronting opening in the lower jaw, was stretched and relatively little. The lower jaw did not have a coronoid procedure or a supradentary bone, the absence of which is a typical component of curved theropods (ornithomimosaurs, oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs and winged creatures), however irregular among theropods as a rule. The shape and extents of the skull changed essentially amid development. The back of the skull and the circles diminished in size, while the nose turned out to be moderately more, comparable changes happen in present day crocodiles. The skull was likewise relatively bigger in the more youthful examples. The jaws of "Gallimimus" were edentulous (toothless), and the front part would have been canvassed in a keratinous rhamphotheca (horny mouth) throughout everyday life. The mouth may have secured a littler territory than in North American relatives, in light of the absence of feeding foramina on the maxilla. The internal side of the bill had little, firmly pressed and uniformly dispersed columnar structures (their precise nature is discussed), which were longest at the front and shortening towards the back.
