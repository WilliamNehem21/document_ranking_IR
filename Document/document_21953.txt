The first point follows from basic properties of the real numbers: "L" has a supremum and "R" has an infimum, which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in "R" or in "L", but not both since "L" and "R" are supposed to be disjoint. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for "p"Â =Â "0", "p"Â =Â "1". In fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance mixed radix systems can be included) or consider the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a finite set of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string (so one should not allow "9" in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of "9"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an order preserving map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a bijection: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string.
