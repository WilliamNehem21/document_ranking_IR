Two days after Knox touched base in Edinburgh, he continued to Dundee where an extensive number of Protestant sympathizers had accumulated. Knox was announced a criminal, and the Queen Regent gathered the Protestants to Stirling. Dreading the likelihood of a synopsis preliminary and execution, the Protestants continued rather to Perth, a walled town that could be guarded in the event of an attack. At the congregation of St John the Baptist, Knox lectured a blazing message and a little episode encouraged into an uproar. A crowd filled the congregation and it was before long gutted. The crowd at that point assaulted two friaries in the town, plundering their gold and silver and crushing pictures. Mary of Guise accumulated those nobles faithful to her and a little French armed force. She dispatched the Earl of Argyll and Lord Moray to offer terms and turn away a war. She guaranteed not to send any French troops into Perth if the Protestants emptied the town. The Protestants concurred, yet when the Queen Regent entered Perth, she garrisoned it with Scottish officers on the French pay roll. This was viewed as deceptive by Lord Argyll and Lord Moray, who both exchanged sides and joined Knox, who currently based himself in St Andrews. Knox's arrival to St Andrews satisfied the prediction he made in the galleys that he would one day lecture again in its congregation. When he gave a lesson, the impact was equivalent to in Perth. The general population occupied with vandalism and plundering.
