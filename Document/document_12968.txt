The taphonomy (entombment and fossilization process) of the three principle "Plateosaurus" localesÃ¢ÂÂTrossingen, Halberstadt and FrickÃ¢ÂÂis irregular in a few different ways. Every one of the three locales are about monospecific gatherings, implying that they contain for all intents and purposes just a single animal groups, which requires extremely exceptional conditions. Be that as it may, shed teeth of theropods have been found at all three locales, just as survives from the early turtle "Proganochelys". Also, a fractional "prosauropod" skeleton was found in Halberstadt that does not have a place with "Plateosaurus", yet is protected in a comparative position. All destinations yielded practically total and halfway skeletons of "Plateosaurus", just as disengaged bones. The halfway skeletons will in general incorporate the rear appendages and hips, while parts of the foremost body and neck are once in a while found in segregation. The creatures were all grown-ups or subadults (about grown-up people); no adolescents or hatchlings are known. Complete skeletons and vast skeleton parts that incorporate the rear appendages all rest dorsal (top) side up, as do the turtles. Likewise, they are for the most part all around enunciated, and the rear appendages are three-dimensionally saved in a crisscross stance, with the feet frequently a lot further in the silt than the hips.
