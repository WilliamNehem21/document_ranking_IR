While the verdure of Grand Teton National Park is commonly solid, the whitebark pine, and to a lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered in danger. On account of the whitebark pine, an intrusive types of organism known as white pine rankle rust debilitates the tree, making it progressively vulnerable to devastation from endemic mountain pine insects. Whitebark pines for the most part flourish at rises above and produce expansive seeds that are high in fat substance and an imperative sustenance hotspot for different species, for example, the wild bear, red squirrel and Clark's nutcracker. The species is viewed as a cornerstone and an establishment animal categories; cornerstone in that its ""biological job (is) lopsidedly substantial with respect to its wealth"" and establishment in that it has a principal job that ""characterizes environment structure, capacity, and procedure"". Whitebark pine has for the most part had a lower occurrence of rankle rust disease all through the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in different districts, for example, Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range. The occurrence of rankle rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is marginally lower than in Grand Teton. In spite of the fact that rankle rust isn't in itself the reason for expanded mortality, its debilitating impact on trees permits local pine bugs to all the more effectively swarm the trees, expanding mortality. While general practice in national parks is to enable nature to follow all the way through, the disturbing pattern of expanded ailment and mortality of the imperative whitebark pine trees has started a cooperative exertion among different government elements to mediate to secure the species.
