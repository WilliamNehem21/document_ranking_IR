"TV Without Pity" gave the scene an A+ rating.

Dek Hogan of "Computerized Spy" felt that the scene was "wonderfully offset and with snapshots of high fervor and contacting strength" and that the single oil tear shed by the Cyberman rendition of Hartman was a "pleasant touch". He reprimanded Catherine Tate's appearance as being pointless to end the scene and for "breaking the inclination". Stephen Brook of "The Guardian" imagined that the scene was "a highpoint of the advanced arrangement, very enthusiastic, alarming and truly energizing", while Rose's takeoff was "splendidly dealt with". He emphatically analyzed the scene's plot of a war between "the best beasts in the program history" against the film "Outsider versus Predator".
