The fundamental quarrel from SmackDown was Randy Orton guarding the World Heavyweight Championship against Christian. The storyline began the May 6 scene of "SmackDown", when Orton vanquished Christian to turn into the hero not exactly seven days after Christian had won the title. Christian would then conjure his rematch proviso against Orton at Over the Limit, in which he lost. At Capitol Punishment on June 19, Orton vanquished Christian to hold the title again by sticking him, after the arbitrator neglected to see his foot under the base rope. On the June 24 scene of "SmackDown", Christian requested another endeavor at the title from SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long; his interest was allowed with the stipulation that he could vanquish Kane. Christian lost the match against Kane by exclusion after impedance from Mark Henry. Long at that point made a label group coordinate for later that equivalent scene, setting the group of Christian and Henry against Kane and Orton with a comparable stipulation; Henry stuck Orton in the session. A while later, Long offered Henry an endeavor at the title if Henry could vanquish Orton once more. Henry lost the match by countout after Christian built a diversion. This set up a match among Orton and Christian for the title at Money in the Bank. On the July 8 scene of "SmackDown", Christian's legal counselors in the storyline added a stipulation to the match that if Orton was precluded or there was "poor directing", he would lose the title to Christian.
