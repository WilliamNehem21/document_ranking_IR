As Southern Rhodesia had been the UK's administrative accomplice in shaping the Federation in 1953, it would be unimaginable (or possibly extremely troublesome) for Britain to break up the association without Southern Rhodesia's co-activity. Field could in this manner possibly hamstring the British by declining to go to the gathering until they promised to give his nation full autonomy. As indicated by Field, Smith and other RF lawmakers, Butler made a few such certifications orally to guarantee their co-task at the meeting, yet more than once would not give anything on paper. The Southern Rhodesians guaranteed that Butler advocated his refusal to give a composed guarantee by saying that coupling Whitehall to a record as opposed to his assertion would be against the Commonwealth's "soul of trust"Ã¢ÂÂ a contention that Field inevitably acknowledged. "How about we recall the trust you underlined", Smith cautioned, as indicated by Field's record swaying his finger at Butler; "in the event that you break that you will live to think twice about it." Southern Rhodesia went to the meeting, which was held at Victoria Falls over seven days beginning from 28 June 1963, and in addition to other things it was consented to formally exchange the Federation toward the year's end. In the House of Commons thereafter, Butler straight denied proposals that he had "oiled the wheels" of Federal disintegration with mystery guarantees toward the Southern Rhodesians.
