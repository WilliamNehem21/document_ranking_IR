In around 1921, Wright had started to experience the ill effects of Parkinson's malady, and through the span of his editorship the indications deteriorated. Before the finish of the 1920s he was unfit to sign his name, and by the late 1930s Bill Sprenger was helping him get the chance to work and back home. The main issue with Wright as editorial manager was dated November 1924, and the magazine promptly continued an ordinary month to month plan, with the configuration changing back to mash once more. The compensation rate was at first low, with a top of a large portion of a penny for every word until 1926, when the top rate was expanded to one penny for each word. Some of Popular Fiction Publishing's obligations were satisfied after some time, and the most noteworthy pay rate in the end rose to one and a half pennies for each word. The magazine's spread cost was high for the time. Robert Bloch reviewed that "in the late Thirties of this century...at when most mash periodicals sold for a dime, its cost was a quarter". Albeit Popular Fiction Publishing kept on being situated in Chicago, the article workplaces were in Indianapolis for some time, at two separate locations, however moved to Chicago towards the finish of 1926. After a brief period on North Broadway, the workplace moved to 840 North Michigan Avenue, where it would stay until 1938.
