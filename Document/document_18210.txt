In 1947, at Atalaia in Portugal, brachiosaurid remains were found in layers dating from the Tithonian. Albert-FÃ©lix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyszewski named them as the species "Brachiosaurus atalaiensis" in 1957. Its referral to "Brachiosaurus" was doubted in the 2004 edition of "The Dinosauria" by Paul Upchurch, Barret, and Peter Dodson who listed it as an as yet unnamed brachiosaurid genus. Shortly before the publication of the 2004 book, the species had been placed in its own genus "Lusotitan" by Miguel Telles Antunes and OctÃ¡vio Mateus in 2003. De Lapparent and Zbyszewski had described a series of remains but did not designate a type specimen. Antunes and Mateus selected a partial postcranial skeleton (MIGMÂ 4978, 4798, 4801â4810, 4938, 4944, 4950, 4952, 4958, 4964â4966, 4981â4982, 4985, 8807, 8793â87934) as the lectotype; this specimen includes twenty-eight vertebrae, chevrons, ribs, a possible shoulder blade, humeri, forearm bones, partial left pelvis, lower leg bones, and part of the right ankle. The low neural spines, the prominent deltopectoral crest of the humerus (a muscle attachment site on the upper arm bone), the elongated humerus (very long and slender), and the long axis of the ilium tilted upward indicate that "Lusotitan" is a brachiosaurid, which was confirmed by some later studies, such as an analysis in 2013.
