Viking raids increased in the early 840s on both sides of the English Channel, and in 843 Ãthelwulf was defeated by the companies of 35 Danish ships at Carhampton in Somerset. In 850 sub-king Ãthelstan and Ealdorman Ealhhere of Kent won a naval victory over a large Viking fleet off Sandwich in Kent, capturing nine ships and driving off the rest. Ãthelwulf granted Ealhhere a large estate in Kent, but Ãthelstan is not heard of again, and probably died soon afterwards. The following year the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" records five different attacks on southern England. A Danish fleet of 350 Viking ships took London and Canterbury, and when King Berhtwulf of Mercia went to their relief he was defeated. The Vikings then moved on to Surrey, where they were defeated by Ãthelwulf and his son Ãthelbald at the Battle of Aclea. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" the West Saxon levies "there made the greatest slaughter of a heathen that we have heard tell of up to the present day". The "Chronicle" frequently reported victories during Ãthelwulf's reign won by levies led by ealdormen, unlike the 870s when royal command was emphasised, reflecting a more consensual style of leadership in the earlier period.
