After the 1929 London celebration "The Times" music commentator composed that Delius "has a place with no school, pursues no custom and resembles no other author in the structure, substance or style of his music". This "incredibly individual and individual figure of speech" was, be that as it may, the result of a long melodic apprenticeship, amid which the author consumed numerous impacts. The most punctual critical encounters in his creative advancement came, Delius later stated, from the hints of the estate tunes conveyed down the stream to him at Solano Grove. It was this singing, he told Fenby, that originally gave him the inclination to convey what needs be in music; subsequently, composes Fenby, huge numbers of Delius' initial works are "fragrant of Negro hymnology and people melody", a sound "not heard before in the ensemble, and sometimes since". Delius' nature with "dark" music conceivably originates before his American undertakings; amid the 1870s a famous singing gathering, the Fisk Jubilee Singers from Nashville, Tennessee, visited Britain and Europe, giving a few generally welcomed shows in Bradford. At the point when Delius kept in touch with Elgar in 1933 of the "excellent four-section harmonies" of the dark manor laborers, he may have been unwittingly suggesting the spirituals sung by the Fisk gathering.
