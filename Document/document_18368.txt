Jellicoe's ships, including "Erin", practised gunnery drills on 10â13 January 1915 west of the Orkney and Shetland Islands. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty's battlecruisers but the fleet was too far away to participate in the Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7â10 March, the fleet made a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another cruise took place on 16â19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17â19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 20â21 April.
The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17â19 May and 29â31 May without encountering German vessels. During 11â14 June, the fleet practised gunnery and battle exercises west of the Shetlands and more training off the Shetlands from 11 July. On 2â5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted training exercises and then made another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. "Erin" participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2â5 November. The ship was transferred to the Second Battle Squadron sometime between September and December.
