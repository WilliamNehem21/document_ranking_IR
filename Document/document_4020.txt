The Mount Cayley massif, in rise, is the biggest and most tireless fountain of liquid magma in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It is a very disintegrated stratovolcano made out of dacite and rhyodacite magma that was stored amid three periods of volcanic action. The main eruptive stage began around four million years back with the ejection of dacite magma streams and pyroclastic shake. This brought about the production of the Mount Cayley legitimate. Consequent volcanism amid this volcanic stage developed a huge magma vault. This demonstrations like a volcanic fitting and makes the magma spines that as of now structure apexes on Cayley's tough summit. After the Mount Cayley legitimate was built, magma streams, tephra and welded dacite rubble was ejected. This second period of movement million years back brought about the formation of the Vulcan's Thumb, a rugged volcanic edge on the southern flank of the Mount Cayley legitimate. Protracted dismemberment from an all-encompassing time of disintegration decimated a great part of the first stratovolcano. Volcanic movement after this drawn out time of disintegration created thick dacite magma streams from parasitic vents 300,000ÃÂ years back that stretched out into the Turbid and Shovelnose Creek valleys close to the Squamish River. This along these lines made two minor parasitic magma vaults 200,000ÃÂ years back. These three volcanic occasions rather than a few others around Cayley in that they don't hint at association with chilly ice.
