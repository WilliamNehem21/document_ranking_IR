In 1850, New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson presented enactment for a three-penny piece in .750 fine silver, that is, three sections silver to one section copper (American silver coins were at that point .900 fine). He proposed to offer it in return for the Spanish silver, which would be esteemed at eight reals to the dollar for the reason, higher than the going rate. The new coin would gauge three-tenths as much as the dime, however the corruption of the silver would repay the administration for the misfortunes it would take in recovering the underweight, worn Spanish coins. The three-penny category was picked as it facilitated well with the six and twelve penny esteems frequently allocated the fip and duty. The House of Representatives rather considered enactment to diminish the valuation of the Spanish coins to ten pennies for each genuine, and to strike a twenty-penny piece, of .900 silver, to encourage the trade. Neil Carothers, in his book on little division American cash, proposes that the House's arrangement would have brought about the Spanish coins remaining available for use, and any twenty-penny pieces issued being accumulated or softened. No enactment go in 1850, which saw proceeded with fare of America's silver coinage.
