"Suillellus luridus" is a strong parasite with a thick yellow-olive to olive-darker raised pad formed top that can reach in width. The top shading will in general obscure with age, and locales of red, orange, purple, dark colored, or olive-green can create in development. The top surface is tomentose (smooth), getting to be smoother with maturity, and sticky in wet climate. The pore surface is at first dim red before turning orange-red, and has a lighter-hued zone circling the edge. There are 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3 roundabout pores for each millimeter, and the cylinders are profound. The cylinders are shorter around the top edge and near the stem, where they structure a roundabout sadness. At first light yellow, the cylinders step by step become olive-yellow and after that somewhat blue green upon presentation to air. A trademark include is the nearness of a maroon layer between the cylinders and the substance. The thick stem is tall and wide, and bears a particular orange-red meshlike design on a paler yellowish or ochre foundation. The tissue is yellowish, with red checks in the top, and stains an extreme dull blue when wounded or broken. There is a swoon sharp smell, and the taste is depicted as mellow.
