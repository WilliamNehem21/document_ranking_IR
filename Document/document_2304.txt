With Jock in progressively weakness after the war, the Smith family quickly considered sending Ian to begin a real existence in the United States with the assistance of Jock's sibling Elijah, who had turned into a prosperous New York agent. Smith indicated little enthusiasm for leaving Rhodesia, in any case, and concluded that he would complete at college, at that point get back home and purchase his own homestead. He came back to Rhodes University in mid 1946 to discover the grounds overwhelmed with veterans such as himselfÃ¢ÂÂthere were 400 of them out of scarcely 1,000 understudies. Smith moved toward becoming representative for the college's ex-servicemen, senior understudy of his corridor and executive of the understudies' delegate gathering. He turned down the administration of the paddling club, saying it would be one authoritative duty too much, yet consented to mentor the team. Preparing the rowers under exacting military-style discipline, he drove them to triumph at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the Vaal Dam south of Johannesburg, upstaging the very much liked Wits group, and therefore gotten national-standard varsity praises for paddling, the principal Rhodes understudy ever to do as such. Toward the year's end, having passed the tests to pick up his business degree ("by some wonder", he reviewed), he came back to Southern Rhodesia to think about cultivating at Gwebi Agricultural College, close Salisbury.
