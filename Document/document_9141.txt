The tale of "Sisters on a basic level" was composed by 26 African-American understudies from a tenth grade English class at Jefferson High School after Montgomery and her significant other William Asher, the chief of the scene, had the understudies visit the arrangement of "Charmed". Most understudies at the school were unfit to peruse, compose, or grasp at a secondary school level, with 44% perusing at a third grade level and not many understudies perusing at a dimension a lot higher than that. Sargent said that the understudies, "who may have been stuck in the ghetto for the remainder of their lives, adored "Entranced", and with only a little endorsement and inspiration, woke up on the set." Montgomery considered "Sisters on the most fundamental level" her most loved scene of the arrangement, and said that it "was made in the genuine soul of Christmas ... considered in the picture of blamelessness and loaded up with truth." The scene got the Governors Award at the 23rd Primetime Emmy Awards function in 1971. Montgomery's biographer Herbie Pilato composed that "no scene of the arrangement all the more unmistakably spoke to [the] cry against bias" than "Sisters on the most fundamental level". Pundit Walter Metz commended Asher's decision of camera edges, yet condemned the scene's progressivism as too much wistful and oversimplified.
