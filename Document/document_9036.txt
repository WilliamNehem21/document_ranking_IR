"Advanced Spy"s Ben Rawson-Jones depicted the scene's remain off among Mulder and Scully as "a very tense snapshot of neurosis." A New York "Every day News" audit called the scene "powerful and unpleasant", and said that its plot "was deserving of privileged section into "The Twilight Zone"". Matt Haigh called it "an amazingly retaining and exciting scene" on the Den of Geek site, taking note of its obligation to "The Thing", and Juliette Harrisson called "Ice" the "best" independent scene of the main season. On the TV Squad blog, Anna Johns called it "an awesome scene" with an "astounding" opening. UGO Networks called the scene's worms among the arrangement's best "Beasts of-the-Week" and the reason for "much pointed-firearms hostility". In Tor.com, Meghan Deans thought about the scene where Mulder and Scully investigate each other for disease to a comparable scene in "Pilot"; in "Ice", the two characters were similarly powerless and (in contrast to the pilot scene) Scully was not depicted as "a simpleton". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Needing to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen", gave the scene five out of five stars. They called it "the most compelling scene at any point made", taking note of that the arrangement repeated its equation a few times amid its run. Shearman felt that despite the fact that their content was subsidiary, Morgan and Wong made "a urgent story" by joining essential subjects from "The Thing" with a "balanced" cast of characters.
