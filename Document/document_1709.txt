On 5 April 1944, Blamey left for San Francisco on board SS "Lurline" for the main leg of a voyage to go to the 1944 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London as a major aspect of Curtin's gathering. The adventure was made via ocean and rail because of Curtin's dread of flying. Additionally ready the ship were American military staff coming back to the United States, and somewhere in the range of 40 Australian war ladies. Blamey "was constantly appealing to ladies and pulled in by them. Propelling years had not diminished either his preference for desirous experiences or his ability to appreciate them", and he carried with him a few instances of spirits. The unruly goings-on in Blamey's lodge did not charm him to the Prime Minister, who was a transformed drunkard. The gathering headed out via train to Washington, DC, where Blamey was heartily welcomed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and advised the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the advancement of the war in SWPA. In London Blamey had a progression of gatherings with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, and was advised on Operation Overlord by General Sir Bernard Montgomery and Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder. Blamey was frustrated to need to turn down an idea to go with the attack as a visitor of General Dwight Eisenhower in light of the fact that Curtin expected that the intrusion would prompt retaliatory German bombarding, and needed to be far away before it begun.
