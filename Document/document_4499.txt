In March 1911, the armada led practices in the Skagerrak and Kattegat. "Schlesien" and the remainder of the armada got British and American maritime squadrons at Kiel in June and July. The year's harvest time moves were kept to the Baltic and the Kattegat, amid which another armada audit was held so as to plan for an Austro-Hungarian designation that included Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. On 3 November 1911, "Schlesien" was exchanged to II Battle Squadron with the remainder of her sister ships; as of now, she exchanged back to Kiel, where II Squadron was based. In mid-1912, because of the Agadir Crisis, the late spring journey was restricted to the Baltic, to abstain from uncovering the armada amid the time of elevated strain with Britain and France. The armada from that point held the yearly pre-winter moves in August and September. A winter journey in the Baltic pursued toward the year's end. In 1913 the equivalent uneventful example pursued. On 14 July 1914, the yearly summer journey to Norway started. The risk of war amid the July Crisis constrained Kaiser Wilhelm II to end the voyage after just two weeks; before the finish of July the armada was back in port.
