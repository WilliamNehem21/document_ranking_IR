On lap 33, Sorenson kept running into the back of Dale Jarrett's vehicle, which spun in reverse into the turn four divider, provoking the third alert. Jarrett resigned from the race when he crashed into his carport. All drivers chose to make pit stops for fuel under alert. Riggs kept up his lead at the lap-39 restart, trailed by Kahne and Bowyer. Johnson stretched out beyond Sadler to move into eighth on lap 44. On lap 46, a fourth alert was given; in the wake of leaving turn two, Todd Kluever was hit by partner Greg Biffle and spun on the backstretch, causing Ken Schrader and Petty to crash into Kluever. Michael Waltrip hit the stopping point in shirking. Most drivers (counting Riggs) made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt drove at the lap-53 restart with the non-halting vehicles of Edwards, Newman, Biffle and Sorenson tailing him. Riggs moved again into third spot on lap 59 in the wake of passing Biffle and Newman. By lap 66, Earnhardt held a 1.78-second preferred standpoint over Edwards. Two laps later, Riggs disregarded Edwards to come in just short of the win. Riggs shut the hole to Earnhardt, and was 1.5 seconds behind by lap 75. Green-banner pit stops started three laps later, with Earnhardt ceasing on lap 79, giving the lead back to Riggs. Kahne and Riggs made pit stops on the 85th lap for scraped right-hand tires.
