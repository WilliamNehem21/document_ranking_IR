In 1929, Allan Williams set an eating area in favor of the street along USÃÂ 16 south of Saranac. Williams was the Ionia County engineer responsible for the different streets in the province, and that area is "the thing that many consider to be the country's first roadside table". The primary change to the USÃÂ 16 steering was made in 1933 when the thruway was moved to sidestep Farmington, with the old directing held as a state parkway. The following year, in 1934, M-126 was made among Nunica and Muskegon. In 1940, USÃÂ 16 was rerouted to supplant M-126, and the previous course of USÃÂ 16 among Nunica and Grand Haven was redesignated M-104. Two further changes amid 1941Ã¢ÂÂ 42 rerouted the western end in Muskegon to finish at the vehicle ship docks. Beforehand, drivers needed to explore from the western end along different streets to the ship association with the remainder of USÃÂ 16 in Wisconsin. The second change steered Bypass USÃÂ 16 (Byp. USÃÂ 16) along 28th Street and Wilson (already the South Beltline and West Beltline areas of M-114) in the Grand Rapids territory. The USÃÂ 16 assignment was moved in 1953 to supplant Byp. USÃÂ 16 while the previous directing through downtown Grand Rapids was redesignated Business USÃÂ 16 (Bus. USÃÂ 16).
