Dissimilar to Pampa who commends Arjuna and Karna in his composition, Ranna praises his supporter King Satyashraya and positively thinks about him to Bhima, whom he crowns toward the finish of the Mahabharata war. He calls Bhima's foe Duryodhana "mahanubhava" ("an extraordinary individual"). The work contains probably the most punctual instances of elegiac sections (called "shoka gita" or "charama gita") in the Kannada language, noted among which is one piece that depicts the unfortunate groan (called "karuna rasa" or "supposition of poignancy") of Duryodhana on observing the killed assortments of his sibling Duhshasana, his indistinguishable companion in euphoria and distress, Karna, and Arjuna's valorous child Abhimanyu. The impact given to the composition, the language, the word usage and the style kept up all through the portrayal has earned Ranna a spot among the most striking creators of Kannada writing. Credited additionally to Ranna is the most punctual accessible lexicon in Kannada language called the "Rannakanda" (990), of which just eleven refrains still exist. His other eminent works were the "Chakeresvaracharita" and the "Parashuramacharitha". As per student of history Suryanath Kamath, the last work, which is presently lost, may have been a tribute of Chavundaraya, whom the artist appreciated. For his artistic commitments, the title "Kavi Chakravathi" ("Emperor among artists") was presented to Ranna by his benefactor ruler.
