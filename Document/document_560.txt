The ibis was ensured by its religious noteworthiness, and a celebration was held every year to commend its arrival north. The Turkish ibis populace was focused close to the community of Birecik in the south-east of the nation, and amid the principal half of the twentieth century, the Birecik province kept up a generally steady populace of around 500 reproducing sets, achieving an expected all out populace of around 3,000 around 1930. By the 1970s, numbers had definitely declined and a hostage rearing project was started in 1977 with one grown-up pair and nine chicks taken from nature. This program to a great extent neglected to return the decrease; there were 400 flying creatures in 1982, five sets in 1986, and seven sets in 1987. Just three flying creatures came back from their wintering grounds in 1989, and only one out of 1990. The returning flying creatures kicked the bucket before they could duplicate, in this way rendering the species wiped out in the wild in Turkey starting at 1992. When the wild Turkish populace progressed toward becoming non-reasonable, the state was kept up as a group which was free-flying for a large portion of the year yet confined in harvest time to forestall movement.
