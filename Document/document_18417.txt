The pied currawong is an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, eating fruit and berries as well as preying on many invertebrates, and smaller vertebrates, mostly juvenile birds and bird eggs, although they may take healthy adult birds up to the size of a Crested Pigeon on occasion. Currawongs will hunt in trees, snatching birds and eggs from nests, as well as insects and berries from trees. They also hunt in the air and on the ground. Insects predominate in the diet during summer months, and fruit during the winter. They will often scavenge, eating scraps and rubbish and can be quite bold when seeking food from people, lingering around picnic areas and bird-feeding trays. Beetles and ants are the most common types of insects consumed. Pied currawongs have been recorded taking mice, as well as chickens and turkeys from farms. The pied currawong consumes fruit, including a wide variety of figs, such as the Moreton Bay ("Ficus macrophylla"), Port Jackson ("F. rubiginosa"), Banyan ("F. virens") and Strangler fig ("F. watkinsiana"), as well as lillypillies ("Syzygium" species), white cedar ("Melia azedarach"), plum pine ("Podocarpus elatus"), and geebungs ("Persoonia" species). Other fruit is also sought after, and currawongs have been known to raid orchards, eating apples, pears, strawberries, grapes, stone fruit, citrus, and corn. Pied currawongs have been responsible for the spread of the invasive ornamental "Asparagus aethiopicus" (often called "A. densiflorus") in the Sydney area, the weedy privet species "Ligustrum lucidum" and "L.Â sinense", and firethorn species "Pyracantha angustifolia" and "P.Â rogersiana" around Armidale.
