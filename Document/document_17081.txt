After playing in one Test match against the South African team on a stopover when returning from England to Australia, Trumble retired from Test cricket, aged 35. When Australia lost to the English tourists in the First Test in Sydney in 1903â04, Trumble was persuaded to return for the Second Test under the captaincy of Noble. He was immediately successful taking 4Â wickets for 107Â runs in the first innings and 5 for 34 in the second, but was unable to prevent England from winning the Test by 185Â runs Selected for the remaining four Tests, his 24Â wickets in fourÂ Tests made Trumble the most successful Australian bowler in the series. The writer Roland Perry described Trumble's final Test match as "the most dramatic and memorable farewell performance ever by a bowler". In front of his home town supporters in Melbourne, he took 7Â wickets for 28Â runs, including a hat-trick, to bowl Australia to victory; "Wisden" describing his bowling in the second innings as "practically unplayable". The hat-trick, his second in Test cricket, consisted of the dismissals of Bernard Bosanquet, Plum Warner and Dick Lilley on 7 March. He went on to take the wicket of Ted Arnold, ending the match and his career in international cricket.
