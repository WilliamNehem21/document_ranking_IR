The Acra was not the main Hellenistic fortification in Jerusalem. Sources demonstrate that a prior bastion, the Ptolemaic Baris, had likewise involved an area sitting above the Temple's areas. In spite of the fact that the definite area of the Baris is still discussed, it is commonly acknowledged to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later involved by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris tumbled to AntiochusÃÂ III at the turn of the second century BCE and is missing from all records of the Maccabean Revolt. In spite of the stories which have the Acra built inside an extremely brief time-range, it was in any case sufficiently imposing to climate extensive stretches of attack. These components, combined with references in which the Baris was itself called an "acra", have driven some to recommend that the Baris and the Acra were in certainty a similar structure. Albeit both 1 Maccabees and Josephus appear to depict the Acra as another development, this might not have been the situation. "Artifacts of the Jews" 12:253 might be meant give the feeling that the "reprobate or fiendish" had "remained" as opposed to "stayed" in the stronghold, which could be interpreted as meaning that the Acra had been remaining before the revolt and that just the Macedonian battalion was new.
