In January 2010, Santa Monica's studio chief John Hight told video-gaming blog Joystiq that "while "Lord of War III" will finish up the set of three, it won't spell the finish of the establishment" and said "We will be extremely cautious about what we do straightaway." From April 2011 until April 2012, a few sources guaranteed that a fourth fundamental section would discharge at some point in 2012 and would include an online part. On April 12, 2012, Sony discharged a mystery picture on its official PlayStation Facebook page, which was trailed by the diversion's declaration on April 19, however Amazon released the declaration the day preceding. The trailer declared Todd Papy, who had filled in as an architect on "Lord of War" and "Divine force of War II" and as Design Director on "Divine force of War III", as Game Director. David Jaffe affirmed that "Lord of War III" Game Director Stig Asmussen did not come back to coordinate this diversion since he was taking a shot at another venture at Santa Monica. The declaration trailer was described by Linda Hunt; it alludes to a period before Kratos turned into the Ghost of Sparta and was not "bound in blood". The declaration formally affirmed that the diversion's title would be "Lord of War: Ascension". Papy said the diversion was not titled "Lord of War IV" to maintain a strategic distance from perplexity since it is a prequel, as opposed to a continuation, to the set of three. The name was picked in light of the fact that it supplements the story and the extra multiplayer segment; as indicated by Papy, in this mode, players are "fundamentally climbing from an obscure saint to a god".<ref name="4/30"></ref>
