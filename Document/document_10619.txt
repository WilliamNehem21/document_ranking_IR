Reclamation chip away at the patios encompassing the Shrine amid the 1990s raised by and by the likelihood of exploiting the space under the Shrine: as the Shrine had been based on an empty fake slope, the undercroft (in spite of the fact that at the time loaded up with rubble from the development) gave a vast space to advancement. At an arranged expense of $5.5 million, the new advancement was proposed to give a guest's middle, organization offices and an improved access to the Shrine's tomb, the same number of the rest of the veterans and their families found the stairs at the conventional formal passageway hard to climb. In redeveloping the site, exceptional thought was given to the situating of the new passageway. The first arrangement was to utilize a passage from the east, however this was disposed of as it had "no feeling of function". Rather it was chosen to create two new patios, and spot the new display under the northern advances. Development started in 2002, with the plan by Melbourne engineers Ashton Raggatt McDougall, and the new territories were opened in August 2003. The finished undertaking was granted the Victorian Architecture Medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 2004.
