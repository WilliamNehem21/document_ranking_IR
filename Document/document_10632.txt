Redevelopment of the Witton End stand started in the late spring of 1976, a year after Villa came back to the First Division following eight years away. The stand had not seen any significant work since 1924, and its back remained a hill of earth. Introductory redesigns saw the leveling of the earth and new solid porches built on the lower level in anticipation of the development of an upper level. Stage two started in February 1977 and was authoritatively opened in late October. The stand's structure and fittings were great for the time, including curiosities, for example, an 'AV' logo illuminated in hued seats and a twofold line of official boxes. Just as the new Witton End stand, renamed the North Stand, Villa Park experienced further remodels all through the ground. The expense of the work was ÃÂ£1.3ÃÂ million. Subsequently, and likewise with the development of the Trinity Road Stand fifty years sooner, Villa were again troubled with obligation. An inward examination found that ÃÂ£700,000 of the ÃÂ£1.3ÃÂ million worth of bills were unaccounted for. A later report by bookkeepers Deloitte Haskins and Sells found that the bills were swelled by just 10% yet that there were "not kidding ruptures of suggested codes of training and poor site supervision."
