The Huskies were unable to match their early success in the second half of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38â12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12â10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, including one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40â16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No.Â 25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35â13 after leading 10â0 at the end of the first quarter and 13â7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39â14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17â13) and No.Â 23-ranked Pittsburgh (34â10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7â5, 3â4 within the Big East conference.
