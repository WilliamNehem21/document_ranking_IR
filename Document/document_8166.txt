Gibson's second arrangement, the "Scaffold set of three", is made out of "Virtual Light" (1993), an "obscurely funny urban investigator story", "Idoru" (1996), and "Every one of Tomorrow's Parties" (1999). The first and third books in the set of three focus on San Francisco soon; every one of the three investigate Gibson's repetitive subjects of mechanical, physical, and profound amazing quality in a more grounded, matter-of-truth style than his first set of three. Salon.com's Andrew Leonard takes note of that in the Bridge set of three, Gibson's reprobates change from worldwide organizations and man-made brains of the Sprawl set of three to the mass mediaÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ to be specific newspaper TV and the clique of big name. "Virtual Light" portrays an "end-organize free enterprise, in which private endeavor and the benefit intention are taken to their obvious end result", as indicated by one survey. This contention on the broad communications as the normal development of free enterprise is the opening line of the significant Situationist work "The Society of the Spectacle". Leonard's audit called "Idoru" an "arrival to frame" for Gibson, while faultfinder Steven Poole attested that "Every one of Tomorrow's Parties" denoted his improvement from "sci-fi superstar to wry humanist of the not so distant future."
