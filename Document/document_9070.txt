The advanced look for the "Mary Rose" was started by the Southsea part of the British Sub-Aqua Club in 1965 as a major aspect of an undertaking to find wrecks in the Solent. The undertaking was under the administration of antiquarian, writer and novice jumper Alexander McKee. Another gathering driven by Lieutenant-Commander Alan Bax of the Royal Navy, supported by the Committee for Nautical Archeology in London, likewise framed an inquiry group. At first the two groups had contrasting perspectives on where to discover the disaster area, yet inevitably united. In February 1966 a graph from 1841 was discovered that denoted the places of the "Mary Rose" and a few different wrecks. The graphed position harmonized with a channel (one of the scour pits) that had just been situated by McKee's group, and an unequivocal area was at long last settled at a position 3ÃÂ km (1.9ÃÂ mi) south of the passageway to Portsmouth Harbor () in water with a profundity of (36ÃÂ feet) at low tide. Jumping on the site started in 1966 and a sonar check by Harold Edgerton in 1967Ã¢ÂÂ 68 uncovered some sort of covered element. In 1970 a free timber was found and on 1971, the principal auxiliary subtleties of the covered body were distinguished after they were in part revealed by winter storms.
