"Chesapeake"s ostensible rating is expressed as either 36 or 38ÃÂ guns. Initially assigned as a 44-firearm deliver, her update by Fox prompted a rerating, obviously dependent on her littler measurements when contrasted with "Congress" and "Star grouping". Joshua Humphreys may have rerated "Chesapeake" to 38ÃÂ guns, or Secretary Stoddert rerated "Congress" and "Group of stars" to 38 weapons since they were bigger than "Chesapeake", which was appraised to 36 firearms. The latest data on her rating is from the "Lexicon of American Naval Fighting Ships", which states she was rerated "from 44ÃÂ guns to 36, in the end expanded to 38". Her weapon rating remained a matter of perplexity all through her vocation; Fox utilized a 44-firearm rating in his correspondence with Secretary Stoddert. In planning for the War of 1812 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton guided Captain Samuel Evans to enroll the quantity of crew members required for a 44-firearm transport. Hamilton was redressed by William Bainbridge in a letter expressing, "There is a misstep in the team requested for the "Chesapeake", as it squares with in number the groups of our 44-weapon frigates, while the "Chesapeake" is of the class of the "Congress" and "Heavenly body"." Lastly, when sold for scrap by the Royal Navy in 1819, she was appraised as a 48-firearm send.
