In an accumulation of Renaissance metalwork Benvenuto Cellini (1500Ã¢ÂÂ 71) speaks to a definitive attribution, as his authentic functions as a goldsmith are rarer than artworks by Giorgione. In his 1902 list Charles Hercules Read makes reference to that huge numbers of the pendants had been ascribed to Cellini, yet avoids underwriting the attributions. A little silver hand-chime (WB.95) had a place with Horace Walpole, who adulated it indulgently in a letter as "the "uniquest" thing on the planet, a silver ringer for an inkstand made by Benvenuto Cellini. It influences one to trust all the luxurious encomiums he gives on himself; without a doubt so does his Perseus. All things considered, "my" chime is in the best taste, and is swarmed by caterpillars, reptiles, grasshoppers, flies, and masques, that you would take it for one of the maladies of Egypt. They are all "in altissimo", nay "in out-issimo relievo" but then practically imperceptible yet with a glass. Such foliage, such fruitage!" However Baron Ferdinand had understood that it was bound to be by Wenzel Jamnitzer, goldsmith to the Emperor Rudolf II, to whom it is still credited. Another piece never again credited to Cellini is a substantial bronze entryway knocker, with a figure of Neptune, 40ÃÂ cm high, and weighing more than 11 kilos.
