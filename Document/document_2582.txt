In May 1842 when the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island reached a critical stage, Tyler considered the solicitation of the representative and assembly to send in government troops to help smother it. The extremists under Thomas Dorr had outfitted themselves and proposed to introduce another state constitution. Prior to such acts, Rhode Island had been following a similar protected structure that was set up in 1663. Tyler called for quiet on the two sides, and suggested that the senator extend the establishment to give most men a chance to cast a ballot. Tyler guaranteed that in the event that a real insurgence should break out in Rhode Island he would utilize power to help the ordinary, or Charter, government. He clarified that government help would be offered just to put down a revolt once in progress, and would not be accessible until savagery had occurred. In the wake of tuning in to reports from his private operators, Tyler chose that the 'uncivilized collections' had scattered and communicated his trust in a "temper of appeasement just as of vitality and choice" without need of government powers. The radicals fled the state when the state local army walked against them, however the episode prompted more extensive suffrage in the state.
