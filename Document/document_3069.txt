Griswold kept altering and contributing artistic analysis for different productions, both full-time and independent, including 22ÃÂ months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with "The International Magazine". There, he worked with donors including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt and John R. Thompson. In the November 10, 1855, issue of "The Criterion", Griswold secretly assessed the principal release of Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass", announcing: "It is difficult to picture how any man's extravagant could have considered such a mass of moronic foulness". Griswold charged that Whitman was blameworthy of "the most wretched imaginings and shamefullest permit", a "corrupting, brutal sexiness." Referring to Whitman's verse, Griswold said he left "this social occasion of filth to the laws whichÃÂ ... must have the ability to smother such gross profanity." Whitman later incorporated Griswold's audit in another version of "Leaves of Grass". He finished his audit with an expression in Latin alluding to "that terrible sin, among Christians not to be named", the stock expression since quite a while ago connected with Christian judgments of homosexuality. Griswold was the primary individual in the nineteenth century to openly point to and stress the topic of sensual want and acts between men in Whitman's verse. More thoughtfulness regarding that part of Whitman's verse would just surface late in the nineteenth century.
