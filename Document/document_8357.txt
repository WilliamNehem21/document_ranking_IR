In November 1852 the Butlers had a child, George Gray Butler, trailed by a second, Arthur StanleyÃ¢ÂÂknown as StanleyÃ¢ÂÂin May 1854. Head servant's later recollections of Oxford were of a closeted and misanthrope network ailing in family life; she was frequently the main female at get-togethers and would tune in outrage to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz depicts as "the open acknowledgment of the twofold standard by the men of their word of the college". Head servant was annoyed by a talk in regards to the production in 1853 of Elizabeth Gaskell's tale "Ruth" in which the champion is tempted by a rich person and in this manner surrendered. Steward saw that the male conversationalists thought of it as common that an "ethical slip by in a lady was talked about as a gigantically more terrible thing than in a man"; she chose not to voice her sentiments on the point but rather "to talk little with men, however much with God". As an increasingly down to earth measure sheÃ¢ÂÂand GeorgeÃ¢ÂÂstarted to help huge numbers of the fallen lady of Oxford and welcomed some to live in their home. One case in which they were included concerned a young lady serving a jail sentence at Newgate Prison. She had been lured by a college wear who had in this way relinquished her; the lady had killed her child despondently. The Butlers reached the legislative leader of Newgate to mastermind her to remain in their home toward the finish of her sentence.
