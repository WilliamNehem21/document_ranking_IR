Skelton was eager to consult with MGM to broaden the understanding gave he would get the privilege to seek after TV. This time the studio was happy to allow it, making Skelton the main major MGM identity with the benefit. The 1950 exchanges enabled him to start working in TV starting September 30, 1951. Amid the last segment of his agreement with the studio, Skelton was working in radio and on TV notwithstanding films. He would proceed to show up in movies, for example, Jack Donohue's "The Yellow Cab Man" (1950), Roy Rowland and Buster Keaton's "Reason My Dust" (1951), Charles Walters' "Texas Carnival" (1951), Mervyn LeRoy's "Stunning to Look At" (1952), Robert Z. Leonard's "The Clown" (1953) and "The Great Diamond Robbery" (1954), and Norman Z. McLeod's inadequately gotten "Open Pigeon No. 1" (1957), his last significant film job, which started by chance from a scene of the TV treasury arrangement "Peak!". In a 1956 meeting, he said he could never work at the same time in every one of the three media again. Subsequently, Skelton would make just several minor appearances in movies after this, including playing a cantina alcoholic in "Around the globe in Eighty Days" (1956), a card shark in "Sea's 11" (1960), and a Neanderthal man in "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" (1965).
