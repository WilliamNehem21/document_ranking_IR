The gills are normally thin and gathered together, with an extensively adnate to almost decurrent connection to the stem and arched edges. They are a colorless darker when youthful, getting to be brownish at development. Some short gills, called lamellulae, don't expand altogether from the top edge to the stem, and are intercalated among the more drawn out gills. The stem ranges from long, thick at the summit, and remains break even with in width all through or is marginally augmented descending. At first strong, it ends up empty from the base up as it develops. The membranous ring is situated on the upper portion of the stem close to the top, however might be sloughed off and missing in more established examples. Its shading is at first whitish or light dark colored, however normally shows up a darker corroded darker in develop examples that have dropped spores on it. Over the dimension of the ring, the stem surface has a fine whitish powder and is paler than the top; beneath the ring it is darker down to the rosy darker to bistre base. The lower bit of the stem has a meager covering of pale fibrils which in the long run vanish and don't leave any scales. The spore print is corroded dark colored.
