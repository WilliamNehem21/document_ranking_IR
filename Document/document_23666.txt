The origin of the name Parrett is unclear, but several derivations from the Celtic languages used in Wales have been suggested. Priestley-Evans suggests, "Parrett has been said to be a form of the Welsh "pared", a partition, and that it was the name which the Welsh people of Somerset and Devon gave to that river because it was at one time the dividing line between themselves and the Saxons". Another spelling, "parwydydd", is also translated as partition. Another explanation from Welsh, "Peraidd", meaning "the sweet or delicious river", has also been suggested. An alternative explanation, based on Old English, is a derivation from "Pedair" or "Pedride" from "pedr", meaning four and the Old Cornish "Rit" meaning flow, which in this case would relate to the four flows or streams: the Tone, Yeo, Isle and Parrett. This is based on the explanation given in Ekwall's 1928 book "English River Names". Whichever derivation is correct, the name Parrett and its spelling variations have been in use since the Anglo-Saxon era, as evidenced by the addition of "-tun" onto river names as seen in the local towns North Petherton and South Petherton. The spelling "Pedred" and "Pedrida" are also mentioned in connection with the Parrett. The Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names states only that the name is a 'pre-English river-name of obscure origin'.
