During the action, "Tiger" was hit by six German shells, the most significant of which was a shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. "Tiger"s repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, "Tiger"s own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 shells fired, scoring one hit each on "Seydlitz" and . Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a "poltroon" and adding "The "Tiger"s gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to have had a lot of practice.". In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through "Tiger"s part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am quite ready to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success." The ship was given a refit in December 1915.
