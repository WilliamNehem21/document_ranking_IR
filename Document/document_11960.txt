Fifteen unique tracks were considered for consideration on the collection, which Reznor depicted as "Very reasonable. Very boisterous. Screwing cool." Reznor additionally portrayed the collection as a "montage of sound kind of thing", refering to melodic motivation from early Public Enemy records, explicitly the generation systems of The Bomb Squad. The majority of "Year Zero"s melodic components were made by Reznor exclusively on his PC, instead of the instrument-substantial "With Teeth". AllMusic's survey portrayed the collection's PC blended sound: "guitars squall against glitches, signals, pops, and blotches of foggy sonic assaults. Percussion poses a potential threat, twisted, natural, circled, screwed, spindled and broken." Many surveys of the collection contrasted the collection's electronic sound with prior Nine Inch Nails discharges, for example, "The Downward Spiral" and "The Fragile", while differentiating its intensely adjusted sounds to the more "natural" approach of "With Teeth". Numerous faultfinders likewise remarked on the collection's general tone, including depictions, for example, "loads of silver and dim feeling" and reference to the collection's "slanted tone". "The New York Times" survey portrayed the collection's sound by saying "Hard beats are relaxed with contortion, static pads the fits of rage, subtle bass lines drift underneath the surface." The article proceeded to depict singular tracks: "And as normal the music is stuffed with subtleties: "Meet Your Master" experiences no less than three cycles of rot and resurrection; some portion of the enjoyment of "The Warning" is following the regularly changing timbres."
