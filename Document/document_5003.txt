From nearly the beginning of his vocation Barbirolli was a successive account craftsman. As a youthful cellist he made four records for Edison Bell in 1911, with piano joining by his sister Rosa, and as a major aspect of the Kutcher and the Music Society string groups of four he recorded music by Mozart, Purcell, Vaughan Williams and others in 1925 and 1926. As a conductor he started recording in 1927 for the National Gramophonic Society (a branch of "The Gramophone)." Among his records from that period was the first to be made of Elgar's "Presentation and Allegro for Strings". On hearing it, the author stated, "I'd never acknowledged it was such a major work." Elgar, in spite of a broad discography as a conductor, never recorded the work himself, and some have estimated that "the expansiveness, respectability and expressive verse" of Barbirolli's elucidation left the writer unwilling to contend. In 1928 Barbirolli made a few accounts for the Edison Bell name. That year, he started his long relationship with the His Master's Voice (HMV) mark. Following the LSO show at which he had remained in for Beecham, he was drawn closer by Fred Gaisberg, the head recording maker for HMV who marked him for his organization without further ado thereafter. A HMV associate of Gaisberg depicted Barbirolli as "a fortune", since he "could go with Chaliapin without inciting a commotion, win brilliant feelings from Jascha Heifetz, Artur Rubinstein, Fritz Kreisler and Pablo Casals, and lead one of the best recorded exhibitions of the Quintet from "Meistersinger"".
