Nirvana at last picked Albini to record its third collection. Albini had a notoriety for being a principled and obstinate individual in the American free music scene. While there was hypothesis that the band picked Albini to record the collection because of his underground accreditations, Cobain told "Solicitation" magazine in 1993, "Generally I needed to work with him since he happened to create two of my most loved records, which were "Surfer Rosa" [by Pixies] and "Case" [by The Breeders]." Inspired by those collections, Cobain needed to use Albini's procedure of catching the characteristic vibe of a room through the use and position of a few mouthpieces, something past Nirvana makers had been loath to attempting. Months before the trio had even drawn nearer Albini about the account, bits of gossip circled that he was slated to record the collection. Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying contribution, just to get a call from Nirvana's administration a couple of days after the fact about the undertaking. Despite the fact that he believed the gathering to be "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox" and "an unremarkable adaptation of the Seattle sound", Albini revealed to Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he acknowledged on the grounds that he felt frustrated about the band individuals, whom he saw to be "indistinguishable kind of individuals from all the little rotisserie groups I manage", helpless before their record organization. Prior to the beginning of account sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. Consequently, Albini sent Cobain a duplicate of the PJ Harvey collection "Free of Me" to give him a thought of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.
