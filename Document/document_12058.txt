In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany to acquire Emperor Henry III's assistance in returning Edward the Exile, child of Edmund Ironside, to England. Edmund (ruled 1016) was a senior stepbrother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's child Edward was in Hungary with King Andrew I, having left England as a baby after his dad's demise and the increase of Cnut as King of England. In this mission Ealdred was to some degree fruitful and acquired understanding into the working of the German church amid a stay of a year with Hermann II, the Archbishop of Cologne. He likewise was awed with the structures he saw, and later joined a portion of the German styles into his own developments. The principle target of the mission, be that as it may, was to verify the arrival of Edward; however this bombed, principally in light of the fact that Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were stressed, and the head was not able or reluctant to help Ealdred. Ealdred had the capacity to find that Edward was alive, and had a spot at the Hungarian court. Albeit a few sources express that Ealdred went to the royal celebration of Emperor Henry IV, this is beyond the realm of imagination, as on the date that Henry was delegated, Ealdred was in England blessing an abbot.
