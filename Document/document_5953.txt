The show highlights exemplary Western themes, for example, train thefts and gunfighter standoffs, in mix with atypical components. A significant part of the arrangement is dedicated to the sci-fi plot encompassing the Orb, and it is this blend of the Western sort with dream that has helped "Brisco" keep up its clique status. In pretty much every scene, the characters find or are gone up against by incredible innovation. In the pilot scene, Brisco and Professor Wickwire alter a rocket to keep running on train tracks. In the scene "Brisco For the Defense", Brisco utilizes a slide projector to demonstrate a preliminary jury unique finger impression proof. Educator Wickwire returns ordinarily in the arrangement to help with innovation, incorporating tinkering with bikes and protecting the saints with a helium-filled dirigible. Campbell told "Starlog" magazine, "It's sort of Jules Verne meets "The Wild West"." The nearness of cutting edge innovation in a Victorian period Western places the arrangement in the steampunk kind; it is one of only a handful couple of such shows to have disclosed on prime-time TV. No less than 33% of the show's scenes contain steampunk or Weird West components. However "innovation out-of-time" as often as possible barges in into the plots of "Brisco", the incredible machines or techniques seldom show up once more. A portion of these out-of-time advancements were obsolete renderings of those predominant in the twentieth century, and two film analysts, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, recommend that devotees of the show might be bewildered that such innovations, so helpful in their own lives, are not abused further.
