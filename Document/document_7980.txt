The biggest of the red robins, the fire robin is long. It has a more thin form than different individuals from the class "Petroica", with moderately long wings and neck and little head. The male is effectively recognized by the brilliant orange-red plumage of the throat, bosom and midriff. The crown, scruff, ear coverts, hindneck, and sides of neck are dim dark, and legends and jaw are a dim dark. The dark quills of the sides of the crown might be suffused with dull orange. The remainder of the upperparts, involving the wings, back and tail, are dim. There is a little white frontal spot over the bill, and the wing bar and external tail shafts are white. The quills of the back midsection, flanks and vent are white with dark bases. The female is obviously huedÃ¢ÂÂpale dark colored generally speaking, and a lighter buff underneath. The back stomach, flanks and vent are grayish. As in the male, plumes in favor of the crown might be suffused with a dull orange, and this may likewise happen with bosom quills. There are little grayish checks on the wings or more the bill. The bill, legs, feet and paws are dark, and the eyes dull darker. A fire robin with an all lemon-yellow bosom and generally female plumage was seen in a little run of fire robins close Swansea in eastern Tasmania in September 1950.
