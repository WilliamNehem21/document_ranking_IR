As indicated by student of history Alfred Bellinger, Antiochus XII may have gotten help from Ptolemaic Egypt to pick up his royal position. This view is reflected in Antiochus XII's strategies, which were focused at the south in Nabataea and Judaea, yet not towards development inside the kingdom of Syria. His domain was restricted to inward Syria, focused on Damascus, which filled in as his capital and essential mint. Antiochus XII likewise controlled over the town of Gadara, administered by an authority named Philotas. In 100 BC, Gadara had been vanquished by the Hasmonean ruler of Judea Alexander Jannaeus, who somewhat crushed its dividers, however it was recovered by the Seleucids in 93 BC. Gadara held extraordinary key significance for Syria as it filled in as a noteworthy military center point for tasks in the south. Controlling it was fundamental to the war exertion against the Judaeans, which drove Antiochus to modify the city's guards in 228 SE (85/84 BC). Antiquarian Aryeh Kasher recommended that Antiochus XII burrowed what the main century history specialist Josephus called the "channel of Antiochus" (or valley of Antiochus) to shield Damascus from the Nabataeans; the channel was most likely situated in the Hula Valley.
