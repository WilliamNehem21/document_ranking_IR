To keep up the quick shooting pace Eastwood requested, Owens decided to generally abstain from utilizing bluescreen innovation, as the procedure can be tedious and hard to light. He rather utilized rotoscoping, the procedure whereby impacts are drawn straightforwardly onto live activity shots. Rotoscoping is more costly than bluescreen, however the strategy had demonstrated dependable for Eastwood when he utilized it on "Banners of Our Fathers"ÃÂ (2006) to abstain from shooting against bluescreen on a peak. For Owens, the lighting was better, and he considered rotoscoping to be "quicker, simpler and increasingly characteristic". Owens utilized bluescreen in just a couple of areas, for example, at the finishes of backlot boulevards where it would not affect the lighting. The Universal Studios backlot had been utilized for such a large number of movies that Owens thought it essential to camouflage recognizable design however much as could reasonably be expected, so some closer view and center separation structures were swapped. One of his most loved impacts shots was a scene in which Collins leaves a taxi before the police headquarters. The scene was shot primarily against bluescreen; just Jolie, the walkway, the taxi and an additional were genuine. The finished shot highlights the full scope of impacts procedures utilized in the film: advanced additional items in the closer view, set augmentations, and PC produced vehicles.
