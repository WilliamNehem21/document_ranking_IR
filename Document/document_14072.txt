In a matter of seconds before the finish of the 1988Ã¢ÂÂ 89 customary season, Flames general chief Cliff Fletcher declared that he had achieved a concurrence with Soviet experts that permitted Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first run through an individual from the Soviet national group was allowed to play for a non-Soviet group. Not long after, Soviet players started to flood into the NHL. Groups foreseen that there would be a convergence of Soviet players during the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were chosen in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. The whole "KLM" line, the Soviet group's top line, joined the NHL in 1989 as Vladimir Krutov and Igor Larionov played for the Canucks, while Sergei Makarov went to Calgary. Makarov won the Calder Memorial Trophy as freshman of the year in 1990, a determination that caused contention; he was 32 years of age and had played 11 professional seasons in the Soviet League. In the wake of the debate, the NHL altered its standards: players beyond 26 years old were never again considered for the honor. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Iron Curtain prepared for increasingly Eastern European players to play in North America. Just six European players were chosen at the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. That number expanded to 32 out of 1989, while a record 123 Europeans were drafted in 2000. Europeans made up 22.5% of the NHL in 2013-14, totalling 232 players.
