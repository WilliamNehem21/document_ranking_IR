Amid 4ÃÂ January, Rewa moved once more into the South Pacific bowl and proceeded with eastbound as a debilitating class 3ÃÂ severe tropical violent wind, with the FMS evaluating the 10-minute continued windspeeds at 150ÃÂ km/h (90ÃÂ mph). Amid the following day, its eye progressed toward becoming darkened after the mountains of New Caledonia influenced Rewa's flow by making a hot and dry Foehn wind. The FMS announced that the framework had debilitated into a classification 2 tropical violent wind, while the JTWC detailed that Rewa had turned into a typhoon. The framework therefore made landfall in the region of Saint Vincent Bay on New Caledonia's south-western coast, before it rose close Thio from the east coast amid 6 January. By 7ÃÂ January, Rewa's dissemination had moved toward becoming uncovered affected by upper dimension north-westerlies; subsequently both the FMS and JTWC detailed that Rewa had debilitated into a sorrow. Throughout the following 3 days, the remaining low-level course was guided towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly exchange wind stream produced by an amazing region of high weight situated between New Zealand and Kermadec Islands. Amid 10 January, Rewa's remainders moved out of the South Pacific bowl and again into the Australian locale while beginning to re-strengthen into a tropical tornado, as a mid to upper dimension trough over eastern Australia expanded in size.
