In the wake of accepting the thumbs up to take a shot at the task, Moore and Gibbons went through multi day at the last's home making characters, creating subtleties for the story's milieu and talking about impacts. The pair was especially affected by a "Frantic" spoof of Superman named "Superduperman"; Moore stated, "We needed to take Superduperman 180 degreesÃ¢ÂÂsensational, rather than comedic". Moore and Gibbons considered a story that would take "well-known out-dated superheroes into a totally new domain"; the author said his aim was to make "a superhuman "Moby Dick"; something that had that kind of weight, that kind of thickness". The author thought of the character names and depictions, yet left the points of interest of what they looked like to Gibbons. Gibbons did not take a seat and plan the characters intentionally, but instead "did it at odd occasions [...] spend[ing] perhaps half a month simply doing representations." Gibbons structured his characters to make them simple to draw; Rorschach was his most loved to draw since "you simply need to draw a cap. On the off chance that you can draw a cap, at that point you've drawn Rorschach, you simply draw sort of a shape for his face and put some dark masses on it and you're finished."
