Disarray with the very respected mill operator or sweetbread mushroom ("Clitopilus prunulus") is a typical reason for harming in France; the last growth has a grayish-white fleece top and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with development. Youthful natural product assemblages of "Entoloma sinuatum" can likewise be mistaken for St George's mushroom ("Calocybe gambosa"), despite the fact that the gills of the last are packed and cream in shading, and the obfuscated agaric ("Clitocybe nebularis"), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unordinary scent. To confuse matters, it frequently develops close to these eatable species. Its general size and shape take after individuals from the sort "Tricholoma", in spite of the fact that the spore shading (white in "Tricholoma", pinkish in "Entoloma") and shape (rakish in "Entoloma") help recognize it. The uncommon and eatable all-white dovelike tricholoma ("T.ÃÂ columbetta") has a silken top and stem and a black out, not coarse, smell. "E.ÃÂ sinuatum" might be mistaken for "Clitocybe multiceps" in the Pacific Northwest of North America, in spite of the fact that the last has white spores and for the most part develops in bunches. An easygoing spectator may confuse it with a palatable field mushroom ("Agaricus campestris"), yet this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-darker in development, and a dim darker spore print. The inadequately known North American species "E. albidum" takes after "E.ÃÂ sinuatum" yet is similarly toxic.
