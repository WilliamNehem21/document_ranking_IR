Jeremy Sisto said he was drawn to the script, and was excited to take on a different project than his regular role of Detective Cyrus Lupo on the NBC crime drama series "Law & Order". Sisto said of working on the show, "For nine months we basically do the same episode over and over. This ["Into Tempation" script] came out of nowhere." Sisto said of working on "Into Temptation": "Having just come off a job where there is little room to find true moments and to create a full character, I felt this respite from the task of trying to force a space where I could express something more personal through my job was no less than a creative life saver."
Coyle cold called Kristin Chenoweth's agent and proposed the part, which is different from her usual roles, and her agent said it was the exact part the actress was seeking. In order to film "Into Temptation", Chenoweth took a five-day hiatus from her supporting role on the ABC television series "Pushing Daisies". Brian Baumgartner, best known for his supporting role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy series "The Office", was a regular theater performer in the Minneapolis â Saint Paul area before joining that show. While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an upfront presentation, shortly after having finished filming the fourth season of "The Office", Baumgartner was offered the "Into Temptation" script by Coyle, who asked him to consider taking the role of Father Ralph O'Brien. Baumgartner said he enjoyed the script and agreed to the part.
