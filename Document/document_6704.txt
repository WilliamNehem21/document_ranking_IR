The wartime exercises of the ship are misty. As per an after war report composed for the "Procedures of the United States Naval Institute", the fragmented vessel was towed to Kiel, where she was utilized as a sleeping enclosure transport. The cutting edge maritime history specialist RenÃÂ© Greger states that the fragmented body never left Hamburg. Some contemporary onlookers trusted the ship had been finished for administration with the German Navy, and British Admiral John Jellicoe, the authority of the Grand Fleet, got insight that the ship may have been in administration by 1916. Different onlookers, for example, Barnett, indicated the trouble the German Navy would have had in rearming the ship with German weapons, given the way that Germany had no plans for maritime firearms of that bore or mountings appropriate for use on board "Salamis". He respected the case that she had been put into administration "dicey". Barnett's appraisal was right; a significant remaking of the ship's barbette structures would have been required to suit German weapons, and since firearms accessible for maritime use were not effectively accessible inferable from the necessities of the German Army, work was coordinated toward German vessels under development like the battlecruiser . The British understood the talk was false when the ship did not show up at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May Ã¢ÂÂ 1 June 1916.
