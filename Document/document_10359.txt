Poe picked a raven as the focal image in the story since he needed a "non-thinking" animal fit for discourse. He settled on a raven, which he considered "similarly fit for discourse" as a parrot, since it coordinated the expected tone of the lyric. Poe said the raven is intended to symbolize ""Mournful and Never-finishing Remembrance"". He was likewise roused by Grip, the raven in "" by Charles Dickens. One scene specifically looks somewhat like "The Raven": toward the finish of the fifth part of Dickens' epic, Grip makes a commotion and somebody says, "What was thatÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ him tapping at the entryway?" The reaction is, "'Tis somebody thumping delicately at the shutter."<ref name="Staford Cremains/Ravens"></ref> Dickens' raven could express numerous words and had numerous comic turns, including the flying of a champagne stopper, however Poe underlined the flying creature's progressively sensational characteristics. Poe had composed an audit of "Barnaby Rudge" for "Graham's Magazine" saying, in addition to other things, that the raven ought to have served an increasingly representative, prophetic reason. The closeness did not go unnoticed: James Russell Lowell in his "A Fable for Critics" composed the section, "Here comes Poe with his raven, as "Barnaby Rudge"/Three-fifths of him virtuoso and two-fifths sheer fudge." The Free Library of Philadelphia has in plain view a taxidermied raven that is presumed to be the extremely one that Dickens possessed and that motivated Poe's sonnet.
