In 1815 a land guarantee that had been presented by Nicholas Jarrot to the land chiefs at Kaskaskia, Illinois Territory, was affirmed. In the case Jarrot attested that a "Jean Baptiste Poinstable" had been "leader of a family at Peoria in the year 1783, and when that year", and that he "had a house fabricated and developed land between the Old Fort and the new settlement in the year 1780". This archive has been taken by Quaife and different history specialists as proof that Point duSable inhabited Peoria on the Illinois River preceding going upriver to Chicago. Different records show that Point duSable was living and working under the British at the Pinery in Michigan in the mid 1780s. The Kaskaskia land officials distinguished numerous deceitful land claims, incorporating two recently submitted for the sake of Point duSable. Nicholas Jarrot, the inquirer, was engaged with numerous bogus cases, and Swenson recommends that this one was additionally deceitful, made without the information of Point duSable. Albeit maybe in strife with a portion of the above data, some authentic records propose that Point duSable purchased land in Peoria from J.B. Maillet on March13, 1773, and sold it to Isaac Darneille in 1783 preceding he turned into the principal "changeless" inhabitant of Chicago.
