At the 1961 Australian Championships, Windle won the 1500Â m in a time of 17Â min 37.7Â s to claim his first Australian title at the age of 16. However, his victory was overshadowed when his bathers partly fell off during the race. In the following year, Windle showed his versatility by winning the 220Â yd, 440Â yd and 1650Â yd freestyle events, in times of 2Â min 2.9Â s, 4Â min 25.0Â s and 17Â min 53.3Â s respectively. He also anchored the New South Wales team to victory in the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd freestyle relay. Selected for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, he marked his international debut with silver and bronze in the 1650Â yd and 440Â yd freestyle respectively. Murray Rose, who had returned from competition in the United States college system, won both events. Rose won the 1650Â yd event, finishing in 17Â min 18.1Â s, with Windle 26.4Â s in arrears. In the 440Â yd event, Rose finished in a time of 4Â min 20.0Â s, 3.1Â s ahead of the third-placed Windle. Windle also won gold in the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd freestyle relay, along with Rose, Allan Wood and Anthony Strahan, setting a world record in the process.
