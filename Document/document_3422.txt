Cooper's most vital film amid the post-war years was Fred Zinnemann's Western show "High Noon" (1952) with Grace Kelly for United Artists. In the film, Cooper plays resigning sheriff Will Kane who is getting ready to leave town on his special first night when he discovers that a fugitive he helped set away and his three partners in crime are coming back to look for their retribution. Unfit to pick up the help of the unnerved townspeople, and surrendered by his young lady of the hour, Kane all things considered remains to confront the fugitives alone. Amid the taping, Cooper was in weakness and in impressive torment from stomach ulcers. His attacked face and uneasiness in certain scenes "shot as self-question", as per biographer Hector Arce, and added to the adequacy of his execution. Considered one of the primary "grown-up" Westerns for its topic of good strength, "High Noon" got energetic audits for its imaginativeness, with "Time" magazine setting it in the positions of "Stagecoach" and "The Gunfighter". Bosley Crowther, in "The New York Times", composed that Cooper was "at the highest point of his structure", and John McCarten, in "The New Yorker", composed that Cooper was never progressively powerful. The film earned $3.75 million in the United States and $18 million around the world. Following the case of his companion James Stewart, Cooper acknowledged a lower pay in return for a percent of the benefits, and wound up making $600,000. Cooper's downplayed execution was broadly lauded, and earned him his second Academy Award for Best Actor.
