The footbridges were presented and the stream crossed easily at the same time, the divisional history remarked, the "railroad bank on the far side was an a lot more prominent characteristic impediment" because of substantial downpour and was "intensely wired" and guarded. The 113th and 114th Brigades crossed the waterway, each upheld by a tank, while the 115th was held for possible later use to manage German counter-assaults. Regardless of substantial German opposition and the tanks getting to be hindered in mud, the troops had the capacity to catch the rail line by 02:30.

Significant General Cubitt depicted the assault: having "shaped up in boggy ground, [the men] crossed a troublesome waterway (for the fourth time since 21st August), assaulted up a glacis cleared by automatic weapon shoot, raged a sharp railroad dike 40 to 50 feet high and in pouring precipitation, extremely elusive and profound going, in the long stretches of dimness, built up [themselves] on the last goal". Components of the division's pioneers participated in the strike on the statures past the stream and supported in the catch of the position. Regardless of a few counter-assaults, the division held the high ground. The assault dispensed no less than 225 setbacks and brought about the catch of 212 detainees, a battery of mounted guns pieces and mortars.
