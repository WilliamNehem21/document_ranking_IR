By the fourteenth century, Muslims had turned into a noteworthy minority in the south, however the coming of Portuguese evangelists checked their development. Haider Ali, however a passionate Muslim, did not enable his confidence to meddle with the organization of the prevalently Hindu kingdom. History specialists are, in any case, separated on the aims of Haider Ali's child, Tipu Sultan. It has been asserted that Tipu raised Hindus to noticeable positions in his organization, made liberal stipends to Hindu sanctuaries and brahmins, and for the most part regarded different beliefs, and that any religious changes that Tipu embraced were as discipline to the individuals who defied his power.

They opine that Tipu was in charge of mass transformations of Christians and Hindus in these locales, either by power or by offering them charge motivators and income advantages to change over.
