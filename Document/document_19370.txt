While most of the scientific community considers that the destructive substance responsible for "Vasa"'s long-term decay is sulfuric acid, Ulla Westermark, professor of wood technology at LuleÃ¥ University of Technology, has proposed another mechanism with her colleague BÃ¶rje Stenberg. Experiments done by Japanese researchers show that treating wood with PEG in an acidic environment can generate formic acid and eventually liquify the wood. "Vasa" was exposed to acidic water for more than three centuries, and therefore has a relatively low pH. Samples taken from the ship indicate that formic acid is present, and that it could be one of the multiple causes of a suddenly accelerated rate of decomposition.
The museum is constantly monitoring the ship for damage caused by decay or warping of the wood. Ongoing research seeks the best way to preserve the ship for future generations and to analyze the existing material as closely as possible. A current problem is that the old oak of which the ship is built has lost a substantial amount of its original strength and the cradle that supports the ship does not match up very well with the distribution of weight and stress in the hull. 'The amount of movement in the hull is worrying. If nothing is done, the ship will most likely capsize again', states Magnus Olofson from the "Vasa" Museum. An effort to secure "Vasa" for the future is under way, in cooperation with the Royal Institute of Technology and other institutions around the globe.
