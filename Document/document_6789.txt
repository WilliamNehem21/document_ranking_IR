Charles Scott (April 1739October22, 1813) was an eighteenth century American fighter who was chosen the fourth Governor of Kentucky in 1808. Stranded in his adolescents, Scott enrolled in the Virginia Regiment in October 1755 and filled in as a scout and escort amid the French and Indian War. He rapidly ascended through the positions to turn into a commander. After the war, he wedded and occupied with horticultural interests ashore left to him by his dad, yet he came back to dynamic military administration in 1775 as the American Revolution developed in force. In August 1776, he was elevated to colonel and given order of the fifth Virginia Regiment. The fifth Virginia joined George Washington in New Jersey soon thereafter, presenting with him for the length of the Philadelphia battle. Scott told Washington's light infantry, and by late 1778 was additionally filling in as his head of knowledge. Furloughed toward the finish of the Philadelphia crusade, Scott came back to dynamic administration in March 1779 and was requested to South Carolina to help General Benjamin Lincoln in the southern theater. He touched base in Charleston, South Carolina, similarly as Henry Clinton had started his attack of the city. Scott was taken as a POW when Charleston surrendered. Paroled in March 1781 and traded for Lord Rawdon in July 1782, Scott figured out how to finish a couple enlisting assignments before the war finished.
