Schultz assumes responsibility for Manitoba, and the administration of Ontario offers a money remunerate for Riel's catch, in any condition. Macdonald furtively sends Riel cash to vanish, as his passing would lose him cast a ballot in Quebec yet enabling him to live would cost him cast a ballot in English Canada. Riel escapes from town to town in the U.S. as abundance seekers attempt to follow him down. In 1873, he comes back to the Manitoba and wins a seat in the government Parliament in a by-decision. He fears really sitting in parliament in light of the fact that there is as yet an abundance on his head, and keeps on living sequestered from everything. In 1874, he wins his seat once more. Schultz wins a seat in the settlement too, in any case, and Alexander Mackenzie has turned out to be Prime Minister, running on guarantees not to allow the agitators an absolution. Riel is ousted from Parliament for neglecting to sit, yet wins his seat again in the following by-race. The disappointed government at long last stretches out an absolution to the revolutionariesÃ¢ÂÂall with the exception of Riel, whose pardon is contingent on a five-year expulsion from Canada. Amid his outcast, he has a visionary encounter on a ridge in Washington, D.C., in which God names him David, the Prophet of the New World, and instructs him to lead the MÃÂ©tis to opportunity. In 1876, Riel is furtively dedicated by a companion to an insane person refuge close MontrÃÂ©al under a bogus name.
