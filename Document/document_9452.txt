Gary Anderson's missed kick has been singled out as the primary contributing element to the Vikings' misfortune, as the Falcons had the capacity to gain by the late move in energy created by a surprising chance to tie and in the long run win. Considering this effect on the diversion's result and the notable exhibitions of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings group, the miss has since been noted as a vital crossroads in the more prominent history of the NFL. Paul Allen, the play-by-play radio host for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss as a standout amongst the most pulverizing crossroads in the historical backdrop of Minnesota sports. As indicated by Chad Hartman, another games radio host situated in Minneapolis, "[Anderson] will dependably be known as the person who was a piece of botching the Vikings' trek to the Super Bowl, despite the fact that he had this glorious season." ESPN casted a ballot the miss as the most critical play in Vikings history, and ESPN patron Ben Goessling trusts that the miss affected disasters that the establishment looked in ensuing years, including three further NFC Championship misfortunes in 2000, 2009, and 2017. Cunningham agreed by asserting, "With that kick, it just appeared as though the entire establishment went wide left."
