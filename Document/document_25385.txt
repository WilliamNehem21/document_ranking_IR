After reprising the role of Rocket Raccoon in "" (2018), Cooper directed his first film, "A Star Is Born", a remake of the 1937 musical film of same name. Starring with Lady Gaga, Cooper played an established singer, Jackson Maine, whose romance with a woman named Ally (played by Gaga) becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his. Having long aspired to direct a film, Cooper was keen on making a love story. People had warned him against directing a third remake, and he feared that the film would end his directing career if it failed. It premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August 2018, and was released worldwide in October to critical acclaim. On Cooper's directing, Owen Gleibermann of "Variety" wrote that "to say that [Cooper] does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment" and that he "gets right onto the high wire". Brian Tallerico, writing for critic Roger Ebert's website, found that Cooper "does some of the best work of his career as the kind of man who's always restless" and gives "an excellent performance", praising his singing abilities and his chemistry with Gaga. The film earned over $425 million at the box office against a production budget of $36 million.
