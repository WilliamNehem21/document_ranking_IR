After the Battle of Brunete, the detachment was rearranged into another Spanish division, known as the "DivisiÃÂ³n de Ingenios Blindados" (Armored Vehicles Division). This was made out of a tank detachment and a heavily clad unit; the last was comprised of lighter defensively covered battling vehicles, for example, the BA-6. It was put under the order of Spanish Colonel SÃÂ¡nchez Paredes. At this point, the greater part of the Soviet tankers had come back to the Soviet Union to give data on motorized fighting in Spain. The main Soviet unit left was the overwhelming tank regiment, outfitted with fresh out of the box new BT-5s which had not been utilized in battle yet. This regiment was run by both Soviet and veteran Spanish tankers, and was put under the direction of Soviet Colonel Kondriatev. At long last, the division likewise discarded an infantry detachment and an enemy of tank big guns organization. In any case, at this point the Republican military order had consigned the tank to the job of just infantry support, deterred by the poor execution of Republican protection to that date. The last significant fight Republican protection would participate in was the Battle of the Ebro, in 1938.
