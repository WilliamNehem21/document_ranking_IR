Jones' interpretation of the Gospel of Matthew was distributed in 1832, and around a similar time he filled in as a manager for his sibling John's interpretation of the Gospel of John. Jones was appointed a priest on October 6, 1833 by Reverend George Marsden in York, Upper Canada. He was the main Ojibwa to be appointed as a Methodist minister. That year, the Canadian Methodists had brought together their congregation with the British Wesleyans. The joined church was presently kept running by the British, and Jones was ignored for positions inside the congregation for less qualified people, and his impact decreased. At the point when the situation of leader of the Canadian Indian teachers came open, it was filled by a British Wesleyan with no involvement with Indians, Reverend Joseph Stinson. William Case was given the second in order position, with extraordinary consideration towards making an interpretation of sacred texts into Ojibwe. Case talked no Ojibwe. Case, whom Jones had seen as a coach, made his home office at the Credit Mission. Jones started to refuse in the congregation, as he was being given little duties and the congregation demonstrated no trust in his capacities. Case disclosed to Methodist clergyman James Evans to start interpreting songs and books of the Bible into Ojibwe, including those Jones had just deciphered. After the passing of Augustus Jones in November 1836, Peter welcomed his stepmother and two most youthful siblings to inhabit the Credit mission.
