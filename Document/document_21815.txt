In 1827, German chemist Friedrich WÃ¶hler visited Ãrsted and received explicit permission to continue the aluminium research, which Ãrsted "did not have time" for. WÃ¶hler repeated Ãrsted's experiments but did not identify any aluminium. (WÃ¶hler later wrote to Berzelius, "what Oersted assumed to be a lump of aluminium was certainly nothing but aluminium-containing potassium".) He conducted a similar experiment, mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium, and produced a powder of aluminium. After hearing about this, Ãrsted suggested his own aluminium may have contained potassium. WÃ¶hler continued his research and in 1845 was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some of its physical properties. WÃ¶hler's description of the properties indicates that he obtained impure aluminium. Other scientists also failed to reproduce Ãrsted's experiment, and WÃ¶hler was credited as the discoverer. While Ãrsted was not concerned with the priority of the discovery, some Danes tried to demonstrate he had obtained aluminium, and in 1921, the reason for the inconsistency between Ãrsted's and WÃ¶hler's experiments was discovered by Danish chemist Johan Fogh, who demonstrated that Ãrsted's experiment was successful thanks to use of a large amount of excess aluminium chloride and an amalgam with low potassium content. In 1936, scientists from American aluminium producing company Alcoa successfully recreated that experiment. However, many later sources still referred to WÃ¶hler as the discoverer.
