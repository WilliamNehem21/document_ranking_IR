"At World's End" was intended to return it tonally to a character piece. Sparrow, specifically, is tinged with franticness after broadened isolation in Davy Jones' Locker, and now wants everlasting status. Sparrow battles with the stuff to be an ethical individual, after his legitimate streak caused his fate in the second film. This is for the most part appeared by his inexorably whimsical conduct and Jack's fantasies, which seemed, by all accounts, to be basically his unhinged personality first and foremost where many "Jack Sparrows" seemed to group the ship in his single outcast, however later the mind flights developed progressively critical and there were fundamentally two "Jacks" continually contending about which way to pursue: the everlasting status or the mortality. The last fantasy occurred while Jack was detained on the Dutchman, where his legitimate streak won. Before the finish of "At World's End", Sparrow is cruising to the Fountain of Youth, an early idea for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was conceivable, and maker Jerry Bruckheimer communicated enthusiasm for a turn off. Violence Verbinski agreed that "the majority of the accounts get under way by the main film have been settled. In the event that there ever were another "Privateers of the Caribbean" film, I would begin crisp and spotlight on the further undertakings of Captain Jack Sparrow."
