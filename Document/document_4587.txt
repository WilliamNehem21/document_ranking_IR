Mucho Macho Man's dam is stakes-winning Ponche de Leona, whose family isn't especially outstanding. Her sire, Ponche, won five stakes races and sired five stakes victors. Her dam won one race in 19 begins. Mucho Macho Man along these lines has next to no linebreeding; just a 4ÃÂ4 cross to the sire Mr. Miner, implying that this steed shows up twice in the fourth era of his family. Ponche de Leona was acquired at the Keeneland deal in November 2007 by John and Carole Rio for $33,000 when in foal with Mucho Macho Man, the moderately low cost somewhat inferable from having been reared late in the year; late foals are hard to sell. Be that as it may, by November 2011, after the accomplishment of Mucho Macho Man in his three-year-old year, and in foal to Macho Uno once more, the Rios exchanged her at Keeneland for $300,000. Following Mucho Macho Man's Breeders' Cup win in 2013, and having additionally created the stakes-put Mucho Man's Gold, she was again sold at the Keeneland January 2014 deal, this time in foal to Distorted Humor, bringing $775,000. In 2013, she was named Florida broodmare of the year by the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders' and Owners' Association.
