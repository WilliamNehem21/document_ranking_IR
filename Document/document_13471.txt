Ruler Henry partook in the jousting, donning Diane's high contrast hues. He vanquished the dukes of Guise and Nemours, however the youthful Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, thumped him half out of the seat. Henry demanded riding against Montgomery once more, and this time, Montgomery's spear broke in the lord's face. Henry reeled out of the conflict, his face pouring blood, with fragments "of a decent bigness" standing out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all swooned. Henry was conveyed to the ChÃÂ¢teau de Tournelles, where five chips of wood were extricated from his head, one of which had penetrated his eye and cerebrum. Catherine remained by his bedside, yet Diane warded off, "for dread", in the expressions of a writer, "of being removed by the Queen". For the following ten days, Henry's state varied. Now and again he even felt all around ok to manage letters and tune in to music. Gradually, in any case, he lost his sight, discourse, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he kicked the bucket, matured 40. From that day, Catherine accepting a broken spear as her image, recorded with the words ""lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor"" ("from this come my tears and my agony"), and wore dark grieving in memory of Henry.
