Ace Henrik and Arendt de Groote started purchasing the crude materials required for the main ships in 1625, buying timber from individual domains in Sweden just as purchasing unpleasant sawn planking in Riga, KÃÂ¶nigsberg (present day Kaliningrad), and Amsterdam. As they arranged to start the first of the new ships in the pre-winter of 1625, Henrik related with the lord through the Vice Admiral Fleming about which ship to construct first. The loss of ten ships in the Bay of Riga drove the ruler to propose building two boats of another, medium size as a fast trade off, and he sent a detail for this, a ship which would be 120 feet (35.6 m) long on the bottom. Henrik declined, since he had effectively cut the timber for an expansive and a little ship. He laid the bottom for a bigger ship in late February or early March 1626. Ace Henrik never observed Vasa finished; he became sick in late 1625, and by the late spring of 1626 he had given over supervision of the work in the yard to another Dutch shipwright, Henrik 'Hein' Jacobsson. He kicked the bucket in the spring of 1627, most likely about a similar time as the ship was propelled. After the passing of Henrik Hybertsson, the obligation to deal with the develop the ship was acquired by his widow Margareta Hybertsson.
