Contemporary records of the Battle of Bosworth can be found in four principle sources, one of which is the English "Croyland Chronicle", composed by a senior Yorkist writer who depended things being what they are data from nobles and fighters. Different records were composed by outsidersÃ¢ÂÂVergil, Jean Molinet, and Diego de Valera. While Molinet was thoughtful to Richard, Vergil was in Henry's administration and drew data from the ruler and his subjects to depict them in a decent light. Diego de Valera, whose data Ross sees as untrustworthy, arranged his work from letters of Spanish dealers. Be that as it may, different students of history have utilized Valera's work to conclude potentially profitable bits of knowledge not promptly apparent in different sources. Ross finds the lyric, "The Ballad of Bosworth Field", a valuable source to learn certain subtleties of the fight. The huge number of various records, for the most part dependent on second-or third-hand data, has demonstrated an obstruction to students of history as they attempt to recreate the fight. Their regular grievance is that, aside from its result, not very many subtleties of the fight are found in the accounts. As indicated by history specialist Michael Hicks, the Battle of Bosworth is one of the most exceedingly bad recorded conflicts of the Wars of the Roses.
