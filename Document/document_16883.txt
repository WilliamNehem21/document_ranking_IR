As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form "daylight savings time" (with an "s") was already in 1978 much more common than the older form "daylight saving time" in American English ("the change has been virtually accomplished"). Nevertheless, even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. ("Although "daylight saving time" is considered correct, "daylight savings time" (with an "s") is commonly used.") The first two words are sometimes hyphenated ("daylight-saving(s) time"). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving (without "time"), daylight savings (without "time"), and daylight time. The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style explains the development and current situation as follows: "Although the singular form "daylight saving time" is the original one, dating from the early 20th centuryâand is preferred by some usage criticsâthe plural form is now extremely common in AmE. [...] The rise of "daylight savings time" appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when "saving" is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether "saving" is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving). [...] Using "savings" as the adjectiveâas in "savings account" or "savings bond"âmakes perfect sense. More than that, it ought to be accepted as the better form."
