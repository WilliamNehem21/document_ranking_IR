Numerous westerners, including Republicans, were supporters of free silver. McKinley's counsels had foreseen there would be solid emotions about the cash question, and squeezed the possibility for a choice on what the gathering stage should state regarding the matter. McKinley had would have liked to stay away from this issue; his surrogates had displayed him as solidly for the best quality level in the East, where support for that arrangement was solid. Western supporters, who regularly supported silver, were advised he was thoughtful to the bimetallic reason. In the next years, a few McKinley partners, including distributer H. H. Kohlsaat and Wisconsin's Henry C. Payne, assumed praise for including an express notice of the best quality level in the stage's cash board (for they considered it imperative to the Republican triumph in November), yet it was not embedded in the draft until Hanna counseled with McKinley by phone. The silver Republicans from the West were driven by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, who drafted a board advancing free silver, just to see it voted against in the drafting advisory group, and in the full Platform Committee. Teller was resolved to have the full tradition vote on his language, in spite of the fact that it was sure he would lose as most Republican representatives supported the highest quality level. The discussion was hung on June 18. After Teller's minority report was voted against and the gold board embraced by a mind larger part, 23 delegates, including Teller and his Senate associates Frank Cannon of Utah and Fred Dubois of Idaho, left the tradition and in this way left the Republican Party. In the midst of a wild scene, an irate Hanna was seen remaining on a seat, yelling at the leaving men, "Go! Go! Go!"
