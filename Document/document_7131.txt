Thomas Nuttall portrayed the species in the second volume of his 1846 work "The North American Sylva" with explicit designation "aurea" ('brilliant' in Latin). In 1768, Scottish botanist Philip Miller portrayed "Ficus maxima", refering to Carl Linnaeus' "Hortus Cliffortianus" (1738) and Hans Sloane's "Catalogus plantarum quÃÂ¦ in insula Jamaica" (1696). Sloane's outline of the species, distributed in 1725, delineated it with figs borne separately, a normal for the "Ficus" subgenus "Pharmacosycea". As an individual from the subgenus "Urostigma", "F. aurea" has matched figs. In any case, a closer examination of Sloane's portrayal drove Cornelis Berg to infer that the representation delineated an individual from the subgenus "Urostigma" (since it had other indicative of that subgenus), more likely than not "F. aurea", and that the outline of independently borne figs was likely masterful permit. Berg found the plant gathering whereupon Sloane's representation was based and presumed that Miller's "F. maxima" was, truth be told, "F. aurea". In his portrayal of "F. aurea", which depended on plant material gathered in Florida, Thomas Nuttall thought about how conceivable it is that his plants had a place with the animal varieties that Sloane had depicted, yet arrived at the decision that it was another species. Under the principles of natural terminology, the name "F. maxima" has need over "F. aurea" since Miller's depiction was distributed in 1768, while Nuttall's portrayal was distributed in 1846.
