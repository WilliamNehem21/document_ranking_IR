In the age of the auto trails, it was regular for parkways to be named as opposed to numbered. An endeavor to make a trail, for example, the Lincoln Highway flopped in Michigan. Younger students in 1926 from Anderson, Indiana, needed to respect James Whitcomb Riley, the writer from the Hoosier State, with a parkway that associated the nation's mid year and winter resort territories. The Michigan fragment of the street going through the state was to pursue what might later be USÃÂ 131. The James Whitcomb Riley Association advanced the parkway by painting white groups on utility poles with the name of the street in orange letters amid that August and September. Be that as it may, the street being referred to was at that point named the Mackinaw Trail, and the affiliation did not verify consent of the state thruway official, as was required by a 1919 Michigan law. The law made it illicit for any "relationship to portray or check some other courses or trails through the State of Michigan... except if the equivalent will be affirmed recorded as a hard copy by the State Highway Commissioner." accordingly, government authorities would not embrace the affiliation's proposition, and Michigan was rejected from the expressway. The endeavors of the national affiliation were hindered by the stopped advancement, and the roadway was disbanded by December 1926.
