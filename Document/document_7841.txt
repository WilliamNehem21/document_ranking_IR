Beginning with "Confined Bird", Angelou made a purposeful endeavor while composing every one of her collections of memoirs, including "Mother and Me and Mom", to challenge the standard structure of the self-portrayal by evaluating, changing, and extending the class. Her utilization of fiction-composing procedures, for example, discourse, portrayal, and topical advancement has frequently driven analysts to sort her books as personal fiction. Valerie Sayers, in her survey of "Mother and Me and Mom" in "The Washington Post", calls Angelou's books journals on account of their restricted center, however adulates her for depicting what it resembled to grow up Black in "Jim Crow America". Sayers states: "She figures out how to completely uncover that national sore without picking at it, a slick trap that...requires impressive limitation and her very own steely altruism". Angelou expressed in a 1989 meeting that she was the main "genuine" essayist to pick the class to convey what needs be. As commentator Susan Gilbert expressed, Angelou was announcing not one individual's story, however the collective's. Researcher Selwyn R. Cudjoe concurred, and saw Angelou as illustrative of the tradition in African-American self-portrayal as an open signal that represented a whole gathering of individuals. Angelou's manager Robert Loomis had the capacity to persuade her to state "Confined Bird" by provoking her to compose a self-portrayal that could be considered "high craftsmanship", which she proceeded all through her arrangement. In spite of the fact that Angelou was effective, she was, as Sayers demanded, brilliant and sufficiently talented to compose for any gathering of people, however decided not to compose for "a highbrow abstract group of onlookers", yet for "perusers as open, energetic and clear as herself".
