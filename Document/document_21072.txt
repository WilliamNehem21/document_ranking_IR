With the strengthening ridge to its north, Hattie began restrengthening after retaining the same intensity for about 24Â hours. Initially, forecasters at the Miami Weather Bureau predicted the storm to turn northward again. Late on OctoberÂ 29, the center of the hurricane passed about 90Â miles (145Â km) southwest of Grand Cayman, at which time the interaction between Hattie and the ridge to its north produced squally winds of around 30Â mph (50Â km/h) across Florida. Early on OctoberÂ 30, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the increase in intensity, reporting winds of 140Â mph (225Â km/h). The storm's minimum central pressure continued to drop throughout the day, reaching by 1300Â UTC; a lower pressure of was computed at 1700Â UTC that day, based on a flight-level reading from the Hurricane Hunters. Hattie later curved toward the west-southwest, passing between the Cayman Islands and the Swan Islands. Late on OctoberÂ 30, Hattie attained peak winds of 160Â mph (260Â km/h) about 190Â mi (310Â km) east of the border of Mexico and British Honduras. This made Hattie the equivalence of a CategoryÂ 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, making it the latest hurricane on record to reach the status until a reanalysis of the 1932Â season revealed that Hurricane Fourteen had a similar intensity on November 5, six days after Hattie. Additionally, Hattie was the strongest October hurricane in the northwest Caribbean until Hurricane Mitch in 1998.
