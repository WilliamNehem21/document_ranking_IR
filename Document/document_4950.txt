The exceptional challenge between the kingdom of the western Deccan and those of the Tamil nation went to the fore in the eleventh century over the intensely challenged fruitful stream valleys in the doab locale of the Krishna and Godavari River called Vengi (present day beach front Andhra Pradesh). The Western Chalukyas and the Chola Dynasty battled many unpleasant wars over control of this vital asset. The magnificent Cholas picked up power amid the season of the popular lord Rajaraja Chola I and the crown ruler Rajendra Chola I. The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi were cousins of the Western Chalukyas yet turned out to be progressively affected by the Cholas through their conjugal ties with the Tamil kingdom. As this was against the interests of the Western Chalukyas, they squandered no time in including themselves politically and militarily in Vengi. When King Satyashraya succeeded Tailapa II to the honored position, he had the capacity to shield his kingdom from Chola animosity just as his northern regions in Konkan and Gujarat in spite of the fact that his power over Vengi was flimsy. His successor, Jayasimha II, battled numerous fights with the Cholas in the south around c. 1020Ã¢ÂÂ 21 when both these ground-breaking kingdoms attempted to pick the Vengi ruler. Presently in c. 1024, Jayasimha II repressed the Paramara of focal India and the defiant Yadava King Bhillama.
