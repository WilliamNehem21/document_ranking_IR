In 1924, the UFA government passed the "Mineral Tax Act", which burdened mineral rightsholders at a rate of three pennies for each section of land. The two biggest such rightsholders, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Hudson's Bay Company, asked the national government to utilize its capacity of preclusion to put a stop to the enactment. At the point when the government went along, Brownlee challenged its activity on three grounds: first, as an immediate duty the proposed toll was inside Alberta's rights under segment 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, and it was protected tradition for the central government to practice denial just when the upbraided enactment was unmistakably illegal. Second, prohibition permitted the area no plan of action to the courts, where the lawfulness of the enactment could be tried. Third, the national government's expressed purposes behind denying the enactment, which were discharged belatedly by equity serve Ernest Lapointe, were (as indicated by Brownlee) incorrect and drove Brownlee to propose that Lapointe, a QuÃÂ©bÃÂ©cois legal counselor prepared in the common law convention of his home territory as opposed to the precedent-based law framework utilized in the remainder of Canada, must be new to the land-holding framework outside of Quebec. Brownlee's assaults were rejected, and the preclusion stood.
