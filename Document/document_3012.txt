It is uncovered in "The Italian Bob" (season 17, 2005) that Bob has moved to Italy to make a new beginning. He is chosen civic chairman of a town in Tuscany and weds a nearby lady named Francesca, with whom he has a child named Gino. The Simpson family, in Italy to recover a vehicle for Mr. Consumes, experiences him by possibility. Bounce invites them with accommodation relying on the prerequisite that they not uncover his felonious past; nonetheless, a smashed Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds, estranging Bob from his natives. He, his significant other and child swear a feud on the Simpsons. The whole Terwilliger family returns in "Burial service for a Fiend" (season 19, 2007) in which Bob's dad, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and mother, Dame Judith Underdunk, show up. Sway fakes his very own demise and secures Bart in the pine box, which he endeavors to incinerate at the generally vacant memorial service home as all the Terwilligers giggle twistedly. They are thwarted by Lisa and the remainder of the Simpson family and sent to jail. Bounce quickly returns in the season 20 scene "Wedding for Disaster", when Bart and Lisa at first speculate Bob of abducting Homer to keep him from going to his second wedding with Marge (due to a keychain they found had a 'S' and a 'B'), yet Krusty gives him a plausible excuse, disclosing to the children that Bob was with him the entire day. In the end, Bob and the children find the genuine guilty parties, Patty and Selma.
