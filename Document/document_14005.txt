The seamount is high over the ocean bottom and has a sporadic shape, with goads anticipating from its periphery. These goads have widths of and surface highlights that are particular from those on the fundamental level top. The goads seem, by all accounts, to be break zones, like these shaped on Hawaii by dyke infusion albeit a portion of the edges at WÃÂdejebato may have an alternate root. WÃÂdejebato seems to have four such edges, which is more than is seen at Hawaii. One clarification is that the northwestern edge is another seamount; another that WÃÂdejebato comprises of more than one fountain of liquid magma in spite of the fact that the moderately little size of the seamount would contend against this view. WÃÂdejebato's inclines slide rather steeply until, at profundity, where they become increasingly delicate, they are finished with structures taking after cones and channels. Some portion of its southern flank, where there is a downdropped porch, appears to have fell before. Another satellite volcanic cone lies north of WÃÂdejebato at a profundity of . WÃÂdejebato contains a volcanic structure inside a shallow dregs top, and a free-air gravity abnormality has been seen on the seamount.
