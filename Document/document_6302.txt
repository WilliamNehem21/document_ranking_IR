DÃÂ¼rer's woodcut isn't a precise portrayal of a rhinoceros. He portrays a creature with hard plates that spread its body like sheets of protective layer, with a gorget at the throat, a strong looking breastplate, and bolts along the creases. He puts a little contorted horn on its back, and gives it flaky legs and saw-like back quarters. None of these highlights is available in a genuine rhinoceros. It is conceivable that a suit of covering was fashioned for the rhinoceros' battle against the elephant in Portugal, and that these highlights delineated by DÃÂ¼rer are portions of the protective layer. On the other hand, DÃÂ¼rer's "protective layer" may speak to the overwhelming folds of tough skin of an Indian rhinoceros, or, similarly as with different mistakes, may basically be mistaken assumptions or imaginative increases by DÃÂ¼rer. DÃÂ¼rer likewise draws a layered surface over the body of the creature, including the "protection". This might be DÃÂ¼rer's endeavor to mirror the harsh and practically bare stow away of the Indian rhinoceros, which has mole like knocks covering its upper legs and shoulders. Then again, his portrayal of the surface may speak to dermatitis incited by the rhinoceros' nearby restriction amid the four-month venture by ship from India to Portugal.
