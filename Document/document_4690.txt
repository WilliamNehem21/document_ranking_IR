In late 1861, the Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of Ridleyville, Pennsylvania, had written to Chase, suggesting that some reference to God be set on the coinage in that season of war, and on NovemberÃÂ 20 of that year, Chase wrote to Mint Director Pollock, "You will make a gadget be set up immediately with a saying communicating in the least tersest terms conceivable this national acknowledgment." Several mottoes were considered by Pollock, including "God Our Trust" and "God and Our Country". A portion of the examples he sent Chase in December 1863 utilized "God Our Trust", and he composed of the structure, "the gadgets are delightful and proper, and the saying on each such, as all who dread God and love their nation, will endorse." He likewise sent example coins portraying George Washington; Chase reacted to the letter, "I support your mottoes, just recommending that on that with the Washington front the maxim should start with the word OUR, in order to peruse OUR GOD AND OUR COUNTRY. Also, on that with the shield, it ought to be changed in order to peruse: IN GOD WE TRUST." Pollock had been propelled by "The Star Spangled Banner", a later stanza of which incorporates the line, "And this be our maxim, 'In God Is Our Trust'ÃÂ ". Pursue may have been affected in his choice by the adage of his place of graduation, Brown University, "In Deo Speramus" (In God We Hope).
