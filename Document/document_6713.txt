By mid 1928, Morris had made plans for a musical drama house and an encompassing retail complex at the Upper Estate. Be that as it may, the new structure was unreasonably costly for the Met to support independent from anyone else, and it required an enrichment. On May 21, 1928, Morris displayed the venture amid a supper for potential financial specialists, at which the Rockefeller family's advertising counsel Ivy Lee was a visitor. Lee later educated his supervisor, John D. Rockefeller Jr., about the proposition, in which the last demonstrated intrigue. Rockefeller wished to give the site genuine thought before he contributed, and he would not like to finance the whole venture individually.

Rockefeller wound up employing the Todd, Robertson and Todd Engineering Corporation as structure advisors to decide the venture's practicality, with one of the company's accomplices, John R. Todd, to fill in as the essential developer and overseeing operator for the task. Todd presented an arrangement for the musical show house site in September 1928, in which he proposed developing places of business, retail establishments, loft structures, and lodgings around the new musical drama house.
