Angelou describes her writing process as regimented. Beginning with "Caged Bird", she has used the same "writing ritual" for many years. She gets up at five in the morning and checks into a hotel room, where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, "Roget's Thesaurus", and the Bible, and leaves by the early afternoon. She averages 10â12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening. Angelou goes through this process to "enchant" herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to "relive the agony, the anguish, the "Sturm und Drang"". She places herself back in the time she is writing about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in "Caged Bird", to "tell the human truth" about her life. Angelou has stated that she plays cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in itâha! It's so delicious!" She does not find the process cathartic; rather, she has found relief in "telling the truth".
