Johnson drove his Australian group to England in 1956. The group's visit to England agreed with what was portrayed by "Wisden" as "the wettest of all summers in memory". The poor climate gave the Australian group minimal opportunity to build up their certainty and Johnson utilized the early matches of the visit to permit his batsmen and bowlers to analyze in the new conditions. In one of these early matches, Surrey vanquished Australia by ten wickets; the first run through Australia had lost to province restriction since 1912. In parallel with later occasions in the Old Trafford Test, off-spinner Jim Laker took every one of the ten wickets in the Australian first innings; Laker and left-arm spinner Tony Lock took 19 of the 20ÃÂ Australian wickets that fell in the match. While Johnson was fruitful with the ball, taking 6ÃÂ wickets for 168; his biased strategies saw him permit LindwallÃ¢ÂÂhis principle quick bowlerÃ¢ÂÂjust two overs in Surrey's first innings and endeavor to transform Alan Davidson into a turn bowler. Cricket author Ray Robinson said of Johnson's strategies all through the visit, "I have not met one great cricketer or cricket judge who isn't confused by them". The way of this misfortune seriously gouged Australia's certainty against turn for the rest of the visit.
