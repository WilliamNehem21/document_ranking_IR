No. 1 Squadron began receiving new Demons in November 1936. In January 1937, it relinquished its Bulldogs to No.Â 21 Squadron, which was to hold them until they could be transferred to the soon-to-be-formed No.Â 2 Squadron. By the end of February, No.Â 1 Squadron's strength was 12 Demons and one Moth, 11 officers and 108 airmen. The unit was redesignated No.Â 1 (Bomber) Squadron in August 1937. Towards the end of the year, it was plagued by several Demon accidents, resulting in a series of inquiries and a review of RAAF procedures in 1938 by Marshal of the RAF Sir Edward Ellington; the so-called Ellington Report and its criticism of air safety standards led to the removal of Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams from his position as Chief of the Air Staff, which he had held since the formation of the Air Force. No.Â 1 Squadron received the RAAF's first three CAC Wirraways on 10Â July 1939. As the likelihood of war increased, the squadron's role was altered to incorporate reconnaissance as well as bombing, resulting in the transfer out of all Demons and Wirraways and the transfer in from other units of nine Avro Ansons on 28â29 August 1939; at the end of the month its personnel comprised nine officers and 122 airmen.
