The divergences from the first novella's plot were commonly not generally welcomed. Tim Teeman, assessing "The Turn of the Screw" for "The Times", felt the 1920s setting did not add to the story, as it was not appropriately created. He contrasted the film with Sarah Waters' tale "The Little Stranger", an apparition story set during the 1920s in which the social changes of the decade are investigated. Gerard Gilbert, composing both for "The Independent" and The Arts Desk, felt that Ann's relationship to the Master was "pointlessly sexed up", and that this component added nothing to the story, and, truth be told, brought down it. In his audit of the American DVD discharge for the "Deseret Morning News", Chris Hicks said that he couldn't perceive any reason why the progressions had been made, and that the literalisation of the sex and viciousness reduced the film. Whittaker recommended that "The Turn of the Screw" was "strangely explicitly unequivocal", and that the progressions were pointless for the plot. The most serious issue, he recommended, was the presentation of the specialist; his dialogs with Ann, which could without much of a stretch be evacuated, served to expel the riddle from the plot, in Whittaker's eyes. Sutcliffe was incredulous of the reframing of the story as a clichÃÂ© record of how "an arrogant young fellow of science has his assurances upturned", and said the film took "the startling indeterminacies of the first", turning them "into a marginally pitiful phantom train ride".
