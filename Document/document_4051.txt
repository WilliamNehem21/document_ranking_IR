These triumphs earned him the title "Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy" (master of the south). Pulakeshin II proceeded with his triumphs in the east where he vanquished all kingdoms in his way and achieved the Bay of Bengal in present-day Orissa. A Chalukya viceroyalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (waterfront Andhra) and sovereigns from the Badami family were dispatched to govern them. Having repressed the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, he acknowledged tributes from the Pandyas of Madurai, Chola line and Cheras of the Kerala district. Pulakeshin II in this way turned into the ace of India, south of the Narmada River. Pulakeshin II is broadly viewed as one of the incredible lords in Indian history. Hiuen-Tsiang, a Chinese explorer visited the court of Pulakeshin II right now and Persian ruler Khosrau II traded diplomats. In any case, the persistent wars with Pallavas got ugly in 642 when the Pallava ruler Narasimhavarman I retaliated for his dad's annihilation, vanquished and looted the capital of Pulakeshin II who may have kicked the bucket in fight. After a century, Chalukya Vikramaditya II walked triumphantly into Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital and involved it on three events, the third time under the authority of his child and crown sovereign Kirtivarman II. He in this way retaliated for the before mortification of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada engraving on the triumph column at the Kailasanatha Temple. He later overran the other customary kingdoms of Tamil nation, the Pandyas, Cholas and Keralas notwithstanding repressing a Kalabhra ruler.
