Jack Bender expressed that Matthew Fox "truly submits body and soul into the story he's telling" and Fox addressed whether he had ever been more drained than while shooting the twofold scene. Like the other "Lost" season finales, the last cliffhanger scene was given a codenameÃ¢ÂÂ"The Rattlesnake in the Mailbox"Ã¢ÂÂ and stayed quiet. After Lindelof and Cuse composed the scene, just Fox, Lilly, Bender, and co-official maker Jean Higgins were given duplicates of the content. The scene was shot with a green screen in a deserted Honolulu parking area with the airplane terminal altered in. In spite of the safety efforts, a total and itemized scene abstract was transferred online over seven days before the scene publicized. Disney explored the hole. The hole provoked Lindelof and Cuse to enter "radio quiet", which was briefly broken at Comic-Con International 2007. The memorial service parlor that Jack visits is classified "Hoffs/Drawlar", which is a re-arranged word of "flashforward". The possibility of flashforwards was brought about by makers Lindelof and Abrams amid the show's origination. In any case, Cuse and Lindelof just began fleshing out the thought toward the finish of the main season, after they understood that flashbacks would in the long run quit being dramatic and realized that they would in the long run need to change to flashforwards. With the declaration that the arrangement would close 48 scenes after "Through the Looking Glass", they felt happy with playing flashforwards as right on time as the third-season finale.
