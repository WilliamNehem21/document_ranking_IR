Antiquarian Hugh Ross contended that in picking up the designation, Willkie "gave extraordinary guarantee of being a champ. There were abundant points of reference from American political history in which a minority party, squeamish over prospects for survival, skirted proficient authority so as to depend its political fortunes to a man without political experience. In the greater part of the past cases, the assignment had gone to a military man. In 1940, it went to an agent." Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 race, proposed that the designation of Willkie left dependable scars on the Republican Party, with preservationists rankled by the accomplishment of its Eastern Establishment wing; "whatever else it did, Philadelphia brought forth the harsh restrictive division inside the Republican Party, one complemented by belief system and geology, that would characterize the gathering for a considerable length of time to come." Among those changed over from neutrality by Willkie's speech, and who worked seriously on the Willkie crusade in Michigan, was Gerald R. Portage, who composed numerous years after the fact in his journals, "I presently understand that my investment did not have much effect at all to the political destiny of Wendell Willkie. Be that as it may, it had a ton of effect to me."
