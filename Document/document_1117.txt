Research in the late nineteenth century lead to what Rishel depicts as "one of the thorniest problems in the investigation of Early Netherlandish workmanship", as endeavors were made to build up creation and date the boards as far as priority. The boards are neither marked nor dated, and have demonstrated particularly hard to trait. Setting up a surmised date of finishing is normally a standout amongst the most imperative factor in crediting an old ace painting. Dendrochronological investigation of the Philadelphia board dated its development rings to somewhere in the range of 1225 and 1307. It was built up that the board was cut from a similar tree as the wood of two known boards by van Eyck, the "Representation of Baudouin de Lannoy" (c.ÃÂ 1435) and "Picture of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini" (1438). These have tree-rings that created somewhere in the range of 1205 and 1383, and 1206 and 1382, individually. Examination of the sapwood proposes a felling date of around 1392. Expecting an ordinary 10 years of flavoring before use, any of the works of art could have started from around 1408 onwards. The Turin rendition is painted on two stuck sheets, vertical to the picture. The rings from board I are dated somewhere in the range of 1273 and 1359, those of board II from 1282 to 1365.
