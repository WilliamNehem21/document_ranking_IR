Youthful examples of "A.ÃÂ hygrometricus" have generally round organic product bodies that commonly begin their improvement incompletely implanted in the substrate. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the natural product body, and might be incompletely encrusted with flotsam and jetsam. As the organic product body develops, the mycelial layer tears away, and the external tissue layer, the exoperidium, tears open in a star-molded (stellate) example to frame 4Ã¢ÂÂ 20 unpredictable "beams". This all the while pushes the organic product body over the ground to uncover a round spore case encased in a slender papery endoperidium. The beams open and close in light of dimensions of dampness in the earth, opening up in high moistness, and shutting when the air is dry. This is conceivable in light of the fact that the exoperidium is made of a few distinct layers of tissue; the deepest, sinewy layer is hygroscopic, and twists or uncurls the whole beam as it loses or gains dampness from its environment. This adjustment empowers the natural product body to scatter spores on occasion of ideal dampness, and diminish dissipation amid dry periods. Further, dry organic product bodies with the beams nestled into be promptly passed up the breeze, enabling them to disperse spores from the pore as they roll.
