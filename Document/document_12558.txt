On 14 March 1973 Thorpe wedded Marion Stein, a professional piano player and the previous spouse of George Lascelles, seventh Earl of Harewood. The couple had been united a year sooner by a shared colleague, the piano player Moura Lympany. The year finished less joyfully for Thorpe, when the optional financial firm of London and County Securities, of which he had been an executive since May 1971, fallen in the midst of gossipy tidbits about botch and extortion, denoting the beginning of the auxiliary financial emergency of 1973Ã¢ÂÂ 75; the subtleties were not uncovered until 1976. In February 1974 Heath, whose legislature had been tormented by mechanical turmoil, called a general race on the issue of "Who administers Britain?". Amid the race battle there was proof of alienation with both Heath and Wilson, and of a flood in Liberal help. Thorpe was certain that the gathering would make a huge achievement; on decision day, 28 February, it verified its most elevated national vote to date, 6 million, and its most elevated offer of the vote (19.3) since 1929. In any case, under the first-past-the-post casting a ballot framework, these considers interpreted along with only 14 seats. Thorpe's greater part in North Devon rose to 11,072.
