In July 1917 Hornung's sonnet, "Wooden Crosses", was distributed in "The Times", and in September, "Bond and Free" showed up. Towards the year's end, he was acknowledged as a volunteer in a YMCA bottle and library "a short separation behind the Front Line". Amid his administration in Arras, in February 1918 he acquired a staff vehicle from a companion and visited his child's grave close Ypres, before coming back to the library in Arras. Hornung was worried about help for pacifism among troops, and kept in touch with his better half about it. When she addressed Doyle about the issue, instead of talking about it with Hornung he educated the military specialists. Hornung was irritated by Doyle's activity, and "let him know there was no requirement for him to 'butt in' with the exception of his own 'fulfillment'." Relations between the two men were stressed subsequently. Hornung kept on working at the library until the German Spring Offensive in March overran the British positions and he was compelled to withdraw, initially to Amiens and after that, in April, back to England. He remained in England until November 1918, when he again took up his YMCA obligations, building up a rest cottage and library in Cologne. In 1919 Hornung's record of his time spent in France, "Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front", was distributed. Doyle later composed of the book that "there are portions of it which are splendid in their clear depiction", while Hornung's biographer, Alison Cox, portrayed the book as "a standout amongst the best records of the war as experienced on the cutting edges". That year Hornung additionally distributed his third and last volume of verse, "The Young Guard".
