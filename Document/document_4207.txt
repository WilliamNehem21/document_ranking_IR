Edward's new castle comprised of three courts along the north side of the Upper Ward, called Little Cloister, King's Cloister and the Kitchen Court. At the front of the royal residence lay the St George's Hall go, which joined another corridor and another house of prayer. This range had two symmetrical gatehouses, the Spicerie Gatehouse and the Kitchen Gatehouse. The Spicerie Gatehouse was the principle entrance into the royal residence, while the Kitchen Gatehouse just drove into the kitchen patio. The incredible lobby had various extensive windows watching out over the ward. The range had an unordinary, bound together rooftop line and, with a taller rooftop than the remainder of the castle, would have been very particular. The Rose Tower, intended for the ruler's private use, set off the west corner of the range. The outcome was an "incredible and clearly compositionally brought together palaceÃÂ ... uniform in a wide range of ways, as to rooftop line, window statures, cornice line, floor and roof statures". Except for the Hall, Chapel and the Great Chamber, the new insides all common a comparable tallness and width. The guarded highlights, be that as it may, were basically for show, conceivably to give a background to jousting between the two-parts of the Order of the Garter.
