Four putative first lower molariforms (mf1s) of "Ferugliotherium" are known, and the main known tooth of "Trapalcotherium" is additionally thought to be a mf1. "Ferugliotherium" mf1s are generally rectangular, with adjusted corners, and bear two longitudinal lines of cusps. There are four cusps in the lingual line (in favor of the tongue) and three in the labial column (the side of the lips). The cusps are associated with cusps in the other column by transverse edges and isolated from cusps in their very own lines by three transverse wrinkles. Two intensely worn "Ferugliotherium" mf1s were initially recognized as upper molars of "Vucetichia gracilis" by Bonaparte in 1990. One of the two jam the roots; at the front and back, there were two roots, melded at their bases. The mf1 of "Trapalcotherium" contrasts just in certain subtleties; among others, the cusps are less unmistakable from the peaks. The sole mf2 of "Ferugliotherium" is the holotype. It bears two lines of two cusps. The cusps in the front and back sets are associated by a wide edge and the two sets are isolated by a profound wrinkle. Transverse edges between the cusps like those seen in ferugliotheriids are not known in any multituberculate. Then again, by and large examples of cusps and edges are basically comparable among "Ferugliotherium", "Gondwanatherium", and "Sudamerica", showing that the three are firmly related.
