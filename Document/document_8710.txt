"Misterioso" was discharged in 1958 by Riverside and was Monk's eighth collection for the name. The next March, Monk was casted a ballot piano player of the year in a yearly survey of worldwide jazz commentators from "Down Beat" magazine, who said he was heard "at his difficult, reliably imaginative best" on "Misterioso". Jazz pundit Nat Hentoff evaluated the record that May for "Hello Fi Review", in which he said it was not one of the musician's best collections. He watched "too little space for Monk's soloing and to some degree to an extreme" for Griffin, whose saxophone cry and timing were more great than his performances. Hentoff likewise trusted Haynes and Abdul-Malik did not bolster Monk as imaginatively as Wilbur Ware and Art Blakey had on his past Riverside collections, where he said Monk was in all the more convincing structure. Whenever "Misterioso" was discharged in 1964 in the United Kingdom, Charles Fox gave it a positive survey in "Gramophone". He discovered its music keeping pace with Monk's typical benchmarks and featured by extraordinary playing by him and the mood segment, especially Haynes, who indicated "by and by what an incredible drummer he was at that point, without a doubt, still is today". Notwithstanding, Fox felt Griffin did not fit in with the group of four and dominated Monk's sytheses, finding the saxophonist's performances diffuse and portrayed by unimportant citations as opposed to melodic advancement.
