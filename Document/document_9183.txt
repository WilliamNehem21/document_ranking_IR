The precise arrangement of the fauna "Achelousaurus" was a piece of is unsure, as its fossils have not been found in direct relationship with other taxa. Its halfway anagenetic position recommends that "Achelousaurus" imparted its natural surroundings to shapes generally found in the center or toward the finish of the time scope of its development. Likewise with horned dinosaurs, Horner expected he had discovered transitional taxa in other dinosaur gatherings of the Two Medicine Formation. One of these was a structure in the middle of "Lambeosaurus" and "Hypacrosaurus"; in 1994 he would name it "Hypacrosaurus stebingeri". Today, "Hypacrosaurus stebingeri" is never again observed as having advanced through anagenesis in light of the fact that autapomorphies of the species have been distinguished. Horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as demonstrative for a taxon in the middle of "Stegoceras" and "Pachycephalosaurus"; these have not been reliably alluded to another variety. At last, Horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional among "Daspletosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus". In 2017, tyrannosaurid stays from the Two Medicine Formation were named as another types of "Daspletosaurus": "Daspletosaurus horneri". The 2017 investigation thought of it as conceivable that "D. horneri" was an immediate relative of "D. torosus" in a procedure of anagenesis, however dismissed the likelihood that "D. horneri" was the predecessor of "Tyrannosaurus".
