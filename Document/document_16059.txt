"T5" was also returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December 1943. "T6" was scuttled by the Italians north of Rimini on 11 September as she had insufficient fuel on board to reach an Allied port. Once under German control, "T7" was also handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and served under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of Yugoslav Partisan propaganda, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. On 24 June 1944, she and the S-boats "S 154" and "S 157" of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between Å ibenik and Rijeka, protecting German sea supply routes along the Adriatic, when they were attacked by the Royal Navy Fairmile D motor torpedo boats "MTB 659", "MTB 662" and "MTB 670" near the island of Kukuljari, south of Murter Island. The MTBs fired two torpedoes at "T7", but missed, so they closed and engaged her with their guns, setting her ablaze. She was beached, and 21 crew were rescued by the MTBs. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more crew, then destroyed her with demolition charges. "T8" was sunk north-west of Dubrovnik by German aircraft while evacuating Italian troops from Dalmatia on 10 or 11 September 1943.
