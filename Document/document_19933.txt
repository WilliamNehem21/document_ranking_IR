In the DVD commentary for the episode, Shearsmith and Pemberton expressed a hope that Pemberton's crossword could be published before the episode's airing, so that viewers would be able to watch the episode having unknowingly already completed the crossword around which it revolves. Pemberton's crossword was published in "The Guardian" on the same day that the episode aired, credited to "Sphinx"; for one critic, this explained and justified the answer "MYSTERYGUEST". The collaboration between "Inside No. 9" and "The Guardian" drew inspiration from the collaboration between "The Simpsons" and "The New York Times" for "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" in 2008. Pemberton dedicated the crossword, which was his first in print, to the late Kenny Ireland. The two of them had completed the "Guardian" crossword daily while filming together for the television comedy "Benidorm". Allowing a one-off contribution from a non-regular setter was deeply unusual for "The Guardian", whose crosswords are normally produced by one of about 25 regular setters. Pemberton, again writing as "Sphinx", went on to publish a further cryptic crossword in "The Guardian" in 2018, during the airing of the fourth series of "Inside No. 9". The puzzle worked independently of any references to "Inside No. 9", but included "an extra layer for ["Inside No. 9"] viewers".
