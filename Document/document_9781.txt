The Australian group made a poor begin in the last after Fraser nearly quit amid the main leg, trusting that a bogus begin had happened after erroneously hearing a second gunfire. She completed her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, just about two seconds slower than her own best, yet enough for a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Swimming the second leg, Leech kept up the lead in the initial 50 meters yet blurred in the second half and completed with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds; the Australian lead was subsequently sliced to 0.9 s. Morgan made a plunge for the third leg and was then redesignd and gone by American Nancy Simons. With 25 meters left, Morgan removed her head from the waterÃ¢ÂÂan essential blunderÃ¢ÂÂand seeing the American a body length in front, reacted with a flood to recapture a 0.7-second lead heading into the last changeover. Crapp then stretched out the edge to 2.2 seconds to verify an Australian triumph in a world-record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The triumph was the first occasion when that Australia had cleared the 100-meter free-form transfer and individual occasions for the two people. The main other time this has been accomplished was by the Americans in 1920 in Antwerp. The success would be Australia's solitary triumph in a female swimming hand-off at the Olympics until the 2004 Games in Athens. The triumph made Morgan Australia's most youthful ever gold medallist; this record still stands.
