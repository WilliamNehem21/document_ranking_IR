Exploiting the Abbasids' distraction with the concealment of the Khurramite defiance, the Byzantine sovereign Theophilos had propelled assaults on the Muslim boondocks zone in the mid 830s, and scored a few triumphs. His powers were supported by around 14,000 Khurramites who fled into the Empire, ended up purified through water and tried out the Byzantine armed force under the order of their pioneer Nasr, better known by his Christian name Theophobos. In 837, Theophilos, asked by the inexorably hard-squeezed Babak, propelled a noteworthy battle into the Muslim wilderness lands. He drove a substantial armed force, allegedly numbering more than 70,000 men, in a practically unopposed intrusion of the district around the upper Euphrates. The Byzantines took the towns of Zibatra (Sozopetra) and Arsamosata, assaulted and pillaged the farmland, extricated emancipate from Malatya and different urban communities in return for not assaulting them, and crushed a few littler Arab powers. As displaced people started touching base at Samarra, the caliphal court was shocked by the mercilessness and boldness of the strikes; not just had the Byzantines acted in open intrigue with the Khurramites, however amid the sack of Zibatra every male detainee were executed and the remainder of the populace sold into bondage, and some hostage ladies were assaulted by Theophilos' Khurramites.
