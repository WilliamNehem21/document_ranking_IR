In "", Lightning is resuscitated following 500 years by the god Bhunivelze. The world is set to finish in thirteen days, and Lightning is picked as the Savior, an otherworldly guide for humankind, which has stopped to age because of the impact of mayhem. As an end-result of Lightning's assistance, Serah will be restored. Supported by Hope, Lightning liberates her previous partners of their passionate weights, reunites with Odin as a white Chocobo, and every now and again runs into Lumina, the physical appearance of Lightning's stifled vulnerabilities. Lightning starts to question her humankind, and, when she discovers that Bhunivelze stole Serah's spirit and controlled Lightning's recollections, she intends to deceive him after he has wrapped up the new world. At the point when the apocalypse arrives, Lightning battles Bhunivelze, who needs to change mankind into his optimal picture and has been forming Lightning to turn into Etro's substitution. In spite of the fact that she is set up to satisfy her new job and surrender her human life, Lightning rather calls for help and acknowledge Lumina as a piece of herself. Everybody she has spared, including Serah, joins with her and thrashings Bhunivelze. Lightning at that point observers the formation of another universe, into which she runs with her partners and the spirits of humankind. In the epilog, she is seen heading out to rejoin with one of her companions.
