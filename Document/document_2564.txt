Campbell passed on all of a sudden in July 1971, however there was sufficient material in "Analog"s stock to enable the rest of the staff to assemble issues for the remainder of the year. CondÃÂ© Nast had given the magazine almost no consideration, since it was both gainful and modest to deliver, however they were glad that it was the main sci-fi magazine. They asked Kay Tarrant, who had been Campbell's collaborator, to enable them to discover a substitution: she reached ordinary supporters of request proposals. A few surely understood authors turned down the activity; Poul Anderson did not have any desire to leave California, and neither did Jerry Pournelle, who likewise felt the pay was excessively little. Before he passed on, Campbell had conversed with Harry Harrison about taking over as editorial manager, however Harrison did not have any desire to live in New York. Lester del Rey and Clifford D. Simak were additionally reputed to have been offered the activity, however Simak denied it; Frederik Pohl was intrigued, yet presumed his craving to alter the course of the magazine reduced his odds with CondÃÂ© Nast. The CondÃÂ© Nast VP accountable for choosing the new proofreader chose to peruse both fiction and true to life composing tests from the candidates, since "Analog"s title included both "sci-fi" and "science reality". He picked Ben Bova, a short time later disclosing to Bova that his accounts and articles "were the main ones I could get it". January 1972 was the primary issue to credit Bova on the masthead.
