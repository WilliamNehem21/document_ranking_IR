In 1968, the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) found a molybdenum store at the base of Castle Peak, the most astounding top in the White Cloud Mountains. ASARCO documented administrative work with the Forest Service to build streets and to take into account an open pit mine underneath Castle Peak to remove the metal. The proposed mine would have been profound, wide, and long. About of material would be prepared every day with 99.5 percent being stored in waste heaps and settling lakes. ASARCO assessed that the mine would make 350 employments and $1 million ($ today) in charges every year, while the streets would open up open doors for further investigation. The Forest Service would not have the capacity to quit mining and ensure the White Cloud Mountains in light of the fact that the General Mining Act of 1872 gave mining rights to any individual who had found a jackpot or placer. Broadly, restriction to the mine mounted, while Republican Governor Don Samuelson voiced help for the mine in 1970, saying that ASARCO was not, "going to tear down mountains. They are just going to burrow a gap." He likewise described Castle Peak as, "only sagebrush on one side and scraggly trees on the other." Samuelson lost his re-appointment offer that November in a rematch with Democrat Cecil Andrus, a supporter of saving the backwoods who later (1977Ã¢ÂÂ 81) filled in as U.S. inside secretary in the Carter Administration.
