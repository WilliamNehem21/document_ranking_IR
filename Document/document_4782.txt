In 1999, the responsibility for Records changed hands, with proprietor and companion of the band Lee Barrett leaving the organization. Opeth marked with UK name Peaceville Records in Europe, which was appropriated by Music for Nations. Opeth held time at Studio Fredman to start take a shot at its next collection, however recording was deferred while the studio was migrated. Because of time requirements, the band had the capacity to practice just twice before entering the studio. Deferrals with the collection's work of art pushed the discharge back an extra month and "Still Life" was discharged on October 18, 1999. Because of issues with the band's new dissemination organize, the collection was not discharged in the United States until February 2001. "Still Life" was the main collection recorded with MÃÂ©ndez, and furthermore the first Opeth collection to hold up under any sort of inscription on the intro page upon its underlying discharge, including the band's logo. Allmusic called "Still Life" a "considerable grafting of unforgiving, regularly barbed guitar riffs with agile tunes." As clarified by ÃÂkerfeldt, "Still Life" is an idea collection: "The principle character is somewhat expelled from the place where he grew up in light of the fact that he lacks same confidence as the remainder of the occupants there. The collection basically begins off when he is returning following quite a long while to attach with his old 'angel.' The enormous managers of the town realize that he's back... A great deal of terrible things begin occurring."
