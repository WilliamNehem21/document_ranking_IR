The joined stilt is commonly found in southern Australia. In Western Australia, it is found dominatingly in the southwestern corner, however can be as far north as the saltworks in Port Hedland. Reproducing occurred at Lake Ballard in the Goldfields-Esperance after overwhelming precipitation from Cyclone Bobby in 1995, and afterward again subsequent to flooding in 2014. In 1933 an expansive settlement had been recorded at Lake Grace, however had surrendered to assault apparently by foxes. The joined stilt has been recorded in southeastern South Australia, just as the seepage of the Lake Eyre framework, and in Victoria west of Port Phillip and the Wimmera. In July 2010 Lake Torrens loaded up with water, bringing about the inundation of around 150,000 joined stilts. The Natimuk-Douglas Wetlands in western Victoria are a vital settling ground for the species, however lower numbers come here if there is flooding somewhere else in southeastern Australia. In New South Wales, it is most generally found in the Riverina and western pieces of the state, and has achieved southern Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it has been found at the sewage lakes at Alice Springs and Erldunda. It has been recorded as a vagrant to Tasmania, with critical numbers recorded in 1981.
