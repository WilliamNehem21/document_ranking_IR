Breckinridge was a representative to the January 8, 1851, state Democratic tradition which assigned Lazarus W. Powell for senator. After seven days, he reported that he would look for race to Congress from Kentucky's Eighth District. Nicknamed the "Ashland locale" since it contained Ashland, the domain of Whig Party author Henry Clay, and a great part of the zone Clay once spoke to, the region was a Whig fortress. In the past congressional decision, Democrats had not in any case assigned a hopeful. Breckinridge's rival, Leslie Combs, was a previous state administrator whose fame was reinforced by his relationship with Clay and his interest in the War of 1812; he was relied upon to win the decision effectively. In April, the competitors held a discussion in Frankfort, and in May, they together campaigned the region, delivering every day discourses. Breckinridge emphasized his severe constructionist perspective on the U.S. Constitution and decried the defensive levies supported by the Whigs, expressing that "free idea needs facilitated commerce". His solid voice and charming identity appeared differently in relation to the crusade style of the a lot more seasoned Combs. On race day, he conveyed just three of the locale's seven areas, yet amassed a two-to-one triumph edge in Owen County, winning the district by 677 votes and the decision by 537. Democrats conveyed five of Kentucky's ten congressional locale, and Powell was chosen as the principal Democratic representative since 1834.
