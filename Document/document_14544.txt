In Roman historiography, the clerical history of Tyrannius Rufinus, a Latin interpretation and augmentation of crafted by Eusebius dated around 402, offers a record of the Christian change of Ethiopia (marked as "India ulterior") by the minister Frumentius of Tire. The content clarifies that Frumentius, so as to finish this undertaking, was appointed a cleric by Athanasius of Alexandria (298Ã¢ÂÂ 373), in all likelihood after 346 amid the last's third residency as Bishop of Alexandria. The mission surely occurred before 357, when Athanasius was removed, supplanted by George of Cappadocia, and constrained into flight, amid which he composed a contrite letter to Roman sovereign Constantius II (r. 337Ã¢ÂÂ 361) that fortuitously saved an Imperial Roman letter to the regal court of Aksum. In this letter, Constantius II tends to two "dictators" of Ethiopia, Aizanas and Sazanas, who are without a doubt Ezana and his sibling Saiazana, or Sazanan, a military authority. The letter likewise implies that the leader of Aksum was at that point a Christian ruler. From the early engravings of Ezana's rule obviously he was previously a polytheist, who raised bronze, silver, and gold statues to Ares, Greek lord of war. Be that as it may, the double Greek and Sabaean-style Ge'ez engravings on the Ezana Stone, remembering Ezana's triumphs of the Kingdom of Kush (situated in Nubia, for example present day Sudan), notice his change to Christianity. This case is bolstered by the Christian image of the cross improving for all intents and purposes all Aksumite coins stamped after Ezana's rule, alongside the unexpected suspension of polytheistic compositions.
