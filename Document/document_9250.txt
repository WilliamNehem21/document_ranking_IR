Saunders was among a gathering of men cleared from Crete by a British submarine in May 1942, and came back to Australia in October. He rejoined his old unit, the 2/seventh Battalion, which had re-framed in Palestine and been taken back to Australia alongside the remainder of the sixth Division to help guard against the danger presented by Japan's entrance into the war. In November 1942, Saunders' more youthful sibling Harry, who had enrolled soon after him in 1940, was executed in real life while serving in New Guinea with the 2/fourteenth Battalion. At the point when Harry had signed up, Reg reviewed, "I was furious on the grounds that I was the special case that should go.ÃÂ ... with two of us there, one of us would get killedÃÂ ..." The senior Saunders in this manner served in New Guinea too, battling in the SalamauaÃ¢ÂÂ Lae crusade in mid-1943 where, having again been advanced brief sergeant, he took over order of a detachment when its authority was injured in real life. For his administration, he was suggested for a commission by his leader, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn. At the point when Guinn let him know of his arrangement, Saunders snickered and stated, "I would prefer not to be an officerÃÂ ... I'd preferably be Regimental Sergeant Major". Guinn reacted, "Christ, they don't make young men RSMs".
