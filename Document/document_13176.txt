The west range at Netley is little and does not run the full length of the west side of the house. It is isolated in two by the first principle access to the monastery, with an external parlor where the priests could meet guests. North of this on the ground floor were basements for sustenance stockpiling, and toward the south was the lay siblings' refectory. The upper floor, come to by a stair from the order, was the quarters for the lay siblings. Netley was a late establishment, worked when the lay siblings were a declining some portion of the Cistercian economy, and it is likely that they were less in number, consequently the little size of the settlement required. When the west range was finished in the fourteenth century they were quickly vanishing, and had everything except evaporated before the century's over. Amid the late fourteenth and fifteenth hundreds of years most Cistercian houses exploited the huge territory of the religious community at that point left unfilled and changed over the lay siblings' quarters to new employments. At certain houses, for example, Sawley Abbey in Lancashire, a progression of agreeable chambers for the utilization of religious authorities or visitors were constructed; somewhere else, for example, Hailes Abbey in Gloucestershire, the west range was transformed into a private abiding of extraordinary style for the abbot. The remains of the west range at Netley are too fragmentary to be in any way certain about their motivation in the last piece of the medieval period.
