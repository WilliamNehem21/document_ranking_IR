After two matches as between time mentor, Wilmots consented to supplant Leekens as chief. Following his arrangement, the group's outcomes improved, to such an extent that some remote media viewed it as another Belgian brilliant age. The youthful Belgian squad qualified as unbeaten gathering champs for the 2014 World Cup finals, and earned Belgium's second-since forever place in a World Cup quarter-finals with a four-coordinate series of wins. Belgium met all requirements for Euro 2016 with a match to save in October 2015, and took the top spot in the FIFA World Rankings without precedent for November 2015, to remain first for five months. In the next year, Belgium couldn't affirm their job as pariah at the European Championship with a quarter-last disposal by the 26th FIFA-positioned Welsh group. This provoked the RBFA to expel Wilmots. In the 2018 World Cup qualifying distribution, they were seeded first in their gathering, and made the last competition under Spanish supervisor Roberto MartÃÂ­nez, turning into the principal European group other than hosts Russia to do as such. The group achieved an unsurpassed high third spot in the World Football Elo Ratings after their success in the round of 16. Belgium was wiped out in the semi-finals by possible victors France, yet won the third spot play-off against England.
