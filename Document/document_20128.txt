The cantata shows elements which became standards for Bach's Leipzig cantatas and even the Passions, including a "frame of biblical text and chorale around the operatic forms of aria and recitative", "the fugal setting of biblical words" and "the biblical narrativeÂ ... as a dramatic ".
As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in MÃ¼hlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata .
Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the , the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the . The first cantatas he composed in the new position were , for Palm Sunday, for Jubilate Sunday, and , for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-KÃ¶then. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.
