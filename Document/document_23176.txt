After Gay attained its peak intensity, outflow from Typhoon Hunt to its northwest increased the wind shear over the typhoon. The wind shear deteriorated Gay's northern eyewall, causing the typhoon to weaken. In the 24Â hours after Gay reached its peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that the winds had decreased by 65Â km/h (40Â mph) to below super typhoon status; such rapid weakening is uncommon for a storm over open waters. Tropical cyclone forecast models had anticipated Gay to make a turn to the north and northeast, but it maintained a west-northwest track toward Guam. Despite weakening steadily, the typhoon maintained a large size with a wind diameter of . Around 0000Â UTC on NovemberÂ 23, Gay made landfall on Guam, becoming the third typhoon in three months to strike the islandâthe others were Typhoon Omar in August and Typhoon Brian in October. Both the JTWC and the JMA estimated the typhoon to have had winds of 160Â km/h (100Â mph) at landfall. The influence from Typhoon Hunt diminished after Gay affected Guam, allowing it to begin restrengthening. Late on NovemberÂ 25, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 215Â km/h (135Â mph). Gay subsequently slowed while moving along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and it turned north while gradually weakening. On NovemberÂ 28, the JMA downgraded Gay to a tropical storm, and the JTWC followed suit the next day. The JMA assessed that Gay became an extratropical cyclone at 0000Â UTC on NovemberÂ 30; however, the JTWC continued issuing advisories until DecemberÂ 1, making it the longest-lasting typhoon of the season with 63Â advisories. The remnant of Gay accelerated and turned to the northeast, passing to the southeast of Japan and crossing the International Date Line.
