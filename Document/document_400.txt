In 1947, at Atalaia in Portugal, brachiosaurid remains were found in layers dating from the Tithonian. Albert-FÃÂ©lix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyszewski named them as the species "Brachiosaurus atalaiensis" in 1957. Its referral to "Brachiosaurus" was questioned in the 2004 version of "The Dinosauria" by Paul Upchurch, Barret, and Peter Dodson who recorded it as an up 'til now anonymous brachiosaurid class. In no time before the distribution of the 2004 book, the species had been set in its own variety "Lusotitan" by Miguel Telles Antunes and OctÃÂ¡vio Mateus in 2003. De Lapparent and Zbyszewski had portrayed a progression of remains however did not assign a sort example. Antunes and Mateus chose a halfway postcranial skeleton (MIGMÃÂ 4978, 4798, 4801Ã¢ÂÂ 4810, 4938, 4944, 4950, 4952, 4958, 4964Ã¢ÂÂ 4966, 4981Ã¢ÂÂ 4982, 4985, 8807, 8793Ã¢ÂÂ 87934) as the lectotype; this example incorporates twenty-eight vertebrae, chevrons, ribs, a conceivable shoulder bone, humeri, lower arm bones, incomplete left pelvis, lower leg bones, and part of the correct lower leg. The low neural spines, the conspicuous deltopectoral peak of the humerus (a muscle connection site on the upper arm bone), the extended humerus (long and thin), and the long hub of the ilium tilted upward demonstrate that "Lusotitan" is a brachiosaurid, which was affirmed by some later investigations, for example, an examination in 2013.
