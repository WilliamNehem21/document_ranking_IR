About 09:00, MariÃÂ and MarkoviÃÂ went to Zagreb to see PetroviÃÂ, who requested them to quickly come back to their division and keep on opposing the Germans. On the arrival venture, they experienced the greater part of their division pulling back towards KriÃÂ¾evci, except for the mounted force units as yet battling north of Koprivnica. MariÃÂ ended the retreat, and set up positions around Mali GrabiÃÂani, making his base camp at KriÃÂ¾evci. GeorgijeviÃÂ rejected his Croat troops and withdrew with the remainder of his power towards Zagreb, and the leader of the 104th Infantry Regiment released every one of his troops. Toward the evening, the hard-squeezed mounted force units started to pull back. About 14:00, the second Cavalry Regiment pulled back to Novigrad Podravski by means of Bregi, yet getting a threatening gathering from the Croat populace, proceeded towards Bjelovar. About 18:00, the first Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment pulled back by means of Koprivnica, achieving the remainder of the division about 23:00. About 19:00, the Germans involved Koprivnica without obstruction. Before sun-down, MariÃÂ's division numbered around 2,000 troops, the 36th Infantry Regiment and 81st Cavalry Regiment were generally scattered, the 53rd Infantry Regiment had viably stopped to exist, and his mounted guns regiment had just two steeds to pull weapons.
