One of the subjects that rules the last piece of Blair's time in office is his choice to go along with US President George W. Shrubbery in submitting troops to the 2003 attack of Iraq, the repercussions of which he depicts as a "bad dream", yet that he accepts to have been important in light of the fact that Saddam Hussein "had not surrendered the system of WMD [weapons of mass destruction], only settled on a strategic choice to place it into suspension". He would settle on a similar choice again as to Iran, cautioning that if that nation creates atomic weapons it will change the parity of intensity of the Middle East, to the district's hindrance. Blair trusts a few issues in Iraq still require a "goals" and will rot whenever left unattended. Of the war dead he says, "I feel frantically upset for them, sorry for the lives cut off, sorry for the families whose loss is exacerbated by the contention over why their friends and family kicked the bucket, sorry for the totally unreasonable determination that the misfortune ought to be theirs." A year on from the attack he trusts Bush will win a second term as US President: "I had come to like and appreciate George," he composes.
