Elevated to amass commander, Murdoch was designated Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at Eastern Area Command, Sydney, in July 1943. In January 1944, he moved toward becoming SASO at North-Western Area Command, which controlled thirteen Australian, British, Dutch, and American squadrons from its base camp in Darwin, Northern Territory. Murdoch arranged a considerable lot of the order's bombarding and mining tasks in the South West Pacific Theater, and was referenced in despatches for his "recognized administration" in the job. He was presented as SASO on the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.ÃÂ 1 TAF) in April 1945, supplanting Group Captain William Gibson after the last's rejection in the wake of the "Morotai Mutiny", when the undermined renunciations of eight of the RAAF's driving warrior pros caused an emergency in the development's authority. Designated operational duty by No.ÃÂ 1 TAF's new Air Officer Commanding, Air Commodore Frederick Scherger, Murdoch got a significant part of the credit for the "superb" arranging of the RAAF's job in Operation Oboe Six, the attack of Labuan. He went with Scherger aground on the evening of the arrivals on 10ÃÂ June 1945. Murdoch was likewise applauded for his staff work amid Operation Oboe Two, the Battle of Balikpapan, in July.
