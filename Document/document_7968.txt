The most compelling retelling, which as indicated by numerous observers guaranteed that the "Mary Celeste" issue could never be overlooked, was a story in the January 1884 issue of the "Cornhill Magazine". This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle, at that point a 25-year-old ship's specialist. Doyle's story, titled "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement", did not cling to the certainties. He renamed the ship "Marie Celeste", the chief's name was J. W. Tibbs, the deadly voyage occurred in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel conveyed travelers, among them the main Jephson. In the story, another traveler, a fan named Septimus Goring with a contempt of the white race, has suborned individuals from the team to kill Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, the remainder of the ship's organization is murdered, put something aside for Jephson who is saved in light of the fact that he has a supernatural appeal that is adored by Goring and his assistants. Doyle had not anticipated that his story should be paid attention to, yet Sprague, as yet filling in as the US delegate in Gibraltar, was adequately charmed to ask if any piece of the story may be valid.
