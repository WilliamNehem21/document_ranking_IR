Distinguishing features can also be found in the ilium of the pelvis. In "Brachiosaurus", the ischiadic peduncle, a downward projecting extension connecting to the ischium, reaches farther downward than in "Giraffatitan". While the latter genus had a sharp notch between the ischiadic peduncle and the back portion of the ilium, this notch is more rounded in "Brachiosaurus". On the upper surface of the hind part of the ilium, "Brachiosaurus" had a pronounced tubercle that is absent in other sauropods. Of the hindlimb, the femur was very similar to that of "Giraffatitan" although slightly more robust, and measured long. As in "Giraffatitan", it was strongly elliptical in cross-section, being more than twice as wide in front or back view than in side view. The fourth trochanter, a prominent bulge on the back side of the femoral shaft, was more prominent and located further downward. This bulge served as anchor point for the most important locomotory muscle, the caudofemoralis, which was situated in the tail and pulled the upper thigh backward when contracted. At the lower end of the femur, the pair of condyles did not extend backward as strongly as in "Giraffatitan"; the two condyles were similar in width in "Brachiosaurus" but unequal in "Giraffatitan".
