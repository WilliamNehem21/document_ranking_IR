Charles suspected, most likely effectively, that a few individuals from the English Parliament had intrigued with the attacking Scots. On 3 January 1642, Charles guided Parliament to surrender five individuals from the Commons Ã¢ÂÂ Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode and Sir Arthur Haselrig Ã¢ÂÂ and one companion Ã¢ÂÂ Lord Mandeville Ã¢ÂÂ on the grounds of high treachery. At the point when Parliament won't, it was potentially Henrietta Maria who convinced Charles to capture the five individuals by power, which Charles expected to complete by and by. Be that as it may, updates on the warrant achieved Parliament in front of him, and the needed men disappeared by pontoon in the blink of an eye before Charles went into the House of Commons with an outfitted watchman on 4 January. Having dislodged the Speaker, William Lenthall, from his seat, the ruler asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees, broadly answered, "May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to talk in this spot however as the House is satisfied to guide me, whose worker I am here." Charles wretchedly proclaimed "every one of my winged creatures have flown", and was compelled to resign, with next to nothing.
