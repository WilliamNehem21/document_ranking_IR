The principal work presently commonly considered as a musical drama is Jacopo Peri's "Dafne" of 1597, intently pursued by "Euridice" (1600), for which Peri and Giulio Caccini composed separate melodic settings. Ottavio Rinuccini was the librettist for both "Dafne" and "Euridice". In the new sort a total story was told through characters, and notwithstanding themes and gatherings, the vocal parts included recitative, aria and arioso. This was an improvement from different more seasoned types of melodic performance center that had existed since the most punctual long stretches of the Italian Renaissance; such structures incorporated the "maschera" ("masque"), the "ballo" (a move excitement, frequently with sung sections), and especially the "intermedio" or "intermezzo", a short sensational melodic scene embedded as a preface or "entr'acte" between the demonstrations of straight plays. Another arrangement in the later renaissance time frame was the "torneo", or "competition", a stylised sensational scene in which the primary singing was performed by a storyteller. Sub-operatic types of sensational music kept on flourishing as musical drama itself built up; the obscured limits that existed for a long time between these structures and "musical show" has prompted banter about how to classify a few functions. For instance, the exact type of Monteverdi's "Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda" (1624) has demonstrated especially hard to characterize.
