The scene was altered by arrangement customary Jay Rabinowitz in a Manhattan NBC office, with discussion at different occasions by Fleder, Yoshimura and Tom Fontana. Rabinowitz altered the scene for a few days alone, at that point worked with Fleder for four days, making several alters to the scene. Yoshimura worked with the editorial manager next and was baffled with the primary cut of the scene that he saw, asserting that it should have been "much increasingly frantic and chaotics toward the end, and not all that aesthetic". Yoshimura likewise disclosed to Rabinowitz that the finished product of the scene should put solid accentuation on Braugher in light of the fact that he felt that the story is experienced "through his eyes". Amid the altering procedure, Yoshimura initially evacuated a scene including an outline of Pembleton riding the elevator out of the tram station after Lange passed on. Yoshimura felt that the shot was excessively nostalgic, yet Levinson by and by had it put back in the scene after Fleder professed to have "asked" for it to be incorporated. At the point when Fontana first viewed the scene, he felt that the preface was too confounding in light of the fact that it was hard to tell what occurred amid the mishap scene. It was altered with the goal that somewhat concentrating on medium shots of D'Onofrio and MacVittie, it incorporated a more extensive shot to build up the nearness of a metro train before the mishap so watchers would not be so confounded.
