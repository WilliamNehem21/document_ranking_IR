Pundits praised "Turok"s designs; while giving the remainder of the diversion a lukewarm reaction, Burrill and the "EGM" group both evaluated the visuals profoundly. Polak said that the diversion demonstrated the amazingness of the Nintendo 64's illustrations in the comfort showcase. Translucent water, destructible trees and focal point flares were among the graphical subtleties adulated by commentators. "The Washington Post"s Tom Ham said that "similarly noteworthy" as the natural detail were the "consistent with life" activitys. "Overwhelm a baddie and he'll get his throat, blood splatting, and after that tumble to the ground, as yet shaking," Ham composed. "How might you put a cost on that?" Scary Larry concurred that the grisly passing livelinesss are a feature of the inside and out noteworthy designs. The dimension of violence and blood in the amusement lead commentators, for example, Scary Larry, "The Times"s Tim Wapshott, and "The Washington Times"s Joseph Szadkowski to alert against giving kids a chance to play the diversion. GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann noticed that the illustrations included some significant downfalls; if in excess of a couple of foes showed up on screen in the meantime, the amusement's casing rate would back off. Gerstmann composed that the separation haze used to decrease the log jam was a "slick impact" as foes would show up out of the fog "teeth first", in spite of the fact that it covered the reassure's constraints. Perry remarked that the failure to investigate the separation constrained players to depend on the diversion map. "People to come" said that while "Turok" was in general likely the most attractive Nintendo 64 diversion to date, the restricted surface palette makes every one of the conditions seem comparative, making the amusement perplexing notwithstanding the guide.
