As an engineering student of history, Hughes considers Sharpe to be "in the top position". His illustrations of real Gothic structures were still being used a century after his demise. The structural history specialist James Price expresses that Sharpe was "considered the best expert on Cistercian Abbeys in England". A few scholars have viewed Sharpe as an early pioneer of the Gothic Revival, in spite of the fact that as Hughes would like to think this is "most likely more for his books than for his structures". In 1897, 20ÃÂ years after his demise, Sharpe was viewed as adequately eminent to justify a passage in the "Word reference of National Biography". In the article, the writer alludes to his being "an excited and significant understudy of medieval engineering". As a railroad engineer he might have been "not really an unfit achievement"; yet his regulatory and enticing abilities were significant, as is appeared in his arranging of railroads in Northwest England, and in the sterile change and water supply of Lancaster. As a beginner performer his "blessings were immense". Hughes thinks about that Sharpe "utilized his abilities to the full", and in perspective on the manners by which he utilized his numerous blessings, Price portrays him as Lancaster's "Renaissance man".
