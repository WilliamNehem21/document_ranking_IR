Pedro Paez (1564Ã¢ÂÂ 1622), a Spanish Jesuit at the court of Susenyos I, deciphered parts of the annals of Ethiopian sovereigns extending back to the reign of Amda Seyon I in the fourteenth century AD, just as the reign of lord Kaleb of Axum in the sixth century AD. A portion of these pieces were saved in the "Historia de Ethiopia" by the Portuguese Jesuit Manuel de Almeida (1580Ã¢ÂÂ 1646), however Paez's unique original copy was generally modified to expel polemical entries against the opponent Dominican Order. Paez additionally interpreted a part from an Ethiopian hagiography that secured the life and works of the thirteenth century ruler Gebre Mesqel Lalibela. The "Historia de Ethiopia", which landed in Goa, India, before the finish of 1624, was not distributed in Europe until the cutting edge period and just stayed available for use among individuals from the Society of Jesus in Portuguese India, in spite of the fact that Almeida's guide of Ethiopia was distributed by Baltasar Teles in 1660. In his treatise "A Voyage to Abyssinia", the Portuguese Jesuit teacher JerÃÂ³nimo Lobo (1595Ã¢ÂÂ 1678) portrayed Abyssinia and its occupants, showing that the local occupants were of two unmistakable physical sorts: the Abyssinians legitimate, who were restricted included, close olive-cleaned, and had long hair which they wore in different styles, and the Soudans, who were platyrrhine (for example level nosed), dark cleaned, and had wooly hair. Following the surrender of Susenyos I, his child and successor Fasilides (r. 1632Ã¢ÂÂ 1667) had the Jesuits removed from Ethiopia.
