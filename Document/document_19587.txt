"The Man in the Moone" was published five months after "The Discovery of a World in the Moone" by John Wilkins, later bishop of Chester. Wilkins refers to Godwin once, in a discussion of spots in the Moon, but not to Godwin's book. In the third edition of "The Discovery" (1640), however, Wilkins provides a summary of Godwin's book, and later in "Mercury" (1641) he comments on "The Man in the Moone" and "Nuncius Inanimatus", saying that "the former text could be used to unlock the secrets of the latter". "The Man in the Moone" quickly became an international "source of humour and parody": Cyrano de Bergerac, using Baudoin's 1648 translation, parodied it in "L'Autre Monde: oÃ¹ les Ãtats et Empires de la Lune" (1657); Cyrano's traveller actually meets Gonsales, who is still on the Moon, "degraded to the status of pet monkey". It was one of the inspirations for what has been called the first science fiction text in the Americas, "Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures Aligned to the Meridian of MÃ©rida of the YucatÃ¡n by an Anctitone or Inhabitant of the MoonÂ ..." by Manuel Antonio de Rivas (1775). The Laputan language of Jonathan Swift, who was a distant relation of Godwin's, may have been influenced by "The Man in the Moone", either directly or through Cyrano de Bergerac.
