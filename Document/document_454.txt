"WÃÂ¶rth" and the remainder of the squadron went to services for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal at Kiel on 3 December 1894. The squadron along these lines started a winter preparing journey in the Baltic Sea; this was the main such voyage by the German armada. In earlier years, the main part of the armada was deactivated for the winter months. The I Division secured in Stockholm from 7 to 11 December, amid the 300th commemoration of the introduction of Swedish lord Gustavus Adolphus. Further activities were led in the Baltic before the boats needed to put into their home ports for fixes. From 19 December to 27 March 1895, "WÃÂ¶rth" came back to her old obligation as armada lead while "KurfÃÂ¼rst Friedrich Wilhelm" was in dock for fixes. The ship was busy with individual and divisional preparing in mid 1895. In May, progressively armada moves were done in the western Baltic, finishing up with a visit by the armada to Kirkwall in Orkney. The squadron came back to Kiel toward the beginning of June, where arrangements were in progress for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Strategic activities were completed in Kiel Bay within the sight of outside appointments to the opening function.
