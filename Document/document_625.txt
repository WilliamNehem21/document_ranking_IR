Protestants praised Walsingham as "a sound mainstay of our federation and boss supporter of prudence, learning and valor". He was a piece of a Protestant intellectual elite that included Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser and John Dee: men who advanced an expansionist and patriot English Renaissance. Spenser incorporated a dedicatory poem to Walsingham in the "Faerie Queene", comparing him to Maecenas who acquainted Virgil with the Emperor Augustus. After Walsingham's demise, Sir John Davies made an acrostic lyric in his memory and Watson composed a funeral poem, "Meliboeus", in Latin. Then again, Jesuit Robert Persons thought Walsingham "coldblooded and uncaring" in his abuse of Catholics. Catholic sources depict a merciless, wicked man driven by religious prejudice and an over the top love for interest. Walsingham draws in contention still. In spite of the fact that he was merciless, his rivals on the Catholic side were no less so; the treatment of detainees and suspects by Tudor specialists was run of the mill of European administrations of the time. Walsingham's own, rather than his open, character is subtle; his open papers were seized by the legislature while a significant number of his private papers, which may have uncovered much, were lost. The pieces that do endure show his own enthusiasm for cultivating and falconry.
