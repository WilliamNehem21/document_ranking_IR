The Spanish described the weapons of war of the PetÃ©n Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords known as "hadzab" that were crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian; these were similar to the Aztec "macuahuitl". They had a thin, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in the wood. The shaft was up to long and was crafted from the hard, dark wood of a flowering tree ("Apoplanesia paniculata") called "chulul" by the Maya. The bows used by the Maya were described as almost as high as a man and were made from the same "chulul" wood as the "hadzab", with the bowstring fashioned from henequen fibre; the bow was called a "chuhul". Arrows were made from reeds with flint, bone or fishtooth arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers. In hand-to-hand combat the Maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a "chulul"-wood handle, they were about long. Maya spears were referred to as "nabte"; sometimes the tip was fire-hardened, sometimes they were set with a stone blade. Spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin. The Maya used several different sizes of spear with the smaller spears probably employed as a missile; the longer spears were a similar size as those used by the Spanish.
