The RAAF had then raised three warrior unitsÃ¢ÂÂNos.ÃÂ 75, 76 and 77 SquadronsÃ¢ÂÂfurnished with Kittyhawks as of late conveyed from the United States. Cresswell, recently elevated to squadron pioneer, accepted direction of No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron at Pearce, Western Australia, on 20ÃÂ April. At twenty-one, he was more youthful than the vast majority of his work force. Drawing on his specialized involvement with Westinghouse, he urged his pilots to regard their air ship and the ground groups that looked after them. At first in charge of the air protection of Perth, No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron exchanged to Batchelor Airfield close Darwin in August, turning into the first RAAF contender unit to be positioned in the North-Western Area. It moved to another of Darwin's satellite runways, Livingstone, in September. Cresswell drove the squadron in the resistance of Darwin against Japanese marauders and guaranteed its first elevated triumph soon after 5ÃÂ a.m. on 23ÃÂ November 1942, when he obliterated a Mitsubishi "Betty" aircraft. It was the principal "execute" for an Australian squadron over the territory, and the main night triumph over Australia. When he came back to base and was asked what he felt like, Cresswell answered, "Breakfast". He souvenired the radio administrator's seat from the aircraft's destruction.
