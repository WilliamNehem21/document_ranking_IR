The French and British maritime staffs moved to Geneva, where a second understanding was marked on 17 September 1937. It broadened the guidelines overseeing submarine fighting to surface vessels, and had similar signatories. Official variants of the two understandings were distributed in French and English. A few proposition were not executed: for example, the British Admiral Ernle Chatfield needed the Spanish gatherings to have the capacity to confirm that the banner a ship was showing was right, along these lines averting assaults on British transportation if Republican boats kept on utilizing the British banner as a ways to get out. This would have profited the Nationalists, and the French demanded that this arrangement be dropped. Greece and Turkey needed boats with an unmistakable distinguishing imprint to be prohibited, in order to abstain from being compelled to flame on a German or Italian warship. This was rejected, yet a change was made enabling countries to issue their favored requests in their own regional waters. A proposal to flame at any assaulting air ship was effectively passed. Another proposal on surface boats (which erroneously expressed no assault had yet been demonstrated) was in the long run toughened with the expansion of a provision expressing aggressors would be assaulted, in line with the French. A Soviet proposition reinforcing the impact of the understanding was made.
