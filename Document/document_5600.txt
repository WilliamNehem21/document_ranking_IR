"B.ÃÂ telmatiaea" is one of five "Banksia" animal varieties, all firmly identified with "B.ÃÂ sphaerocarpa", that have profoundly unordinary blossom nectar. Though other "Banksia" species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is light yellow at first, yet bit by bit ends up darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green adhesive inside one to two days of emission. On account of "B.ÃÂ telmatiaea", it in the long run turns into "a practically dark, thick irregularity clinging to the base of the blooms". This abnormal nectar was first noted in 1980 by Byron Lamont, who ascribed its change to the cyanobacteria that he watched bolstering off the nectar sugars. Taking note of that a considerable lot of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts, he guessed that they help the plant by fixing climatic nitrogen, which is then washed off the blossom heads by downpour, and consumed by the proteoid root tangle. This indicated advantageous interaction was researched in 1985, however no proof of nitrogen fixing was found. Further examinations in 1996 recommended that the discolouration isn't brought about by cyanobacteria or different microorganisms in the nectar, however is somewhat "a synthetic wonder of plant birthplace". As of February 2007, the reason was as yet obscure. Concoction investigation of "B.ÃÂ telmatiaea" nectar has appeared at have an ordinary nectar sugar piece, but overwhelmed by sucrose.
