The people of the Marshall Islands featured Auriga in the myth of DÃ¼mur, which tells the story of the creation of the sky. Antares in Scorpius represents DÃ¼mur, the oldest son of the stars' mother, and the Pleiades represent her youngest son. The mother of the stars, Ligedaner, is represented by Capella; she lived on the island of Alinablab. She told her sons that the first to reach an eastern island would become the King of the Stars, and asked DÃ¼mur to let her come in his canoe. He refused, as did each of her sons in turn, except for Pleiades. Pleiades won the race with the help of Ligedaner, and became the King of the Stars. Elsewhere in the central Caroline Islands, Capella was called "Jefegen uun" (variations include "efang alul", "evang-el-ul", and "iefangel uul"), meaning "north of Aldebaran". Different names were noted for Auriga and Capella in Eastern Pacific societies. On Pukapuka, the figure of modern Auriga was called "Te Wale-o-Tutakaiolo" ("The house of Tutakaiolo"); in the Society Islands, it was called "Faa-nui" ("Great Valley"). Capella itself was called "Tahi-anii" ("Unique Sovereign") in the Societies. "Hoku-lei" was the name for Capella but may have been the name for the whole constellation; the name means "Star-wreath" and refers to one of the wives of the Pleiades, called "Makalii".
