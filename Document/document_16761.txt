The first part of the title indicates that the âstoriesâ are not merely fictitious but have a factual basis in domestic, quotidian life, though readers would understand âfrom real lifeâ to mean âbased onâ or âadapted from real âlifeâ, and not necessarily ârepresentation of actual eventsâ. The âstoriesâ are âoriginalâ because narratives for children should start afresh in order to avoid continued ideological contamination from vulgar chapbooks or courtly âfairy talesâ. The phrase âreal lifeâ strengthens âoriginalâ, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary. âConversationsâ suggests familiar, familial discourse rather than formal moralising. âCalculatedâ suggests a programme rationally determined. These âconversationsâ and âstoriesâ are also to construct the youthful self in a particular way, by regulating âthe affectionsâ or emotional self and forming âthe mindâ or rational and moral self âto truth and goodnessââunderstood in terms of professional middle-class culture.
As Richardson explains, in "Original Stories" adulthood is defined by the ability to discipline oneself by "constructing moral tales" out of one's life. Wollstonecraft's extensive use of inset tales encourages her readers to construct a moral narrative out of their own lives, with a predetermined ending. At the end of the book, Mary and Caroline no longer require a teacher because they have learnt the storylines which Mrs. Mason has taught themâthey know the stories that they are supposed to enact.
