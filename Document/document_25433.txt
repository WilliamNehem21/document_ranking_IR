Other Coward works produced in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays "Easy Virtue" (1926), a drama about a divorcÃ©e's clash with her snobbish in-laws; "The Queen Was in the Parlour", a Ruritanian romance; "This Was a Man" (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; "The Marquise" (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; "Home Chat" (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues "On with the Dance" (1925) and "This Year of Grace" (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play "Sirocco" (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, "the two most beautiful things in the world are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, "My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles."
