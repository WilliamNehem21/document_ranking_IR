In late October 1942, amid the Guadalcanal Campaign, "Jun'yÃÂ" participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Right now, her air aggregate comprised of eighteen Zeros, eighteen D3As and nine B5Ns. At 05:00 on 26 October 1942, she had propelled fourteen Zeros and a couple D3As to arrive at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, which had been erroneously revealed by the Imperial Japanese Army as in their grasp, however they were welcomed by Marine Grumman F4F Wildcats and all were shot down. At 09:30, "Jun'yÃÂ" propelled another air strike that assaulted the bearer , the warship and the light cruiser , scoring hits on the last two, yet exacting minimal generous harm. Three D3As and a B5N were shot somewhere near returning Douglas SBD Dauntless plunge planes. Kakuta requested another air strike to be propelled at 14:15, utilizing six B5Ns from the harmed and nine D3As from the two transporters. In no time a while later, more air ship were propelled to assault the American boats, including six B5Ns and six D3As escorted by about six Zeros. These air ship assaulted the transporter , which had been seriously harmed by the assaults before in the day. American harm control measures had been somewhat fruitful, yet one torpedo hit by a B5N from "ShÃÂkaku" expanded her rundown from 7.5ÃÂ° to 14.5ÃÂ° and close misses by the plunge planes began enough creases in her plating that her rundown expanded to 18ÃÂ°. The Americans at long last arranged the ship deserted and the last rush of jump planes hit "Hornet" twice more, yet exacted minimal further harm.
