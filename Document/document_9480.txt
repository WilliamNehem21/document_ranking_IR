Tortoise numbers declined from more than 250,000 in the sixteenth century to a low of around 3,000 during the 1970s. This decay was brought about by overexploitation of the species for meat and oil, living space freedom for horticulture, and acquaintance of non-local creatures with the islands, for example, rodents, goats, and pigs. The termination of most monster tortoise heredities is thought to have additionally been brought about by predation by people or human precursors, as the tortoises themselves have no characteristic predators. Tortoise populaces on no less than three islands have turned out to be terminated in chronicled times because of human exercises. Examples of these wiped out taxa exist in a few exhibition halls and furthermore are being exposed to DNA examination. Ten types of the first 15 make due in the wild; an eleventh species ("Chelonoidis abingdonii") had just a solitary known living individual, kept in bondage and nicknamed Lonesome George until his demise in June 2012. Protection endeavors, starting in the twentieth century, have brought about a large number of hostage reproduced adolescents being discharged onto their tribal home islands, and the all out number of the species is evaluated to have surpassed 19,000 toward the beginning of the 21st century. Regardless of this bounce back, the species all in all is named "helpless" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
