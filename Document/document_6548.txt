Dissimilar to most different multituberculates and different well evolved creatures, the calcaneus bone at the back of the foot had a short tuber calcanei (like some tree kangaroos), with an extended, iron block molded proximal procedure firmly twisted downwards and to the side. "Catopsbaatar" had an os calcaris bone on the inward side of its lower leg, a component likewise found in present day male monotremes (the platypus and the echidna) and other Mesozoic warm blooded creatures. The os calcaris bone was plate-like and rectangular in blueprint; as in monotremes, it bolstered the cornu calcaris in shaping a goad on the external side of the bone structure (bunch of foot bones). Dissimilar to with other Mesozoic well evolved creatures, these two components were not combined in multituberculates. The cornu calcaris was triangular, with a concavity in the center, and was long. The goad was smoothed, and was thicker at its combination with the os calcaris (where they associated through a few edges). As the goad of PM120/107 may have been moved from its unique position, it is obscure whether it confronted inwards (like in the platypus). Dissimilar to in the platypus, there was no impression of a trench for venom. The cornu calcaris of "Catopsbaatar" was solidified (transformed into bone) and would have been shrouded in keratin (the horny covering found in nails and feet). The cornu calcaris of the platypus comprises just of keratin, and is empty.
