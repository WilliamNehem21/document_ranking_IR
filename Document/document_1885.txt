In 2002, Hill cooperatively composed a self-portrayal, "", with mountain climber and essayist Greg Child, distributed by W.W. Norton and Company. As she portrays the procedure, "He would take my works and sort out them, and he urged me to expound on specific components. He accentuated that recounting to the story is what's essential, so he truly helped me think about what I needed to state, and make sense of who my crowd was." Hill clarified in a meeting that expounding on past occasions was simpler in light of the fact that she had room schedule-wise to consider them. She needed to "pass on the history and culture of free climbing", explicitly how it moved toward becoming as specific as it is today. She felt that she had an extraordinary point of view to offer, both as somebody who moved at a specific crossroads in climbing history and as a lady: "And I wonder if a male essayist would have displayed that data in an unexpected way. I think the book is imperative from that point of view ["sic"], on the grounds that I am a lady, and there are very few female perspectives on climbing, or the historical backdrop of moving, out there." Writing about moving during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was commanded by men. As practiced American climber and essayist Rachel de Silva clarifies, the six noteworthy American climbing magazines distributed less than 12 articles every year by or about ladies amid the 1980s regardless of ladies containing 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the principal ladies driven climbing books showed up.
