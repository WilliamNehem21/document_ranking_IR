The jury discovered every one of the litigants liable, and the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham articulated them blameworthy of high treachery. The Attorney General Sir Edward Coke told the court that each of the sentenced would be attracted in reverse to his demise, by a steed, his head close to the ground. They were to be "put to death somewhere between paradise and earth as disgraceful of both". Their private parts would be cut off and consumed before their eyes, and their guts and hearts expelled. They would then be executed, and the dissected pieces of their bodies showed so they may move toward becoming "prey for the fowls of the air". Fawkes' and Tresham's declaration with respect to the Spanish conspiracy was perused so anyone might hear, just as admissions related explicitly to the Gunpowder Plot. The last bit of proof offered was a discussion among Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in nearby cells. The two men obviously thought they had been talking in private, however their discussion was caught by an administration spy. At the point when the detainees were permitted to speak, Fawkes clarified his not liable supplication as numbness of specific parts of the arraignment.
