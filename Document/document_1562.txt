The courts' mindfully idealistic acknowledgment of "Pepper", which incorporated an endeavor to incorporate it in the House of Lords' Practice Directions, before long started to melt away. Despite the fact that the lower courts connected the choice and permitted the utilization of "Hansard", and the Lords itself at first tailed it in "R v Warwickshire County Council, ex parte Johnson", a few protests and points of confinement were communicated in later "obiter dicta" and "proportion decidendi". The main legal protests were voiced in 1997 by Lord Hoffmann in "The Intolerable Wrestle with Words and Meanings", where he reprimanded the expanded cost and drop in productivity which it made. In a discourse to the Chancery Bar Lord Millett calling the judgment "an unfortunate choice" that "was not just confused in viable terms, it was in my view in opposition to rule", saying that: The courts promptly started to "trim down" the point of reference set by "Pepper". The primary direct assault came through "Massey v Boulden", where the Court of Appeal held that "Hansard" couldn't be utilized in criminal law cases, in view of "the rule that punitive rules are to be barely understood intercedes to determine any uncertainty without resort to Hansard".
