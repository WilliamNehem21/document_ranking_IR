Thought of throffers shapes some portion of the more extensive inquiry of intimidation and, explicitly, the likelihood of a coercive offer. Deciding if throffers are coercive, and, assuming this is the case, to what degree, is troublesome. The customary presumption is that offers can't be coercive, no one but dangers can, however throffers can challenge this. The undermining part of a throffer need not be express, as it was in Steiner's models. Rather, a throffer may appear as an offer, yet convey an inferred danger. Thinker John Kleinig sees a throffer for instance of an event when an offer alone might be viewed as coercive. Another case of a coercive offer might be the point at which the circumstance in which the offer is made is now inadmissible; for example, if a processing plant proprietor exploits a poor monetary condition to offer specialists an unreasonable compensation. For Jonathan Riley, a liberal society has an obligation to shield its natives from pressure, regardless of whether that intimidation originates from a risk, offer, throffer or some other source. "In the event that different people ... endeavor to disappoint the right-holder's needs, at that point a liberal society must find a way to keep this, by law if vital. All activities of intensity by others to disappoint the significant individual or gathering inclinations establish baseless 'impedance' with freedom in absolutely private issues."
