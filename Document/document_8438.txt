Scout Herb Raybourn watched him play shortstop in a 1988 baseball competition yet did not extend him to be a noteworthy leaguer. After a year, PanamÃÂ¡ Oeste's pitcher performed so ineffectively in a playoff diversion that Rivera was approached to supplant him, and in spite of no involvement with the position, he pitched well. Partners Claudino HernÃÂ¡ndez and Emilio GÃÂ¡ez therefore reached Chico Heron, a scout for the New York Yankees. Two weeks after his pitching debut, Rivera was welcome to a Yankees tryout camp kept running by Heron in Panama City. Raybourn, who had come back to Panama to scout as the Yankees' executive of Latin American tasks, got a tip about Rivera. Raybourn was amazed to hear he had exchanged positions however chosen to watch him toss. In spite of the fact that Rivera had no formal pitching preparing, weighed just , and tossed just , Raybourn was awed by his physicality and smooth, easy pitching movement. Survey Rivera as a crude ability, Raybourn marked the beginner free specialist to an agreement with the Yankees association on FebruaryÃÂ 17, 1990; the agreement incorporated a marking reward of US$2,500 ($ today), as per Major League Baseball (MLB) records.
