A giraffe rests by lying with its body over its collapsed legs. To rests, the creature bows on its front legs and after that brings down the remainder of its body. To get back up, it initially jumps on its knees and spreads its rear legs to raise its rump. It at that point rectifies its front legs. With each progression, the creature swings its head. In imprisonment, the giraffe dozes discontinuously around 4.6 hours out of every day, for the most part during the evening. It for the most part dozes resting, in any case, standing dozes have been recorded, especially in more seasoned people. Discontinuous short "profound rest" stages while lying are portrayed by the giraffe bowing its neck in reverse and laying its head on the hip or thigh, a position accepted to demonstrate incomprehensible rest. In the event that the giraffe needs to twist down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or twists its knees. Giraffes would likely not be skilled swimmers as their long legs would be exceptionally bulky in the water, in spite of the fact that they could glide. When swimming, the thorax would be overloaded by the front legs, making it troublesome for the creature to move its neck and legs in concordance or keep its head over the surface.
