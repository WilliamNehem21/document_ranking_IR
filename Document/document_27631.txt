The etymology of "Mirza" puzzled researchers for many years. Gray often created mysterious and unexplained taxonomic namesâa trend not only continued with his description of "Mirza" in 1870, but also with the genera "Phaner" (fork-marked lemurs) and "Azema" (for "M.Â rufus", now a synonym for "Microcebus"), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For "Mirza", Palmer only noted that it derived from the Persian title mÃ®rzÃ¢ ("prince"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from "Arabian Nights", a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel "et al." also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy "The Palace of Truth" by W. S. Gilbert, which premiered in London on 19Â NovemberÂ 1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.
