Olivier played the lead in "Richard III" and furthermore performed with Leigh in "The School for Scandal" and "The Skin of Our Teeth". The visit was a remarkable achievement and, despite the fact that Leigh was tormented with sleep deprivation and enabled her understudy to swap her for seven days while she was sick, she by and large withstood the requests put upon her, with Olivier taking note of her capacity to "enchant the press". Individuals from the organization later reviewed a few squabbles between the couple as Olivier was progressively angry of the requests put on him amid the visit. The most sensational fight happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh would not go in front of an audience without them. A depleted and exasperated Olivier shouted an indecency at her and slapped her face, and a crushed Leigh slapped him consequently, overwhelmed that he would hit her openly. Consequently, she advanced toward the phase in obtained siphons, and in a flash, had "dried her tears and grinned splendidly in front of an audience". Before the finish of the visit, both were depleted and sick. Olivier told a writer, "You may not know it, however you are conversing with a few strolling bodies." Later, he would see that he "lost Vivien" in Australia.
