Although more commercially successful than the band's previous albums, "Mother's Milk" received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion found throughout the album. However, it was praised as well; Amy Hanson of AllMusic called it "a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers," and believed that "if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener, 'Good Time Boys', it took only a few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' outrageous, and brilliant, interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic 'Higher Ground' to prove that this new lineup was onto something special. Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked-out 'Punk Rock Classic' and the band's own punched-up tribute to 'Magic Johnson', "Mother's Milk" was everything the band had hoped for, and a little more besides." Steve Morse of "The Boston Globe" called it a "high-octane fusion of metal, funk and rapâsort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone," while noting that "Knock Me Down" combined "electrifying musicianship". "The Toronto Star" commented that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were "the Mothers of Invention for the 1990s." In 2005, "Mother's Milk" was ranked number 359 in "Rock Hard" magazine's book of "The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time".
