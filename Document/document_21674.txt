Until the end of 1835 Berlioz had a modest stipend as a laureate of the Prix de Rome. His earnings from composing were neither substantial nor regular, and he supplemented them by writing music criticism for the Parisian press. Macdonald comments that this was activity "at which he excelled but which he abhorred". He wrote for "L'Europe littÃ©raire" (1833), "Le rÃ©novateur" (1833â1835), and from 1834 for the "Gazette musicale" and the "Journal des dÃ©bats". He was the first, but not the last, prominent French composer to double as a reviewer: among his successors were FaurÃ©, Messager, Dukas and Debussy. Although he complained â both privately and sometimes in his articles â that his time would be better spent writing music than in writing music criticism, he was able to indulge himself in attacking his bÃªtes noires and extolling his enthusiasms. The former included musical pedants, coloratura writing and singing, viola players who were merely incompetent violinists, inane libretti, and baroque counterpoint. He extravagantly praised Beethoven's symphonies, and Gluck's and Weber's operas, and scrupulously refrained from promoting his own compositions. His journalism consisted mainly of music criticism, some of which he collected and published, such as "Evenings in the Orchestra" (1854), but also more technical articles, such as those that formed the basis of his "Treatise on Instrumentation" (1844). Despite his complaints, Berlioz continued writing music criticism for most of his life, long after he had any financial need to do so.
