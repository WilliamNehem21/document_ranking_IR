In 687, Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, the legislative head of Basra and more youthful sibling of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, propelled an ambush against Kufa. A sizable bit of his military comprised of Kufan nobles, who had recently fled Mukhtar's reformatory measures. The span of Mukhtar's Kufan armed force isn't sure with extents between three thousand to sixty thousand, contingent upon the source. The Kufans withdrew following their thrashing at the clashes of Madhar, situated along the Tigris among Basra and Kufa, and Harura, a town close Kufa. Mus'ab then assaulted Mukhtar's castle for four months. Ibn al-Ashtar, who was then legislative head of Mosul, did not endeavor to assuage Mukhtar, either on the grounds that he was not called to activity, or in light of the fact that he declined Mukhtar's summons. In either case, he later joined Mus'ab. On 3 April 687, Mukhtar left the royal residence joined by nineteen supporters, (the rest of would not battle), and was slaughtered battling. Before long a short time later, Mukhtar's residual partisans, totaling around six thousand, surrendered and were executed by Mus'ab. One of Mukhtar's spouses, Umrah bint Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, would not criticize her significant other's perspectives and was therefore executed, while his other wife denounced him and was saved. Mukhtar's hand was cut off and held tight the mass of the mosque. His grave is, purportedly, situated inside the sanctum of Muslim ibn Aqil, at the back of the Great Mosque of Kufa. A few sources, nonetheless, express that Mus'ab had consumed his body.
