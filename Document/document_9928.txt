The topic of the carvings of the focal sections as misericords is extremely fluctuated, yet with numerous normal subjects repeating in various places of worship. Normally, the topics are less brought together and less straightforwardly identified with the Bible and Christian philosophy than are the subjects of little figures seen somewhere else inside houses of worship, for example, those on managers. This is much the situation at Wells, where none of the misericord carvings is legitimately founded on a Bible story. The subjects, picked either by the woodcarver, or maybe by the individual paying for the slow down, have no abrogating topic. The sole bringing together component is the roundels on each side of the pictorial subject, which are for the most part extravagantly cut foliage, by and large formal and stylised in the later Decorated way, yet with a few instances of naturalistic foliage, including roses and bindweed. Huge numbers of the subjects convey conventional translations. The picture of the "Pelican in her Piety" (accepted to nourish her young all alone blood) is a perceived image for Christ's adoration for the Church. A feline playing with a mouse may speak to the Devil catching a human spirit. Different subjects show prominent tales or adages, for example, "When the fox lectures, look to your geese". A considerable lot of the subjects are portrayals of creatures, some of which may symbolize a human bad habit or ideals, or a part of confidence.
