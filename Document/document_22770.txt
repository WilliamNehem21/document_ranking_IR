"76 T" survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, by which rump Austria officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class T-group boats, "77 T," "78 T" and "79 T", and four 250t-class F-group boats, she served with the Royal Yugoslav Navy (, KJRM; ÐÑÐ°ÑÐµÐ²ÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ³Ð¾ÑÐ»Ð¾Ð²ÐµÐ½ÑÐºÐ° Ð Ð°ÑÐ½Ð° ÐÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÐ°). Taken over in March 1921, in KJRM service, "76 T" was renamed "T1". When the navy was formed, she and the other seven 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels in the KJRM. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy. In May and June 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser "Dalmacija", the submarine tender "Hvar" and the submarines and , on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. It is not clear if "T1" was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval attachÃ© reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets.
