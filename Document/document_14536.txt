Henry was the most youthful of William and Matilda's four children. Physically he looked like his more seasoned siblings Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as student of history David Carpenter depicts, "short, stocky and barrel-chested," with dark hair. Because of their age contrasts and Richard's initial passing, Henry would have most likely observed generally little of his more seasoned siblings. He most likely knew his sister Adela well, as the two were close in age. There is minimal narrative proof for his initial years; students of history Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson propose he was raised dominatingly in England, while Judith Green contends he was at first raised in the Duchy. He was most likely taught by the Church, potentially by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at Salisbury Cathedral; it is questionable if this shown an aim by his folks for Henry to turn into an individual from the ministry. It is likewise dubious how far Henry's instruction expanded, however he was most likely ready to peruse Latin and had some foundation in the aesthetic sciences. He was given military preparing by a teacher called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his dad on 24 May 1086.
