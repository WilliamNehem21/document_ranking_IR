This came to fruition as the consequence of a visit by Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland, one of the individuals from parliament for Devon. Horrified by the crude conditions, he gave cash for the structure of a totally new repayment of thirty new blackhouses. These houses were made of dry stone, had thick dividers, and were roofed with turf. Each ordinarily had just a single minor window and a little opening for letting out smoke from the peat fire that consumed amidst the room. Subsequently, the insides were darkened by ash. The dairy cattle involved one end of the house in winter, and once every year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground.
