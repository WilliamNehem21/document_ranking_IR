Water has diverse acoustic properties from those of air. Sound from a submerged source can spread moderately uninhibitedly through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are comparative. At the point when the head is presented to the water, some solid is transmitted by the eardrum and center ear, however a huge part achieves the cochlea freely, by bone conduction. Some stable localisation is conceivable, however troublesome. Human hearing submerged, in situations where the jumper's ear is wet, is less delicate than in air. Recurrence affectability submerged additionally contrasts from that in air, with a reliably higher limit of hearing submerged; affectability to higher recurrence sounds is diminished the most. The kind of headgear influences commotion affectability and clamor risk contingent upon whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing submerged is less delicate with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes significant lessening. When wearing a cap, hearing affectability is like that in surface air, as it isn't extraordinarily influenced by the breathing gas or chamber environment arrangement or weight. Since sound ventures quicker in heliox than in air, voice formants are raised, giving jumpers' discourse sharp and twisted, and difficult to comprehend for individuals not accustomed to it. The expanded thickness of breathing gases under strain has a comparative and added substance impact.
