Shortly afterwards 14 Devastators from VT-6 from the carrier , led by Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's aircraft tried to sandwich "Kaga", but the CAP, reinforced by an additional eight Zeros launched by "Akagi" at 09:33 and 09:40, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and "Kaga" dodged the torpedoes. Defensive fire from the Devastators shot down one of "Akagi"s Zeros.
Minutes after the torpedo plane attacks, American carrier-based dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives. It was at this time, around 10:20, that in the words of Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the "Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail." Twenty-eight dive bombers from "Enterprise", led by C. Wade McClusky, began an attack on "Kaga", hitting her with at least four bombs. At the last minute, one of McClusky's elements of three bombers from VB-6, led by squadron commander Richard Best who deduced "Kaga" to be fatally damaged, broke off and dove simultaneously on "Akagi". At approximately 10:26, the three bombers hit her with one bomb and just missed with two others. The first near-miss landed to port, near her island. The third bomb just missed the flight deck and plunged into the water next to the stern. The second bomb, likely dropped by Best, landed at the aft edge of the middle elevator and detonated in the upper hangar. This hit set off explosions among the fully armed and fueled B5N torpedo bombers that were being prepared for an air strike against the American carriers, resulting in an uncontrollable fire.
