The canal has suffered several major breaches throughout its history. As early as 1799 a flood carried away large sections of the lower banks, and on 15 October 1853 two boats were swept through a breach near the bottom of Nob End Locks (no injuries were reported). Three breaches were reported from 1878â1879, in Little Lever and Darcy Lever, the latter near Burnden Chemical Works. Subsidence, caused by mining activity, prompted a breach near Agecroft in 1881. As a result of such incidents, from 1881 to 1888 engineer Edwin Muir was employed to reduce the subsidence caused by mining activity. Similar work was undertaken throughout the 1920s. Maps from the 1880s show that by then, to safeguard against further subsidence, the canal company had purchased areas of coal beneath the canal. In 1884 the canal's owners, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, successfully sued colliery owners Knowles & Sons for losses incurred from damage caused by subsidence. Following this judgement, the railway company settled out of court with other colliery owners. Constant repairs were made, particularly through Pendleton, where the embankment was periodically raised. Some bridges were lifted far above their original supports, while others sank as low as above head height.
