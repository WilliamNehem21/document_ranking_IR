Beecham, whom the BBC called "England's first global conductor", took the RPO on a strenuous visit through the United States, Canada and South Africa in 1950. Amid the North American visit, Beecham directed 49 shows in practically day by day progression. In 1951, he was welcome to direct at Covent Garden following a 12-year nonattendance. State-subsidized out of the blue, the musical drama organization worked uniquely in contrast to his pre-war routine. Rather than short, elegant seasons, with a noteworthy orchestra symphony, the new executive David Webster was endeavoring to develop a lasting troupe of home-developed ability playing out all the all year, in English interpretations. Outrageous economy in creations and incredible consideration regarding the movies were fundamental, and Beecham, however he had been harmed and angry at his rejection, was not fit to take an interest in such an endeavor. At the point when offered a melody of eighty artists for his arrival, leading "Pass on Meistersinger", he demanded enlarging their number to 200. He likewise, in opposition to Webster's strategy, demanded playing out the piece in German. In 1953 at Oxford, Beecham introduced the world debut of Delius' first musical drama, "Irmelin," and his last operatic exhibitions in Britain were in 1955 at Bath, with GrÃÂ©try's "ZÃÂ©mire et Azor".
