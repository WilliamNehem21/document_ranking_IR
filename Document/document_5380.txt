Dawson was given two forms of the content, one marked "The Klingon" and the other "The Human". The contents treated the human and Klingon types of Torres as two separate characters, underlining their defects. Dawson saw that Human Torres needed quality and boldness, while Klingon Torres needed rationale and control. She felt that the Klingon ought to get more consideration, particularly when Torres battles with that side of her personality all through the arrangement. She likewise needed the scene to catch Klingon Torres' regard for Human Torres. Dawson included that the scene's focal subject was "figuring out how to regard the pieces of one's self that make up the entire individual". "Appearances" was noted for building up Torres' progressing powerlessness to accommodate her human and Klingon characters, in "the most exacting fight". Biller couldn't help contradicting the scene's goals, contending that Torres ought to stay human. He felt that the scene ought to longerly affect Torres' character improvement, and accepted: "[w]e couldn't get as far as possible of the scene and state that Torres has now settled every one of her issues and finds a sense of contentment with herself". This story circular segment proceeded in the later scenes "Day of Honor" and "", in which Torres in the long run acknowledged her Klingon legacy.
