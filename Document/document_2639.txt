Normal arrangement author Nobuo Uematsu composed the soundtrack for "Conclusive Fantasy VIII". He attempted to put together the tunes with respect to the enthusiastic substance of the scenes in which they would be played, declaring that communicating the feelings he wanted could easily compare to improving aptitudes: "I figure it will be a disgrace on the off chance that we won't most likely cry as we play our own amusement". He couldn't decide a character's feelings exclusively dependent on the plot, rather utilizing pictures of appearance and clothingÃ¢ÂÂ"It's imperative to know when their feelings are at their tallness, yet it more often than not takes until a month prior to discharge for them to complete the closure dialog...!" When IGN Music expressed that the music of "Definite Fantasy VIII" was dull and maybe impacted by the plot of the amusement, Uematsu said "the environment of music shifts relying upon story line, obviously, but on the other hand it's my aim to put different kinds of music into one diversion". The nonattendance of character topics found in the past two diversions was expected to Uematsu finding those of "Definite Fantasy VI" and "Last Fantasy VII" incapable. Uematsu thinks of it as sensible to have character topics if each character has a "feature" in the diversion, however he discovered "Last Fantasy VIII" just centered around Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a team, bringing about the "Eyes on Me" subject.
