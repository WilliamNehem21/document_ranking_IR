For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; "The World Before the Flood", "Venus, the Evening Star" and "Guardian Cherubs". (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both "The World Before the Flood" and "Venus" attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of "The World Before the Flood"âa work containing scantily clad figures of both sexesâdrew a pointed comment in "The Gentleman's Magazine" that it "will serve to accompany the "private" Titians of that nobleman". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him Â£100 in recognition of his talent.
As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, "Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs", was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.
