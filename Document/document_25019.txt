Midget submarine "M-14"âlaunched from "I-27"âwas the first to enter Sydney Harbour. The Middle HeadÂ â South Head loop detected it at 20:01, but dismissed the reading due to heavy civilian traffic. At 20:15, a Maritime Services Board watchman spotted the midget after it passed through the western gap, collided with the Pile Light, then reversed and trapped its stern in the net. The submarine's bow broke the surface; the watchman rowed toward it to determine what it was and then rowed to the nearby patrol boat HMAS "Yarroma" to report his finding. Despite efforts by "Yarroma" to pass on this information, Sydney Naval Headquarters did not receive the report until 21:52. HMAS "Yarroma" and "Lolita" were dispatched to investigate. Upon confirming that the object in the net was a "baby submarine", "Lolita" dropped two depth charges while "Yarroma"s commander requested permission from Sydney Naval Headquarters to open fire. The depth charges failed to detonate, as the water was too shallow for the hydrostatic fuse setting. At 22:35, while "Yarroma" was waiting for permission to fire, and "Lolita" was setting up to deploy a third depth charge, the two crewmen on "M-14" activated one of the submarine's scuttling charges, killing themselves and destroying the submarine's forward section.
