"Nassau" and the rest of the IÂ Squadron were again engaged by British light forces shortly after 22:00, including the light cruisers , , and . "Nassau" followed her sister "Westfalen" in a 68Â° turn to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The two ships fired on "Caroline" and "Royalist" at a range of around . The British ships turned away briefly, before turning about to launch torpedoes. "Caroline" fired two at "Nassau"; the first passed close to her bows and the second passed under the ship without exploding.
At around midnight on 1 June, the German fleet was attempting to pass behind the British Grand Fleet when it encountered a line of British destroyers. "Nassau" came upon the destroyer , and in the confusion, attempted to ram her. "Spitfire" tried to evade, but could not maneuver away fast enough, and the two ships collided. "Nassau" fired her forward 11-inch guns at the destroyer. They could not depress low enough for "Nassau" to be able to score a hit; nonetheless, the blast from the guns destroyed "Spitfire"s bridge. At that point, "Spitfire" was able to disengage from "Nassau", and took with her a 6Â m (20Â ft) portion of "Nassau"s side plating. The collision disabled one of "Nassau"s 15Â cm (5.9Â in) guns, and left a 3.5Â m (11.5Â ft) gash above the waterline; this slowed the ship to until it could be repaired. During the confused action, "Nassau" was hit by two shells from the British destroyers, which damaged her searchlights and inflicted minor casualties.
