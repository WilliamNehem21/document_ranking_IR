Hemingway researcher Wendolyn Tetlow says that from its initiation the gathering was composed with a musical and melodious solidarity reminiscent of Pound's "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley" and T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land". The painstakingly made grouping proceeds in the 1925 release, starting with the initial five Nick Adams stories, which are about viciousness and fate, void connections and characters lacking mindfulness. The initial two stories, "Indian Camp" and "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife", can be perused as an activity in antithesis, where sentiments of misfortune, outrage, and insidiousness are disregarded and curbed. "The End of Something" and "The Three-Day Blow" likewise structure a couple; in the primary Nick says a final farewell to his better half, in the second he gets alcoholic and denies the relationship has finished, persuading himself that it will all work out. This condition of refusal proceeds in "The Battler", the fifth story; when looked with brutality Nick won't perceive that he is in threat. "A Very Short Story", about double-crossing, and injuring, closes the succession as indicated by Tetlow, who proposes these are stories in which Hemingway expounds on the "most unpleasant sentiments of misfortune and bafflement". The characters face misfortune with internal quality, apathy and a feeling of acknowledgment; they assemble quality in the accounts that come subsequent to, increasing mindfulness as they acknowledge the purposelessness and torment of life. The gathering closes with "Enormous Two-Hearted River", in which Nick discovers serenity, maybe even joy, in isolation. Wagner-Martin noticed that "it is this fundamental quietness that by and large increases the strain and distress of the previous pieces."
