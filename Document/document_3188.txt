The battle was nasty; both significant gathering hopefuls were blamed for different demonstrations of misbehavior; Polk was blamed for being both a duelist and a quitter. The most harming smear was the Roorback phony; in late August a thing showed up in an abolitionist paper, some portion of a book itemizing anecdotal goes through the South of a Baron von Roorback, a fanciful German aristocrat. The Ithaca "Annal" printed it without marking it as fiction, and embedded a sentence claiming that the voyager had seen forty slaves who had been sold by Polk subsequent to being marked with his initials. The thing was pulled back by the "Narrative" when tested by the Democrats, yet it was broadly republished. Borneman proposed that the imitation reverse discharges on Polk's adversaries as it served to remind voters that Clay also was a slaveholder, John Eisenhower, in his diary article on the race, expressed that the smear came past the point where it is possible to be successfully refuted, and likely cost Polk Ohio. Southern papers, then again, went far in guarding Polk, one Nashville paper claiming that his slaves favored their servitude to opportunity. Polk himself inferred to paper reporters that the main slaves he claimed had either been acquired or had been bought from relatives in budgetary misery; this paternalistic picture was additionally painted by surrogates like Gideon Pillow. This was not valid, however not known at the time; by then he had purchased more than thirty slaves, both from relatives and others, for the most part to procure work for his Mississippi cotton estate.
