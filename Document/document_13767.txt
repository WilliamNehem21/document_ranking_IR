The Ethic Committee's outside guidance, Robert Bennett, needed to dispense with Republican Senator John McCain and Glenn from the examination. The Democrats did not have any desire to bar McCain, as he was the main Republican being explored, which implies they couldn't pardon Glenn from the examination either. McCain and Glenn were denounced the least of the five, as the Senate commission found that they had worked out "misguided thinking". The GOP concentrated on Glenn's "misguided thinking" as opposed to what Glenn saw as total absolution. GOP administrator Robert Bennett stated, "John Glenn misconceived Charles Keating. He additionally misconceived the resilience of Ohio's citizens, who are left to pay of almost $2 billion." After the Senate's report, Glenn stated, "They so immovably put this thing to bed...there isn't much there to object with. I didn't do anything incorrectly." In his life account, Glenn expressed, "outside of individuals near me kicking the bucket, these hearings were the depressed spot of my life." The case cost him $520,000 in lawful charges. The relationship of his name with the outrage made Republicans confident that he could be vanquished in the 1992 crusade, yet Glenn crushed Lieutenant Governor Mike DeWine to hold his seat.
