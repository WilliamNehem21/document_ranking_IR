Likewise in 2009, Cooper highlighted in the mental loathsomeness "Case 39", a postponed generation that had been taped in 2006. He combined with Sandra Bullock in the satire "About Steve", a film that was inadequately gotten by commentators, neglected to draw in a wide gathering of people and earned them a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo. Following a job in one of eleven sections of the collection movie "New York, I Love You" (2009), Cooper showed up in the group lighthearted comedy "Valentine's Day" (2010), coordinated by Garry Marshall, co-featuring with Julia Roberts. The film was a business achievement, netting over $215 million around the world. He at that point featured in the parody "Sibling's Justice" and as the anecdotal character Templeton "Faceman" Peck in the component film form of "The A-Team" nearby Liam Neeson, Quinton Jackson, and Sharlto Copley. To get ready for the job, he refrained from devouring sugar, salt and flour, and experienced exhausting exercises. The film discharged to negative audits and poor film industry returns. Tim Robey of "The Daily Telegraph" stated, "Cooper affirms his qualifications as maybe the most egotistically narcissistic entertainer", while "Domain" credited both Cooper and Copley for "acing swagger and madness separately, who best both catch but then re-fashion their famous characters." Cooper showed up as visitor host of "WWE Raw" in June 2010.
