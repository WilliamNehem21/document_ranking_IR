There are two conceivable outcomes for the quantity of purposes of convergences. One is that either or , state , is the condition for . For this situation, is a line through . On the off chance that is digression to ,, at that point so is each hover in the pencil, and in this way is contained in . The other probability is that neither nor is the condition for . For this situation, the capacity is a remainder of quadratics, neither of which evaporates indistinguishably. In this way, it evaporates at two points and has posts at two points. These are the focuses in and , separately, tallied with assortment and with the roundabout focuses deducted. The objective capacity decides a morphism of degree two. The fiber over is the arrangement of focuses for which . These are definitely the focuses at which the circle whose condition is meets . The branch purposes of this morphism are the circles digression to . By the RiemannÃ¢ÂÂ Hurwitz recipe, there are exactly two branch focuses, and hence meets in two points. Together, these two potential outcomes for the crossing point of and exhibit that is a quadric cone. Every single such cone in are the equivalent up to a difference in directions, so this totally decides the state of .
