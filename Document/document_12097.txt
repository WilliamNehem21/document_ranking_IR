Engineer Ryan Lambourn made a glimmer diversion called "V-Tech Rampage" in 2007, which enables players to control the activities of shooter Seung-Hui Cho in the Virginia Tech slaughter. Lambourn affirmed compassion for Cho, and said that he was an objective of tormenting in secondary school. "Nobody tunes in to you except if you have something electrifying to do. Also, that is the reason I feel compassion toward Cho Seung-Hui [sic]. He needed to go that far", Lambourn expressed. On the "V-Tech Rampage" site, Lambourn posted an explanation that he would remove the diversion from Newgrounds if gifts came to $1000; at $2000 in gifts he would bring the amusement down from the primary site and for another $1000 he would apologize for making it. Ledonne posted a remark on Lambourn's site after "V-Tech Rampage" attracted correlations with "Super Columbine Massacre", calling Lambourn's announcement commensurate to a "prisoner note", and requesting that bloggers consider "not whether a diversion about the Virginia Tech shooting SHOULD be made yet how we may approach making an amusement that achieves more than "V-Tech Rampage" does with the topic." Ledonne expressed that he messaged Lambourn thoughtfully, yet that the designer reacted to his messages with irreverence; he repeated that the two recreations had distinctive inspirations and were not effectively practically identical in substance.
