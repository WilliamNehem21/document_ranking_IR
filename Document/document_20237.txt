In an effort to secure the loyalty of the Bosnian Muslims, PaveliÄ ordered that a property in Zagreb be converted into a mosque that he named the "Poglavnik's Mosque". Despite PaveliÄ's assurances of equality with the Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Croatian rule. A Muslim leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. Although this was an overstatement, Muslims were underrepresented in government positions, comprising only two of 20 ministerial positions, none of the six state secretaries was a Muslim, and there were only 13 Muslim "people representatives" in a total of 206. Fierce fighting broke out between the UstaÅ¡e, Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and pan-Yugoslav Partisans in NDH territory. Some UstaÅ¡e Militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians. The Chetniks accused the Muslims of taking part in the UstaÅ¡e violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslims received little protection from the Croatian Home Guard, the regular army of the NDH, whom the Germans described as "of minimal combat value". Local militias were raised, but these were also of limited value and only one, the Tuzla-based Home Guard HadÅ¾iefendiÄ Legion, led by Muhamed HadÅ¾iefendiÄ, was of any significance.
