John Colter is generally viewed as the main mountain man and, similar to those that went to the Jackson Hole district throughout the following 30ÃÂ years, he was there principally for the gainful hide catching; the locale was rich with the exceptionally looked for after pelts of beaver and other hide bearing creatures. Somewhere in the range of 1810 and 1812, the Astorians went through Jackson Hole and crossed Teton Pass as they traveled east in 1812. After 1810, American and British hide exchanging organizations were in rivalry for control of the North American hide exchange, and American power over the locale was not verified until the marking of the Oregon Treaty in 1846. One gathering utilized by the British North West Company and driven by pioneer Donald Mackenzie entered Jackson Hole from the west in 1818 or 1819. The Tetons, just as the valley west of the Teton Range referred to today as Pierre's Hole, may have been named by French speaking Iroquois or French Canadian trappers that were a piece of Mackenzie's gathering. Prior gatherings had alluded to the most unmistakable pinnacles of the Teton Range as the Pilot Knobs. The French trappers' "les trois tÃÂ©tons" (the three bosoms) was later abbreviated to the Tetons.
