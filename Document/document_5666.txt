Regardless of juggling his vocation at the Bar and as an individual from parliament, Birkett kept up a decent participation in the House of Commons, and alongside Sir John Simon he turned into the main Liberal representative on the lawful side of enactment. His assault on a proviso of the Finance Act 1930 drew much commendation from both Liberal and Conservative government officials, including Winston Churchill, who said that "I have once in a while heard a discourse all the more exactly coordinated at the item under discussion, all the more agreeably receptive to the character of Committee exchange, than the fantastic articulation the Honorable and educated Gentleman has quite recently made". Birkett drove the Liberal reaction to the Labor proposition of the Trade Disputes Bill 1931 and "diminished it to wears out", in spite of the fact that the Bill passed on account of some Liberal abstentions. The discourse was an especially generally welcomed one and drove MacDonald to again offer the situation of Solicitor General to Birkett, as the occupant postholder James Melville was going to leave. Again Birkett won't, and Stafford Cripps was named. At the point when the Liberal Party came back to control in 1931 in alliance with the Conservatives and National Labor as a component of MacDonald's National Government, it was normal that Birkett would be offered the position being a Liberal Member of Parliament, however when they proposed possibility for Solicitor General, the Liberals had surpassed their ecclesiastical standard consented to in the alliance. Birkett was offered a non-legitimate office yet said that he "couldn't examine a post that implied surrendering my training".
