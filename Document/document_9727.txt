With the BÃÂ¬nh XuyÃÂªn vanquished, DiÃ¡Â»Âm directed his concentration toward overcoming the HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o. Thus, a fight between government troops driven by General DÃÂ°ÃÂ¡ng VÃÂn Minh and Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t's men started in CÃ¡ÂºÂ§n ThÃÂ¡ on 5 June. Five HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o brigades surrendered quickly; Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t and three residual pioneers had fled to the Cambodian fringe before the month's over. Having surrendered his powers, Ngo abraded Soai and Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t, asserting that their exercises were not predictable with HÃÂ²a HÃ¡ÂºÂ£o religious practices and blamed them for battling with socialists. The officers of the three different pioneers in the long run surrendered, yet Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t's men proceeded as far as possible, guaranteeing dependability to the Emperor BÃ¡ÂºÂ£o ÃÂÃ¡ÂºÂ¡i.

The socialists guaranteed in a history composed decades later that Ba CÃ¡Â»Â¥t had endeavored to manufacture a union with them, yet that discussions separated a couple of months after the fact.
