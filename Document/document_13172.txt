M-553 starts as a two-path provincial thruway east of Gwinn at a crossing point with M-35 in the network of New Swanzy. From that point it runs north through some business properties into the Sands Plains, a sandy zone inadequately secured with Jack Pines. The roadway goes through a convergence with M-94 close to the west entryway of the previous K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base. Here, the trunkline is parallel to a line of the Canadian National Railway which interfaces mines of the Marquette Iron Range to Escanaba. M-553 traverses the rail line west of the runway at the Sawyer International Airport situated at the previous Air Force base. On the north side of the airplane terminal, M-553 crosses Kelly Johnson Memorial Drive, the air terminal access street named for Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, who was a prominent flying specialist at Lockheed who helped plan the SR-71 "Blackbird" surveillance flying machine and individual from the International Aerospace Hall of Fame. The trunkline proceeds with more distant through forests and swings toward the northwest. M-553 passes the Marquette County Fairgrounds and ranges CRÃÂ 480 at the Crossroads zone only north of the Sands Plains and the Blueberry Ridge ski trail; the territory around the convergence has a few organizations.
