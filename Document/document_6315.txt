The pinkish-red compound flowerheads, known as inflorescences, are up to 20ÃÂ cm (8ÃÂ in) crosswise over in spring to summer, and contain somewhere in the range of 50 and 140 littler blossoms, orchestrated in a corymb or raceme. These individual blossoms are long and sit on stalks (known as pedicels) up to long, which emerge in sets off the primary stalk inside the inflorescence. Each bloom comprises of a cylindrical perianth, which halfway parts along one side at anthesis to discharge the thick style. The disgrace is contained inside an inclining plate like structure at the tip of the style. The rounded perianth parts into four sections at its tip, and the anther lies in the sunken parts inside every one of these portions. The blossom parts are smooth and bare. The dust is blood red. Subsequent to blooming, the long woody seedpod creates. Round and hollow fit as a fiddle, it parts down one side to discharge the seeds, which are ready from February to June. They are organized in two lines, with no less than four seeds in each line. Each seed is isolated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is any longer than the seed itself.
