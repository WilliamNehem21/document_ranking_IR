At Ziff-Davis, "Phenomenal Adventures" proceeded as it had amid the war, with an infrequent essential story, for example, "Largo", by Theodore Sturgeon, and "I'll Dream of You" by Charles F. Myers. Both "Fabulous Adventures" and its sister magazine, "Astonishing Stories", had the capacity to come back to month to month distribution by late 1947 on account of the "Shaver Mystery", a progression of stories by Richard Shaver. In the March 1945 issue of "Stunning" Palmer distributed a story by Shaver called "I Remember Lemuria". The story, about ancient developments, was exhibited by Palmer as a blend of truth and fiction, and the outcome was a sensational lift to Amazing's dissemination. Palmer ran another Shaver story in each issue, coming full circle in an exceptional issue in June 1947 committed totally to the Shaver Mystery. "Astounding" before long drew criticism for these accounts and William Ziff requested Palmer to constrain the measure of Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer went along, however his advantage (and conceivably conviction) in this kind of material was currently noteworthy, and he before long started wanting to leave Ziff-Davis. In 1947 he framed Clark Publications, propelling "Destiny" the next year, and in 1949 he left Ziff-Davis to alter that and different magazines.
