"Maxinquaye" was named 1995's best record in year-end polls by several English publications, including "NME", "Melody Maker" and "The Wire", and finished second in the voting for the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics. The record also received a nomination for the 1995 Mercury Prize, an annual music award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland, losing out to Portishead's 1994 debut "Dummy". It was later ranked high in a "Q"-published poll determining the 100 greatest British albums, "Mojo"s "100 Modern Classics", and "Rolling Stone"s "Essential Recordings of the 90s", among other lists. Since then, "Maxinquaye" has frequently appeared on authoritative lists of the greatest records ever, including "NME"s 2013 list of the 500 greatest albums, which ranked it 202nd best. "Uncut" named it 156th best on a similar list in 2016. It was ranked 66th on "Pitchfork"s list of the 100 best albums from the 1990s, with guest writer Rollie Pemberton crediting the record for helping shape "the landscapes of modern electronica and underground hip-hop". "Slant Magazine" named it the 21st greatest electronic album of the 20th century and wrote that along with "Blue Lines" and "Dummy", it was also "one of the most influential trip-hop albums of the '90s". According to Acclaimed Music, "Maxinquaye" is the 153rd most prominently ranked record on critics' all-time lists. It was also included in the music reference book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die"; journalist Alex Rayner wrote in an accompanying chapter that the "innovative, thought provoking, and intricately arranged" album played a significant role in popularising British hip hop and spoken word music in the UK.
