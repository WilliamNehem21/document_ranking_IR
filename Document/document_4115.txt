The idea of "garden rooms" has been dated to the Romans, who included rooms inside certain homes that opened on one side onto a greenery enclosure. The agricultural researcher and plant specialist Marie-Luise Gothein distinguished such a room at Pliny's Villa Tusci, in her investigation "A History of Garden Art". In the late nineteenth century, response set in against both the Victorian design for expand bedding and Italianate custom, and the prior eighteenth century scene planting displayed on the artworks of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. This drove to some extent to an idea of the "garden room" (particular from the design idea of a greenery enclosure room) as a space out of entryways, in which ways, comparing to corridors in a house, lead to encased gardens inside the patio nursery all in all, thought about as rooms. The designer Hermann Muthesius depicted the style which formed into the Arts and Crafts approach in his "" ("The English House"): "the patio nursery is viewed as a continuation of the rooms of the house, very nearly a progression of ... open air rooms, every one of which is independent". Various pre-Sissinghurst planters, including Jekyll and Lawrence Johnston, had structured in this style, and quite a bit of their work was known to Sackville-West and Nicolson. This arranging highlight has since turned into a built up one in greenery enclosure structure.
