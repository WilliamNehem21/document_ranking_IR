Amid the English winter of 1922Ã¢ÂÂ 23, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) chose a group to visit Australia and New Zealand. This side, captained by Archie MacLaren and made for the most part out of beginners, was not especially solid and contained a few players picked for their social standing as opposed to cricketing capacity. The group played four top of the line amusements in Australia against state groups; the first was drawn and the others were lost. After scores of 75 and 58 against Western Australia, Chapman played back to back innings of 53, 73 and 69 against South Australia and Victoria, trailed by 100 in the most enthusiastically anticipated match of the visit against a solid New South Wales side. The press and open lauded his assaulting batting and his handling, albeit Frank Iredale, a previous Test cricketer, saw a few imperfections in his method. At the point when the group proceeded onward to New Zealand, after a questionable begin Chapman scored 533 keeps running at a normal of 48.45, including two centuries. The vacationers came back to Australia for the last leg of the visit; Chapman scored 91 against New South Wales and 134 of every 142 minutes against South Australia. In all the Australian amusements, he totalled 782 keeps running at 65.16; in every one of the matches on visit he had 1,315 keeps running at a normal of 57.15.
