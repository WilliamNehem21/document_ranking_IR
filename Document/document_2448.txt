Eaton was presented on Britain following the finish of World WarÃÂ II, and went to RAF Staff College the following year. In September 1947, he was named Officer Commanding No.ÃÂ 81 (Fighter) Wing in Japan, as a feature of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). The Australian unforeseen at first included three battle units, Nos.ÃÂ 76, 77 and 82 Squadrons, just as No.ÃÂ 381 (Base) Squadron, No.ÃÂ 481 (Maintenance) Squadron, No.ÃÂ 111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and No.ÃÂ 5 Airfield Construction Squadron. By mid-1949, it had been diminished to No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron alone, and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded; Eaton filled in as "RAAF Component" authority for the rest of his residency in Japan. Just as reconnaissance watches, preparing and between administration works out, the Australian pilots partook in stately flypasts. On one such event, over Tokyo, Eaton drove his arrangement of thirty Mustangs into cloud with a defective aviation instrument in his plane, with the outcome that he and his confidants, who were following his lead, turned out to be seriously disorientated and were blessed to stay away from impact; RAAF history specialist Alan Stephens thought about this as a not-atypical case of the easygoing demeanor to flying wellbeing showed at the time by the veteran pilots of World WarÃÂ II.
