Regardless of when Nagavarma II lived, it is acknowledged that couple of researchers in the historical backdrop of Kannada writing made critical commitments in the same number of subjects as he did. His compositions on syntax, verse, prosody, and vocabulary are standard experts and their significance to the investigation of the Kannada language is very much recognized. Among his accessible works, the verifiably critical "Kavyavalokana" ("Treatise on the specialty of verse") on sentence structure, poetics and talk is viewed as way breaking and contains every one of the fundamentals of Kannada punctuation. The principal segment of the book is designated "Sabdasmriti" and contains five parts managing euphonic mixes, things, mixes, ostensible subordinates and action words individually. It depends on prior works by the Sanskrit grammarians Dandin and Bhamaha. The "Karnataka Bhashabhushana", a united and comprehensive Kannada sentence structure composed by Nagavarma II in the Sanskrit language, pursues the central system of the Katantra school of Sanskrit syntax. For his commitment to Kannada syntax, Nagavarma II earned the honorific "Sarvavarma" Ã¢ÂÂ the name of the prominent Sanskrit grammarian of the Satavahana period. His "Abhidana Vastukosa" ("Treasury of connotations"), a dictionary, gives Kannada counterparts of about eight thousand Sanskrit words and is viewed as an accomplishment which gave Kannada language extensive balance in the realm of Sanskrit abstract strength. Present day Kannada writer Govinda Pai recommended that the writer of "Karnataka Bhashabhushana" was an alternate Nagavarma who had a place with the mid-twelfth century.
