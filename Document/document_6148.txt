The main match of the PPV show saw reDRagon (Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish) shielding the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero), Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida), and the Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Romero played out the "Eternity Clothesline" (various corner clotheslines) and twofold clotheslines on his rivals. A progression of jumps out of the ring finished in Kushida plunging from the turnbuckles onto his adversaries on the floor. Despite the fact that Time Splitters pursued with a neckbreaker-moonsault blend on Nick, the three-mean a pinfall was ceased at two. The Young Bucks began a "Superkick Party" (numerous superkicks) and proceeded with a "Meltzer Driver" (helped Tombstone piledriver) on Koslov, yet the stick was again separated. ReDRagon took over with a backbreaker and jumping knee drop on Shelley, a twofold arm DDT and work cart suplex on Matt, and a super bird of prey bolt by Fish on Nick. The first "Pursuing the Dragon" kick/brainbuster mix endeavor was countered by an inside support by Koslov for a two check, however the second "Pursuing the Dragon" endeavor succeeded; O'Reilly stuck Koslov to hold the title at 13 minutes and 1 second.
