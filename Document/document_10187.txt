Another Hemingway researcher, Jim Berloon, can't help contradicting Tetlow, composing that its solitary solidarity comprises of likenesses in tone and style and the repeat of the Nick Adams character. In spite of the fact that the primary vignettes share a repeating theme about the war, each is unmistakably surrounded, debilitating any basic solidarity that may have existed. He accuses the war, saying that it was unreasonably hard for Hemingway to expound on it strongly, that it was "excessively substantial, horrendous, and rationally overpowering to get a handle on completely". Rather, he says, Hemingway composed parts, "discrete looks into hellÃÂ ... like the destruction of fight lit up from a shell burst around evening time." The structure evident in the 1924 gathering of vignettes is lost in the later version in light of the fact that the short stories appear to manage close to nothing if any relationship to the interchapters, breaking the painstakingly developed request. The feeling of conflict is strengthened in light of the fact that the activity is about anonymous men and troopers, just alluded to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are changed through conditions and settings, where peril exists obviously, on the war zone, or, in one case, by a shot sexual experience in a Chicago taxi.
