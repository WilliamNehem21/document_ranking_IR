In 2004 LÃÂ¼ and associates confirmed that the skeleton had a place with another, unmistakable taxon, and made it the holotype example of "Nemegtia barsboldi". The variety name alludes to the Nemegt Basin, and the particular name respects the Mongolian scientist Rinchen Barsbold, the pioneer of the group that found the example. In 2005 the describers found (in the wake of being advised by a scientist) that the name "Nemegtia" had just been utilized for a family of freshwater seed shrimp (Ostracoda) from a similar development in 1978, and was in this manner distracted. They proposed rather the new variety name "Nemegtomaia" (""maia"" signifies "great mother" in Greek, and the full name signifies "great mother of the Nemegt"), making reference to the then-late disclosure that oviraptorids agonized eggs as opposed to taking them, however no hint of a home or eggs had yet been found related with "Nemegtomaia" itself. The main known individual from the oviraptorid family was found with a home of eggs initially thought to have had a place with the ceratopsian class "Protoceratops", and was along these lines named "Oviraptor" in 1924; this name signifies "egg-seizer". During the 1990s more oviraptorid examples were found related with homes and eggs, wherein oviraptorid fetuses were discovered, along these lines demonstrating that the eggs had a place with the oviraptorids themselves. "Ingenia" was comparatively renamed as "Ajancingenia" in 2013, since the previous variety name was distracted by a roundworm (Nematoda).
