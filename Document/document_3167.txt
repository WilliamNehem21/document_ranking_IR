From Ancyra, the Abbasid armed force swung to Amorium, to which they laid attack on 1August. Al-Afshin, Itakh, and Ashinas all alternated striking the city with their troops, yet the attack was wildly challenged, even after the Abbasids, educated by a deserter, affected a break in a frail spot of the divider. Following two weeks, exploiting a short dÃÂ©tente for exchanges mentioned by one of the Byzantine leaders of the rupture, the Abbasid armed force effectively raged the city. It was completely pillaged and its dividers demolished, while the people, numbering into the several thousands, was taken away to be sold into subjection. As per al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim was presently considering stretching out his battle to assault Constantinople, when the connivance headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was revealed. Al-Mu'tasim was compelled to stop his crusade and return rapidly to his domain, without messing with Theophilos and his powers, positioned in close-by Dorylaion. Taking the immediate course from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the Caliph's military and its detainees endured amid the walk through the bone-dry wide open of focal Anatolia. A few prisoners were exhausted to the point that they couldn't move and were executed, while others found in the disturbance the chance to get away. In striking back, al-Mu'tasim, in the wake of isolating the most conspicuous among them, executed the rest, somewhere in the range of 6,000.
