De Castries' withdrawal in his dugout, joined with his bosses' failure to supplant him, made an initiative vacuum inside the French order. On 24 March, an occasion occurred which later turned into a matter of chronicled banter. The history specialist Bernard Fall records, in view of Langlais' diaries, that Colonel Langlais and his individual paratroop commandants, all completely outfitted, stood up to de Castries in his dugout on 24 March. They revealed to him he would hold the presence of direction, yet that Langlais would practice it. De Castries is said by Fall to have acknowledged the game plan without dissent, in spite of the fact that he exercised some direction capacities from there on. Phillip Davidson expressed that "reality would appear to be that Langlais took over compelling order of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries progressed toward becoming 'administrator emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered guidance about issues in Dien Bien Phu". Jules Roy, notwithstanding, makes no notice of this occasion, and Martin Windrow contends that the "paratrooper putsch" is probably not going to have at any point occurred. The two students of history record that Langlais and Marcel Bigeard were known to be on great terms with their boss.
