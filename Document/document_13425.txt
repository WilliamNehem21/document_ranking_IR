Afterward, following an email trade with the normal Republican challenger Toomey about human services, Sestak proposed an unconventional joint town lobby with Toomey about the issue, which was held September 2 at Muhlenberg College in Allentown. Apparition was not welcomed to take an interest, and political surveyor G. Terry Madonna of Franklin and Marshall College portrayed it as a "casual settlement" among Sestak and Toomey to debilitate their joint opponent, something the two men denied. Observers proposed Toomey was eager to help Sestak at this phase of the race since he favored Sestak as a general decision adversary over Specter, who could draw Republican and Independent voters from Toomey. Additionally in September, Obama showed up in a 30-second TV advertisement for Specter, lauding him for his help of the President's monetary recuperation activities. A September survey by Franklin and Marshall College discovered Specter kept up a 37 percent to 11 percent lead over Sestak, yet additionally that 54 percent of individuals felt a change was required rather than 34 percent who felt Specter merited a 6th term. That survey additionally discovered 73 percent felt they didn't think enough about Sestak to frame a feeling, which surveyor Madonna said showed the race would be centered more around Specter's incumbency and record than about Sestak or Toomey.
