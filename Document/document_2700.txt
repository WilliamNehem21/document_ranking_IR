In medieval Europe, the pelican was believed to be especially mindful to her young, to the point of giving her very own blood by injuring her very own bosom when no other sustenance was accessible. Subsequently, the pelican came to symbolize the Passion of Jesus and the Eucharist, and usurped the picture of the sheep and the banner. A reference to this legendary trademark is contained for instance in the song by Saint Thomas Aquinas, "Adoro te commit" or "Submissively We Adore Thee", where in the penultimate stanza, he depicts Christ as the "cherishing divine pelican, ready to give sustenance from his bosom". Elizabeth I of England embraced the image, depicting herself as the "mother of the Church of England". Nicholas Hilliard painted the "Pelican Portrait" around 1573, presently possessed by the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. A pelican bolstering her young is delineated in an oval board at the base of the cover sheet of the initial (1611) version of the King James Bible. Such "a pelican in her devotion" shows up in the 1686 reredos by Grinling Gibbons in the congregation of St Mary Abchurch in the City of London. Prior medieval instances of the theme show up in painted paintings, for instance that of "around" 1350 in the area church of Belchamp Walter, Essex.
