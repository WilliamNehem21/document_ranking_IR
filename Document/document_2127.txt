Second-term U.S Representative Joe Sestak, a previous U.S. Naval force chief of naval operations, started secretly talking about the likelihood of looking for the Democratic selection with his family in December 2008. Congressperson Bob Menendez, director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, drew nearer Sestak in April 2009 and requested that he run, yet Sestak asserted he was not at first intrigued. In any case, media hypothesis about Sestak's conceivable crusade started as ahead of schedule as mid-April 2009, and strengthened the day Specter changed ideological groups. While most Democrats grasped the long-lasting Senator, Sestak issued an announcement condemning Specter's choice, pronouncing it an entrepreneur move that ought to have been made in conference with Pennsylvanians instead of the Senate Democratic initiative and the Washington political foundation. Menendez drew nearer Sestak once more, this time asking him not to keep running against Specter, however Sestak did not consent to withdraw. Afterward, when asked by Fox News, Sestak demanded he had not chosen whether he would keep running for the workplace, yet declined to promptly support Specter and said he needed to "sit back and watch". Amid a May 3 appearance on CNN's "Condition of the Union with John King", Sestak addressed whether Specter was extremely a certified Democrat, including, "I think Arlen needs to let us know not that it was too difficult to even consider running against somebody. ... What I have to know is, what is he running for?"
