After finish of the visit, Ellison kept on playing for Poneke and Wellington. While playing with his club, Ellison actualized the utilization of a wing-forward and seven-man scrum positional framework. It isn't known precisely who designed the situation of wing-forward, yet Ellison asserted in "The Art of Rugby Football" that he had created it; history specialist Greg Ryan claims the position was created in northern England, and that Ellison just refined it in the wake of finding it amid the Natives' visit. The unmistakable component of wing-forward assume was their job of nourishing the ball into the scrum, and consequently clutching one of the hookers while the ball advanced through the scrum to the half-back. With the wing-forward bound to the side of the scrum, the restricting half-back would then need to move past them to handle the player with the ball; this would build the measure of time the half-back would have possessing the ball before their inverse could handle them. Ellison asserted that he concocted the position while playing for Poneke after he "thought that it was inconceivable for the most brilliant of arbitrators to identify and plentifully punish off-side impedances of rivals set on ruining my passes".
