The rest of Div Cav left Matruh for Fuka on 27 June, accepting new Bren Gun Carriers at Baggush. A Squadron arranged the new bearers for the fight to come. After a report of moving toward Axis tanks, the squadrons were pulled back to Daba on 28 June and to Fortress A toward the evening. On 30 June, the regiment screened west and south of the crate. From 1 July, the regiment battled in the First Battle of El Alamein. B Squadron was shelled on 1 July and pulled back to the Deir el Munassib. The regiment tested in front of the container, connecting with the Axis powers, and B Squadron lost a bearer to against tank firearms on the Alam Nayil edge. The Axis powers were stopped by a New Zealand counter-assault driven by Brigadier Weir. Alam Nayil was caught by Weir's power on 3 July and C Squadron held the edge while Weir's power squeezed ahead. After the Italian weapons on the edge were obliterated, C Squadron pulled back and experienced harsh criticism from Ruweisat Ridge. On 3 July, A Squadron inspected around Gebel Kalakh and was ineffectively shelled by the benevolent sixth Field Regiment. Two troops from A Squadron drew in an Italian truck-mounted brigade of the Trieste Division, annihilating two trucks, catching one Italian and discharging three Indian PoWs.
