Jeter is considered to be one of the most consistent baseball players of all time. He played fewer than 145 games a season only three times in his career: when he dislocated his left shoulder on Opening Day 2003 (119 games), when he injured his calf in 2011 (131 games), and in 2013 when he struggled with a myriad of injuries (17 games). For his career, he averaged 204 hits, 113 runs scored and 21 stolen bases per 162 games. He is currently 6th on the all-time hits list in Major League Baseball history. Highly competitive, Jeter once said, "If you're going to play at all, you're out to win. Baseball, board games, playing "Jeopardy!", I hate to lose." Seen as one of the best players of his generation, most sportswriters believe that Jeter will be a 1st ballot induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame and potentially a unanimous selection in his first year of eligibility (2020).
An aggressive hitter, Jeter swings at most pitches in the strike zone and many near it. Though right-handed hitters often pull the ball into left field, Jeter's signature inside-out swing, dubbed the "Jeterian Swing", results in most of his hits going to center and right field. Similarly, most of his home runs have been hit to right field rather than to center or to left, as his swing takes advantage of Yankee Stadium's close right-field fences.
