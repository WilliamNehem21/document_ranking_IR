In the midst of this action Mackay and Murray, presently joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, had little influence in the general existence of the camp and communicated their assurance to abandon it, freely, as quickly as time permits. Bartlett needed to sit tight for the more extended sunlight long periods of February before endeavoring the walk, yet was influenced by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking gathering to set up a development camp on Wrangel Island. A gathering of four, driven by "Karluk's" first officer Alexander Anderson and including group individuals Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with directions from Bartlett to build up their camp at or close Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who went with the gathering as a scout, came back to Shipwreck Camp and detailed that he had left the gathering a couple of miles shy of land that was obviously not Wrangel Island, and was presumably Herald Island, from their proposed goal. This was the last locating of Anderson's gathering; their definitive destiny was not built up until ten years after the fact, when their remaining parts were found on Herald Island.
