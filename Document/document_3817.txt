Nansen did not continue formal investigations at the college. Rather, on Collett's proposal, he acknowledged a post as keeper in the zoological branch of the Bergen Museum. He was to go through the following six years of his life thereÃ¢ÂÂaside from a six-month vacation voyage through EuropeÃ¢ÂÂworking and considering with driving figures, for example, Gerhard Armauer Hansen, the pioneer of the disease bacillus, and Daniel Cornelius Danielssen, the exhibition hall's executive who had diverted it from a backwater accumulation into a focal point of logical research and training. Nansen's picked territory of study was the then generally unexplored field of neuroanatomy, explicitly the focal sensory system of lower marine animals. Before leaving for his holiday in February 1886 he distributed a paper condensing his examination to date, in which he expressed that "anastomoses or relationships between the diverse ganglion cells" couldn't be exhibited with sureness. This strange view was affirmed by the synchronous explores of the embryologist Wilhelm His and the therapist August Forel. Nansen is viewed as the main Norwegian protector of the neuron hypothesis, initially proposed by Santiago RamÃÂ³n y Cajal. His resulting paper, "The Structure and Combination of Histological Elements of the Central Nervous System", distributed in 1887, turned into his doctoral proposal.
