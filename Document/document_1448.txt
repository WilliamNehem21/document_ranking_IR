Jeff Simon of "The Buffalo News", who disliked "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt "Weight Gain 4000" demonstrated the arrangement could be amusing. He explicitly complimented the scene's editorial on American industrialism. Simon expressed, "It's everything harsh social parody, and on the off chance that it weren't on Comedy Central, trust me, nobody in networkland would think it prepared for prime time. What's more, you know what else? It's interesting." Likewise, "The Washington Post" commentator Tom Shales unequivocally censured "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", however said the second scene was entertaining and included "shrewdly entwined" plot-lines. Shales stated, "[It] recommends the show might be an endeavor at parody and not simply poopy humor ... Indeed, it's as yet wiped out and still bent, yet by one way or another this scene in any event seems to have some comic inventiveness behind it, while the first was only a smutfest." In 2006, "Weight Gain 4000" was recognized by "Winnipeg Free Press" as one of the ten most critical "South Park" scenes, and positioned twelfth in a rundown of the best 25 biggest Cartman minutes, as dictated by voters on the Comedy Central site. The "Day by day Record" in Scotland recorded the scene's completion, and the "Beefcake!" line, as one of the six most important minutes in the arrangement.
