The prison commander brought his unusual captive to the attention of The Commissioners for taking Care of Sick and Wounded Seamen and for the Care and Treatment of Prisoners of War, the body then responsible for all medical services in the Royal Navy and for overseeing the welfare of prisoners of war. , a member of the Commission, and Dr Cochrane, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, performed an experiment to test Domery's eating capacity and tolerance for unusual foods. At 4:00Â am, Domery was awakened and fed 4Â lbs (1.8Â kg) of raw cow's udder, which was eaten without hesitation. At 9:30Â am he was given a meal of 5Â lbs (2.3Â kg) of raw beef, twelve large tallow candles totalling oneÂ pound (453Â g), and a bottle of porter, all of which were consumed. At 1:00Â pm Domery was given another meal of a further 5Â lbs of beef, a pound (453Â g) of candles, and three large bottles of porter, all of which were also eaten and drunk. During the course of the experiment he did not defecate, urinate or vomit at any point, his pulse remained regular and his skin did not change temperature. Upon Domery's return to his quarters at 6:15Â pm following the conclusion of the experiment, he was recorded as being of "particularly good cheer", and danced, smoked his pipe and drank a further bottle of porter.
