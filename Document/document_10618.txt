Feller began Game One of the 1948 World Series against the NL-champion Boston Braves. In the eighth inning, Feller and Boudreau seemed to have picked off the Braves' Phil Masi as he endeavored to take a base, however umpire Bill Stewart ruled he was protected. Masi scored the main keep running of the diversion on a Braves single. In spite of surrendering only two hits on 85 pitches for the diversion, Feller and the Indians lost 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0. Afterward, photos demonstrated that Boudreau had labeled Masi out by two feet. Feller stated, "Stewart was the main person in the recreation center who thought he was sheltered." Feller was again named the starter in Game Five, which set a participation record; the 86,288 fans in Cleveland was the then-biggest participation at a ball game. The Braves set up three keeps running in the highest point of the primary inning. The Indians returned to tie the amusement, however by the seventh inning the Braves recaptured the lead for good and Feller was expelled from the diversion. He got done with having permitted eight hits and seven earned runs. Lemon won Game Six and gave the Indians their second World Series title. After the Indians came back to Cleveland and were given a triumph march, Feller stated, "This is on a par with being President."
