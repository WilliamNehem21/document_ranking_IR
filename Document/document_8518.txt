Hausmann says the film "unequivocally asserts the significance of maintaining the forbiddance against inbreeding"; a common topic of Ball's work is his correlation of the taboos against interbreeding and homosexuality. Rather than making a clear qualification, "American Beauty" takes a gander at how their restraint can prompt brutality. Col. Fitts is so embarrassed about his homosexuality that it drives him to kill Lester. Ball stated, "The motion picture is to a limited extent about how homophobia is situated in dread and restraint and about what [they] can do." The film infers two unfulfilled forbidden wants: Lester's quest for Angela is a sign of his desire for his very own little girl, while Col. Fitts' constraint is displayed through the nearly sexualized order with which he controls Ricky. Thus, Ricky understands that he can just damage his dad by dishonestly revealing to him he is gay, while Angela's helplessness and accommodation to Lester helps him to remember his duties and the cutoff points of his dream. Col. Fitts speaks to Ball's dad, whose quelled gay wants prompted his own misery. Ball modified Col. Fitts to postpone uncovering him as gay, which Munt peruses as a conceivable "suspension of Ball's own male centric inbreeding dreams".
