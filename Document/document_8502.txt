Siward was, at some stage, wedded to ÃÂlfflÃÂ¦d, little girl of Ealdred II of Bamburgh, and granddaughter of Uhtred the Bold. The "Old English Saxon Chronicle" declares that, in 1041 Eadulf, Earl of Bamburgh, was "sold out" by King Harthacnut. The "double-crossing" appears to have been done by Siward; since when the "Libellus de Exordio" and different sources expound on a similar occasion, they state that Siward assaulted and slaughtered Eadulf. It was in this manner that Siward progressed toward becoming duke of all Northumbria, maybe the main individual to do as such since Uhtred the Bold. It is conceivable that Siward utilized ÃÂlfflÃÂ¦d's genealogy to guarantee the earldom of Bamburgh for himself, despite the fact that it is hazy whether the marriage occurred previously or after Siward slaughtered Eadulf. Kapelle has brought up that no leader of Bamburgh after Uhtred is bore witness to at the English illustrious court, which he contended "must mean they were in rebellion" against the government, and that Siward's assault may in this way have been supported by a ruler wishing to pulverize a defiant or traitorous vassal. Siward anyway presumably had his own advantages as well. Executing Eadulf wiped out his primary adversary in the north, and the marriage related him with the group of Uhtred the Bold, and with Uhtred's enduring child Gospatric.
