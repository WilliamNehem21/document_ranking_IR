In 1891 Robey visited the Royal Aquarium in Westminster where he watched "Teacher Kennedy", a vaudeville mesmerist from America. After the execution, Robey visited Kennedy in his changing area and offered himself as the sap for his next appearance. They concurred that Robey, as his young disciple, would be "entranced" into singing a comic tune. At a later practice, Robey arranged an arrangement to sing one of the comic tunes that had been composed for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was an incredible achievement, and thus he verified a changeless showy residency at the setting. Soon thereafter, he showed up as a performance demonstration at the Oxford Music Hall, where he played out "The Simple Pimple" and "He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now". The showy press before long wound up mindful of his demonstration, and "The Stage" considered him an "entertainer with a pretty comical inclination [who] conveys his melodies with extensive point and meets with all achievement". In mid 1892, together with his exhibitions at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey featured nearby Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theater of Varieties in Mile End, where, as indicated by his biographer Peter Cotes, he "stole the notification from experienced troupers".
