Upon Poppy's return in 2011, she and Jodie were widely known as a "double act". Roz Laws of the "Sunday Mercury" welcomed Poppy's return, observing that "Walford needs all the humour it can get these days". The "Daily Mail" Jaci Stephen loved Poppy and Jodie's scenes: "Great girls, excellent pairing and very funny. More, please!" In the "Daily Mirror", Jennifer Rodger called them a "refreshing change", and Tony Stewart deemed them "The daftest girls in Soapland and probably the funniest". Stewart was one of several critics to express displeasure over their axing, describing it as "a shame". Jane Simon and Brian McIver of the "Daily Record" described them as "an adorable female double act [and] E20's answer to 2 Shoes", and wrote of their departure, "apparently there just isn't enough room for sunny, funny, glass-half-full types in Walford". "The Sun" Colin Robertson noted that Jodie, Poppy and Norman Simmonds (George Layton), who was axed at the same time as the duo, were "EastEnders" "three funniest characters"; a critic writing for "The Huffington Post" suggested that they had "injected some humour into the famously gloomy soap". "The Daily Mirror" Rodger said that she was "sad" that the duo had left, saying that she "found their scenes together hilarious", hoping that she would see both Bright and Babbington in a new show together. Bright stated that during her main stint in 2011, she received mail telling her saying how much fans liked the double act between Poppy and Jodie, and that they were a "breath of fresh air".<ref name="interview/poppy"></ref>
