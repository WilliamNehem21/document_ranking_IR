As Carnell would like to think, the artistic nature of "Science Fantasy" was "far higher" than that of "New Worlds", yet "New Worlds" was dependably the better-selling of the two magazines. Carnell's assurance to keep the quality high driven him to defer distributing issue 20 for two months as a result of an "absence of reasonable material". His endeavors were compensated by incessant appearances of stories from "Science Fantasy" in the yearly "Year's Greatest SF" collection arrangement altered by Judith Merril. Carnell at times utilized reprints, regularly choosing stories in accordance with the magazine's emphasis on unique dream, for example, Fritz Leiber's "Space-Time for Springers", and Theodore Sturgeon's "The Graveyard Reader". Towards the finish of the 1950s Carnell started to reintroduce verifiable, and beginning in 1959 he printed a progression of articles by Sam Moskowitz on key figures in the early history of sci-fi, for example, Edgar Allan Poe; these articles, which had first showed up in American magazines, for example, "Satellite Science Fiction", were later gathered as "Travelers of the Infinite". The fine art was of variable quality, in the sentiment of pundit Brian Stableford; among the better covers Stableford refers to crafted by Brian Lewis, who provided practically all "Science Fantasy"s spread workmanship from 1958 through 1961. Student of history David Kyle remarked on the "noteworthy" spread by R.M. Bull for the third issue, which he viewed as "strikingly reminiscent of crafted by Margaret Brundage for "Peculiar Tales" in the thirties."
