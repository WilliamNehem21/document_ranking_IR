Mangrove trees cover the coastlines of South Florida, sometimes growing inland depending on the amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove treesâred ("Rhizophora mangle"), black ("Avicennia germinans"), and white ("Laguncularia racemosa")âcan be found in the Everglades. With a high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.
Within the Florida mangrove systems live 220Â species of fish, and a variety of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons ("Egretta tricolor"), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos ("Coccyzus minor"), yellow warblers ("Dendroica petechia"), and white-crowned pigeons ("Patagioenas leucocephala"). The mangroves also support 24Â species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18Â species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle ("Chelonia mydas"), hawksbill turtle ("Eretmochelys imbricata"), and West Indian manatee ("Trichechus manatus").
