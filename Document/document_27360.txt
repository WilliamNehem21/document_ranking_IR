A tropical disturbance developed on JulyÂ 17 in the Central Pacific Ocean, near the International Date Line. Deep convection with outflow persisted around a circulation, and at 06:00Â UTC on JulyÂ 20 the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression, just east of the date line and about 980Â km (610Â mi) west-southwest of Johnston Atoll. The system crossed the line shortly thereafter and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Kalmaegi. The JMA classified the system as a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained it as a tropical depression. Kalmaegi moved northwestward due to a ridge to the north, and initially a tropical upper tropospheric trough provided favorable conditions. However, the trough soon increased wind shear and restricted outflow, which caused quick weakening. The thunderstorms diminished from the circulation, and around 12:00Â UTC on JulyÂ 22, Kalmaegi dissipated about 30Â hours after forming.
A large monsoonal system persisted toward the end of July 2002 near the Philippines. On AugustÂ 2, a tropical depression formed off the northwest coast of Luzon and moved west-northwestward. Late on AugustÂ 3, it intensified into Tropical Storm Kammuri off the coast of Hong Kong. A weakening ridge turned the storm northward toward the coast of China. Tropical Storm Kammuri made landfall late on AugustÂ 4, after reaching peak winds of 100Â km/h (65Â mph). The system dissipated over the mountainous coastline of eastern China and merged with a cold front on August 7.
