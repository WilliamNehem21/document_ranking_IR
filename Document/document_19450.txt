Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-SaÃ«ns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-HonorÃ© with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, "Saint-SaÃ«ns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with". Saint-SaÃ«ns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, in the Latin Quarter; his mother moved with them. The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy. In 1878, the elder, AndrÃ©, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-FranÃ§ois, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months. Saint-SaÃ«ns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for AndrÃ©'s accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage.
For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-SaÃ«ns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-SaÃ«ns, with only the short and unsuccessful "La princesse jaune" staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act "drame lyricque", "Le timbre d'argent" ("The Silver Bell"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel CarrÃ©'s libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.
