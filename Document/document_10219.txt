The preparation was laid in 1947, when Clark Publishing, the organization that would distribute the main issue of "Creative ability", was consolidated in Evanston, Illinois, by Raymond Palmer. He worked for Ziff-Davis as the editorial manager of "Astonishing Stories" and did not leave until the finish of 1949, yet he propelled two magazines under the Clark name before that date: "Destiny", in the spring of 1948, and "Different Worlds", the primary issue of which was dated November 1949. Both of these magazines recorded their manager as "Robert N. Webster", an alias received while he was still at Ziff-Davis in view of the irreconcilable circumstance. The second issue of "Different Worlds" revealed that Webster and Palmer would alter together; by the third issue, dated March 1950, the falsification had been dropped and in spite of the fact that there was no masthead posting the proofreader, the article was just marked "Rap" (for "Raymond A. Palmer"). At the 1949 World Science Fiction Convention in Cincinnati, held throughout the few days of 3Ã¢ÂÂ 5 September, Palmer reported that he had left Ziff-Davis and portrayed his arrangements for Clark Publishing. He additionally met and contracted Bea Mahaffey, a 21-year-old sci-fi fan going to her first tradition, as his associate manager.
