Over her talking appearances, Lightning is voiced by Ali Hillis in English and Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese. Sakamoto was awed by Lightning, whom she called "cold" and "solid". She was approached to depict Lightning's quality and to sell out the character's concealed vulnerabilities. She at first thought that it was weird to voice Lightning, as she was utilized to gentler jobs, for example, Aerith Gainsborough, a focal character in "Definite Fantasy VII" and its partner media. Remarking on the trouble of adjusting Lightning's portrayal as a lady and an expertly prepared warrior, Kitase noticed that Sakamoto's acting drew out Lightning's gentility. Hillis was given the job of Lightning subsequent to talking a couple of the character's lines amid tryout, and was then given a book about the "Last Fantasy XIII" universe, which she found a touch of "overpowering" when she read it. One of the difficulties Hillis confronted was recovering the feeling and vitality of Sakamoto's Japanese execution in the character's English interpretation. She endeavored to help the staff of the "XIII" amusements depict Lightning as a genuine individual: "I feel that was my fundamental need, to ensure that Lightning had each and every layer of her identity as an individual, a diversion character, however a genuine individual with layers and history and connections to each and every character in the game...even the Chocobo!" Over the course of the "XIII" set of three, Hillis felt that Lightning turns into "somewhat more snide ... somewhat more solidified to everything that is going on around her and ... [evolves] into a genuine warrior".
