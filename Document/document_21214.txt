The music video for "DÃ©jÃ  Vu" was filmed by British director Sophie Muller in New Orleans, Louisiana on June 21, 2006, with parts of the video shot at the Maple Leaf Bar and the Oak Alley Plantation in Carrollton, Louisiana and Vacherie, Louisiana respectively. The footage features couture-inspired outfits, vigorous footwork and sexually-themed routines. The video simultaneously premiered on July 12, 2006 on MTV's show "Total Request Live" ("TRL"), and Overdrive, MTV's broadband video channel. It reached the top spot on the "TRL", Yahoo!, and MTV countdowns. The "Deja Vu" video topped the UK TV airplay chart in late July 2006.
The video begins with showing BeyoncÃ© against a green wall and Jay-Z sitting on a chair inside a dark room. BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z then start to simultaneously play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of BeyoncÃ© are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits. As the chorus begins, she is shown running around and dancing out in a large sugarcane field. At the end of the chorus, she dances in a red dress in front of a pond and in a large red dress out in front of a mansion. When Jay-Z's verse begins, the two are shown alone inside a room, BeyoncÃ© is now barefoot and bare-legged, she dances seductively around Jay-Z, and leads to the controversial oral sex scene. BeyoncÃ© is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with BeyoncÃ© leaning back in a pose as fireflies race away.
