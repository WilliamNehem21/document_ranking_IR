Jordan convinced Hill to at any rate remain for the British Grand Prix. Going into that race end of the week, Hill declared he would resign after the Grand Prix, driving Jordan to test Jos Verstappen in the event that Hill must be immediately supplanted. Following a solid fifth spot at his home occasion, be that as it may, Hill altered his opinion and chose to see out the year. His best outcome for the rest of the period was 6th spot, which he accomplished in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 to go, there were bits of gossip that the Prost Grand Prix group would discharge Jarno Trulli ahead of schedule after he marked for Jordan's 2000 battle as Hill's substitution. In the meantime, his partner, Frentzen, turned into a title contender going into the last couple of races of the period and, in the end, completed third in the title. In this manner, both Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to accomplish its best-ever complete with a third position in the Constructors' Championship. Slope's last race was the Japanese Grand Prix where he spun off the track and maneuvered into the pits refering to mental weakness.
