Ancient Egyptian belief held that the individual consisted of three basic parts; the body, the "ka", and the "ba". When the person died, the "ka" would separate from the body and return to the gods from where it had come, while the "ba" remained with the body. The body of the individual, interred in the burial chamber, never physically left; but the "ba", awakened, released itself from the body and began its journey toward new life. Significant to this journey was the Akhet: the horizon, a junction between the earth, the sky, and the Duat. To ancient Egyptians, the Akhet was the place from where the sun rose, and so symbolised a place of birth or resurrection. In the texts, the king is called upon to transform into an "akh" in the Akhet. The "akh", literally "effective being", was the resurrected form of the deceased, attained through individual action and ritual performance. If the deceased failed to complete the transformation, they became "mutu", that is "the dead". The function of the texts, in congruence with all funerary literature, was to enable the reunion of the ruler's "ba" and "ka" leading to the transformation into an "akh", and to secure eternal life among the gods in the sky.
