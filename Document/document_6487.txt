The primary issue of "If" was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editorial manager; it included stories by Richard Shaver, Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all journalists who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. When the third issue achieved the news stands, the frustrating deals figures for the principal issue were in, and Quinn chose to let Fairman go. Quinn persisted with himself as proofreader. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he proceeded as manager on the masthead for certain years. Quinn acquired Ed Valigursky as the workmanship editorial manager; he planned striking spreads, including some wraparound fine artÃ¢ÂÂan abnormal componentÃ¢ÂÂwhich improved course. Quinn started hunting down a substitution supervisor: essayist Lester del Rey turned down the activity (a choice he is accounted for to have later lamented), yet Quinn had the capacity to draw in Larry T. Shaw, a functioning sci-fi fan who had sold a couple of stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as partner manager and before long started composition publications (starting with the September 1953 issue) and helping with story determination. The magazine's quality immediately improved and soon Quinn felt ready to change to a month to month plan, rather than every other month. Shaw left after just a year, and Quinn continued full article duties.
