The June 1687 Raid on the Medway by the Dutch armada amid the Second Anglo-Dutch War uncovered the shortcomings of the Thames barriers. It took an additional hundred years for the protections on Gravesend Reach to be improved, as new works at Gravesend and Tilbury worked during the 1780s, however that being said the capability of forward barrier Ã¢ÂÂ to forestall foes getting to the lower Thames Ã¢ÂÂ kept on being ignored. It was not until the episode of the French Revolutionary Wars that the requirement for successful forward protection was tended to. Lieutenant Colonel Hartcup of the Royal Engineers completed a review of the Thames in 1794 in which he suggested constructing a triangle of mounted guns batteries to monitor the passage to Gravesend Reach and the following reach of the stream, Lower Hope Reach. Two of the batteries would be situated on the south bank at Shornemead, about north-west of Higham; at Lower Hope Point, about north-west of Cliffe; and on the north bank at East Tilbury, about north of the old Henrician strong house. The batteries would have a greatest scope of about and their circular segments of flame would cover, empowering them to help one another.
