Like that of current elephants, the mammoth's touchy, solid trunk was an appendage like organ with numerous capacities. It was utilized for controlling items and social association. Albeit sound grown-up mammoths could safeguard themselves from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, adolescents and debilitated grown-ups were defenseless against pack seekers, for example, wolves and enormous felines. Bones of adolescent Columbian mammoths, amassed by "Homotherium" (the scimitar-toothed feline), have been found in Friesenhahn Cave in Texas. Tusks may have been utilized in intra-species battling for an area or mates and for presentation, to draw in females and threaten rivals. Two Columbian mammoths that kicked the bucket in Nebraska with tusks interlocked give proof of battling conduct. The mammoths could utilize their tusks as weapons by pushing, swiping or slamming them down, and utilized them in pushing challenges by interlocking them, which some of the time brought about breakage. The tusks' ebb and flow made them unacceptable for cutting. On Goat Rock Beach in Sonoma Coast State Park, blueschist and chert outcrops (nicknamed "Mammoth Rocks") show proof of having been scoured by Columbian mammoths or mastodons. The stones have cleaned regions over the ground, basically close to their edges, and are like African scouring rocks utilized by elephants and different herbivores to free themselves of mud and parasites. Comparable rocks exist in Hueco Tanks, Texas, and on Cornudas Mountain in New Mexico.
