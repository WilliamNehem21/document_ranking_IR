In 1831 slate obligation was abrogated, and this delivered a quick extension in the business, especially since the obligation on tiles was not nullified until 1833. The Ffestiniog Railway line was developed somewhere in the range of 1833 and 1836 to transport slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the seaside town of Porthmadog, where it was stacked onto ships. The railroad was evaluated with the goal that stacked slate wagons could be controlled by gravity downhill right from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The vacant wagons were pulled back up by steeds, which went down in 'dandy' wagons. This helped development at the Blaenau Ffestiniog quarries, which had recently needed to truck the slate to Maentwrog to be stacked onto little water crafts and brought down the River Dwyryd to the estuary, where it was exchanged to bigger vessels. There was further development at Blaenau when John Whitehead Greaves, who had been running the Votty quarry since 1833, took a rent on the land between this quarry and the principle Ffestiniog to Betws-y-Coed street. Following quite a while of burrowing he struck the well known Old Vein in 1846 in what turned into the Llechwedd quarry. A flame which demolished an expansive piece of Hamburg in 1842 prompted an interest for slate for modifying, and Germany turned into a vital market, especially for Ffestiniog slate.
