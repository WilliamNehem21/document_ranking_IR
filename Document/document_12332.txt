At 10 Downing Street toward the beginning of September 1964, impasse created between Douglas-Home and Smith over the most ideal approach to gauge dark popular sentiment in Southern Rhodesia. A key board of Britain's Southern Rhodesia arrangement was that the terms for autonomy must be "adequate to the general population of the nation all in all"Ã¢ÂÂ consenting to this, Smith proposed that white and urban dark assessment could be measured through a general choice of enrolled voters, and that provincial dark perspectives could be gotten at a national "indaba" (inborn gathering) of boss and headmen. Douglas-Home disclosed to Smith that in spite of the fact that this proposition fulfilled him by and by, he couldn't acknowledge it as he didn't trust the Commonwealth, the United Nations or the Labor Party would likewise do as such. He focused on that such a move towards settlement with Smith may hurt the Conservatives' odds in the British general decision the following month, and recommended that it may be to Smith's greatest advantage to hold up until after the race to proceed with arrangements. Smith acknowledged this contention. Douglas-Home guaranteed Smith that a Conservative government would settle with him and give freedom inside a year.
