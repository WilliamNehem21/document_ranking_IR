Concerns have additionally been raised over the blended utilization of citizen and corporate financing and related naming rights for segments of the recreation center. While a landmark in Wrigley Square distinctions the recreation center's numerous private and corporate givers, many park highlights are likewise named for their corporate guarantors, with the patrons' names conspicuously showed with stone markers (The Boeing Gallery, The Exelon Pavilion, The AT&T Plaza, The Wrigley Square). A few commentators have regarded this to be unseemly for an open space. Julie Deardorff, "Chicago Tribune" wellbeing and wellness columnist, depicted the naming of the McDonald's Cycle Center as a continuation of the "ÃÂ 'McDonaldization' of America" and as to some degree "treacherous" on the grounds that the organization is making itself increasingly noticeable as the social estimation is to move far from inexpensive food. Timothy Gilfoyle, creator of "Thousand years Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark", takes note of that a discussion encompasses the corporate naming of a few of the recreation center's highlights, including the BP Bridge, named for an oil organization. Naming rights were sold for high charges, and Gilfoyle was by all account not the only one who chastised park authorities for pitching naming rights to the most elevated bidder. Open intrigue bunches have waged holy war against commercialization of parks. Be that as it may, a large number of the benefactors have a long history of nearby generosity and their assets were fundamental to give essential financing to a few park highlights.
