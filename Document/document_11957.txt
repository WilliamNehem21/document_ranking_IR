The designs for the Polish strike must be changed because of surprising Russian activities. The Polish powers expected overwhelming resistance from somewhere around two Russian divisions. Be that as it may, in the first part of the day the Russian 21st Division continued its development along the BiaÃÂystokÃ¢ÂÂ Warsaw street towards Marki and Warsaw, while the 27th began its walk towards JabÃÂonna. The 21st Division accomplished some early victories when its fifth and sixth Rifle Brigades drove the Poles once more from the Czarna River some toward the west. In any case, in the meantime it was propelling directly before Polish powers which were getting ready to strike Radzymin. At 10:15 hours the Polish 81st and 85th Infantry Regiments from the first Lithuanian-Belarusian Division attacked the left flank of the clueless Russians, proceeded with the WarsawÃ¢ÂÂ BiaÃÂystok street, and got through to the town. The assault was driven by Lieutenant Colonel Kazimierz Rybicki, who had actually seen the annihilation of the 46th Regiment the earlier day, on his day away from work. This time spirits were high and the Polish infantry progressed all together, with officers in the main line and the troopers singing DÃÂbrowski's Mazurka. By early afternoon the town was freed.
