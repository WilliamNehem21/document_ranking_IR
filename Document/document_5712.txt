Later observers likewise discovered a lot to adulate in "The Oceanides." Guy Rickards portrays the tone lyric as an "uncommon score", superb yet unpretentious in its delineation of the ocean's different states of mind, however in any case "music suffused by light", while Robert Layton sees the piece as "unmistakably increasingly goal-oriented and very sorted out in plan" than its quick ancestor, "The Bard". Tawaststjerna noticed Sibelius' prosperity at describing the ocean: the "fun loving woodwinds" that breath life into the oceanides however which feel "outsider" in the scene's tremendousness; the "amazing swell" of wind and water passed on by oboe and clarinet over undulating strings and harp glissandi; the supported breeze harmony symbolizing the "boundless span of the ocean"; and, the "strong peak" of the tempest, the last wave crash which "dependably surpasses one's desires". The Finnish author Kalevi Aho has contended for the D real Yale variant, feeling as if the piece loses "something basic" regarding instrumental shading in D major: "The symphonic tone in D major is hidden, some way or another baffling and impressionistic. Contrasted and it D significant sounds more clear, yet in addition increasingly matter-of-certainty". The conductor Osmo VÃÂ¤nskÃÂ¤ likewise has noticed the contrast between the two keys, contrasting the D significant form with a "huge lake" and the D major to a "forceful sea".
