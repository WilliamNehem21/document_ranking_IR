Having made no progress in Rome, Momolo and Marianna Mortara returned to Bologna in early December 1858, and soon afterwards moved to Turin, in Piedmont. The caseâan anti-Catholic "publicist's dream", to quote Kertzerâhad by now become a massive controversy in both Europe and the United States, with voices across the social spectrum clamouring for the Pope to return Edgardo to his parents. Mortara became a "cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre" not only for Jews but for Protestant Christians as well, particularly in the United States, where anti-Catholic sentiment aboundedâ"The New York Times" published more than 20 articles on the case in December 1858 alone. In Britain, "The Spectator" presented the Mortara case as evidence that the Papal States had "the worst government in the worldâthe most insolvent and the most arrogant, the cruelest and the meanest". The Catholic press both in Italy and abroad steadfastly defended the Pope's actions. The pro-Church articles often took on an overtly anti-Semitic character, charging for example that if coverage in Britain, France or Germany was critical this was hardly a surprise "since currently the newspapers of Europe are in good part in the hands of the Jews". Scazzocchio suggested that the press storm attacking the Church was actually counter-productive for the Mortara family's cause, as it angered the Pope and thereby steeled his resolve not to compromise.
