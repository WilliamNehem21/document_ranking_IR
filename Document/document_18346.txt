In February 1943, Waddy took charge of the Spitfire Squadron of No.Â 2 Operational Training Unit (No.Â 2 OTU), based at Mildura, Victoria. He was quoted in "The Canberra Times" that April offering his message of congratulation to the RAF on the 25th anniversary of its foundation: "You should not have many more birthdays before 'Jerry' and the Japs are shot clean out of the skies. Here's hoping." Fellow aces and Desert War veterans Clive Caldwell, Wilf Arthur and Bobby Gibbes were also instructors at No.Â OTU prior to their combat postings in the South West Pacific; in December 1943, Caldwell and Waddy nearly collided when they crossed paths during an aerobatics display at No.Â 5 Service Flying Training School in Uranquinty, New South Wales. Waddy undertook a staff course the following year, and was promoted to squadron leader. He was posted to Noemfoor in the Dutch East Indies in September 1944 to command No.Â 80 Squadron; his unit was part of No.Â 78 (Fighter) Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.Â 1 TAF), led by Air Commodore Harry Cobby. Operating Kittyhawks, No.Â 80 Squadron undertook dive bombing and strafing missions against Japanese targets, but saw little air combat.
