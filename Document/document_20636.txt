Texas' Rose Bowl win was the 800thÂ victory in school history and it earned the Longhorns their fourthÂ consensus national championship in football. Since the game, the media, coaches, and other commentators have heaped praise upon the Texas team, Young, and the Rose Bowl performance. Both the Rose Bowl win as well as the Longhorns' overall season have both been cited as standing among the greatest performances in college football history by observers such as "College Football News", the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "Scout.com", "Austin American-Statesman", and "Sports Illustrated". ESPN awarded the two teams the 2006Â ESPY Award for the "Best Game" in any sport.
Texas' win over USC was their ninthÂ consecutive victory when facing a ranked opponent. Texas broke USC's winning streak (then the longest in the nation) at 34 and claimed the longest running winning streak for themselves at 20Â wins in a row. Texas' 20-game winning streak was the second-longest winning streak in school history; Texas had 30 wins in a row from 1968 to 1970. Texas extended the winning streak to 21 before a September 9, 2006, loss to Ohio State University. In beating USC, Texas defeated a No. 1Â ranked team for the first time since defeating Alabama in the Orange Bowl on January 1, 1965. The Longhorns ended the season ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage (.7143).
