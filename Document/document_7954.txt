Aldfrith's relations with the Church were, in any case, not constantly smooth. He acquired from Ecgfrith an agitated association with Wilfrid, a noteworthy religious figure of the time. Wilfrid, the priest of York, had been banished by Ecgfrith for his job in influencing Ecgfrith's better half, ÃÂthelthryth, to remain a righteous abstinent. In 686, at the encouraging of Archbishop Theodore, Aldfrith permitted Wilfrid to return. Aldfrith's relations with Wilfrid were stormy; the antagonistic vibe between the two was somewhat brought about by Aldfrith's loyalties with the Celtic Church, a result of his childhood in a state of banishment. An increasingly noteworthy reason for conflict was Wilfrid's restriction to Theodore's division, in 677, of his enormous Northumbrian see. At the point when Wilfrid came back from outcast the compromise with Aldfrith did exclude Aldfrith's help for Wilfrid's endeavors to recuperate his episcopal expert over the entire of the north. By 691 or 692 their disparities were hopeless. Wilfrid's hagiographer writes:For some time all eventual harmony between the astute King Aldfrith and our sacred cleric, and a more joyful situation could barely be envisioned. At that point dislike would bubble up again and the circumstance would be turned around. Thus they proceeded for a considerable length of time, all through companionship with one another, till at long last their fights reached a crucial stage and the lord exiled Wilfrid from Northumbria.
