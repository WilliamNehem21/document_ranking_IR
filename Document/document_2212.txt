Throughout the following six days, the agents received a progression of goals mentioning changes in the administration of Texas. Antiquarian Eugene Campbell Barker proposes that the discourses would likely not have closed so quickly except if the representatives had done "extensive planning before the gathering". A few of the goals were intended to invigorate the nearby economy. Representatives mentioned that traditions obligation implementation be deferred until 1835 and that residents be conceded a strategy to expel degenerate traditions officers. Goals supported that land titles be issued all the more rapidly and that open terrains be sold to fund-raise for bilingual schools. Agents from Nacogdoches asked that the administration take a firmer submit keeping new pilgrims from infringing on grounds that had recently been guaranteed to local clans. Subsequent to clarifying that reputable potential natives were being avoided from Texas while offensive squatters kept on gushing unlawfully in, the agents requested the annulment of the restriction on migration from the United States. Besides, they mentioned authorization to raise a local army, apparently for security from raiding local clans. The most disputable goals asked that Texas become an autonomous state, separate from Coahuila. The partition demand was included by a vote of 36Ã¢ÂÂ 12. The movement included as legitimization the way that Coahuila and Texas were divergent in atmosphere and economy and referenced that Texas' constrained portrayal in the state council made it exceptionally hard to authorize laws that explicitly tended to the requirements of its natives. Agents demanded that free statehood was not an affection for withdrawal from Mexico.
