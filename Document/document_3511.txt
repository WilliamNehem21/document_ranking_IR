Among his 1993 discharges, Khan accumulated the most thankfulness for depicting abhorrent jobs in two film industry hits: an over the top sweetheart in "Darr", and a killer in "Baazigar". "Darr" denoted the first of Khan's numerous joint efforts with producer Yash Chopra and his organization Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the utilization of the expression "I adore you, K-k-k-Kiran" were mainstream with gatherings of people. For "Darr" he got an assignment for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, otherwise called the Best Villain Award, yet lost to Paresh Rawal for "Sir". "Baazigar", in which Khan played an equivocal vindicator who kills his sweetheart, stunned Indian crowds with a sudden infringement of the standard Bollywood recipe. In "The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture", Sonal Khullar called the character "the quintessential screw-up". His execution in "Baazigar", which would be his first of numerous appearances with on-screen character Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the "Reference book of Hindi Cinema" expressed that Khan "resisted the picture of the customary saint in both these movies and made his very own form of the revisionist legend". Likewise in 1993, Khan played out a bare scene with Deepa Sahi in "Maya Memsaab", despite the fact that pieces of it were controlled by the Central Board of Film Certification. The resulting debate provoked him to shun such scenes in future jobs.
