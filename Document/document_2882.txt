Nicknamed Canada's "Excellent National Drunk", the Gray Cup party started in the 1948 title when several Calgary Stampeders fans dropped on Toronto for their group's first appearance in the amusement. Bringing chuckwagons and ponies, the fans composed a hotcake breakfast Ã¢ÂÂ a staple of the Calgary Stampede Ã¢ÂÂ for baffled Torontonians. As per history specialist Hugh Dempsey, "The Gray Cup was simply one more amusement until Calgary ran down to Toronto with chuckwagons and everything and transformed it into an occasion." The Stampeders won on the quality of the "sleeper play", a touchdown scored by Norm Hill after he concealed himself from the Ottawa safeguard by resting on the sidelines, as though snoozing. He got the go from quarterback Keith Spaith while still on his back. The triumph finished the main undefeated season ever of expert football. The rowdy festivals that pursued the success offered ascend to the legend of Calgary councilman and future city hall leader Don Mackay riding his pony into the anteroom of the Royal York Hotel. This occasion was rehashed in the 2012 Gray Cup diversion in Toronto to a great part of the enjoyment of the devotees of the two groups.
