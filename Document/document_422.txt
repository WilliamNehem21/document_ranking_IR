Whenever Rep. James Henry Hammond of South Carolina hoped to keep abolitionist servitude petitions from achieving the House floor, be that as it may, Pierce favored the abolitionists' entitlement to request. All things considered, Pierce upheld what came to be known as the stifler rule, which took into consideration petitions to be gotten, yet not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836. He was assaulted by the New Hampshire abolitionist servitude "Envoy of Freedom" as a "doughface", which had the double significance of "fainthearted energetic man" and "northerner with southern feelings". Penetrate had expressed that not one out of 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the "Envoy of Freedom" article included the quantity of marks on petitions from that state, separated by the quantity of occupants as per the 1830 registration, and recommended the real number was one-in-33. Puncture was offended when South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun read the article on the Senate floor as "verification" that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce answered to him in a discourse which expressed that most signatories were ladies and youngsters, who couldn't cast a ballot, which in this way provided reason to feel ambiguous about the one-in-33 figure.
