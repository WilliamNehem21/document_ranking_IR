In the second semi-last of 2009 Finals Day, Somerset won the hurl and chose to field against Kent. Affordable bowling from Thomas and Willoughby, just as the early wickets of Joe Denly and Martin van Jaarsveld, constrained Kent to 145/5. On a moderate pitch, Trescothick played what ESPNcricinfo's Andrew McGlashan portrayed as a "severe innings", scoring 56 keeps running off 32 balls. He shared an opening association of 73 with chief Langer, and when of Trescothick's rejection after 8.1 overs, Somerset required 62 keeps running off 71 balls. Hildreth and de Bruyn took 10 overs to include another 57 runs, and after Hildreth was bowled for 36, Kieswetter added two rushes to concede Somerset triumph with seven balls remaining. Against Sussex in the last, Somerset by and by won the hurl and chose to field. A solid batting show by Sussex, featured by Dwayne Smith's 59 keeps running off 26 balls, set Somerset an objective of 173 to win. In the opening overs of Somerset's answer, Trescothick scored intensely, making the pursuit "look basic" as indicated by McGlashan. Be that as it may, after he was gotten on 33, Somerset lost ordinary wickets. An association of 41 between de Bruyn and Trego steadied Somerset for a period, yet when the pair were rejected in ensuing overs, their group fallen from 104/4 to 109 full scale.
