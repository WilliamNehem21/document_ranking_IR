The principle strike on Musa Qala started at 4ÃÂ pm on 7 December. A few Taliban were supposedly murdered in US airstrikes as the assault started. That night approximately 600 American troopers from the 82nd Airborne Division were carried toward the north of the town in 19 helicopters. Chinook and Blackhawk troop bearers escorted by Apache assault helicopters were engaged with the strike. Amid the night the paratroopers got through Taliban channels to make room for further ground troops and after that burrowed guarded positions. Amid the assault, an Apache was hit by ground fire and had one motor thumped out yet the pilot, CW2 Thomas O. Malone, figured out how to arrive securely in spite of being harmed. In excess of 2,000 British troops of the Helmand Task Force (at that point under the course of 52nd Infantry Brigade), including Scots Guards, Brigade Reconnaissance Force shaped by 4/73 Special OP Bty and 2 YORKS, Household Cavalry, and Royal Marines from 40 Commando, wound up engaged with the activity. English troops set up a cordon around the town to help the US assault and furthermore started a development with Afghan troops from the south, west, and east, trading gunfire with the Taliban. While the BRF gave the US Paratroopers fire support from the west. In any event on the principal day of the fight these advances may have filled in as a bluff to occupy consideration from the principle US air strike. Danish and Estonian troops were likewise engaged with the underlying attack.
