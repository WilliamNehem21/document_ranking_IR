Most of the fight, yet to come, tumbled to Nauendorf's section. His men had walked the majority of the previous night; his segment moved with the corps of General Latour to Feldburg, yet by the chÃÂ¢teau of BÃÂ¼rgeln toward the east at , it swung to one side (west) to enter to the wellspring of the Kandern stream. At long last, by 14:00, two toward the evening, Nauendorf's segment had trudged through mud and waste and came completely into the activity. Regardless of decided restriction, his troops removed the French from Kandern and Sitzenkirch, and all the high ground over the waterway and Feuerbach. The battling there, among Ferino's and Nauendorf's segments, was extraordinary and terrible: Moreau later described that Ferino's troops performed "wonders of valor" from dawn to dusk. At the point when Nauendorf wrapped up the French from Kandern, and two villas adjacent to it, and he sent a note with this data to Latour. As the fight completed, a brutal tempest released hail and wind. So finished the principal day of the fight amid which Charles' military had effectively removed both French flanks from their positions. Medium-term, Charles attracted up his arrangements to assault the French focus on the next morning. It guaranteed to be a long and grisly second day.
