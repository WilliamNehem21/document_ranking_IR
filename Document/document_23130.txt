Manson singled out "Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis)" as his favorite song on the album and said that it describes every person's desire for self-actualization. The song's flanged arpeggiated chords builds into heavy guitar chugs and string bending during the chorus and features an optigan. Drowned In Sound described the song as "a shining moment" in the album. "President Dead" is a guitar-driven song showcasing John 5's technical skills. It opens with a sample of Don Gardiner's "ABC News Radio" broadcast announcing the death of John F. Kennedy and accents both the first verse and guitar solo with a mellotron. The song is 3:13 long, which is a deliberate numerological reference to frame 313 of the Zapruder filmâthe frame displaying the moment of impact of the fatal head shot which killed Kennedy. "In the Shadow of the Valley of Death" is an introspective song with Adam at his most emotionally vulnerable. The song is divided into two parts. The first portion consists of samples and a 'death loop' on a simple strum from a 1952 Gibson acoustic guitar. In the second portion the samples and 'death loop' are replaced by a bass guitar and drums over plucked chords. "Cruci-Fiction in Space" further explores the Kennedy assassination, postulating that human beings have evolved from monkeys to men to guns. It's composition is slow and heavy; bereft of "speed or intricacy." Its middle 8 has a mixed meter drum beat in 4/4 time with two additional eighth notes at the end; "it doesn't start in 4/4, it doesn't end in 4/4, so it's confusing." "A Place in the Dirt" is another personal song, characterized by Adam's self-analysis of his place in Holy Wood.
