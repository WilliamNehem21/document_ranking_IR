By then a gathering of blue-bloods influenced the Despot to look for the help of the Republic of Venice, an activity most likely taken without counseling Constantinople. In spring 1423, by means of the Venetian province of Negroponte, he educated the Venetians of his aim to hand over the city to them. When he educated the Venetians, they were shocked. The main conditions Andronikos joined to his offer were that the property, traditions and benefits of the city's occupants, their entitlement to exchange and go back and forth uninhibitedly, and the situation of the city's Orthodox Church be regarded, and that Venice promise to safeguard the city against the Ottomans. The sixteenth century writer Pseudo-Sphrantzes claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 ducats, and this announcement was frequently acknowledged by researchers until the mid-twentieth century. This isn't referenced in some other source, nor is it found in the first reports relating to the issue, as appeared by the researchers Konstantinos Mertzios and Paul Lemerle. Then again, the Venetian agents delegated to supervise the handover were approved to give a whole of 20,000Ã¢ÂÂ 40,000 aspers from the income of the city as a yearly appropriation to Andronikos, should he demand it.
