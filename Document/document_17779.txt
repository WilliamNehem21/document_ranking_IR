On 22 September Mack decided to hold the Iller line anchored on Ulm. In the last three days of September, the French began the furious marches that would place them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that Bernadotte's I Corps had marched through Prussian Ansbach, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces. Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or maneuvers; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to Ingolstadt east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size. On 5 October Napoleon ordered Ney to join Lannes, Soult, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at DonauwÃ¶rth. The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same placeÂ â they instead deployed on a long west-east axisÂ â and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at DonauwÃ¶rth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion. Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around DonauwÃ¶rth; on 6 October three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to DonauwÃ¶rth to seal off Mack's escape route.
