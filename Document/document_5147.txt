The main open conflict between the rebels and officers went ahead the morning of 3 December, when a little gathering of mariners assembled on the forecastle and, denying requests to leave, started to contend with the officers. Chief Eyles requested to know their requests, which were a confirmation that "Temeraire" would not go toward the West Indies, however rather would come back to England. In the end Rear Admiral Campbell came down to address the men, and having educated them that the officers did not know the goal of the ship, he requested them to scatter. The men went underneath decks and the beginning uprising seemed to have been suppressed. The instigators, numbering around twelve, stayed decided in any case, and made careful request among the remainder of the team. Having in the end verified that most of the group would, if not really bolster a revolt, in any event not restrict it, and that "Temeraire"s team would be upheld by the ship's marines just as the teams of a portion of different warships in Bantry Bay, they chose to press ahead with their arrangements. The insurrection started with the group shutting the ship's gunports, viably blockading themselves underneath deck. Having done as such, they denied requests to open them once more, scoffed the officers and compromised savagery. The team at that point came up on deck and indeed requested to know their goal and would not obey requests to cruise for anyplace however England. Having displayed their requests they returned beneath decks and continued the standard shipboard everyday practice as much as they could.
