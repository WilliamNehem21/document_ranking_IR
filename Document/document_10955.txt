The decision of Kent and ÃÂthelberht was in all likelihood directed by various variables, including that ÃÂthelberht had enabled his Christian spouse to venerate unreservedly. Exchange between the Franks and ÃÂthelberht's kingdom was well established,and the language hindrance between the two locales was evidently just a minor impediment as the translators for the mission originated from the Franks. Another explanation behind the mission was the developing intensity of the Kentish kingdom. Since the obscuration of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, ÃÂthelberht was the main Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede alludes to ÃÂthelberht as having imperium, or overlordship, south of the River Humber. Ultimately, the closeness of Kent to the Franks considered help from a Christian territory. There is some proof, including Gregory's letters to Frankish lords in help of the mission, that a portion of the Franks felt they had a case to overlordship over a portion of the southern British kingdoms right now. The nearness of a Frankish religious administrator could likewise have loaned belief to cases of overlordship, if Liudhard was felt to go about as a delegate of the Frankish Church and not simply as a profound guide to the ruler. Archeological remains bolster the thought that there were social impacts from Francia in England around then.
