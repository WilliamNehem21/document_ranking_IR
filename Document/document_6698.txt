Its imperial inhabitant might just have made York House the zenith of Brettingham's vocation. Worked amid the 1760s, it was one of his last excellent houses. His last nation house commission was at Packington Hall, Warwickshire. In 1761, he distributed his arrangements of Holkham Hall, considering himself the engineer, which drove commentators, including Horace Walpole, to censure him as a purloiner of Kent's plans. Brettingham passed on in 1769 at his home outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was covered in the walkway of the area church. All through his long vocation, Brettingham did a lot to promote the Palladian development. His customers incorporated a Royal Duke and somewhere around twenty-one grouped friends and peeresses. He isn't a commonly recognized name today generally on the grounds that his commonplace work was vigorously affected by Kent and Burlington, and not at all like his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he didn't create, or was not allowed the chance to build up, a solid individual stamp to his work on nation houses. At last, he and a significant number of his contemporary draftsmen were overshadowed by the structures of Robert Adam. Adam redesigned Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, notwithstanding Kedleston Hall, proceeded to supplant James Paine as designer at Nostell Priory, Alnwick Castle, and Syon House. Regardless of this, Adam and Paine stayed incredible companions; Brettingham's associations with his kindred engineers are unrecorded.
