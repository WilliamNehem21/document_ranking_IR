The last dramatization of account "Freewheelin"' happened when Dylan was planned to show up on "The Ed Sullivan Show" on May 12, 1963. Dylan had disclosed to Sullivan he would perform "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues", however the "head of program rehearses" at CBS Television educated Dylan that this melody was conceivably offensive to the John Birch Society, and requested that he play out another number. As opposed to agree to TV oversight, Dylan would not show up on the show. There is difference between Dylan's biographers about the results of this restriction push. Anthony Scaduto composes that after "The Ed Sullivan Show" failure, CBS legal advisors were frightened to find that the questionable melody was to be incorporated on Dylan's new collection, just half a month from its discharge date. They demanded that the melody be dropped, and four tunes ("John Birch", "Let Me Die In My Footsteps", "Drifting Gambling Willie", "Shakes and Gravel") on the collection were supplanted with Dylan's more up to date organizations recorded in April ("Girl from the North Country", "Experts of War", "Talkin' World War III Blues", "Sway Dylan's Dream"). Scaduto composes that Dylan felt "smashed" by being constrained to submit to restriction, however he was in no situation to contend.
