In the years between his arrival from Paris in 1908 and the flare-up of the First World War in 1914, Vaughan Williams progressively settled himself as a figure in British music. For a rising writer it was imperative to get exhibitions at the huge common music celebrations, which created attention and sovereignties. In 1910 his music highlighted at two of the biggest and most lofty celebrations, with the debuts of the "Rhapsody on a Theme by Thomas Tallis" at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and "A Sea Symphony" at the Leeds Festival the next month. The main British music faultfinders of the time, J. A. Fuller Maitland of "The Times" and Samuel Langford of "The Manchester Guardian", were solid in their commendation. The previous composed of the rhapsody, "The work is magnificent in light of the fact that it appears to lift one into some obscure area of melodic idea and feeling. All through its course one is never certain whether one is tuning in to something exceptionally old or extremely new". Langford pronounced that the ensemble "certainly puts another figure in the primary position of our English writers". Between these triumphs and the beginning of war Vaughan Williams' biggest scale work was the primary variant of "A London Symphony" (1914). Around the same time he expressed "The Lark Ascending" in its unique structure for violin and piano.
