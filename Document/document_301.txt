On March 12, 2007, "Divine force of War II" was propelled at the Metreon: "Lord of War II" Game Director Cory Barlog formally affirmed the improvement of "Chains of Olympus", expressing "It is its own story that interfaces with the general story. "Lord of War", "Divine force of War II", and after that if every one of the stars adjust "Divine force of War III" will be the recounting a set of three. This PSP story will be a further fleshing out." An underlying trailer for "Chains of Olympus" was discharged on April 25, 2007, harmonizing with the declaration of a demo on UMDÃ¢ÂÂthe optical plate mechanism for the PSP. The trailer is described by voice performing artist Linda Hunt.
