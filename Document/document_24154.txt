Clackline Bridge is a timber bridge spanning the Clackline Brook and the former Eastern Railway alignment, in the Shire of Northam, east of Perth. Constrained by the topography of the site, the route of the Eastern Railway tracks, and the previous alignment of Great Eastern Highway, the bridge has a unique curved and sloping design. It has 18 spans over a length, with a 1Â inÂ 20 slope and a horizontal curve radius of . There are 18 numbered piers, starting from pierÂ 1 at the eastern end. The double tracks of the Eastern Railway, which linked Perth and Northam until its removal in 1981, passed between piersÂ 16 and 17. PiersÂ 14 to 17 are parallel to that former railway, at an angle of approximately 40Â degrees to the bridge. This resulted in spans of various lengths: heading out from the western abutment, then a span between piers 16 and 17, followed by a length, two spans, and 13 spans of .
The bridge has undergone multiple alterations, but the original piers remain. They were constructed as "four rounded braced wandoo piles supported from horizontal 450mm timber sills, adzed to 400mm, fixed to concrete footings", with the footings designed to bear on foundation rocks beneath the surface. The bridge's original spans were made up of seven rounded timber wandoo stringers, of at least diameter, bearing on jarrah corbels, supported by jarrah half caps in size. The span over the railway alignment was originally supported on four steel beams, weighing each.
