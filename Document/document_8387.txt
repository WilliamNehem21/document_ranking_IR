The ongoing interaction progresses were likewise very adulated by commentators: Lopez asserted that "Relic handled space, however may have quite recently changed technique diversions for eternity." Reviewers lauded the full 3D nature of the amusement as lifting it from its generally standard continuous methodology interactivity frameworks; Levine said that the 3D was what made the amusement one of a kind, and Ryan expressly named the base ongoing interaction as "genuinely like any time tested constant procedure diversion" yet said that the 3D components and associated mission structure transformed it into an "alternate breed" of diversion. Fortune, be that as it may, concentrated rather on the trouble of the missions themselves, applauding the test and assortment of strategies expected to finish the amusement and praising it for having "the absolute best armada fights at any point found in a PC diversion". Levine, Ryan, Keefer, and Lopez all prominent the associated mission structure as an advancement in the class: by restricting the assets to assemble ships and pulling a similar armada through the missions, "Homeworld" changed over what might more often than not be a lot of separated missions into "sections" of a persistent amusement. They felt this associated the player to their armada as more than expendable units, and added a dimension of technique to the amusement. Keefer and Levine noted, be that as it may, this additional a lot of trouble to the amusement, particularly for progressively easygoing players, as the player could settle on choices in prior dimensions that rendered later ones hard to finish without an express trouble level to balance it. Ryan and Keefer additionally considered the 3D development confusing at first, however Levine and Samuel said the controls were "as simple as would be prudent".
