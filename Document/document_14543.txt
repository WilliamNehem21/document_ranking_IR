A flimsy sagittal peak, developed from the lengthen nasal bones, kept running up the skull midline before ceasing simply over the eye in a somewhat straightened lump. In spite of the fact that the total shape and tallness of this structure is obscure in "Irritator", these head peaks were typical in spinosaurids, having perhaps served a showcase work when the creature was alive. The safeguarded piece of "Irritator"s peak is most profound over the antorbital fenestra and comes up short on the vertical edges found in the peak of "Spinosaurus". Like others in its family, "Irritator" had a long and hard structure on the top of its mouth called an optional sense of taste, isolating the oral from the nasal depression. This is a component seen in surviving crocodilians, yet missing in most theropod dinosaurs. Likewise like its relatives, "Irritator" had two extra openings on the skull rooftop (called the postnasal fenestrae) just as long and just incompletely separating (hard expansions interfacing the braincase with the sense of taste). The back of the lower jaw was profound, its back upper surface comprising fundamentally of the extensive bone, which with the shallower bone beneath it. The , a sideways-confronting opening in the lower jaw, was oval and nearly expansive. The (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) is obscure in "Irritator", put something aside for a conceivable remainder at the front of the surangular. "Irritator challengeri"s holotype is novel in that it is one of only a handful few non-avian (or non-fowl) dinosaur fossils found with a protected stapes.
