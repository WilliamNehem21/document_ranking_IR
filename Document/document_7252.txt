At the point when the Senate met for an exceptional session on July 4, 1861, Breckinridge stood practically alone contrary to the war. Marked a trickster, he was expelled from the Committee on Military Affairs. He requested to comprehend what expert Lincoln needed to bar Southern ports or suspend the writ of "habeas corpus". He reminded his kindred congresspersons that Congress had not endorsed a statement of war and kept up that Lincoln's enrollment of men and use of assets for the war exertion were unlawful. On the off chance that the Union could be convinced not to assault the Confederacy, he anticipated that "every one of those suppositions of regular intrigue and feelingÃÂ ... might prompt a political gathering established upon assent". On August 1, he proclaimed that if Kentucky bolstered Lincoln's indictment of the war, "she will be spoken to by some other man on the floor of this Senate." Asked by Oregon's Edward Dickinson Baker how he would deal with the withdrawal emergency, he reacted, "I would want to see these States all rejoined upon genuine protected standards to whatever other item that could be offered me in lifeÃÂ ... Be that as it may, I unendingly like to see a tranquil detachment of these States, than to see perpetual, careless, destroying war, toward the finish of which I see the grave of open freedom and of individual flexibility."
