A few hypotheses have been proposed about the biogeography of the spinosaurids. Since "Suchomimus" was all the more firmly identified with "Baryonyx" (from Europe) than to "Spinosaurus"Ã¢ÂÂ in spite of the fact that that variety likewise lived in AfricaÃ¢ÂÂthe circulation of spinosaurids can't be clarified as vicariance coming about because of mainland breaking. Sereno and partners suggested that spinosaurids were at first dispersed over the supercontinent Pangea, yet split with the opening of the Tethys Sea. Spinosaurines would then have advanced in the south (Africa and South America: in Gondwana) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in Laurasia), with "Suchomimus" the consequence of a solitary north-to-south dispersal occasion. Buffetaut and the Tunisian scientist Mohamed Ouaja likewise proposed in 2002 that baryonychines could be the precursors of spinosaurines, which seem to have supplanted the previous in Africa. Milner recommended in 2003 that spinosaurids began in Laurasia amid the Jurassic, and scattered through the Iberian land connect into Gondwana, where they emanated. In 2007, Buffetaut called attention to that palaeogeographical examines had exhibited that Iberia was close northern Africa amid the Early Cretaceous, which he found to affirm Milner's thought that the Iberian area was a venturing stone among Europe and Africa, which is upheld by the nearness of baryonychines in Iberia. The course of the dispersal among Europe and Africa is as yet obscure, and consequent disclosures of spinosaurid stays in Asia and Australia show that it might have been intricate.
