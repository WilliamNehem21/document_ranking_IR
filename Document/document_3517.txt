Then, Union Carbide and Kellex had made analysts at the Bakelite Corporation, an auxiliary of Union Carbide, mindful of Nix's ineffective endeavors with powdered nickel boundaries. To Frazier Groff and different scientists at Bakelite's research centers in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it appeared that Nix was not exploiting the most recent methods, and they started their own improvement endeavors. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent examples of their powdered nickel boundaries to Taylor for assessment, however he was disinterested; neither had thought of a pragmatic obstruction. At Kellogg's research facility in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who knew about the means taken by the SAM labs to improve the Norris-Adler hindrance, understood that they could likewise be taken with the Bakelite boundary. The outcome was a boundary superior to either, albeit still shy of what was required. At a gathering at Columbia with the Army in participation on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed exchanging the improvement exertion to the Johnson obstruction. Urey shrugged off this, expecting this would demolish confidence at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a gathering on 3 November 1943, and he chose to seek after improvement of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler obstructions.
