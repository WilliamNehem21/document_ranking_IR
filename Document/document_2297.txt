Jackson favored the Eatons. He and his late spouse Rachel Donelson had experienced comparative political assaults coming from their marriage in 1791. The two had hitched in 1791 not realizing that Rachel's first spouse, Lewis Robards, had neglected to settle the normal separation. When the separation was finished, they wedded lawfully in 1794, however the scene caused a noteworthy debate, and was utilized against him in the 1828 crusade. Jackson saw assaults on Eaton stemming at last from the political resistance of Calhoun, who had neglected to quiet his better half's reactions. The Calhouns were broadly viewed as the main instigators. Jackson, who wanted to customize debate, additionally observed the Petticoat undertaking as an immediate test to his position, since it included lower-positioning official authorities and their spouses appearing to challenge his capacity to pick whomever he needed for his bureau. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a single man, agreed with Jackson's stance and shielded the Eatons. Van Buren was a northerner and a supporter of the 1828 duty (which Calhoun harshly contradicted). Calhoun and Van Buren were the fundamental contenders for who might be selected as VP in the resulting decision and who might at that point, apparently, be the gathering's decision to succeed Jackson. The way that Van Buren favored the Eatons, notwithstanding differences among Jackson and Calhoun on various different issues, mostly the Nullification Crisis, checked him as Calhoun's presumable bad habit presidential successor.
