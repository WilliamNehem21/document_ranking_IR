While on the arrival voyage, she barraged Russian positions at Libau. She steered into the rocks off Steinort amid the task, and "Augsburg" struck a mine off Bornholm. In the wake of being liberated from her establishing, the ship was fixed; Michelsen incidentally filled in as the separation administrator instead of Behring from 13 February to 9 March, when the ship was prepared to come back to support. Behring came back to "Prinz Adalbert" on 20 March. Meanwhile, the Russians had quickly caught Memel. The "Admiralstab" (Admiralty Staff) segregated the II Battle Squadron, II Scouting Group, and two flotillas of torpedo water crafts from the High Seas Fleet to strengthen the powers in the Baltic. The boats started to make diversionary assaults to help the German Army's battle to retake Memel; "Prinz Adalbert" bolstered one such task, a strike of the II Scouting Group into the Bothnian Sea to assault Russian dealer sending on 23 March. The next day, the boats from the High Seas Fleet were reviewed toward the North Sea, disregarding Behring's cruisers indeed.
