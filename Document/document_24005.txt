The highways in the system range in length from the unsigned Business Spur Interstate 375 (BSÂ I-375) at and signed M-212 at to I-75 at . Some trunklines in Michigan are maintained by MDOT but bear no signage along the route to indicate so. These unsigned trunklines are mostly segments of former highway designations that have been moved or decommissioned. They remain under state control until their respective city or county accepts jurisdiction of the roadway from the state.
Highways in the state maintained by MDOT range from two-lane rural highways up to 12-lane freeways. In addition to the Interstates, other trunklines are built to freeway standards. Sections of USÂ 10, USÂ 23, USÂ 31, USÂ 127 and USÂ 131 have been upgraded to freeway standards. All or part of several state trunklines are also freeways. In the Metro Detroit area, M-5, M-8 (Davison Freeway), M-10 (Lodge Freeway), M-14, M-39 (Southfield Freeway), M-53 (Van Dyke Freeway), and M-59 have such sections. In the rest of the state, M-6 near Grand Rapids, Conn. M-13 near Bay City, M-47 near Midland, M-60 near Jackson, and Bus. USÂ 131 near Kalamazoo are also freeways, for all or part of their respective lengths. Sections of USÂ 12, M-20, M-37, M-46, M-55, M-66 and USÂ 223 have been routed to run concurrently with other freeways as well.
