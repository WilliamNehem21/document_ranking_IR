Williston named various other new "Elasmosaurus" species in his 1906 modification. In 1874 he and Mudge found an example in Plum Creek, Kansas. While he at first doled out it in 1890 to another types of "Cimoliasaurus", "C.snowii", he along these lines perceived the elasmosaurid idea of its humerus and coracoids. In this manner, he renamed the species "E.snowii". A second example, found by Elias West in 1890, was additionally allocated by him to "E.snowii". In 1943 Welles moved "E.snowii" to its own class, "Styxosaurus", where the species has remained. Be that as it may, the West example was doled out to "Thalassiosaurus ischiadicus" (see beneath) by Welles in 1952; Carpenter returned it to "S.snowii" in 1999. Williston additionally reassigned the species "E.ischiadicus" from the sort "Polycotylus", where he had at first put it when he named it in 1903. The sort remains were found by him in the equivalent 1874 endeavor with Mudge. Williston alluded another example found by Mudge and H.A. Brous in 1876. In 1943 the two examples were alluded to the new class "Thalassiosaurus" by Welles, who at that point doled out the last to the new variety and species "Alzadasaurus kansasensis" in 1952. Glenn Storrs believed both to be vague elasmosaurids in 1999; around the same time, Carpenter appointed both to "Styxosaurus snowii".
