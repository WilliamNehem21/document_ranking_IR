The saxaul sparrow was first portrayed by English zoologist John Gould in a March 1872 portion of "The Birds of Asia", from an example gathered close Kyzylorda, presently in southern Kazakhstan, by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov. Severtzov had been intending to depict the species as "Passer ammodendri" for quite a while and had been circulating examples among different naturalists. At the point when common history vendor Charles Dode got away from the Paris Commune in 1871 with a portion of his accumulation, Gould got examples from a lot of uncommon winged creatures Dode showed to the Zoological Society of London. Severtzov did not depict the species until 1873, and some later journalists liked to property him, yet Gould's portrayal takes need over Severtzov's. The saxaul sparrow's species name alludes to its desert natural surroundings, originating from the name of the "Ammodendron" or sand acacia tree, which is thus gotten from the Ancient Greek "ÃÂ¬ÃÂ¼ÃÂ¼ÃÂ¿ÃÂ" ("munitions", "sand") and "ÃÂ´ÃÂ­ÃÂ½ÃÂ´ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂ½" ("dendron", "tree"). The English name "saxaul sparrow" alludes to the saxaul plant, with which it is intently related. The saxaul sparrow for the most part is ordered in the class "Passer" with the house sparrow and around twenty different species, despite the fact that a family "Ammopasser" was made for the saxaul sparrow by Nikolai Zarudny in 1890.
