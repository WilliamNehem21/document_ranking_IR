Jackson was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1Â July 1941. By now his younger brother Ed had been posted to No.Â 3 Squadron and was serving with him in Palestine. With the campaign in Syria concluding in mid-July, the unit undertook no operations in August and personnel went on leave before returning to action in Egypt the next month. The rural-bred Jackson took to the night life in Alexandria, but his stay at a first-class hotel left him bewildered as to the purpose of the room's bidet, which he eventually determined was "some feminine arrangement". Peter Ewer, in "Storm Over Kokoda", observed: "There was something of the patrician about John Jackson, but his well-to-do background had a distinctly Australian tinge to it. He liked a game of cards, with a bet on the outcome." In "Whispering Death", Mark Johnston noted that although "tall and blue-eyed", he "did not have the air of a 'boy's own' or movie star pilot", but rather was "balding, ambling and no extrovert". Jackson returned to Australia in November 1941. He was mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his "marked keenness and determination" during operations with No.Â 3 Squadron in the Middle East. The former award was promulgated in the "London Gazette" on 1Â January 1942 and the latter, which listed him as "John Henry Jackson", on 7Â April. The DFC was presented to Jackson's widow Elisabeth, after his death.
