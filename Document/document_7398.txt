The Yankees won the AL East by 11 amusements over Baltimore, verifying their first postseason appearance since 1964. In the 1976 American League Championship Series, they played Kansas City. Forceful baserunning, in addition to seat maneuvering that may have caused Royals third baseman George Brett to make two essential blunders, helped New York win Game One, however Kansas City won two of the following three. Martin's decision of Ed Figueroa to pitch the definitive Game Five at Yankee Stadium was questionable as Figueroa had not contributed well late the season and had lost Game Two, however he was in great structure and helped the Yankees to a 6Ã¢ÂÂ 3 lead in the eighth inningÃ¢ÂÂwhen Brett tied the amusement with a three-run grand slam. Martin did not give the grand slam a chance to upset him, and had a verbal trade with the following hitter, John Mayberry, which helped wake the Yankees up from their shocked skepticism at Brett's homer. Yankee first baseman Chris Chambliss drove the main pitch of the base of the ninth over the correct field divider, and the Yankees had their first flag since 1964, and Martin his first as a chief. The Yankees confronted the safeguarding title holder Reds in the 1976 World Series, and lost in four straight recreations. Martin was shot out from Game Four, at Yankee Stadium, subsequent to rolling a baseball towards umpire Bruce Froemming, the main Yankee to be kicked out of a World Series diversion.
