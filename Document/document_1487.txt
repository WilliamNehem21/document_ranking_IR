The next year Wurtenburg moved into his previous position at quarterback. He took the beginning spot and turned into a pioneer of the group. Wurtenburg built up his own special style at quarterback, routinely endeavoring "long, low, underhand goes" to his colleagues to help set up scoring plays. That year, the Yale group shut out each and every one of its rivals and was later perceived as a national boss. In the meantime, Wurtenburg played on the school's baseball crew, where he would routinely score three or four runs a diversion. In September of his graduating year, 1889, Wurtenburg reported that he would enter the Sheffield Scientific School. At the Exeter Club's first yearly dinner, held that year, Wurtenburg was approached to display a toast to speak to the club's games. In 1890, he filled in as the co-editorial manager of "The Yale Banner", one of the school's yearbooks. Wurtenburg played his last period of football at the college in 1891, after evidently surrendering his spot in the group following the 1889 season. Be that as it may, he was tossed out of the last round of the period, against Princeton, and Frank Barbour was given an ensured beginning quarterback space for the remainder of the time Wurtenburg was at Yale. Wurtenburg graduated in 1893, when he got his Doctorate in Medicine (M.D.).
