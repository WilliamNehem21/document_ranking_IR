The climate was poor amid the 1907 season, bringing about a progression of pitches which fit turn bowling and were hard to bat on. In these conditions, Hirst scored less keeps running than in the past season. He didn't score a century, making 1,321 keeps running at 28.71, and the pervasive sort of pitches did not suit his bowling pace with the goal that he took less wickets. All things considered, he was the second most elevated wicket-taker in the season and came fifth in the bowling midpoints, with 183 wickets at 15.29. Hirst remained a first-decision individual from the Test group, playing every one of the three matches against South Africa that mid year in an arrangement which England won 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0, with the other two amusements drawn. Albeit fruitless with the bat, accomplishing 46 keeps running in five innings with a top-score of 17, in a low-scoring second Test, Hirst was one of only a handful few batsmen to deal with the googlies of Aubrey Faulkner. As a bowler he took 10 wickets at 18.50; of these wickets, six were in the last match of the arrangement. Yorkshire won the County Championship again amid the 1908 season. Hirst finished another twofold, scoring 1,598 keeps running at 38.97 and taking 174 wickets at 14.05, however was not chosen for some other agent recreations until the finish of the period. Be that as it may, he declined a challenge to visit Australia with the MCC group in 1907Ã¢ÂÂ 08.
