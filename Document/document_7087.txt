As a dominatingly Gaelic culture, most Scottish social practices all through this period reflected intently those of Ireland, or if nothing else those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-talking lords presented social practices prominent in Anglo-Norman England, France and somewhere else. As in all pre-present day social orders, narrating was prevalent. The English researcher D. D. R. Owen, who has some expertise in the writing of this time, composes that "Proficient storytellers would carry out their specialty from court to court. Some of them would have been local Scots, almost certainly offering legends from the antiquated Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when suitable, however in French for the majority of the new respectability". Practically these accounts are lost, albeit some have descended in the Gaelic or Scots oral convention. One type of oral culture incredibly very much represented in this period is lineage. There are many Scottish family histories making due from this period, covering everybody from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray to the Scottish lord himself. Scotland's rulers kept up an "ollamh righe", an imperial high writer who had a changeless spot in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose design was to discuss family histories when required, for events, for example, crowning rituals.
