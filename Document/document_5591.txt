"Miniopterus griveaudi" is a little, dull darker "Miniopterus" species. "M.ÃÂ aelleni" is comparable in shading, yet "M.ÃÂ manavi" is darker and "M.ÃÂ brachytragos" and "M.ÃÂ mahafaliensis" are lighter. The upperparts are once in a while rosy dark colored; this shading variation happens more regularly in the Comoro populaces than on Madagascar. In the Comoros, singular states or gatherings now and again comprise only of one shading variation, however there is no evident hereditary separation between the two structures. The head is normally to some degree lighter than the body and the hairs of the underparts have buffish tips. The tragus (a projection on the inward side of the external ear) is straight and restricted and finishes in an adjusted tip. Different species have distinctively molded tragi. The wing film is likewise dark colored, yet the uropatagium (tail layer) is lighter. The wing film and uropatagium are joined to the upper leg at a similar dimension, close to the lower leg. The uropatagium is meagerly secured with dainty hairs that are for all intents and purposes imperceptible to the exposed eye. Interestingly, "M.ÃÂ manavi", "M.ÃÂ mahafaliensis", and "M.ÃÂ brachytragos" have thickly secured uropatagia and that of "M.ÃÂ aelleni" is inadequately, however obviously haired. There are a few contrasts in estimations among the island populaces; creatures from Grande Comore are commonly littlest, those from Anjouan are halfway, and those from Madagascar are biggest.
