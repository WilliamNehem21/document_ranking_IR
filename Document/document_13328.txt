At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser and three destroyers shelled the Lunga edge for 20 minutes and enlightened the edge with a searchlight. Japanese ordnance started shelling the Marine lines, yet did little harm. In the meantime, dissipated gatherings of Kawaguchi's troops started skirmishing with Marines around the edge. Kawaguchi's first BattalionÃ¢ÂÂdriven by Major Yukichi KokushoÃ¢ÂÂassaulted the Raider's "C" organization between the tidal pond and the Lunga River, overwhelming something like one unit and constraining the Marine organization to fall back to the edge. Kokusho's unit wound up snared with troops from Kawaguchi's third Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were all the while attempting to achieve their assault positions, and the subsequent perplexity adequately halted the Japanese assault on the edge that night. Kawaguchi, who was experiencing difficulty finding where he was in connection to the U.S. Marine lines just as planning his troops' assaults, later whined, "Because of the mischievous wilderness, the unit was dissipated all finished and was totally outside my ability to control. In my entire life I have never felt so disillusioned and vulnerable." Twelve U.S. Marines were executed; Japanese setbacks are obscure however maybe to some degree more noteworthy. Albeit both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east endeavored to assault the Marine lines that night, they neglected to reach and stopped close to the Marine lines at day break.
