Aldrin, a Presbyterian senior, was the sole individual to hold a religious function on the Moon. He radioed Earth: "I'd like to accept this open door to ask each individual tuning in, whoever and wherever they might be, to take a breather and think about the occasions of the previous couple of hours, and to express appreciation in his or her own particular manner." Using a unit given to him by his minister, he took communion, yet he kept it mystery in light of a claim over the perusing of Genesis on Apollo 8. In 1970 he remarked: "It was fascinating to feel that the absolute first fluid at any point poured on the Moon, and the principal sustenance eaten there, were fellowship components." On appearance in his 2009 book, Aldrin felt that "Maybe, on the off chance that I had it to do over once more, I would not praise fellowship. Despite the fact that it was a profoundly important encounter for me, it was a Christian holy observance, and we had gone to the Moon for the sake of all humankind Ã¢ÂÂ be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, freethinkers, or agnostics. Be that as it may, at the time I could think about no better method to recognize the monstrosity of the Apollo 11 experience than by expressing gratefulness to God."
