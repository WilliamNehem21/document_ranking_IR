There was struggle at the Mint among Pistrucci and William Wyon, that occasionally included Merlen. As indicated by Graham Pollard in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", "Pistrucci's personality did not cultivate great relations with his partners at the mint; the uncertainty of his situation there was developed by a convulsive yet unpleasant battle directed through the papers by his partisans and those of William Wyon." Pistrucci spoke to each new Master of the Mint for arrangement to the post of boss etcher. In 1828, the occupant Master, George Tierney, worked a trade off that fulfilled nobody. Wyon was named as boss etcher, and Pistrucci as boss medallist, with the pay rates of the main two etching positions separated between them. Of Pistrucci's compensation of ÃÂ£350, ÃÂ£50 was restrictive on his preparation a student. Pistrucci in progression named two of his children, yet the recompense was ceased after 1830 as it had become known that each lived abroad, and one was not a British subject as was ineligible for normal Mint business. Pistrucci's comprehension of the course of action was that he would make such awards as may be requested by government divisions, with every decoration a different charge notwithstanding the yearly compensation.
