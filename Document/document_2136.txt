Consistently breaking down relations between Matthew Kantakouzenos, who currently governed eastern Thrace, and John V Palaiologos, who had assumed control over Matthew's previous space in western Thrace, prompted one more interior clash. Open fighting broke out in 1352, when John V, upheld by Venetian and Turkish troops, propelled an assault on Matthew Kantakouzenos. John Kantakouzenos went to his child's guide with 10,000 Ottoman troops who retook the urban communities of Thrace, generously looting them all the while. In October 1352, at Demotika, the Ottoman power met and crushed 4,000 Serbs gave to John V by Stefan DuÃÂ¡an. This was the Ottomans' first triumph in Europe and an unfavorable omen. After two years their catch of Gallipoli denoted the start of the Ottoman victory of the Balkans, which finished a century later in the Fall of Constantinople. In the mean time, John V fled to the island of Tenedos, from where he made an ineffective endeavor to catch Constantinople in March 1353. John VI Kantakouzenos reacted by having Matthew delegated as co-sovereign, however John V Palaiologos, enrolling Genoese help and depending on the declining ubiquity of Kantakouzenos, prevailing with regards to entering the capital in November 1354. John VI surrendered and resigned to a religious community. Matthew held out in Thrace until 1357, when he also surrendered, leaving John V Palaiologos as the sole ace of a back end state.
