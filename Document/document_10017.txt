One of the soonest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic "Mahabharata" (written in the fourth century BC, yet said to portray occasions between the eleventh and eighth hundreds of years BC). They were not utilized as much as steed drawn chariots by either the Pandavas or Kauravas. Amid the Magadha Kingdom (which started in the sixth century BC), elephants started to accomplish more noteworthy social significance than steeds, and later Indian kingdoms utilized war elephants broadly; 3,000 of them were utilized in the Nandas (fifth and fourth hundreds of years BC) armed force while 9,000 may have been utilized in the Mauryan armed force (between the fourth and second hundreds of years BC). The "Arthashastra" (composed around 300 BC) exhorted the Mauryan government to save a few timberlands for wild elephants for use in the military, and to execute any individual who murdered them. From South Asia, the utilization of elephants in fighting spread west to Persia and east to Southeast Asia. The Persians utilized them amid the Achaemenid Empire (between the sixth and fourth hundreds of years BC) while Southeast Asian states initially utilized war elephants perhaps as right on time as the fifth century BC and proceeded to the twentieth century.
