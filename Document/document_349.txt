The setting, mythos and scene were fundamentally roused by the legends of Northern Europe, while different components drew from Japanese-style revisionism. As indicated by Shiba, numerous components of the story and world were made to be dull, tragic and genuine in tone, rather than any semblance of "Winged serpent Quest" and "Last Fantasy". One of the center account strings, including sentimental emotions between kin, was enlivened in Yoko's psyche by the anime arrangement "Sister Princess". Another arrangement that motivated the group was "Neon Genesis Evangelion", with an examination being attracted between them because of a common quality: while having standard premises, darker story components were covered up in its substance. The focal account topic was "Shamelessness", which was for the most part exhibited by essayist Sawako Natori through the characters. Numerous endings were made in light of the fact that Yoko was informed that the amusement would not have a spin-off. The characters' accounts were made by Yoko and Iwasaki, who freely made the character foundations: Yoko assumed responsibility for Seere, Leonard and Arioch, while Iwasaki was engaged with creating Verdelet, Inuart and Caim. In a meeting concerning her job in the amusement, Natori confessed to feeling humiliated by her composition when hearing Sota Murakami and Natsuki Yamashita, who voiced Seere and Manah, talk their lines.
