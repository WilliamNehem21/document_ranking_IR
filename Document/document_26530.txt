Martill and his team originally classified "Irritator" as a maniraptoran dinosaur in the clade Bullatosauria (a group no longer considered monophyletic), as a close relative to the feathered ornithomimosaurs and troodontids. Given that its dental morphology, particularly long snout, and assumed fin-shaped crest were features unknown in "other" maniraptorans, the researchers erected the new family Irritatoridae within the clade. They recognized "Irritator"s affinities with "Spinosaurus", in that they both had similarly shaped and unserrated teeth, but noted that the latter's mandible would not conform with the front of "Irritator"s upper jaw, and that other non-avian dinosaurs like "Compsognathus" and "Ornitholestes" also bore no serrations on some or all of their teeth. Some of these claims were questioned in 1996 by Kellner who found that "Irritator"s skull lacked the one autapomorphy (distinguishing feature) diagnosed in maniraptorans at the time, which was having its (cheek) bone forming part of the antorbital fenestra. He also pointed out that since "Irritator challengeri"s holotype lacked the tip of its snout, it would not be possible to know if "Spinosaurus"s dentary could complement it or not. Based on comparisons with "Spinosaurus", Kellner resolved "Irritator" as a spinosaurid and synonymized Irritatoridae with that family. "Irritator" was then assigned to the Baryonychidae along with "Angaturama", "Baryonyx", "Suchomimus," and "Spinosaurus" by Oliver W. M. Rauhut in 2003. Thomas Holtz and colleagues in 2004 considered the Baryonychidae synonymous with Spinosauridae, and moved these genera to the latter family. Most later revisions have upheld these classifications. As spinosaurids, "Irritator" and "Angaturama" are placed within the superfamily Megalosauroidea, with Spinosauridae being a possible sister taxon to the Megalosauridae.
