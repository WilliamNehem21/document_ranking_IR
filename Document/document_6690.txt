Steller's ocean bovines developed to be long as grown-ups, a lot bigger than surviving sirenians. Georg Steller's works contain two conflicting appraisals of weight: . The genuine esteem is assessed to fall between these figures, at about . This size made the ocean bovine one of the biggest well evolved creatures of the Holocene age, alongside whales. The ocean dairy animals' huge size was likely an adjustment to lessen its surface zone to-volume proportion and preserve heat. In contrast to different sirenians, Steller's ocean cow was decidedly light, implying that it was unfit to totally submerge. It had a thick external skin, , to keep damage from sharp shakes and ice and potentially to keep unsubmerged skin from drying out. The ocean dairy animals' fat was thick, another adjustment to the sub zero atmosphere of the Bering Sea. Its skin was tanish dark, with white fixes on certain people. It was smooth along its back and harsh on its sides, with cavity like despondencies in all probability brought about by parasites. This unpleasant surface prompted the creature's being nicknamed the "bark creature". Hair on its body was meager, however the internal parts of the ocean dairy animals' flippers were shrouded in fibers. The fore appendages were generally long, and the tail fluke was forked.
