The majority of the records of the Mayfield Convention were lost, probably in a flame that decimated the town hall in 1864. The most broad enduring record originates from the notes of James Beadles, a Unionist spectator of the procedures. After various talks were conveyed, a larger part advisory group led by Paducah circuit judge James Campbell displayed a report containing seven goals. The goals announced the locale's compassion for the South, despite the fact that it swore to maintain Kentucky's present approach of lack of bias. It denounced President Lincoln for pursuing a vile war, and commended Governor Beriah Magoffin for rejecting Lincoln's call for troops. The report likewise denounced the government for outfitting Union sympathizers in the state with purported "Lincoln weapons". A minority advisory group report was given by Ballard County inhabitant and future U.S. Delegate Oscar Turner. This report called Kentucky's lack of bias "purposeless" and "fainthearted," guaranteed to ward off any intrusion by the North, and prescribed calling for help from Tennessee and the Confederate States in case of such an attack. It further cautioned that if the whole state did not embrace this position, the Purchase district would withdraw and adjust itself to Tennessee.
