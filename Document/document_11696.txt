There have been numerous theories that have endeavored to clarify why lemurs display female social strength while different primates with comparable social structures don't, however no agreement has been come to following quite a while of research. The prevailing perspective in the writing states that female strength is an invaluable attribute given the mind-boggling expenses of multiplication and the shortage of assets accessible. To be sure, female predominance has been appeared to be connected to expanded maternal venture. In any case, when regenerative expenses and extraordinary regularity of assets were thought about crosswise over primates, different primates exhibited male strength under conditions that were like or more testing than those looked by lemurs. In 2008, another speculation reconsidered this model utilizing straightforward amusement hypothesis. It was contended that when two people were similarly coordinated in battling limit, the one with the most need would win the contention since it would have the most to lose. Subsequently, the female, with higher asset requirements for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal consideration, was bound to win in asset clashes with similarly estimated guys. This, in any case, expected monomorphism between genders. The next year, another speculation was proposed to clarify monomorphism, expressing that on the grounds that most female lemurs are just explicitly responsive for multi day or two every year, guys can use a progressively latent type of mate guarding: copulatory attachments, which obstruct the female conceptive tract, keeping different guys from effectively mating with her, and accordingly diminishing the requirement for animosity and the developmental drive for sexual dimorphism.
