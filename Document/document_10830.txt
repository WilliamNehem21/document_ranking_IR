Huge flooding was accounted for in that state, alongside high breezes that left territories without power. A sum of 49 houses were seriously harmed, 2 were pulverized, and by and large more than 100 were influenced. In Kennebunkport, the tempest extinguished windows and overwhelmed the summer home of then-President George H. W. Hedge. The home supported noteworthy harm to its first floor. In Portland, tides were better than average, among the ten most elevated tides since record-keeping started in 1914. Along the coast, harm was more terrible than that brought about by Hurricane Bob two months earlier. Crosswise over Maine, the tempest left $7.9 million (1991 USD) in harm, for the most part in York County. The greater part of the harm all out was from property harm, with the rest of transportation, seawalls, and open offices. Despite the fact that there were no passings, there were two wounds in the state. In neighboring New Hampshire, beach front flooding influenced a few towns, devastating two homes. The tempest decimated three water crafts and harmed a beacon. High waves devastated or cleared away more than 50,000 lobster traps, speaking to $2 million in misfortunes (1991 USD).
