Bede, in his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum", says of Penda that he was "a most warlike man of the royal race of the Mercians" and that, following Edwin of Northumbria's defeat in 633 ("see" below), he ruled the Mercians for 22 years with varying fortune. The noted 20th-century historian Frank Stenton was of the opinion that the language used by Bede "leaves no doubt that ... Penda, though descended from the royal family of the Mercians, only became their king after Edwin's defeat". The "Historia Brittonum" accords Penda a reign of only ten years, perhaps dating it from the time of the Battle of Maserfield ("see" below) around 642, although according to the generally accepted chronology this would still be more than ten years. Given the apparent problems with the dates given by the "Chronicle" and the "Historia", Bede's account of the length of Penda's reign is generally considered the most plausible by historians. Nicholas Brooks noted that, since these three accounts of the length of Penda's reign come from three different sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are West Saxon, Northumbrian, and Welsh), they may merely reflect the times at which their respective peoples first had military involvement with Penda.
