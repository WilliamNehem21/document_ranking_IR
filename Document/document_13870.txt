Currie has additionally estimated on the pack-chasing propensities for "Albertosaurus". The leg extents of the littler people were tantamount to those of ornithomimids, which were most likely among the quickest dinosaurs. More youthful "Albertosaurus" were most likely similarly armada footed, or if nothing else quicker than their prey. Currie conjectured that the more youthful individuals from the pack may have been in charge of driving their prey towards the grown-ups, who were bigger and all the more dominant, yet additionally slower. Adolescents may likewise have had unexpected ways of life in comparison to grown-ups, filling predator specialties between the tremendous grown-ups and the littler contemporaneous theropods, the biggest of which were two requests of greatness littler than grown-up "Albertosaurus" in mass. A comparable circumstance is seen in present day Komodo mythical beasts, with hatchlings starting life as little insectivores before developing to turn into the predominant predators on their islands. Nonetheless, as the safeguarding of conduct in the fossil record is exceedingly uncommon, these thoughts can't promptly be tried. In 2010, Currie, however as yet supporting the chasing pack theory, conceded that the fixation could have been realized by different causes, for example, a gradually rising water level amid an all-encompassing flood.
