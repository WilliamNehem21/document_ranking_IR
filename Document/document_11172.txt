The film got positive audits from commentators, especially for crafted by its specialized group. In 2006, W.ÃÂ Chandrakanth of "The Hindu" composed: The enormity of the executive falsehoods hereÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ he effectively diminishes all characters to normal humans showing every one of the indiscretions of individuals aside from Ghatothkacha or Krishna. And afterward he infuses into the Yadava family unit a Telugu climate, full with its comparison, symbolism, aphorism, mockery and mind. The resultÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a blowout for the eyes and soul. That is "Mayabazar" for you. Vijaysree Venkatraman composed for "The Hindu" in 2008 that the "embellishments in this current summer's Hollywood superhuman films were fabulous, at the same time, for me, the fanciful hasn't lost any of its enchantment", including, "If viewing the pleasant half-evil spirit finish a wedding feast without any assistance remains a treat, seeing the eager couple from the husband to be's side get whacked on the other hand by the furnishings and the wilful rug has me in parts". "The Hindu" film pundit M.ÃÂ L. Narasimham expressed: "However there were a few motion picture forms in different Indian dialects, the 1957 Vijaya Productions' "Mayabazar" is as yet thought about the best for its inside and out greatness". As indicated by "The Times of India", "With an amazing cast and a solid content, this motion picture is a stealer. Savitri, NTR [N. T. Rama Rao], ANR [Akkineni Nageswara Rao], SVÃÂ Rangarao and also Suryakantam add layers to their characters. Obviously, the language and the exchanges, basically brilliant. A portion of the scenes are just comical."
