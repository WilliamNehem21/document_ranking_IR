At the point when the group reacted by provoking the warriors as "idiotic executioners", the troops fixed knifes to their firearms and put on gas veils before charging at the protestors and tossing poisonous gas projectiles at them. A portion of the demonstrators fled, while others stayed stationary and started supplicating. Passings and wounds were turned away when a Buddhist head encouraged the protestors to either withdraw to a pagoda and get restorative treatment for the poisonous gas or to return home. At the point when the passage to the pagoda was hindered with security fencing, some protestors just sat on the ground and kept asking. After a standoff enduring just about three hours, troops wearing gas veils coercively scattered the group. The circumstance was more regrettable in HuÃ¡ÂºÂ¿, where DiÃ¡Â»Âm had restricted showings and requested his powers to capture the individuals who occupied with common defiance. At 13:00, somewhere in the range of 1,500 protestors endeavored to walk towards the TÃ¡Â»Â« ÃÂÃÂ m Pagoda in HuÃ¡ÂºÂ¿ for a rally, having assembled at the BÃ¡ÂºÂ¿n NgÃÂ° Bridge close to the Perfume River. A showdown resulted when the protestors endeavored to cross the scaffold. Six floods of ARVN poisonous gas and assault hounds neglected to scatter the group.
