The horned dinosaurs found by Horner exemplified this wonder. In the most minimal layers of the Two Medicine Formation, beneath the overlaying Bearpaw Formation, "Transitional Taxon A" was available. It was by all accounts indistinguishable to "Styracosaurus albertensis", just contrasting from it in the ownership of only a solitary pair of parietal spikes. The center layers, beneath the Bearpaw, contained "Transitional Taxon B" that additionally had a solitary spike pair however varied as its nasal horn that bended to the front over the foremost parts of the nasal bones. In the upper strata, underneath the Bearpaw, "Transitional Taxon C" had been uncovered. It also had a spike pair however at this point the nasal horn was melded with the front branches. The upper surface of the horn was raised and unpleasant. The orbital horns indicated coarse edges. Today, "Taxon A" has been named "Rubeosaurus", "Taxon B" has progressed toward becoming "Einiosaurus", while "Taxon C" is "Achelousaurus". In 1992, Horner et al. did not name these as species for the unequivocal reason that the whole transformative succession was viewed as speaking to an evaluation of transitional ceratopsians between "Styracosaurus albertensis", known from the Judith River Formation, and the determined, hornless "Pachyrhinosaurus" from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which had the spike pair and managers on the nose or more the eyes, just as extra ruffle ornamentation. In 1997, Horner alluded to the three taxa as "centrosaurine 1.", "centrosaurine 2." and "centrosaurine 3.".
