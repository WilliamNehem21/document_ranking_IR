"Faryl" was recorded in London amid Smith's Christmas occasion amid December 2008 and January 2009, and finished on 3 January. It includes a 60-piece symphony, which was recorded at Air Studios, in London. The collection incorporates the tune "Stream of Light". The track is an account of "The Blue Danube", a three step dance formed by Johann Strauss II, with recently composed verses. Smith discussed "Waterway of Light" to the press, saying that "The Blue Danube" "presently has words put to it. I like it since it's unique. Everybody knows the tune and everyone has got high trusts in it." Smith said that her main tune on the collection was her rendition of the Welsh psalm "Calon LÃÂ¢n". Different melodies incorporate Smith's form of "Astounding Grace", a front of "Annie's Song" by John Denver, and a variant of "The Way Old Friends Do", modified for Smith by BjÃÂ¶rn Ulvaeus. Smith talked about the tune, saying "It was about separation ... They didn't think it was proper for me to sing about that, so BjÃÂ¶rn changed the verses so it's about fellowship." The collection was created by Jon Cohen, who has recently worked with craftsmen including the Operababes and Vanessa Mae.
