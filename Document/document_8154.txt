Procter's notoriety proceeded after her demise; the main volume of "Legends and Lyrics" experienced 19 versions by 1881, and the second through 14 releases by that year. A large number of her lyrics were made into songs or generally set to music. Among these was "The Lost Chord", which Arthur Sullivan set to music in 1877; this tune was the most industrially fruitful of the 1880s in both Britain and the United States. Her work was likewise distributed in the United States and converted into German. By 1938, Procter's notoriety had fallen so far that a reading material could specify her sonnets just to articulate them "moronic, trifling and not deserving of the subject". Commentators, for example, Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall contend that the death of Procter's notoriety is expected at any rate to a limited extent to the manner in which Charles Dickens described her as a "display white collar class local holy messenger" and a "delicate and unobtrusive holy person" as opposed to as a "functioning women's activist and solid artist." Emma Mason contends that despite the fact that Dickens' depiction of Procter "smothered current enthusiasm" in her, it additionally "has helped salvage Procter from the sort of unending guess about her private life that has confounded investigations of ladies like Letitia Landon."
