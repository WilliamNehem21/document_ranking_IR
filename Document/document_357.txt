George's building taste moved throughout the years. As a young fellow, he supported Classical, specifically Palladian styles, yet the lord came to support an increasingly Gothic style, both as an outcome of the Palladian style getting to be abused and ineffectively executed, and on the grounds that the Gothic structure had come to be viewed as a progressively legit, national style of English plan in the light of the French upheaval. Working with the planner James Wyatt, George endeavored to "change the outside of the structures in the Upper Ward into a Gothic royal residence, while holding the character of the Hugh May state rooms". The outside of the structure was restyled with Gothic highlights, including new bulwarks and turrets. Inside, protection work was embraced, and a few new rooms developed, including another Gothic staircase to supplant May's seventeenth century rendition, complete with the Grand Vestibule roof above it. New works of art were acquired for the manor, and accumulations from other illustrious royal residences moved there by the lord. The expense of the work came to over ÃÂ£150,000 (ÃÂ£100ÃÂ million in 2008 terms). The lord attempted broad work in the stronghold's Great Park too, spreading out the new Norfolk and Flemish homesteads, making two dairies and reestablishing Virginia Water Lake, and its cave and habits.
