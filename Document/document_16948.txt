In the first animated version of "D.Gray-man" Allen is voiced by Sanae Kobayashi, whom Hoshino praised for capturing the character. During recording of the anime, Kobayashi befriended the Earl's voice actor Junpei Takiguchi as they chatted whenever their characters were absent from a recording, much to Hoshino's surprise. For its anime sequel, "D.Gray-man Hallow", Kobayashi was replaced with Ayumu Murase. Murase said he had positive thoughts about his work, hoping it would appeal to the audience. During recordings of "Hallow", Hoshino was surprised by Murase's work, finding him suitable for Allen. Murase's switching between two personalitiesâAllen and the Nea D. Campbellâimpressed the manga author, who thought at first Murase was using a machine to change the tone of them. Although Murase only appeared with the Millennium Earl twice in "Hallow", his job left a positive impression. During a broadcast of "Hallow", Hoshino made multiple illustrations of Allen interacting with the Noah clan to support the actors. Murase was moved by Hoshino's determination to develop Allen in the manga and thus felt a better impression of his character. Allen is voiced by Todd Haberkorn for the two series' English-language dubs; according to Haberkorn, he enjoyed voicing the character, and once cosplayed as him. In 2016, Haberkorn said that if he could voice Allen again he would pierce his ears.
