While Cranmer was finishing Charles Italy, he got a regal letter dated 1 October 1532 educating him that he had been named the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the demise of diocese supervisor William Warham. Cranmer was requested to come back to England. The arrangement had been verified by the group of Anne Boleyn, who was being pursued by Henry. At the point when Cranmer's advancement wound up known in London, it caused incredible amazement as Cranmer had recently held just minor positions in the Church. Cranmer left Mantua on 19 November and touched base in England toward the start of January. Henry actually financed the ecclesiastical bulls vital for Cranmer's advancement to Canterbury. The bulls were effectively obtained in light of the fact that the ecclesiastical nuncio was compelled from Rome to satisfy the English with an end goal to keep a last rupture. The bulls touched base around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was blessed as a religious administrator on 30 March in St Stephen's Chapel, by John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln; John Vesey, Bishop of Exeter; and Henry Standish, Bishop of St Asaph. Indeed, even while they were hanging tight for the bulls, Cranmer kept on taking a shot at the cancellation procedures, which required more noteworthy criticalness after Anne declared her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were furtively hitched on 24 or 25 January 1533 within the sight of a bunch of observers. Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until a fortnight after 14 days.
