In spite of the fact that there is minimal chronicled proof with respect to Point duSable's life before the 1770s, there are a few speculations and legends that give records of his initial life. Writing in 1933, Quaife distinguished a French outsider to Canada, Pierre Dandonneau, who procured the title "Sieur deSable" and whose relatives were known by both the names "Dandonneau" and "DuSable". Quaife was unfit to locate an immediate connect to Point duSable, however he recognized relatives of Pierre Dandonneau living around the Great Lakes locale in Detroit, Mackinac, and St.Joseph, driving him to estimate that Point duSable's dad was an individual from this family, while his mom was a slave. In 1951 Joseph Jeremie, a local of Haiti, distributed a leaflet in which he said he was the incredible grandson of Point duSable. In view of family memories and gravestone engravings he asserted that Point duSable was conceived in Saint-Marc in Haiti, considered in France, and came back to Haiti to bargain in espresso before heading out to French Louisiana. History specialist and Point duSable biographer John F. Swenson has called these cases "intricate, undocumented attestations... in a whimsical account". In 1953 Shirley Graham based on crafted by Quaife and Jeremie in a recorded novel about Point duSable that she portrayed as "not precise history nor unadulterated fiction", but instead "an inventive understanding of all the well established actualities". This book exhibited Point duSable as the child of the mate on a privateer dispatch, the "Dark Sea Gull", and a liberated slave called Suzanne. Regardless of absence of proof and the proceeded with discussion about Point duSable's initial life, parentage, and origin, this prevalent story is generally exhibited as being authoritative.
