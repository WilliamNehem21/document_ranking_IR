The scene happens in Hog Lane, some portion of the ghetto area of St Giles with the congregation of St Giles in the Fields out of sight. Hogarth would highlight St Giles again as the foundation of "Gin Lane" and "First Stage of Cruelty". The image indicates Huguenots leaving the French Church in what is currently Soho. The Huguenot outcasts had touched base during the 1680s and built up themselves as tradesmen and craftsmans, especially in the silk exchange; and the French Church was their ahead of everyone else of love. Hogarth differentiates their particularity and high design with the carelessness of the gathering on the opposite side of the street; the decaying cadaver of a feline that has been battered to the point of death lying in the canal that isolates the road is the main thing the opposite sides share for all intents and purpose. The more seasoned individuals from the assemblage wear customary dress, while the more youthful individuals wear the styles of the day. The youngsters are spruced up as grown-ups: the kid in the closer view swaggers around in his delicacy while the kid with his back to the watcher has his hair in a net, sacked up in the "French" style.
