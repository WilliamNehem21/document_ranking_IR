The Ferrara post had been developed in the sixteenth century by Pope Paul V, worked in the style of the Trace italienne, or a star, and it straddled the southwest corner of the town's fortresses. The fortification offered whoever had it a key point in the area: it was the lynch-stick of the French barrier. In spring 1799, it was directed by Chef-de-detachment Lapointe with an army of near 2,500. On 15 April, Klenau moved toward the post and mentioned its capitulation. The administrator cannot. Klenau barred the city, leaving a little gathering of mounted guns and troops to proceed with the attack. For the following three days, Klenau watched the field, catching the encompassing vital purposes of Lagoscuro, Borgoforte and the Mirandola fortification. The blockaded army made a few forays from the Saint Paul's Gate, which were spurned by the guerilla laborers. The French endeavored two salvages of the ambushed post: In the first, on 24 April, a power of 400 Modenese was repelled at Mirandola. In the second, General Montrichard attempted to raise the city barricade by progressing with a power of 4,000. At long last, toward the month's end, a segment of Pierre-Augustin Hulin came to and resupplied the fortification.
