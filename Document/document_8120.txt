"Smilodon" was around the span of present day huge felines, however was all the more vigorously manufactured. It had a decreased lumbar district, high scapula, short tail, and wide appendages with moderately short feet. "Smilodon" is most well known for its generally long canine teeth, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed felines, at about long in the biggest species, "S. populator". The canines were thin and had fine serrations on the front and posterior. The skull was vigorously proportioned and the gag was short and wide. The cheek bones (zygomata) were profound and broadly curved, the sagittal peak was conspicuous, and the frontal district was somewhat raised. The mandible had a rib on each side of the front. The upper incisors were expansive, sharp, and inclined advances. There was a diastema (hole) between the incisors and molars of the mandible. The lower incisors were wide, recurved, and set in a straight line over. The p3 premolar tooth of the mandible was available in most early examples, however lost in later examples; it was just present in 6% of the La Brea test. There is some argument about whether "Smilodon" was explicitly dimorphic. A few investigations of "S. fatalis" fossils have discovered little distinction between the genders. On the other hand, a recent report found that, while fossils of "S. fatalis" show less variety in size among people than current "Panthera", they do seem to demonstrate a similar contrast between the genders in certain attributes.
