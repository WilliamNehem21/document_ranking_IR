Kennedy scholarly of the passings on the next morning when National Security Council staff member Michael Forrestal raced into the bureau stay with a message detailing the NgÃÂ´ siblings' supposed suicides. As per General Maxwell Taylor, "Kennedy jumped to his feet and hurried from the stay with a look of stun and alarm all over which I had never observed." Kennedy had arranged that NgÃÂ´ ÃÂÃÂ¬nh DiÃ¡Â»Âm would be securely banished and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. reviewed that the US President was "serious and shaken". Kennedy later wrote an update, regretting that the death was "especially despicable" and censuring himself for endorsing Cable 243, which had approved Lodge to investigate overthrow alternatives in the wake of Nhu's assaults on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that "It shook him by and by ... annoyed him as a good and religious issue. It shook his certainty, I think, in the sort of guidance he was getting about South Vietnam." When Kennedy was reassured by a companion who revealed to him he need not feel frustrated about the NgÃÂ´ siblings on the grounds of tyranny, Kennedy answered "No. They were in a troublesome position. They did as well as could be expected for their nation."
