At Mantinea, Thebes had looked down the joined powers of the best conditions of Greece, yet the triumph presented to it no crown jewels. With Epaminondas expelled from the scene, the Thebans came back to their increasingly customary guarded approach, and inside a couple of years, Athens had supplanted them at the apex of the Greek political framework. No Greek state until the end of time diminished Boeotia to the subjection it had known amid the Spartan authority, yet Theban impact blurred rapidly in the remainder of Greece. At long last, at Chaeronea in 338 BC, the joined powers of Thebes and Athens, crashed into one another's arms for a urgent last remain against Philip of Macedon, were crushingly vanquished, and Theban freedom was put to an end. After three years, cheered by a bogus talk that Alexander the Great had been killed, the Thebans revolted; Alexander squashed the revolt, at that point devastated the city, butchering or oppressing every one of its natives. A minor 27 years after the passing of the man who had made it prevalent all through Greece, Thebes was cleaned from the substance of the Earth, its 1,000-year history finished in about a couple of days.
