Lightning was made by Motomu Toriyama, the executive of "Conclusive Fantasy XIII". Her character configuration was by normal "Last Fantasy" craftsman Tetsuya Nomura, who had recently filled in as the character architect for "Definite Fantasy VIII" and "X". Nomura has said that various plansÃ¢ÂÂincluding some by staff individuals other than himselfÃ¢ÂÂwere considered for Lightning, while Toriyama has guaranteed that Nomura's first draft "looked so cool and solid that there was no requirement for any retakes." Because of the graphical limits of "Definite Fantasy XIII"s planned stages, Nomura had the capacity to incorporate unquestionably more detail in Lightning's structure than in his past character structures, for example, her cape and facial highlights. This required undeniably more exertion on his part. Remarking on an early type of her plan, Nomura clarified that she is basically a "cool character", in that she is not kidding and unforgiving. Be that as it may, he couldn't make the character unreasonably manly because of a paranoid fear of losing player sympathy. Attributes from prior variants of the plan included light or silver hair and Asian-looking facial highlights. Her last workmanship was made less Asian-looking than these early drafts and her hair shading changed to pink, while Hope Estheim was given silver hair. Lightning's last hair shading and hairdo were expected to mirror her womanliness, and to offset her athletic body. Making her limited time CG render was genuinely simple because of the quantity of subtleties accessible concerning her.
