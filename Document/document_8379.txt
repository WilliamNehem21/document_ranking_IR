Starting with "Confined Bird", Angelou utilized the equivalent "composing custom" for a long time. She would get up at five in the first part of the day and register with a lodging, where the staff were told to expel any photos from the dividers. She composed on yellow lawful cushions while lying on the bed, with a jug of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, "Roget's Thesaurus", and the Bible, and left by the early evening. She found the middle value of 10Ã¢ÂÂ 12 pages of material daily, which she altered down to three or four pages at night. Lupton expressed that this custom designated "an immovability of direction and an unbendable utilization of time". Angelou experienced this procedure to give herself an opportunity to transform an amazing occasions into craftsmanship, and to "captivate" herself; as she said in a 1989 meeting with the BBC, to "remember the desolation, the anguish, the "Sturm und Drang"". She put herself back in the time she expounded on, amid horrible encounters like her assault in "Confined Bird", to "tell the human truth" about her life. Faultfinder Opal Moore says about "Confined Bird": "...Though effectively read, [it] is no 'simple read'". Angelou expressed that she played cards to achieve that spot of charm, to get to her recollections all the more successfully. She has expressed, "It might take an hour to get into it, yet once I'm in itÃ¢ÂÂha! It's so heavenly!" She didn't discover the procedure cathartic; rather, she discovered help in "coming clean".
