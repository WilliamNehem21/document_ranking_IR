Promoted air commodore, in February 1943 Hewitt was appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC) No.Â 9 Operational Group (No.Â 9 OG). The RAAF's premier mobile strike force, No.Â 9 OG initially comprised seven Australian combat squadrons and came under the control of the US Fifth Air Force. The month he took over, Hewitt's squadrons were reorganised into two wings based in New Guinea: No.Â 71 Wing, comprising units at Milne Bay, New Guinea, and No.Â 73 Wing, comprising those at Port Moresby. In March, No.Â 9 OG led the RAAF's contribution to the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, "the decisive aerial engagement" in the SWPA according to General Douglas MacArthur, resulting in 12Â Japanese ships being sunk.
By April 1943, Hewitt had been dragged into the divisive personal conflict between the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, and the AOC of RAAF Command, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock. RAAF Command was the Air Force's main operational formation in the Pacific, controlling 24Â Australian squadrons. Jones, administrative and "de jure" head of the RAAF, sought to extend his authority into the sphere of operations by posting a "more accountable" officer into Bostock's position, namely Hewitt. The Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, backed Jones' manoeuvre but was informed by Prime Minister John Curtin that General MacArthur, as Supreme Commander SWPA, "would insist on the replacement of AVM Bostock by an equally able officer", and that "Air Commodore HewittÂ ...Â was not considered an adequate replacement."
