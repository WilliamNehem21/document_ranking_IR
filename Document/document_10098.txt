In February 1930 Tippett gave the accidental music to an act by his showy gathering of James Elroy Flecker's "Wear Juan", and in October he guided them in his own adjustment of Stanford's musical show "The Traveling Companion". His compositional yield was to such an extent that on 5 April 1930 he gave a show in Oxted comprising totally of his own worksÃ¢ÂÂa Concerto in D for woodwinds, oboe, horns and strings; settings for tenor of ballads by Charlotte Mew; "Hymn in C" for ensemble and symphony, with a content by Christopher Fry; piano minor departure from the melody "Racer to the Fair"; and a string group of four. Proficient soloists and instrumental players were locked in, and the show was led by David Moule-Evans, a companion from the RCM. In spite of empowering remarks from "The Times" and the "Day by day Telegraph", Tippett was profoundly disappointed with the works, and concluded that he required further educational cost. He pulled back the music, and in September 1930 re-enlisted at the RCM for a unique course of concentrate in antithesis with R. O. Morris, a specialist on sixteenth century music. This second RCM period, amid which he figured out how to compose fugues in the style of Bach and got extra educational cost in arrangement from Gordon Jacob, was integral to Tippett's possible revelation of what he named his "singular voice".
