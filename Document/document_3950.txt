As antagonism towards Catholics escalated in London from the late 1670s, Wright invested more energy working far from court. He painted six family pictures for Sir Walter Bagot of Blithfield in Staffordshire in 1676/7. In 1678, he expelled to Dublin for various years, maybe because of the counter Catholic delirium produced by Titus Oates' Popish Plot. Here, as yet styling himself ""Pictor Regis"", he painted "The Ladies Catherine and Charlotte Talbot", which is today in the National Gallery of Ireland. He additionally painted two full-lengths representations of costumed chieftains, the "Sir Neil O'Neill" (c. 1680), presently in the Tate Collection, and the "Ruler Mungo Murray" (c.1683), presently in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Sir Neil O'Neill was a kindred Roman Catholic, additionally in a state of banishment in Dublin. Wright depicted him in the dress outfit of an Irish chieftain, with suit of uncommon Japanese reinforcement at his feet. The criticalness of this defensive layer is that it is believed to be a coded image of a triumph over the persecutors of Roman Catholicism, of whom, around then, the Japanese were famous. The representation of Mungo Murray (the fifth child of the Royalist Marquis of Atholl) is remarkable for being viewed as one of the primary occurrence of Scottish plaid being depicted in craftsmanship.
