Crittenden suggests that the two sorts of data can be separated from cognizance or conduct articulation as a 'system' to keep up the accessibility of a connection figure (See area above on Disorganized/confused connection for qualification of "Types"): "Type A techniques were guessed to be founded on decreasing impression of risk to lessen the manner to react. Type C was estimated to be founded on uplifting view of risk to expand the air to react." Type A techniques split off passionate data about inclination undermined and type C methodologies split off transiently sequenced information about how and why the connection figure is accessible. Conversely, type B procedures viably use the two sorts of data absent much bending. For instance: a little child may have come to rely on a sort C methodology of fits in attempting to keep up the accessibility of a connection figure whose conflicting accessibility has driven the tyke to doubt or mutilate causal data about their clear conduct. This may lead their connection figure to get a more clear handle on their requirements and the proper reaction to their connection practices. Encountering progressively solid and unsurprising data about the accessibility of their connection figure, the little child then no longer needs to utilize coercive practices with the objective of keeping up their guardian's accessibility and can build up a protected connection to their parental figure since they believe that their requirements and interchanges will be paid attention to.
