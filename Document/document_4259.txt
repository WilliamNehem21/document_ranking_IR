The concise symphonic prelude to Part I presents the two differentiating states of mind which overrun the whole work. Kemp compares the opening "growling trumpet group of three" to "a drop into Hades", however it is addressed quickly by a tenderly melancholy expression in the strings. When all is said in done the eight numbers which involve this initial segment each have, says Gloag, their very own unmistakable surface and symphonious character, frequently in a disjunctive association with one another, in spite of the fact that the second and third numbers are associated by an instrumental "interludium". From among the different melodic highlights Steinberg attracts consideration regarding rhythms in the chorale "When Shall The Usurer's City Cease" that outline Tippett's learning of and feel for the English madrigal. What Kemp portrays as "one of the incomparable minutes in Tippett's music" happens towards the finish of the Part, as the soprano's aria dissolves into the profound "Take away": "a [transition] so impactful as to set off that moment stun of acknowledgment that floods the eyes with feeling ... in spite of the fact that the soprano keeps on lamenting in a coasting melisma, the otherworldly comes as an alleviation just as a discharge".
