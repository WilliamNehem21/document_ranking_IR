In spite of this proof of Mercian contribution in the southeast there is next to no sign that ÃÂthelred had expansionist aspirations toward the south. The expanding quality of the West Saxons under CÃÂ¦dwalla and Ine would have restricted Mercian openings toward that path. The Northumbrians were never again a diversion; they had been contained north of the Humber since the Battle of the Trent, and turned out to be even to a lesser extent a danger after their unfortunate thrashing in 685 on account of the Picts. A conceivable clarification is that ÃÂthelred was engrossed with war with the Welsh. It was additionally right now that the Hwicce came all the more unquestionably into the Mercian circle. The last Hwiccean ruler to take the title of lord was Oshere, who kicked the bucket in 685; yet from the mid-670s he looked for ÃÂthelred's assent for his stipends, and ÃÂthelred viewed him as a subking. Additional proof of ÃÂthelred's contribution among the Hwicce originates from a sanction in which he allows land for a minster in Gloucestershire, in Hwiccean domain; the contract is for the most part thought to be a creation, yet it has all the earmarks of being founded on a true before source.
