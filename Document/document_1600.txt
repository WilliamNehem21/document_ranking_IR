"Suillus intermedius", found in northeastern and northern North America, is comparable in appearance to "S.ÃÂ salmonicolor". It might be recognized by a lighter-shaded top, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous substance, and a ring that is neither as thick nor as wide as "S.ÃÂ salmonicolor". It is likewise bigger, with a top measurement of up to , and its pore surface now and then gradually recolors rosy darker when wounded. In spite of the fact that it has not been absolutely settled whether "S.ÃÂ cothurnatus" is an unmistakable species, a few attributes have been accounted for to separate it from "S.ÃÂ salmonicolor": a more slender, less rubbery cloak that generally comes up short on a thickened cottony move at the base; glandular specks on the stem that comprise of groups of multiseptate hyphae in a parallel plan finishing in an even line of substantial, sterile cystidia (60Ã¢ÂÂ 140ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m long) that take after basidia; and little hyaline cystidia molded like swollen containers with limited bases. Other "Suillus" species with which "S.ÃÂ salmonicolor" may be confounded incorporate "S.ÃÂ acidus" and "S.ÃÂ subalutaceus". Both of these species have a less very much created halfway shroud, and their substance is a more blunt tone lacking yellow-orange tints.
