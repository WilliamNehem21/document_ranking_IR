Following the flare-up of World WarÃÂ II, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron's Ansons were entrusted with sea watch and guard escort obligations. In 1940, the squadron turned into the RAAF's debut Lockheed Hudson unit; it got its first Hudson on 30ÃÂ March, and before the finish of May had exchanged out the remainder of its Ansons and was working 11 of the new airplane. Conveyed to Malaya to direct sea observation, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron touched base at Sembawang, Singapore, on 4ÃÂ July 1940. It moved to RAF Kota Bharu, close to the MalayaÃ¢ÂÂ Thailand outskirt, in August 1941. Two days before the assault on Malaya, its Hudsons recognized the Japanese intrusion armada be that as it may, given vulnerability about the boats' goal and directions to maintain a strategic distance from hostile activities until assaults were a made against agreeable area, Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham did not enable the escort to be bombarded. Soon after 12 pm, nearby time, the evening of 7/8 December, the Japanese power began arriving on the shorelines at Kota Bharu, near the runway, and from about 02:00, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron propelled a progression of strikes on the Japanese powers, turning into the main air ship to make an assault in the Pacific War. The Hudsons sank a Japanese transport dispatch, the IJN "Awazisan Maru", and harmed two additional vehicles, the "Ayatosan Maru" and "Sakura Maru", for the loss of two Hudsons, an hour prior to the assault on Pearl Harbor. Before the day's over, Japanese ground powers had progressed to the edges of the landing strip, constraining the squadron's staying airworthy flying machine to be emptied to Kuantan, and from that point back to Singapore.
