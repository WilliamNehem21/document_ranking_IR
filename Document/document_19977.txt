The gameplay was generally praised by reviewers, who typically found the combat engaging but were split on the repetitive aspects of the game. 1UP.com's Matt Clark said that the sword gameplay "just feels right", while Mark Brown of "Eurogamer" said that the combat had an excitement factor that pushed players to keep on going for one more battle. Tracy Erickson of "Pocket Gamer" described the swipe-based combat system as "easy to understand, though tough to master", and Nick Chester of Destructoid said that although the combat was not very complicated, it was fun to play. The role-playing game elements were praisedâDestructoid's Chester called them "satisfying" and IGN's Goldstein said that they added to the game's difficulty. Brown's review for "Eurogamer", however, said that while good they were not as engaging as the combat, and the "Edge" review dismissed them as minimal. Reviewers had mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the bloodline system's repetition: Destructoid's Chester described it as addictive and IGN's Goldstein agreed, but Erickson's review for "Pocket Gamer" said that the game had problems with repetition and "Wired" Meyer dismissed it as "repetitive ... as the title suggests". J. Nicholas Geist, writing for "Kill Screen", focused his entire review on the cyclical nature of the game, treating its nature of repetition with small changes between each bloodline as a metaphor for life. Most reviewers found themselves between the two extremes, with Brown of "Eurogamer" simultaneously describing it as "alarmingly repetitious" but still addictive and 1UP.com's Clark saying that enjoying the game required getting past the repetition, despite being "stellar".
