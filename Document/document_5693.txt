Adams by and large remained calm on open issues. He didn't freely reprove Jefferson's activities as president, trusting that "as opposed to restricting Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and contradicting every one of their Measures right or wrong, We should Support each Administration to the extent We can in Justice." When a disappointed James Callender, furious at not being delegated to an office, turned on the president by uncovering the Sally Hemings issue, Adams said nothing. John Quincy was chosen to the Senate in 1803. Presently, both he and his dad crossed partisan loyalties to help Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase. The main major political episode including Adams amid the Jefferson years was a debate with Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old companion, had assaulted Adams in a flyer for his "favoritism for government" and "pride of abilities and much desire." A violent correspondence resulted. In time, their kinship mended. Adams did secretly condemn the president over his Embargo Act, regardless of the way that John Quincy voted in favor of it. John Quincy left the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate would not select him for a second term. After the Federalists censured John Quincy as never again being of their gathering, Adams kept in touch with him that he himself had since a long time ago "surrendered and repudiated the name and character and properties of that order."
