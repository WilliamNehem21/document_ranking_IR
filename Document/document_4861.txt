In January or February 1943, Chevalier had a concise discussion with Oppenheimer in the kitchen of his home. Chevalier disclosed to Oppenheimer that there was a researcher, George Eltenton, who could transmit data of a specialized sort to the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer dismissed the suggestion, yet neglected to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been requested for atomic insider facts for the Soviet Union, by an individual he didn't have a clue who worked for Shell Oil, and who had Communist associations. He gave that individual's name as George Eltenton. At the point when pushed on the issue in later meetings at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who guaranteed to keep the personality of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer distinguished the contact who had moved toward him as Chevalier, and disclosed to Groves that just a single individual had been drawn nearer: his sibling Frank. Forests considered Oppenheimer excessively imperative to a definitive Allied objectives of structure nuclear bombs and prevailing upon the war to remove him this suspicious conduct. He requested that Oppenheimer be given an exceptional status "immediately, independent of the data which you have concerning Mr. Oppenheimer. He is significant to the undertaking."
