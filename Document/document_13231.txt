After lunch, Lindwall and Johnston took the new ball, and the organization advanced just four further hurries to 61 out of 110 minutes. On 39, Compton pointed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a "crack slip get". Hutton figured out how to keep opposing the Australians before Miller struck Crapp in the neck with a bouncer. The batsman did not respond to the blow and did not try to rub the purpose of effect. In the wake of hitting a progression of spread drives for limits, Hutton edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in the two innings. He had batted for more than four hours and left England at 153/4. From that point, the home side crumbled. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring rejected debutant Watkins for two, his solitary wicket for the match. Watkins swung Ring to the leg side and the ball went straight under the control of Hassett, who did not have to move from his situation on the limit, leaving England at 167/6. Lindwall returned and yorked Evans, who appeared to not identify the conveyance in the poor light, for eight. The umpires in this manner canceled play after Yardley bid against the light. The ground was then hit by downpour, bringing about an untimely end to the day's play with England at 178/7, having lost 4/25.
