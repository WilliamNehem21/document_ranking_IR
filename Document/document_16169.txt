In 1992, Alice in Chains appeared in the Cameron Crowe film "Singles", performing as a "bar band". The band also contributed the song "Would?" to the film's , whose video received an award for Best Video from a Film at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.
In March 1992, the band returned to the studio. With new songs written primarily on the road, the material has an overall darker feel than "Facelift", with six of the album's thirteen songs dealing with the subject of addiction. "We did a lot of soul searching on this album. There's a lot of intense feelings." Cantrell said, "We deal with our daily demons through music. All of the poison that builds up during the day we cleanse when we play".
On September 29, 1992, Alice in Chains released its second album, "Dirt". The album peaked at number six on the "Billboard" 200 and since its release has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making "Dirt" the band's highest selling album to date. The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of Allmusic praising the album as a "major artistic statement, and the closest they ever came to recording a flat-out masterpiece". Chris Gill of "Guitar World" called "Dirt" "huge and foreboding, yet eerie and intimate", and "sublimely dark and brutally honest".
