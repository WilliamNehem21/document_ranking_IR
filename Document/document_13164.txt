Amid the Early Neolithic, the site may have been near other chambered long pushcarts; the White Horse Stone, for example, is adjacent and may have once been a piece of the council of these landmarks. Different sarsen stones have been found in the region of both, again maybe mirroring the leftovers of since-obliterated long hand trucks. Toward the south of the White Horse Stone was a structure Ã¢ÂÂ named "Structure 4806" by its excavators during the 2000s Ã¢ÂÂ that was developed in the Early Neolithic time frame. Radiocarbon dating from the site proposes an utilization date of between 4110-3820 and 3780-3530 aligned BCE. long and wide, it was a longhouse of a sort known from crosswise over different pieces of Europe. In the event that it had been a household living arrangement, its size would imply that it was just "involved by few tenants, presumably close to a little family gathering". A littler, round structure roughly in measurement was available just toward the south-east of the longhouse; there was small dating proof for this, however what existed proposed a Late Neolithic inception. The archeologists who unearthed these structures recommended that they may have been "places of the living" that were intervisible with the "places of the dead", including Smythe's Megalith. Then again, they recommended that the longhouse was "a piece of the funerary convention", utilized in setting up "the remaining parts of the dead or for public exercises, for example, devouring".
