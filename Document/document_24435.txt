The ships' main battery consisted of four 45-caliber, guns mounted in electrically powered twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. These guns had major development problems as they proved to be too weak to use a full-strength charge of propellant and had to be reworked and the charge reduced. The guns in "Peresvet" and "Oslyabya" were the original model and could be elevated to a maximum of +35Â°, while the reinforced guns used in "Pobeda" could only elevate to a maximum of +25Â°. The guns were designed to fire once every 40 seconds, but in service they fired at half that rate. The ships carried 75 rounds for each gun. The older guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of while "Pobeda"s newer ones may have reached a muzzle velocity of . At an elevation of +6Â°, the gun had a range of . The secondary armament of the "Peresvet"-class ships consisted of eleven 45-caliber, 6-inch Canet Model 1891 quick-firing (QF) guns, 10 mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and one underneath the forecastle as a bow chaser. Each gun was provided with 220 rounds. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of . They had a range of when fired at an elevation of +20Â°.
