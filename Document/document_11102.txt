Stengel's six years in Toledo would be the length of he would spend anyplace as supervisor, aside from his time with the Yankees of the 1950s. McGraw sent capable players down to Toledo, and the Mud Hens compromised for the flag in Stengel's first year before falling back to third. In 1927, the group won its first flag and vanquished the Buffalo Bisons, five diversions to one, in the Little World Series. Stengel missed piece of the 1927 battle, as he was suspended by the class for actuating the fans to assault the umpire after a nearby play amid the primary round of the Labor Day doubleheader. Stengel proceeded as an infrequent player as late as 1931 notwithstanding his administrative job, hitting an amusement winning grand slam (the remainder of his expert profession) in 1927 for the Mud Hens. Since small time clubs endure vast turnovers in their lists, the group's prosperity did not extend to 1928, when it completed 6th, and afterward eighth in the eight-group class in 1929. The group recouped for third in 1930, however by then both Stengel and the group (in which he had contributed) were having monetary issues because of the beginning of the Great Depression. The group completed last again in 1931, and, after Landis was persuaded no cash had been skimmed off to profit Stengel and different insiders, the group went into receivership, and Stengel was terminated.
