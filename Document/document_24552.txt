Land acquisition for the construction of the SRÂ 94 freeway through Spring Valley had begun by 1965. The next year, a plan to reroute and widen portions of SRÂ 94 from the Sweetwater River to I-8 was underway, with a Caltrans proposal to remove the "Frenchy's" or "Three Springs" curve. In MarchÂ 1968, the San Diego Highway Development Association considered the construction of the freeway from SRÂ 125 to Jamacha Junction a priority. The state announced in August that the Spring Valley widening project would be funded earlier than anticipated, due to the state of the economy. Meanwhile, a $1.8Â million (about $ in dollars) contract to widen SRÂ 94 to eight lanes from Wabash Boulevard to Waite Drive in Lemon Grove was awarded in October. The freeway from Kenwood Drive to Avocado Boulevard in Spring Valley was completed in JulyÂ 1970.
An improved interchange with SRÂ 125 was being planned in 1974, which would connect to the existing freeway extending to Avocado Boulevard. Construction began in October, and continued into late 1975, at a cost of $11Â million (about $ in dollars); the road was predicted to reduce traffic at the intersection of Campo Road and Bancroft Drive, and interchanges at Spring Street and Lemon Grove Avenue were to be built. The Lemon Grove Avenue interchange was open by JanuaryÂ 30, 1976, and parts of the interchange with Spring Street and SRÂ 125 was open by JulyÂ 20.
