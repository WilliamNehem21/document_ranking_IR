Simultaneously, the II Canadian Corps on the western flank of Goodwood began Operation Atlantic to strengthen the Allied foothold along the banks of the Orne river and take VerriÃ¨res Ridge to the south of Caen. Atlantic made initial gains but ran out of steam as casualties mounted. Having cost the Canadians 1,349 men and with the heavily defended ridge firmly in German hands, Atlantic was closed down on 20 July. At Montgomery's urging, "strongly underlined in the Supreme Commander's communications to Montgomery", the II Canadian Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, began a second offensive a few days later, codenamed Operation Spring. This had the limited but important aim of tying down German units to prevent them from being transferred to the American sector, although Simonds took the opportunity to make another bid for VerriÃ¨res Ridge. Again the fighting for VerriÃ¨res Ridge proved extremely bloody for the Canadians, with 25 July marking the costliest day for a Canadian battalionâThe Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canadaâsince the Dieppe Raid of 1942. A counterstroke by two German divisions pushed the Canadians back past their start lines and Simonds had to commit reinforcements to stabilize the front. With Goodwood, the Canadian operations caused the Germans to commit most of their armor and reinforcements to the eastern sector. Operation Springâdespite its costâhad drawn the 9th SS Panzer Division away from the U.S. sector on the eve of Operation Cobra. Only two "Panzer" divisions with 190 tanks now faced the First Army. Seven "Panzer" divisions with 750 tanks were around Caen, far away from Operation Cobra as were all the heavy Tiger tank battalions and the three "Nebelwerfer" brigades in Normandy.
