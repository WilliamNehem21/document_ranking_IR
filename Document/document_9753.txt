The misericords date from 1330 to 1340. They may have been cut under the bearing of ace woodworker John Strode, despite the fact that his name isn't recorded before 1341. He was helped by Bartholomew Quarter, who is reported from 1343. They initially numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have endure. Sixty-one are introduced in the choir, three are shown in the basilica and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New slows down were requested when the eastern end of the choir was reached out in the mid fourteenth century. The ordinances whined that they had borne the expense of the modifying and requested that the prebendary priests should pay for their very own slows down. At the point when the recently restored choir opened in 1339 numerous misericords were left incomplete, including one-fifth of the enduring 65. A considerable lot of the ministers had not paid, and were required to contribute an all out entirety of ÃÂ£200. The misericords endure superior to different segments of the slows down, which, amid the Protestant Reformation, had their shelters hacked off and exhibitions embedded above them. One of the misericords, portraying a kid pulling a thistle from his foot, dates from the seventeenth century. In 1848 there was a finished adjustment of the choir furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the rebuilt slows down.
