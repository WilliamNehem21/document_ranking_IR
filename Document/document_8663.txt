The section of the United States into World War I energized Baker, as it at last gave him a reason throughout everyday life and enabled him to utilize his pilot preparing. He left the United States for Europe in the mid year of 1917, among the primary gathering of Americans to do as such. Despite the fact that anxious to join the front quickly, Baker was informed that he must be confirmed by the French. Accomplishment in the courses was subject to how rapidly the pilots learned French, the dominating language of guidance. Despite the fact that he figured out how to finish every one of the courses effectively, an absence of qualified educators implied that Baker was first sent to a school in England for all the more preparing and afterward back to France to train Americans what he had realized in England, trying to make pilots as fast as could be expected under the circumstances. This disheartened Baker, who was anxious to get into the cutting edges and battle. Attributable to an absence of flying machine supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and questioned he could ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was upbeat to keep seeing Scott, who had enrolled as a medical attendant and worked at a clinic in France.
