Following the court's choice, an intrigue was stopped by the state examiner against Patrick Head and Adrian Newey. On 22 November 1999, the intrigue cleared Head and Newey all things considered, expressing that no new proof had become known (there was missing information from the discovery recorder on Senna's vehicle because of harm, and 1.6 seconds of video from the installed camera of Senna's vehicle was inaccessible in light of the fact that the telecaster changed to another vehicle's camera just before the mishap), thus under Article 530 of the Italian Penal Code, the allegation must be announced as "non-existent or the reality doesn't subsist". This intrigue result was canceled in January 2003, as the Court of Cassation trusted that Article 530 was misconstrued, and a retrial was requested. On 27 May 2005, Newey was cleared all things considered while Head's case was "planned out" under a legal time limit. The Italian Court of Appeal, on 13 April 2007, expressed the accompanying in the decision numbered 15050: "It has been resolved that the mishap was brought about by a controlling section disappointment. This disappointment was brought about by seriously structured and severely executed alterations. The obligation of this falls on Patrick Head, guilty of precluded control". Notwithstanding being discovered in charge of Senna's mishap, Patrick Head was not captured, as the decision was conveyed past the Italian resolution of restriction for murder.
