The name "Oryzomys" was presented in 1857 by Spencer Fullerton Baird for the swamp rice rodent (presently "Oryzomys palustris") of the eastern United States, which had been first depicted twenty years sooner by Richard Harlan. The name joins the Greek "oryza" "rice" and "mys" "mouse" and alludes to the encouraging propensities for the bog rice rodent. Baird set "Oryzomys" as a subgenus of the now-old family "Hesperomys" and included just the swamp rice rodent in it, a grouping which was trailed by Elliott Coues in 1874 and 1877. In 1890, "Oryzomys" was raised to conventional position, and in ensuing years various extra species were credited to it, a considerable lot of which were before long moved to isolate genera. In the 1898 "Catalogus Mammalium", ÃÂdouard Louis Trouessart recorded 67ÃÂ species of "Oryzomys", including some that are currently put in "Calomys", "Necromys", "Thomasomys", and other genera random to "Oryzomys". A portion of the new genera proposed were before long subsumed in "Oryzomys" once more, and in "The Families and Genera of Living Rodents" (1941), John Ellerman recorded "Microryzomys", "Oligoryzomys", "Melanomys", "Nesoryzomys", and "Oecomys" as equivalent words of "Oryzomys" and included about 127ÃÂ species in it. In 1948, Philip Hershkovitz proposed that different oryzomyines like "Nectomys" and "Megalomys" could also be incorporated into "Oryzomys", and Clayton Ray pursued this recommendation in 1962.
