Teacher George Gilbert Pond was the principal individual to attempt to set up a perpetual Priestley historical center at the Priestley House. Subsequent to raising adequate assets, he figured out how to buy the home at sale for $6,000 from Scott's beneficiaries on November 24, 1919 ($ÃÂ  in 2019). Lake trusted that development of another railroad line would decimate the house, thus expected to move it to Pennsylvania State College (presently Pennsylvania State University). Be that as it may, he kicked the bucket on May 20, 1920 preceding this arrangement could be instituted; the arranged rail line was never fabricated and the house demonstrated too delicate to even think about moving. The school set up a dedication support in Pond's respect and held the house as a historical center, despite the fact that Pond's youngsters did not formally exchange the house to the school until April 14, 1932. Some reclamation of the house was done during the 1920s, and a little, block buildingÃ¢ÂÂexpected as a flame resistant historical center for Priestley's books and logical mechanical assemblyÃ¢ÂÂwas based on the grounds and committed to Pond's memory in 1926. In 1941 the state assembly attempted to have the State Historical Commission control the house as an exhibition hall, yet Governor Arthur James vetoed the arrangement for absence of financing.
