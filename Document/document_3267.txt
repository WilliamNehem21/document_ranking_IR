Lansdale kept on being reproachful of Durbrow, and needed to supplant him as envoy. After two months, the approaching US President John F. Kennedy began an audit of Washington's position with respect to Saigon. Lansdale's report anticipated South Vietnam's end, and alongside it, the remainder of South East Asia and US prevalence in worldwide issues, except if another heading was found. He accused what he saw as Durbrow's misguided thinking for the issues in the union, and that the present minister couldn't work successfully any longer since he had "identified emphatically" with the upset. Without unequivocally presenting himself, Lansdale said that Durbrow must be supplanted with somebody "with stamped authority gifts" and the capacity to "impact Asians through understanding them thoughtfully". Lansdale called DiÃ¡Â»Âm "the main Vietnamese with official capacity and the expected assurance to be a powerful President" and said the new envoy required in this way needed a compatibility with him. Lansdale said DiÃ¡Â»Âm was OK with MAAG and the CIA, yet felt that representatives were "exceptionally near the individuals who attempted to slaughter him on November 11". Amid the gathering at which these issues were examined, there was solid understanding that Durbrow's situation in Saigon had turned out to be indefensible. Lansdale's entries were viewed as being essential in Kennedy's choice to supplant Durbrow with Frederick Nolting in May 1961. Nolting was a gentle man who was viewed as improbable to weight DiÃ¡Â»Âm to change and in this manner upset him. Kennedy was thought to have truly examined the arrangement of Lansdale, before experiencing grievances from areas of the State and Defense Departments, among them Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Kennedy additionally expanded financing for DiÃ¡Â»Âm promptly and made a show of help for the Vietnamese chief at the exhortation of Lansdale.
