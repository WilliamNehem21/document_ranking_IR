Johnson showed up in Victory Lane after his triumph lap to praise his fifth win of the period before the group; the success earned him $191,886. He was satisfied with the outcome, saying he was glad to have taken the triumph: "We've been running in advance the last three of four races and haven't had the capacity to let the big dog eat. Today we did." Hamlin was baffled with his completion as he believed he had a quicker vehicle after the race's last restart yet conceded Johnson would not be beaten: "It was my solitary shot to get around him. I wasn't going to get under him totally. There was no chance conceivable. I was doing as well as could be expected to win the race." He later conceded that he reached Johnson and that it was deliberately. Labonte said about his third-place complete, "I have a feeling that I stole something." Jeff Burton was philosophical about his retirement from the race: "These things occur. Everyone has had an issue in this Chase, and we had our own today. This thing isn't over for us using any and all means." Kenseth, who completed eleventh, was hopeful about his odds of winning the Drivers' Championship: "It's extraordinary to be the pioneer, however we must begin running great, It's still truly wide open. It will be entirely energizing, I think, coming down to the last race."
