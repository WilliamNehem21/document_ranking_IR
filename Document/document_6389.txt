Sam Merwin, who had taken over from Oscar Friend at Standard Magazines towards the finish of the war, relinquished the adolescent methodology that had described both "Alarming" and "Exciting"; he asked Bergey to make his spreads progressively sensible, and began to distribute all the more hard sci-fi, including work by Murray Leinster, George O. Smith, and Hubbard. He purchased Jack Vance's first deal, "The World Thinker", which showed up in 1945, and distributed a decent arrangement of material by Ray Bradbury, including a few of his Martian Chronicle stories. The absolute most noteworthy profile names from Campbell's steady of "Astonishing" journalists sold to Merwin, including van Vogt, Heinlein, and Sturgeon, whose "The Sky Was Full of Ships" showed up in 1947 and was tremendously applauded by perusers. Other striking stories incorporate Fredric Brown's "What Mad Universe", which showed up in 1948, and Kuttner's "Valley of the Flame", one of a few science dream books he distributed in "Alarming". Authors, for example, John D. MacDonald, Margaret St. Clair, William Tenn, Arthur C. Clarke, James Blish, and Damon Knight all sold to Merwin, and the net impact was a sensational improvement in the nature of the two magazines, to the point where Ashley proposes that by the late 1940s, "Exciting Wonder", specifically, was a genuine challenger to "Astonishing" for the authority of the field.
