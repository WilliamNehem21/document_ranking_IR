Australia held a similar XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. Ian Johnson was held in spite of taking match figures of 1/85, as was Bill Brown, the opener who was batting out of position in the center request. Darker had scored 25, 26 and 17 in his three innings in the center request amid the visit. O'Reilly censured the determination of Brown, who had seemed, by all accounts, to be discernibly awkward in the new job. He said that in spite of Brown's unbeaten twofold century in his past Test at Lord's in 1938, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey would do well to cases to choice. Following his crotch damage at Trent Bridge, Lindwall was exposed to a careful wellness test on the principal morning. Bradman was not persuaded of Lindwall's wellness, yet the bowler's protestations were adequate to persuade his commander to bet on his incorporation. Australia won the hurl and chose to bat, permitting Lindwall further time to recuperate from his damage. Prior to the hurl, Bradman had spent an uncommonly lengthy time-frame investigating the wicket, and after accurately foreseeing the side of the coin, he took a gander at the surface for another period before declaring Australia's choice to bat. The all-rounder Keith Miller played, yet was unfit to bowl.
