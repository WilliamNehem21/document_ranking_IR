On 6 April 1941, when the World War II German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began, "Morava" was based at Stara KanjiÅ¾a on the Tisza river, as the flagship of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division. This force was responsible for the Hungarian border, and came under the operational control of the 7th Infantry Division "Potiska". The remainder of the 2nd Mine Barrage Division consisted of the river tug "R-XXI", the river transport "Senta", and a few mobilised customs motorboats, based further south on the Tisza at Senta. On 7 April, "Morava" withdrew to Senta, where she was attacked by German aircraft. According to her commander, "PoruÄnik bojnog broda" BoÅ¾idar AranÄeloviÄ, her crew shot down one German aircraft and captured a "Luftwaffe" "Oberstleutnant". On 10 April, "Morava" was ordered to withdraw to conform with the retreat of the 2nd Army Group of the Royal Yugoslav Army from BaÄka and Baranja. On the evening of 11 April, "Morava" anchored at the confluence of the Danube and Sava near Belgrade, along with her fellow monitors "Vardar" and "Sava", and AranÄeloviÄ took command of the flotilla. The three captains conferred, and decided to scuttle their vessels due to the high water levels in the rivers and low bridges, which meant insufficient clearance for the monitors to navigate freely. The crews of the monitors were transshipped to two tugboats, but when one of the tugboats was passing under a railway bridge, demolition charges on the bridge exploded prematurely and the bridge fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men aboard the vessel, 95 were killed.
