As sound executive, Klepacki additionally made many audio cues for "Universe at War". For the outsider Hierarchy, he developed an "unnatural" tasteful through a "weapons store of damaged clamors". Klepacki utilized a "mix of substantial cranes recorded with overdriven impacts" to give the group's walkers a "threatening machinelike breathing sound", and made up his own language to record "different snorts, snarls, characteristics, and abnormal vocalizations. Since Hierarchy saints expected to convey to the player in English, Klepacki built discourse to appear as though the outsiders were "clairvoyantly addressing you, with a back-covering impact on their voices...as if the words are being diverted directly to your mind". The Novus impacts were normally staged and included "mechanical development, power, and metal sounds". He developed one more language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who once in a while address each other. Finally, he drew on climate and other common sounds for the Masari, portraying their atmosphere as having "more weight, thunder, substantial bass thunderings, vortex gusts..." Klepacki guided the voice-acting to have a "respectable and solid" feel without showing up regularly medieval or excessively emotional. He at last felt he took the necessary steps of "three individuals" with "Universe at War", as the amusement's sound prerequisites changed always, requiring cautiousness and developer support. "Divine Intervention" was later named for an "Amusement Audio Network Guild" grant, and the soundtrack was discharged as a free download after Petroglyph's endeavors toward a customary discharge were baffled.
