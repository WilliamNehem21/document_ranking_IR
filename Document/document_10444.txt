Jan Bondeson (1992 and 2006) suggested that, while the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst" are not recorded in any early reports and are probably going to have been a later expansion, the presence of the twins and the asserted multi year of birth can't be expelled. Albeit medieval accounts are temperamental, he noticed various reports in the Chronicon Scotorum, the Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Clonmacnoise of a couple of conjoined sisters conceived in or around 1100, albeit every one of the three are records of Irish history and none notice Kent as the area. He inferred that the instance of Christine McCoy, who made due for eight hours following the demise of her polypagus twin Millie, demonstrates that the guaranteed six hours between the passings of the Biddenden Maids is conceivable, and concurred with Ballantyne's recommendation that that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later error of the figures on the Biddenden cake. He likewise brought up that in spite of the fact that there is no recorded variant of the legend before 1770, there would have been no conceivable thought process in the locals of the eighteenth century to create the story.
