Tauranac constructed the BT19 around a gentle steel spaceframe suspension like those utilized in his past Brabham plans. The utilization of a spaceframe was viewed as a preservationist plan choice; by 1966, a large portion of Brabham's rivals were utilizing the hypothetically lighter and stiffer monocoque configuration, acquainted with Formula One by Lotus amid the 1962 season. Tauranac trusted that contemporary monocoques were not conveniently stiffer than a very much planned spaceframe and were more diligently to fix and keep up. The last was a specific worry for Brabham, which was the biggest producer of client single-seater dashing autos on the planet at the time. The organization's notoriety laid to some extent on BRO Ã¢ÂÂ viably the official 'works' group Ã¢ÂÂ utilizing a similar innovation as its clients, for whom simplicity of fix was a huge thought. One somewhat novel element was the utilization of oval-segment, as opposed to round, tubing around the cockpit, where the driver sits. In a spaceframe or monocoque hustling vehicle, the cockpit is viably an opening in the structure, debilitating it extensively. For a given cross sectional zone, oval tubing is stiffer one way than round tubing. Tauranac happened to have a supply of oval tubing and utilized it to harden the cockpit region. The vehicle weighed around 1250ÃÂ pounds (567ÃÂ kg), around over the base weight limit for the recipe, despite the fact that it was as yet one of the lightest autos in the 1966 field. The race beginning load of a 1966 Brabham-Repco with driver and fuel was assessed to be around , about not exactly the more dominant opponent Cooper T81-Maseratis.
