The first form of "Avarice" has been known as the "blessed vessel" for film documenters. Different reports of the first form turned out to be unwarranted. Among these "sightings" are a case that a duplicate existed in a vault in South America that was just screened once every year for welcomed visitors on New Year's Eve. Another case was that a duplicate in the ownership of a Texan mogul was sold to Henri Langlois of "CinÃÂ©mathÃÂ¨que FranÃÂ§aise". Different cases incorporate that a film society in Boston held a private screening of a print found by a World War II veteran in Berlin from a tip by Emil Jannings, that David Shepherd of the American Film Institute had discovered a duplicate at a carport deal, and that the leader of a film society in Redwood City, California, claimed "the longest existing adaptation of "Avarice" (acquired in Europe)." Stroheim himself once expressed that Benito Mussolini possessed an individual duplicate of the film. Stroheim's child Joseph von Stroheim once guaranteed that when he was in the Army amid World War II, he saw a variant of the film that took two evenings to completely screen, despite the fact that he couldn't recollect precisely to what extent it was.
