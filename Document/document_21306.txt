Clare Heal of the "Daily Express", in her review of the third series, praised the show's "spot-on spoofs of modern telly" and agreed that "There's no particular target audience but pretty much anyone of any age will find something in there for them". Kerrie Mills of PopMatters rated the first three series 9/10, opining that the show "does also provide evidence, edgewise between the falling bodily fluids, of a sharp comic intelligenceÂ ... in fact, it might just be one of the most successful original comedy shows to appear in years." Stephen Kelly of "The Guardian" argued that the fourth series had definitively transcended its roots to become not just "the best show on children's televisionâit's one of the smartest comedies on TV", performed by an "astonishing castÂ ... so superb that even special guest stars such as Chris Addison can look slightly out of their depth." In an article discussing the "League of Gentlemen" troupe's appearance in the same series, the "Radio Times"' Gareth McLean agreed that "despite nominally being a children's programme, "Horrible Histories" is one of the best sketch comedies on TV", adding that "ultimately, comedy performers relish [the] madcap, sometimes deliciously silly exuberance, which, thanks to the show's razorsharp writing, educates as well as entertains." Graeme Virtue of "The Scotsman" called the League's reunion a "coup" for the series: "While Gatiss's American accent was pretty duff, the bickering spark between the three Gentlemen remained."
