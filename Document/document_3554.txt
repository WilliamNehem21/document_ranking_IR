It was initially appeared at the 1970 Venice Film Festival. The give included Pedro Buchardo a role as the President, Luis Brandoni as Miguel and Alejandra Dapassano as Camila. As in Asturias' epic, the activity is incited when the town dolt slaughters a sneering armed force colonel, and accordingly, the president chooses to accuse the homicide for a political enemy, however starting there on the film veers from the novel. In the film, an employable is sent to spread bits of gossip about the charged however rather he begins to look all starry eyed at the denounced man's girl. When this occurs, the employable opposes his steadfastness to the president and enables the little girl and her dad to impel a transformation with what he thinks about the degenerate head.

The lamentable gathering of people at that point needed to persevere through this rancid drama."
