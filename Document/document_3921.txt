The boats of the Fourth Carrier Division were allocated to the Main Body of the first Mobile Fleet, directed by Vice-Admiral JisaburÃÂ Ozawa. The Main Body's job was to go about as an imitation to pull in consideration far from the two different powers drawing closer from the south and west. All powers were to join on Leyte Gulf on 25 October and the Main Body left Japan on 20 October. By the morning of 24 October, the Main Body was inside scope of the northernmost American bearers of Task Force 38 and Ozawa requested an air strike propelled by the Third Carrier Division ("Ise" and "HyÃÂ«ga" had no airplane on board) to draw in the consideration of the Americans. This practiced little else as the Japanese airplane neglected to enter past the shielding warriors; the survivors arrived at landing strips on the Philippine island of Luzon. The Americans were engrossed managing the other Japanese maritime powers and shielding themselves from air assaults propelled from Luzon and Leyte and couldn't extra any airplane to scan for the Japanese transporters until the evening. They at long last discovered them, yet Admiral William Halsey, Jr., authority of Task Force 38, concluded that it was past the point of no return in the day to mount a successful strike. He did, be that as it may, turn the majority of his boats north to position himself for a day break assault on the Japanese bearers the following day.
