In 1960, Cameron showed up close by Hopper in Harrington's first full-length film, "Night Tide". The film was a basic achievement andÃ¢ÂÂregardless of not accepting a wide appropriationÃ¢ÂÂturned into a religion great. She was welcome to show up in Harrington's next film, "Recreations", albeit at last never did as such. After Cameron moved to Venice, Los Angeles, a nearby expressions shop showed her work in August 1961. On his arrival to the U.S. from Europe, Anger moved in with Cameron for a period, before the team moved into a level on Silverlake Boulevard in mid 1964; Anger stayed there before withdrawing for New York City. As per Anger biographer Bill Landis, Cameron had turned into "a somewhat imposing maternal figure" in Anger's life. In October 1964, the Cinema Theater in Los Angeles held an occasion known as The Transcendental Art of Cameron, which showed her craft and verse and screened a portion of her movies; Anger arrived and upset the occasion by questioning the screening of "Introduction of the Pleasure Dome" without his authorization. He at that point propelled a blurb battle, "The Cameron File", against his previous companion, naming her "Typhoid Mary of the Occult World". The pair later accommodated, Cameron visiting Anger in San Francisco, where he acquainted her with Anton LaVey, the originator of the Church of Satan. LaVey was charmed to meet her, having been an aficionado of "Night Tide".
