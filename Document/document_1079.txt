The lyric is generally ascribed to Faltonia Betitia Proba to a great extent on the affirmation of Isidore, who wrote in his "Etymologiae" that "De laudibus Christi" was the result of a lady named Proba who was the spouse of a man named Adelphus ("Proba, uxor Adelphi, centonem ex Vergilio" ... "expressit"). Yet, the classicist and medievalist Danuta Shanzer has contended that the sonnet was not crafted by Faltonia Betitia Proba, but instead her granddaughter, Anicia Faltonia Proba, who lived in the late-fourth and early-fifth hundreds of years. Shanzerwho is of the feeling that Faltonia Betitia Proba likely kicked the bucket in AD 351bases a lot of her affirmation on assumed date irregularities and erroneous dates inside the content. For example, Shanzer calls attention to that lines 13Ã¢ÂÂ 17 of "De laudibus Christi" firmly take after lines 20Ã¢ÂÂ 24 of the ballad "Carmen contra paganos", which was composed at some point after Faltonia Betitia Proba's passing. Shanzer additionally guarantees that "De laudibus Christi" implies an eminent discussion about the date of Easter that occurred in AD 387, along these lines recommending that the ballad must date from the last piece of the fourth century. At last, Shanzer contends that the reference to the war among Magnentius and Constantius in the work's proem blocks the likelihood that Faltonia Betitia Proba orchestrated "De laudibus Christi", because of the way that the war occurred in a similar year as her alleged demise. Shanzer balances her theory by additionally conjuring a printed contention, taking note of that the creator of "De laudibus Christi" is frequently alluded to in later compositions by titles that just Anicia Proba would have gotten, for example, "mother of the Anicians" or the "prominent Roman Mistress".
