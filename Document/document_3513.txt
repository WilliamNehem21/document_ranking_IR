Smithers rode hard and conveyed Travis' letter to San Felipe de Austin in less than 40 hours. In a swiftly sorted out gathering, town pioneers passed a progression of goals swearing help to the Alamo protectors. The consequences of the gathering were imprinted in a broadsheet nearby a multiplication of Travis' letter. In the wake of dispersing each of the 200 duplicates of their underlying print run, paper distributers Joseph Baker and Thomas Borden made something like four different generations of the letter, bringing about in excess of 500 extra duplicates. Their last printing incorporated a message from Governor Henry Smith encouraging the settlers "to travel to the guide of your attacked compatriots and not allow them to be slaughtered by a hired soldier enemy. ... The call is upon ALL who can remain battle ready, to rally immediately, or in fifteen days the core of Texas will be the seat of war." On March 2, the letter was imprinted in the "Texas Republican". It showed up in the other significant Texas paper, the "Transmit and Texas Register", after three days. The letter was in the long run republished all through the United States and quite a bit of Europe.
