A solicitation by the city of Oceanside to reestablish access to Jefferies Ranch Road from SRÃÂ 76 was declined by Caltrans in late 2012, because of worries about future turnpike extension to six paths. In May 2013, development at the I-15 and SRÃÂ 76 trade revealed a "Buffalo latifrons" fossil. Corrections to the exchange were done in August 2013. The last part east to I-15 was contracted out in August, and development was to start soon a short time later and stretch out until 2017, at an expense of $201ÃÂ million. In AugustÃÂ 2016, traffic was to change from the current roadway to the recently built one west of I-15, from Gird Road to Old Highway 395. This would take into consideration the more seasoned roadway to be reconfigured to convey westward traffic, while the new roadway would deal with eastward traffic. The new roadway was depicted as having less turns than the more seasoned street, which would build wellbeing. The extension of the way to four paths was finished in May 2017; this implied from about east of the exchange with I-15 west to CRÃÂ S21 the roadway was four paths wide, including the extending that had been paid for by the proprietors of a stone quarry.
