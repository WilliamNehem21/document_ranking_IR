Though Jones had without any help coded "Minotaur", the little staff for "Pathways" was because of absence of cash for an extensive group.

Every beast was attracted by hand extraordinary states, for example, stationary, moving, assaulting, and kicking the bucket. They were then checked into the PC and added to the amusement; if there were issues, they were redrawn. When the last illustrations were finished, the pictures were colorized in 24-bit shading utilizing Adobe Photoshop. Regardless of the diversion's propelled illustrations, "Pathways" was intended to take a shot at any Macintosh display; it was one of 30ÃÂ applications that ran locally on Apple's PowerMacs on dispatch day.
