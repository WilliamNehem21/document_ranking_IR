Ashmole was conceived on 23 May 1617 in Breadmarket Street, Lichfield, Staffordshire. His family had been conspicuous, yet its fortunes had declined when of Ashmole's introduction to the world. His mom, Anne, was the girl of a well off Coventry draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Paget, a Baron of the Exchequer. His dad, Simon Ashmole (1589Ã¢ÂÂ 1634), was a saddler, who had filled in as an officer in Ireland and Europe. Elias Ashmole went to Lichfield Grammar School (presently King Edward VI School) and turned into a chorister at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1633, he went to live in London as coach to Paget's children, and in 1638, with James Paget's assistance, he qualified as a specialist. He delighted in an effective lawful practice in London, and wedded Eleanor Mainwaring (1603Ã¢ÂÂ 1641), an individual from a "dÃÂ©classÃÂ©" Cheshire blue-blooded family, who kicked the bucket, while pregnant, just three years after the fact on 6 December 1641. Still in his mid twenties, Ashmole had made the primary strides towards status and riches. He likewise ended up aligned with Major-General Charles Worsley (who kicked the bucket 12 June 1656 and was covered at Westminster Abbey), brother by marriage of his sister, Mary Ashmole, who wedded John Booth, of Salford.
