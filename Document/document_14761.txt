In 1870, Treasury Secretary George Boutwell sent Congress a draft bill to supplant the obsolete 1837 Mint Act and the bits of enactment ignored the years in regards to the mint and coinage. Indeed, even in the draft charge, no arrangement was made for the three-penny silver, however some in Congress wished to hold the coin fully expecting the resumption of specie installments. After much discussion in Congress, President Ulysses S. Concede marked the Coinage Act of 1873 on February 12 of that year. The law nullified the two-penny piece, three-penny silver, half dime, and standard silver dollar (later reestablished in 1878). Carothers called the abrogation of the silver three-and five-penny pieces "a need if the 3 penny and 5 penny nickel pieces were to be proceeded after the recovery of silver coinage". Breen regarded the choice to wipe out the silver three-penny piece and the half dime, which may have straightforwardly contended with the two copper-nickel coins, some help to industrialist Joseph Wharton, whose mines delivered a great part of the nickel mineral utilized in coinage. As indicated by numismatist R.ÃÂ W. Julian, the three-penny silver "had its impact well in the U.S. money related framework, yet there was never again any requirement for it".
