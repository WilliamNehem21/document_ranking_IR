Outside explorers to Eastern-Han China incorporate Buddhist priests who made an interpretation of works into Chinese, for example, A Shigao from Parthia, and Lokaksema from Kushan-period Gandhara, India. Notwithstanding tributary relations with the Kushans, the Han Empire got blessings from the Parthian Empire, from a lord in current Burma, from a ruler in Japan, and started an ineffective mission to Daqin (Rome) in AD 97 with Gan Ying as emissary. A Roman consulate of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (r.ÃÂ 161Ã¢ÂÂ 180 AD) is recorded in the "WeilÃÂ¼e" and "Hou Hanshu" to have achieved the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r.ÃÂ AD 146Ã¢ÂÂ 168) in AD 166, yet Rafe de Crespigny affirms this was in all probability a gathering of Roman dealers. Notwithstanding Roman dishes and coins found in China, Roman emblems from the rule of Antoninus Pius and his received child Marcus Aurelius have been found at ÃÂc Eo in Vietnam. This was close to the commandery of Rinan (likewise Jiaozhi) where Chinese sources guarantee the Romans originally arrived, just as international safe havens from Tianzhu (in northern India) in the years 159 and 161. ÃÂc Eo is additionally thought to be the port city "Cattigara" depicted by Ptolemy in his "Geology" (c. 150 AD) as lying east of the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) along the "Magnus Sinus" (for example Inlet of Thailand and South China Sea), where a Greek mariner had visited.
