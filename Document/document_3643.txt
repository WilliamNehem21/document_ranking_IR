His requests were futile. The jury indicted him, and he was condemned to death. After three days, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, drawn and quartered at the western end of St Paul's churchyard. The next day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were attached to wattled leaps and hauled by pony from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at WestminsterÃ¢ÂÂa more extended course than had been endured by their kindred backstabbers. Rookwood had requested to be educated when he gone by his lodgings in the Strand, with the goal that he could open his eyes and see his significant other, holding up at the window. He yelled "Appeal to God for me, petition God for me!" According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth replied, "I will, and be of good bravery. Offer theyself completely to God. I, as far as concerns me, do as uninhibitedly reestablish thee to God as He gave thee unto me." For the remainder of the voyage he kept his eyes shut, in supplication. Thomas Wintour was the principal that day to be hanged and afterward killed. Rookwood was straightaway, and made a short discourse to the collected group of onlookers. He was humble, requesting that God favor the lord, ruler, and their "imperial descendants", however "spoil[ed] all the pottage with one tarnished weed" by entreating God to make the ruler a Catholic. He appears to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before enduring the rest of his sentence.
