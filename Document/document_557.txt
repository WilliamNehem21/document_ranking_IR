While Edward's initial rule had been vigorous and fruitful, his later years were set apart by inactivity, military disappointment and political hardship. The everyday issues of the state had less intrigue to Edward than military crusading, so amid the 1360s Edward progressively depended on the assistance of his subordinates, specifically William Wykeham. A relative upstart, Wykeham was made Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1363 and Chancellor in 1367, however because of political troubles associated with his inability, the Parliament constrained him to leave the chancellorship in 1371. Exacerbating Edward's challenges were the passings of his most confided in men, some from the 1361Ã¢ÂÂ 62 repeat of the plague. William Montague, Earl of Salisbury, Edward's sidekick in the 1330 upset, kicked the bucket as right on time as 1344. William de Clinton, who had likewise been with the lord at Nottingham, passed on in 1354. One of the dukes made in 1337, William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, passed on in 1360, and the following year Henry of Grosmont, maybe the best of Edward's skippers, capitulated to what was most likely plague. Their demises left most of the magnates more youthful and more normally adjusted to the rulers than to the lord himself.
