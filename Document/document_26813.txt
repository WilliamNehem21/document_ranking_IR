The red-bellied black snake was described by the English naturalist George Shaw in "Zoology of New Holland" (1794) as "Coluber porphyriacus". Incorrectly assuming it was harmless, he wrote, "This beautiful snake, which appears to be unprovided with tubular teeth or fangs, and consequently not of a venomous nature, is three, sometimes four, feet in nature." The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek "porphyreus", which can mean "dark purple", "red-purple" or "beauteous". It was the first Australian elapid snake described. The syntype is presumed lost. French naturalist Bernard Germain de LacÃ©pÃ¨de described it under the name "Trimeresurus leptocephalus" in 1804. His countryman RenÃ© Lesson described it as "Acanthophis tortor" in 1826. German biologist Hermann Schlegel felt it was allied with cobras and called it "Naja porphyrica" in 1837.
The genus "Pseudechis" was created for it by German biologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1830, to which several more species have been added subsequently. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words "pseudÄs" "false", and "echis" "viper". Snake expert Eric Worrell, in 1961, analysed the skulls of the genus and found that of the red-bellied black snake to be the most divergent. Its position as an early offshoot from the rest of the genus has been confirmed genetically in 2017.
