Branham confronted analysis and resistance from the beginning of the mending effort. As per antiquarian Ronald Kydd, Branham evoked solid assessments from individuals with whom he came into contact; "the vast majority either cherished him or detested him". In 1947, Rev. Alfred Pohl, a clergyman in Saskatchewan, Canada, expressed that numerous individuals Branham articulated as recuperated later passed on. After a year, W. J. Taylor, a region administrator with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, raised a similar concern and requested a careful examination. Taylor exhibited proof that cases of the quantity of individuals mended were inconceivably overestimated. He expressed, "there is a plausibility that the subject of isn't right". The quantity of individuals who professed to be recuperated in Branham's crusade gatherings "is difficult to surmised" and the numbers fluctuate incredibly between sources. As per Kydd, by watching movies of the restoration gatherings, "the watcher would expect nearly everybody was recuperated" yet the outcomes demonstrated generally the multiple times follow-up was made. No predictable record of subsequent meet-ups was made, making investigation of the cases hard to resulting specialists. Pentecostal history specialist Walter Hollenweger stated, "not very many were really mended". A few participants of Branham's gatherings trusted the healings were a fabrication and blamed him for specifically picking who could enter the supplication line. A few people left his gatherings frustrated subsequent to discovering Branham's conviction that everybody in the group of onlookers could be mended without being in the petition line demonstrated wrong. Branham by and large ascribed the disappointment of supplicants to get mending to their absence of confidence.
