He next scored "Lands of Lore III" and "". Klepacki defined "Red Alert 2"s style with heavy metal guitar and fast-paced beats. Klepacki scored the game with a Korg TR Rack, Novation Nova desktop, and Roland XV-5080. "Red Alert 2" included a remix of "Hell March". The return to high-energy songs was owed in part to fan criticism of "Tiberian Sun". Klepacki maintained the energetic style in "Red Alert 2"s expansion pack "Yuri's Revenge". For ""âthe next entry in the seriesâKlepacki tried to update the style of the original "Command & Conquer" by making it "hipper and more elaborate." Several "Command & Conquer" mainstays appear as reworked versions, including "Target (Mechanical Man)", "Industrial", "Act on Instinct", and "No Mercy". The main theme's melody comes from "C&C 80's Mix", a piece composed for "Covert Operations" but scrapped before release. Klepacki's last contribution to Westwood Studios was the music of "Earth & Beyond", comprising four albums of material. Acquired by Electronic Arts in 1998, Westwood was liquidated in 2002 and the remaining employees were relocated to EA Los Angeles. Several Westwood founders left the company. Though Klepacki offered to score "" and submitted a demo to EA, he was not contacted to compose. When asked in 2002 whether he'd continue scoring music after ten years in the business, he exclaimed, "ten down, next ten to go!" After Westwood's closure, he reflected on his past work at a dinner held by Joseph Kucan and other former employees.
