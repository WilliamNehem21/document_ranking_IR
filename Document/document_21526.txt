"Wonder Stories" had a circulation of about 25,000 in 1934, comparable to that of "Amazing Stories", which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, "Wonder Stories Reprint Annual", but it never appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazinesâ"Pirate Stories" and "High Seas Adventures"âbut neither was successful. "Wonder Stories" was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay Laurence Manning, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks for weeks at a time. Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass the dealers, he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute "Wonder Stories" solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of Beacon Magazines and on 21 February 1936 "Wonder Stories" was sold.
