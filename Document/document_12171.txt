The Games start, and almost a large portion of the tributes are murdered in the bloodbath toward the begin, battling about the weapons and supplies all through the field. Katniss slights Haymitch's prior counsel to escape quickly and about kicks the bucket, yet utilizes her all around working on chasing and ingrained instincts to cover up in the forested areas. Following a couple of days, a fake flame drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the "Vocations" tributes and Peeta, who appears to have aligned with them. Lament, covering up in an adjacent tree, quietly alarms Katniss to a "tracker jacker" home, which she sends it falling down, discharging the flying creepy crawlies. Their venom slaughters one of the professions and pushes the others away, however Katniss is stung and starts fantasizing. Peeta returns, yet as opposed to murdering her, advises her to flee. Katniss later structures a partnership with Rue, yet Rue is lethally injured by another tribute while Katniss annihilates the professions' provisions. Katniss murders Rue's executioner with a bolt, and goes with Rue as she kicks the bucket and spreads blooms over the body to demonstrate her insubordination against the Capitol. In appreciation, Rue's locale sends Katniss a portion of bread.
