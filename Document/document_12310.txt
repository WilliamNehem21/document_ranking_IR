The "Analecta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum" claims that he was "a Scot by birth", and that he was conceded into the Dominican Order of Paris in 1219. The last source, be that as it may, is frequently very untrustworthy, and can't be completely trusted. The history specialist Archie Duncan was mindful about a date as firm and ahead of schedule as 1221, and composed that Clement "had entered the Dominican request by the later 1220s". Albeit "Lenient" is neither a Scottish nor an English name, the vast number of French-speakers in both Scotland and England amid this period implies that this thought conveys constrained weight; surely "Forgiving" need not have been his original name. The see of Dunblane was altogether Gaelic-talking in Clement's day, and in this time it was frequently disapproved of for a religious administrator to be uninformed of the language of his bishopric. In the event that this had been a thought in Clement's later arrangement, at that point this would unequivocally recommend that Clement was in truth a Scot. It merits including that Clement was later noted for his aptitude in dialects. Forebearing got his college training at either the University of Oxford or the University of Paris, maybe at both of these foundations. There is a probability that he can be distinguished all the more completely as "Forebearing Rocha". A "Father Clement Rocha" was the proprietor of an original copy from the period presently held in Edinburgh. This, in any case, says nothing all the more regarding his experience.
