The twin arches ascend to a tallness 30ÃÂ metres over the commemoration's stone stage; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the solidarity and penance of the two nations. At the highest point of the arches is a gathering of figures referred to all in all as the "Tune". The most senior figures speak to "Equity" and "Harmony"; "Harmony" remains with a light upraised, making it the most noteworthy point in the district. The pair is in a style like Allward's recently authorized statues of "Truth" and "Equity", situated outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The rest of the "Chorale" is found legitimately underneath the senior figures: "Confidence", "Expectation" and "Truth" on the eastern arch; and "Respect", "Philanthropy" and "Information" on the western arch. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Vast crosses embellish the outside of every arch. The First World War fight praises of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are situated at the base of the arches. The "Soul of Sacrifice" is situated at the base between the two arches. In the presentation, a youthful passing on officer is looking upward in a torturous killing like posture, having tossed his light to a companion who holds it overhead behind him. In a delicately hidden reference to the ballad "In Flanders Fields" by John McCrae, the light is passed starting with one friend then onto the next with an end goal to keep alive the memory of the war dead.
