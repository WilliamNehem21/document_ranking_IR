"I'm Not There" (2007) saw Moore work with Todd Haynes for the third time. The film investigated the life of Bob Dylan, with Moore playing a character dependent on Joan Baez. In 2008, she featured with Mark Ruffalo in "Visual impairment", a tragic spine chiller from the chief Fernando Meirelles. The film was not broadly observed, and commentators were commonly apathetic. Moore was not seen on screen again until late 2009, with three new discharges. She had a supporting job in "The Private Lives of Pippa Lee", and after that featured in the sexual spine chiller "Chloe" with Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. Quickly a short time later, she showed up in the generally welcomed dramatization "A Single Man". Set in 1960s Los Angeles, the film featured Colin Firth as a gay educator who wishes to take his life. Moore played his closest companion, "a kindred English expat and semi-alcoholic divorced person", a character that Tom Ford, the movie's essayist chief, made considering her. Leslie Felperin of "Assortment" remarked that it was Moore's best job in "some time", and was awed by the "uncommon enthusiastic subtlety" of her execution. "A Single Man" was chosen as one of the main 10 movies of 2009 by the American Film Institute, and Moore got a fifth Golden Globe designation for her execution in the film.
