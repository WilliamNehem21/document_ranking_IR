The Superfortresses began to depart their bases at 16:16 local time on 15Â June. The raiding force was led by the 58th Bombardment Wing's commander, Brigadier General Laverne G. Saunders. Of the 75 aircraft dispatched one crashed immediately after taking off with no casualties and a further four turned back suffering mechanical problems. The remaining aircraft proceeded on a direct course to Okino Island where they turned for the run-in to Yawata. Each of the 58th Bombardment Wing's four groups sent two aircraft ahead to mark the target and the other aircraft flew in a long bomber stream; both of these tactics had been adopted from those used by the British Royal Air Force's Bomber Command in Europe. The raiders were detected by Japanese Army and Army Air Force units in China. These reports were passed onto the 19th Air Brigade, which estimated that the bombers were bound for northern KyÅ«shÅ« and would arrive there at about midnight local time. A radar station and lookout posts on Cheju-Do subsequently detected the bombers from 23:31 to 00:30 local time. An air raid alarm was issued at 00:24 and 24 aircraft of the 4th Air Regiment began to take off three minutes later to patrol over northern KyÅ«shÅ«. The 59th Air Regiment was not scrambled as its pilots had not worked with those of the 4th Air Regiment in night operations, its aircraft were suffering from mechanical problems and it was feared that the B-29s would sight and attack the base at Ashiya.
