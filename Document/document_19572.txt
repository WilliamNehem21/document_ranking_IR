Alongside the twinning of the skyway, the QEW was widened to eight lanes between Burlington Street in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then HighwayÂ 2) in Burlington, and to six lanes north to the Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, changeable message signs and traffic cameras were added to create a new traffic-management system called COMPASS. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built at the same time to relieve traffic on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.
With the expanded capacity of the skyway, and the unanticipated traffic volumes on HighwayÂ 403, the Freeman Interchange was now faced with a capacity problem. To resolve this, the renamed Ministry of Transportation began planning on HighwayÂ 403 between Burlington and Mississauga;
this right-of-way would be sold to the 407 ETR consortium in 1995 and built as part of that route.
Work began in August 1991 to rebuild the interchange and add a fourth leg. The rebuilt interchange was opened on OctoberÂ 23, 1993; the first sod for what would open as HighwayÂ 407 was turned that day.
