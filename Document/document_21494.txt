The provisional government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in its quick collapse. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged in the wake of Diá»m's deposal, due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Diá»m. The incidence of Viá»t Cá»ng attacks continued to increase as it had done during the summer of 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification of military statistics by Diá»m's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diá»m's death. Aside from battlefield setbacks, something that was outside his remit, ThÆ¡ was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment. One of the goals of the various anti-Minh coup plots at the time was to remove ThÆ¡, and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from the fact that they were the primary target; at that time, the MRC was moving toward removing ThÆ¡, and Minh was the only senior general to retain confidence in him.
