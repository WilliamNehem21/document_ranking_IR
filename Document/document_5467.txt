Siward kicked the bucket over 10 years before the passing of Edward the Confessor, however in spite of this the "Domesday Book" recorded 4 estates, 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire, claimed legitimately by Earl Siward in 1066, every one of them along these lines held by Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester. This land was expressed to have been worth ÃÂ£212, while his child Waltheof was said to have held ÃÂ£136 worth of land crosswise over 9 regions. Domesday records give an inadequate image of Siward's property. In all out it recorded property worth ÃÂ£348 for Siward and his child, which all alone would contrast inadequately and the ÃÂ£2493 in esteem recorded to have been held by the group of the barons of Mercia. Of the last mentioned, be that as it may, Morcar of Mercia, Earl of Northumbria upon the arrival of King Edward's demise, had land worth ÃÂ£968, while Tostig, banished lord at the time, had land worth ÃÂ£491; both may have come into ownership of a portion of Siward's property over the span of getting to be Earls of Northumbria. In addition, the provinces that would progress toward becoming Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were to a great extent discarded from the study, while, other than being without a doubt, all around ineffectively archived, the grounds in Yorkshire had been seriously crushed and downgraded amid the Harrying of the North.
