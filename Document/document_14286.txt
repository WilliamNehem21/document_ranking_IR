At the episode of World War I in August 1914, "Brandenburg" was reactivated and alloted to the V Squadron, which was at first entrusted with waterfront resistance obligations in the North Sea. In mid-September, the V Squadron was exchanged to the Baltic, under the order of Prince Henry. He at first intended to dispatch a noteworthy land and/or water capable strike on Windau, however a lack of transports constrained an amendment of the arrangement. Rather, the V Squadron was to convey the arrival compel, yet this too was dropped after Heinrich got bogus reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Brandenburg" and the remainder of the squadron came back to Kiel the next day, landed the arrival power, and afterward continued toward the North Sea, where they continued watchman deliver obligations. Prior as far as possible of the year, the V Squadron was indeed exchanged to the Baltic. Ruler Henry next arranged a raid toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the warships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and after that withdrew on the foray. After two days, the armada touched base off Gotland to demonstrate the German banner, and was back in Kiel by 30 December.
