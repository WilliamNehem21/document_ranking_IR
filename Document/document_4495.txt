It was not until 1909 that an "Apatosaurus" skull was found amid the main campaign, driven by Earl Douglass, to what might end up known as the Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. The skull was discovered a short separation from a skeleton (example CM3018) distinguished as the new species "Apatosaurus louisae", named after Louise Carnegie, spouse of Andrew Carnegie, who financed field research to discover total dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was assigned CM11162; it was fundamentally the same as the skull of "Diplodocus". Another littler skeleton of "A.louisae" was discovered close-by CM11162 and CM3018. The skull was acknowledged as having a place with the "Apatosaurus" example by Douglass and Carnegie Museum executive William H. Holland, albeit other scientistsmost eminently Osbornrejected this ID. Holland guarded his view in 1914 out of a location to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some idea Holland was endeavoring to stay away from strife with Osborn, others presumed Holland was holding up until an explained skull and neck were found to affirm the relationship of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's demise in 1934, exhibition hall staff set a cast of a "Camarasaurus" skull on the mount.
