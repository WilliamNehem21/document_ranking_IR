Starting with the 12thÃÂ century, essential socio-political changes occurred in the Deccan, south of the Krishna stream. Amid this period, the Hoysalas, local Kannadigas from the Malnad area (slope nation in present day Karnataka) were on the ascendant as a political power. They are referred to have existed as chieftains from the mid-10thÃÂ century when they separated themselves as subordinates of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani. In 1116, Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana vanquished the Cholas of Tanjore and attached Gangavadi (portions of current southern Karnataka), in this way bringing the locale back under local guideline. In the next decades, with the fading of the Chalukya control, the Hoysalas announced freedom and developed into a standout amongst the most dominant decision groups of southern India. Therefore, writing in Kannada, the nearby language, prospered in the Hoysala domain. This writing can be extensively subdivided as pursues: works overwhelmed by the subjects of Jain compositions, differentiating works by Veerashaiva authors not having a place with the vachana wonderful convention, counters to Shaiva compositions from Jain scholars, early brahminical works (Vaishnava), works from the introduction of the Bhakti (reverential) development in the Kannada-talking locale, works on common themes, and the primary compositions in local meters ("ragale", "sangatya" and "shatpadi").
