"Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All" is a musically dynamic collection including long and complex tunes, quick rhythms and few section melody structures. Metallica chose to widen its sonic range, composing tunes with numerous segments, substantial guitar arpeggios and irregular time marks. Hetfield later clarified: "Songwriting-wise, [the album] was simply us truly appearing and attempting to indicate what we could do. 'We've stuck six riffs into one melody? How about we make it eight. How about we run insane with it.'" Music faultfinder Simon Reynolds noticed the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the collection's epically developed melodies: "The rhythm shifts, gear changes, omissions, decelerations and unexpected ends". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack composed that "Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All" sounds not the same as the band's past collections, with longer melodies, sparser courses of action, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. As per writer Martin Popoff, the collection is less melodic than its ancestors in light of its successive beat changes, unordinary tune structures and layered guitars. He contended that the collection is all the more a dynamic metal record in view of its unpredictably performed music and dreary sound. Music essayist Joel McIver called the collection's music sufficiently forceful for Metallica to keep up its place with groups "at the mellower end of extraordinary metal". As per author Christopher Knowles, Metallica took "the whip idea to its obvious end result" on the collection.
