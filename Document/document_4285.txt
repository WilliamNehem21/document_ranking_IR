The species initially landed in North America in 1941 (these early sightings were initially rejected as escapees), reproduced in Florida in 1953, and spread quickly, rearing without precedent for Canada in 1962. It is currently normally observed as far west as California. It was first recorded reproducing in Cuba in 1957, in Costa Rica in 1958, and in Mexico in 1963, in spite of the fact that it was likely settled before at that point. In Europe, the species had truly declined in Spain and Portugal, yet in the last piece of the twentieth century, it extended back through the Iberian Peninsula, and afterward started to colonize different pieces of Europe, southern France in 1958, northern France in 1981, and Italy in 1985. Reproducing in the United Kingdom was recorded without precedent for 2008, just a year after a deluge found in the earlier year. In 2008, steers egrets were additionally announced as having moved into Ireland out of the blue. This pattern has proceeded and dairy cattle egrets have turned out to be progressively various in southern Britain with deluges in certain numbers amid the nonbreeding periods of 2007/08 and 2016/17. They reared in Britain again in 2017, after a convergence in the past winter, and may wind up set up there.
