After days of continued downpours in Gert's wake, the PÃ¡nuco River rose to 27.60Â ft (8.72Â m) above normal by SeptemberÂ 27âits highest level in 40 years. Once again exceeding its banks, the river destroyed a major levee in city of PÃ¡nuco, forcing 8,000 residents to evacuate. Disastrous flooding reached as far north as southern Tamaulipas, where 5,000 people had to seek refuge. Half of Tampico was coated in deep layers of mud, with scores of structures demolished. The urban areas of Madero and Altamira were also hit by the deluge. Roughly of land around the PÃ¡nuco basin and Tampico were under water, including vast amounts of citrus, coffee, corn, maiz, bean, grain, and soy crops. Telephone, water, and electricity services throughout the region were severely disrupted, and numerous communities were isolated due to broken bridges and roads. In San Luis PotosÃ­, water damage to schools, bridges, and roads was particularly widespread. The agricultural sector suffered heavy losses when the flooding washed away large amounts of livestock and roughly 80Â percent of its crops. Throughout the state, 55,000Â residents were affected by the storm, and 25Â people lost their lives. Gert's trail of destruction extended as far inland as Hidalgo, where 35Â rivers overtopped their banks. Floods and mudslides destroyed 38Â bridges and 86Â roads, as well cutting off power, telephone, and water services, disrupting communication in 361Â localities.
