In September 1893, a noteworthy burglary at the Philadelphia Mint had been found. Henry Cochran, gauging assistant, had been clandestinely extricating gold bars from a vault fixed in 1887, not with a strong entryway but rather with a latticed one that was to some degree free. Bosbyshell, in taking guardianship of the Philadelphia Mint's advantages from his ancestor, Daniel Fox, had not requested the gold to be gauged. At the point when the gold was taken out to be changed over into coin in 1893, the deficiency was found. Albeit a portion of the gold was recouped, there was as yet a lack of $12,810.82, and the legislature brought suit against Bosbyshell after he left office in 1894, verifying judgment against him and the sureties on his bond. Bosbyshell spoke to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which ruled against him. The region court had ruled for Bosbyshell on the matter of 733 silver dollars said to miss, leaving just the topic of the gold. Bosbyshell requested survey by the Supreme Court, yet in addition looked for authoritative alleviation, and on February 2, 1899, Congress exculpated him of the obligation, putting forth the court defense disputable.
