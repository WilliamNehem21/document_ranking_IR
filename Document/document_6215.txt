"Creative ability" is by and large idea of by students of history of sci-fi as one of the more fragile magazines of the 1950s, in spite of its relative life span. Donald Tuck, in his "Reference book of Science Fiction and Fantasy", expelled the books it distributed, saying, "very few were essential, most being in the interplanetary/space musical show/experience field", and Brian Stableford, a sci-fi author and faultfinder, portrayed it as managing "basically in routine space musical drama." James Blish, composing under the pen name "Atheling, Jr.", which he utilized for a portion of his basic composition, commented that it was a "broadly new" magazine. Hamling's publication approach was intentionally inclined against intellectualism. In the November 1951 issue he remarked that "sci-fi was never intended to be an instructive "visit de compel". The purported "grown-up" story is just an endeavor to demonstrate the peruser how moronic he is and how savvy the supervisor is." "Creative ability's" approach, he stated, was to distribute amusement: "What we need is a little unwinding. What's more, engaging perusing is one approach to get it." Some perusers concurred with Hamling; a 1952 issue of "Rhodomagnetic Digest", a fanzine, contains affirming critique on Hamling's publication by Gregg Calkins, an aficionado of the period.
