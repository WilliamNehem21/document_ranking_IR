As the IPHL persuaded players to move to the United States and get paid to play, hockey groups in Canada were compelled to coordinate the pay rates so as to keep their players. Stuart, who was troubled playing in Pittsburgh due to the brutality engaged with diversions, got notification from Dickie Boon that the Montreal Wanderers, guarding Stanley Cup victors, of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) were eager to make Stuart the most generously compensated player in hockey if he somehow happened to join the group. On December 13, 1906, Stuart had a letter distributed in the "Montreal Star" that point by point his issues with the IPHL. Stuart's central concern was the administering; he said they "don't have the foggiest idea how to run hockey here, the arena individuals choose the most imbecilic and clumsy officials that could be found." In December 1906 Pittsburgh wouldn't play a diversion against Michigan Soo, guaranteeing they didn't care for the decision of arbitrator. While a typical issue in the IPHL, Pittsburgh's administration trusted Stuart was behind the activity, and discharged him from the group. Never again bound to any group, Stuart joined the Wanderers; his first amusement with the group was viewed by 6,069 fans. He participated in the Wanderers' Stanley Cup challenge against the New Glasgow Cubs, a group from Nova Scotia, on December 27 and 29, 1906, and alongside colleagues Riley Hern, Frank Glass, Moose Johnson and Jack Marshall, turned into the principal proficient hockey players to seek the Stanley Cup.
