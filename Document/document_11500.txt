The ruler discovered satisfaction in exercises that required physical aptitudes, as opposed to in the study hall. At his dad's Santa Cruz ranch, Pedro prepared whole steeds, and turned into a fine horseman and a phenomenal farrier. He and his sibling Miguel delighted in mounted chases over new ground, through timberlands, and even during the evening or in harsh climate. He showed an ability for illustration and crafted works, putting forth a concentrated effort to wood cutting and furniture making. Also, he had a desire for music, and under the direction of Marcos Portugal the ruler turned into a capable author. He had a decent performing voice, and was capable with a few melodic instruments (counting piano, woodwind and guitar), playing prominent tunes and moves. Pedro was a straightforward man, both in propensities and in managing others. Aside from on grave events when he wore court dress, his day by day clothing comprised of white cotton pants, striped cotton coat and an expansive overflowed straw cap, or a gown coat and a top cap in increasingly formal circumstances. He would as often as possible set aside some effort to take part in discussion with individuals in the city, taking note of their worries.
