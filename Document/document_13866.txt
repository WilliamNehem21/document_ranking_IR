The group purchased a few hundred of the ten-penny First Man on the Moon postage stamp issue. These were joined to the lightweight envelopes by secretaries in the Astronaut Office. Collins had made game plans for the KSC present office on open at 1:00ÃÂ am EDT on dispatch dayÃ¢ÂÂopening this office so at an early stage an Apollo dispatch morning was not strangeÃ¢ÂÂand brought a few hundred of the stepped spreads. When the envelopes had been gone through the wiping out machine, he took them to the space explorer quarters, where individuals from the Flight Crew Support Team vacuum fixed them in teflon-secured fiberglass to flame resistant them for space. Regularly, if the Flight Crew Support Team found that a thing was not on a space traveler's PPK list, they would include it, and ensure they were endorsed, yet group pioneer James L. Smotherman expressed that he "goofed", clarifying that he had confounded the 400 spreads with the Herrick envelopes, which had been endorsed by Slayton. Since the 400 spreads had not been affirmed by Slayton, they were viewed as unapproved. Scott expressed, "I never planned to contraband the spreads. On the off chance that I had planned to contraband the spreads, I unquestionably would not have permitted Mr. Collins to deal with them or the remainder of the general population to help me." Like different things being set in the pockets on Scott's space suit (for instance, his shades), they were first appeared to him by the suit professionals helping him dress. Isolated into two parcels, the packaged spreads were about thick and weighed about ; they entered the rocket in Scott's pocket. Apollo 15 launched for the Moon at 9:34ÃÂ am on July 26, 1971, with three space travelers and around 641 covers on board.
