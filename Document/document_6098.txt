Maslin considered the movie a noteworthy directorial debut that tells a delicate story with an amazing measure of adoring consideration, and Klady saying the main failings came when Darabont concentrated for a really long time on supporting characters, or adorned an optional story. "The Hollywood Reporter" said that both the coordinating and composing were fresh, while condemning the film's long running time. Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by amusingness and startling occasions, would hose the film's standard intrigue, yet the story offered an entrancing picture of the inborn humankind of the detainees. Gleiberman detested that the detainees' wrongdoings were ignored to depict them more as heroes. Turan correspondingly questioned what he saw as outrageous brutality and assault scenes, and making the vast majority of the detainees appear like a "group of swell and kindhearted folks" to cast the jail involvement in a "ruddy sparkle". Klady condensed the film as "respectable and frequenting stimulation", contrasting it with a harsh jewel with little defects, yet Howe censured it for straying with numerous subplots, and pandering by settling the story with Andy's and Red's gathering, instead of leaving the secret. Ebert noticed that the story works since it isn't about Andy as the saint, yet how Red sees him.
