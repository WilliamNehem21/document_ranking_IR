Smith's commitments have been regarded with various tributes by Russians and by the general population of her home province of Maine. A landmark to her was worked in Moscow; "Samantha Smith Alley" in the Artek Young Pioneer camp was named after her in 1986. The landmark worked to Smith was stolen by metal criminals in 2003 after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2003, Voronezh retiree Valentin Vaulin manufactured a landmark to her with no help from the legislature. The Soviet Union issued a memorial stamp with her resemblance. In 1986 Soviet space expert Lyudmila Chernykh found space rock 3147, which she named 3147 Samantha. Danish author Per NÃÂ¸rgÃÂ¥rd composed his 1985 viola concerto "Recalling Child" in memory of Smith. A jewel found in Siberia, a mountain in the previous Soviet Union, a cultivar of tulips and of dahlias, and a sea vessel have been named in Smith's respect. In Maine, the primary Monday in June of every year is authoritatively assigned as Samantha Smith Day by state law. There is a bronze statue of Smith close to the Maine State Museum in Augusta, which depicts Smith discharging a pigeon with a bear whelp resting at her feet. The bear whelp speaks to both Maine and Russia. Primary schools in Sammamish, Washington, and in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, have been named after Samantha. In October 1985, Smith's mom established The Samantha Smith Foundation, which encouraged understudy trades between the United States and the Soviet Union (and, after December 1991, the ex-Soviet successor states) until it ended up torpid in the mid-1990s. The Foundation was formally broken down in 2014 following two many years of lethargy.
