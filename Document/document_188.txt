The otters structure the subfamily Lutrinae inside the mustelids and the mammoth otter is the main individual from the sort "Pteronura". Two subspecies are right now perceived by the authoritative Mammal Species of the World, "P. b. brasiliensis" and "P. b. paraguensis". Off base portrayals of the species have prompted different equivalent words (the last subspecies is regularly "P. b. paranensis" in the writing). "P. b. brasiliensis" is dispersed over the north of the goliath otter go, including the Orinoco, Amazon, and Guianas stream frameworks; toward the south, "P. b. paraguensis" has been proposed in Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina, in spite of the fact that it might be terminated in the last three of these four. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) considers the species' essence in Argentina and Uruguay questionable. In the previous, examination has appeared dispersed populace remainders. "P. b. paraguensis" is evidently littler and progressively gregarious, with various dentition and skull morphology. Carter and Rosas, in any case, dismissed the subspecific division in 1997, taking note of the grouping had just been approved once, in 1968, and the "P. b. paraguensis" type example was fundamentally the same as "P. b. brasiliensis". Researcher Nicole Duplaix calls the division of "far fetched esteem".
