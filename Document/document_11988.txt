The ruler's gathering involved the house in RÃÂ©union for just shy of two years. As pressures among England and France started to mount by and by, this time over the contention in Sudan, the French experts ended up worried that components of the populace in Madagascar may catch the chance to dispatch another resistance to French guideline. The ruler's vicinity to Madagascar was viewed as a conceivable wellspring of consolation for would-be Malagasy rebels. French specialists settled on a sudden choice to evacuate Ranavalona and her gathering to Algeria, an increasingly inaccessible area. On February 1, 1899, with almost no admonishing, Ranavalona and her family were requested on board the "Yang-Tse" joined by a secretary-mediator and a few servants. Amid the 28-day adventure to the French port of Marseilles, the travelers ceased over at such ports as Mayotte, Zanzibar, Aden and Djibouti. All through the trek, the different skippers in charge of the voyage were compelled to keep Ranavalona from talking with any individual who was not French. The gathering was held for a while at Marseilles before being exchanged to a manor in the Mustapha Superieur region in Algiers. Ranavalona had wanted to proceed to Paris and was enormously baffled to learn she was rather being sent to Algeria, apparently sobbing uncontrollably, weeping hysterically, and commenting, "Who is sure of tomorrow? Just yesterday I was a ruler; today I am essentially a troubled, beaten down lady."
