Following the declaration, USC Interactive Media Division pulled back its sponsorship of the celebration. Seven of the fourteen finalist diversions were expelled from the challenge by their engineers in dissent: "Mesh", "Stream", "Quite a long time ago", "Toblo", "Regular Shooter", "Book and Volume" and "Palace Crashers" ("Toblo" was later reestablished by the DigiPen Institute of Technology, who possesses the rights to the amusement). Designer Jonathan Blow of "Mesh" expressed: "["Super Columbine Massacre"] needs empathy, and I discover the Artist's Statement guileful. Be that as it may, notwithstanding this, the diversion has reclaiming esteem. It provokes critical contemplations, and it pushes the limits of what diversions are about. It is made with more out of an eye toward workmanship than generally diversions. Plainly, it has a place at the celebration." Blow and different designers sent an open letter to the celebration, empowering the restoration of the amusement as keeping with the celebration's "trailblazing" endeavors. In spite of dissents, Baxter would not alter his opinion, refering to thought for the shooting's unfortunate casualties and their families. Ledonne told different finalists that he wanted to go to the celebration at any rate and disseminate duplicates of the diversion. Recognizing that the withdrawal of six finalists traded off the challenge, Roberts let the participants vote on whether any prizes would be granted; they chose not to.
