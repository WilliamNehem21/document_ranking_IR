On 31Â October 2011, "Achtung Baby" was reissued in five formats. In addition to a single-disc release of the album, a deluxe edition included a bonus disc of remixes and B-sides from the album's five singles, and a vinyl edition included the album on two LPs with two additional LPs of remixes. The 10-disc "Super Deluxe" and "Ãber Deluxe" editions included: the "Zooropa" album; three additional CDs with remixes, B-sides, and outtakes; a "kindergarten" disc with nascent versions of "Achtung Baby"s 12Â songs; four DVDs containing "From the Sky Down", the "Zoo TV: Live from Sydney" concert film, music videos, and other bonus material; 16 art prints; and a hardback book. The "Ãber Deluxe" edition also contains a double-vinyl copy of the album, five 7-inch vinyl singles, a copy of U2's fan club magazine "Propaganda", and a replica of Bono's "Fly" sunglasses. The media initially reported that the reissue was a remastered release. However, the reissue's official website initially excluded any mention of "remastering" before adding it and then removing it. The Edge confirmed that the album was not fully remastered since "the original was so right" and so much "artistry had gone into the original EQ'ing" but did say said that they were able to "optimize it... tweak the levels, give it a bit of a polish". "Blow Your House Down", an outtake included in the deluxe editions, was released as a promotional single in October 2011.
