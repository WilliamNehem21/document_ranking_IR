Sources vary on the exact number of losses delivered by the rocket strikes. Receptacle Laden protector Abu Jandal and activist student Abdul Rahman Khadr later assessed that just six men had been slaughtered in the strikes. The Taliban guaranteed 22 Afghans slaughtered and more than 50 truly harmed, while Berger put al-Qaeda losses at somewhere in the range of 20 and 30 men.

A declassified September 9, 1998, State Department link expressed that around 20 Pakistanis and 15 Arabs passed on, out of an aggregate of more than 50 executed in the assault. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen's pioneer, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, at first asserted a loss of life of more than 50 aggressors, yet later said that he had lost less than ten contenders.
