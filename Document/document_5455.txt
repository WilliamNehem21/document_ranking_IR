The apparition parasite was at first depicted in 1844 by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley as "Agaricus nidiformis". Berkeley felt it was identified with "Agaricus ostreatus" (presently "Pleurotus ostreatus") however commented it was an "unmistakably progressively grand animal varieties". Material was initially gathered by Scottish naturalist James Drummond in 1841 on "Banksia" wood along the Swan River. He expressed "when this organism was laid on a paper, it discharged by night a luminous light, empowering us to peruse the words around it; and it kept on doing as such for a few evenings with progressively diminishing force as the plant evaporated." More material gathered from close to the base of a "debilitated yet living" bush ("Grevillea drummondii") was named as "Agaricus lampas" by Berkeley. He noted both were luminous and firmly related species. Tasmanian botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn gathered material in October 1845 from that state, which Berkeley felt contrasted from past accumulations in having more separated and less decurrent gills and a shorter stipe, and named it "Agaricus phosphorus" in 1848. Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo put every one of the three named taxa in the variety "Pleurotus" in 1887. These names have been synonymised with "O.ÃÂ nidiformis", in spite of the fact that the name "Pleurotus lampas" continued in certain writings, including the 1934Ã¢ÂÂ 35 monograph of Australian organisms by John Burton Cleland. In evaluating the distributed writing, Victorian herbal contact officer Jim Willis knew about Rolf Singer's putting of "Pleurotus olearius" into the family "Omphalotus", yet held back before exchanging the phantom parasite over, despite the fact that he surrendered it was wrongly set in "Pleurotus". Examining the species in 1994, Orson K. Mill operator, Jr. gave the phantom organism its present binomial name when he exchanged it to the sort "Omphalotus" with other bioluminescent mushrooms.
