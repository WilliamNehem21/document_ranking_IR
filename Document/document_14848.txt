Such movement wound down when it turned out to be certain that the ship couldn't be raised by the innovation of the time. Be that as it may, "Vasa" did not fall totally into lack of definition after the recuperation of the firearms. The ship was referenced in a few accounts of Sweden and the Swedish Navy, and the area of the disaster area showed up on harbor outlines of Stockholm in the nineteenth century. In 1844, the naval force officer Anton Ludwig Fahnehjelm turned in a solicitation for rescuing rights to the ship, guaranteeing he had found it. Fahnehjelm was an innovator who structured an early type of light jumping suit and had recently been engaged with other rescue tasks. There were jumps made on the disaster area in 1895Ã¢ÂÂ 1896, and a business rescue organization connected for a license to raise or rescue the disaster area in 1920, yet this was turned down. In 1999, an observer additionally guaranteed that his dad, a negligible officer in the Swedish naval force, had partaken in jumping practices on "Vasa" in the prior years World War I. There is no proof that anybody visited the disaster area site after this until the start of the cutting edge "Vasa" venture.
