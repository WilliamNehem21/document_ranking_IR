The palatable "Coprinellus bisporus" is about indistinguishable yet does not have the yellowish top granules and just has two spores for every basidium. The textured inky top ("Coprinus variegatus" = "Coprinus quadrifidus") has a grayish-dark colored top with dull white to earthy scales; its smell is offensive. The trooping disintegrate top ("Coprinellus disseminatus", consumable) has littler, yellow-dark colored to dim darker tops and white gills that turn dark yet don't break down away; it generally develops in extensive bunches on spoiling wood (here and there covered wood). "Coprinus atramentarius" is a bigger, dim animal groups that develops in thick bunches on stumps or on the ground from covered wood, needs sparkling particles on the top, and the top and gills break down at development. "Coprinellus radians" grows separately or in bunches from a tufted tangle of coarse yellow-orange mycelium on the wood. "Coprinellus truncorum" is likewise secured with sparkling granules and is said to be practically vague from "C.ÃÂ micaceus" in the field; microscopy is expected to differentiate, as "C.ÃÂ truncorum" has ellipsoid spores with an adjusted germ pore, contrasted with the shield-molded (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of "C.ÃÂ micaceus". One examination recommends that contrasted with "C.ÃÂ truncorum", "C.ÃÂ micaceus" is browner in the focal point of the top (instead of grayish) and has a more prominent inclination to develop in groups; progressively atomic proof is required to decide whether the two taxa are hereditarily indistinguishable.
