In September 1963, after Cox was released from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and shaped a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and at this point Alphonso 'Infant Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was playing out this guitar trick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix figured out how to play with his teeth. He later remarked: "doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there you need to play with your teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth everywhere throughout the stage." Although they started playing low-paying gigs at darken settings, the band in the end moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the customary heart of the city's dark network and home to a flourishing cadence and blues music scene. They earned a short residency playing at a well known setting around the local area, the Club del Morocco, and for the following two years Hendrix brought home the bacon performing at a circuit of scenes all through the South that were partnered with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), generally known as the Chitlin' Circuit. Notwithstanding playing in his own band, Hendrix executed as a sponsorship artist for different soul, R&B, and blues artists, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, Ike and Tina Turner and Jackie Wilson.
