In November 1942, "Argus" was allocated toward the Eastern Naval Task Force that attacked Algiers, Algeria, amid the Allied arrivals in French North Africa with 18 Supermarine Seafire IICs of 880 Squadron on board. The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that executed four men. She and the escort bearer joined a guard coming back to the United Kingdom on the night of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. torpedoed "Justice fighter", directly behind "Argus" in the guard, later that morning. The ship was under fix for a month after she achieved the United Kingdom, yet she required a progressively careful refit that kept going from February to May 1943. Renamed as an escort transporter after the consummation of her refit, she was consigned to deck-landing preparing. She was requested to be satisfied on 27 January 1944, yet this request was evidently repudiated as she kept preparing until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was produced using her deck. In March, she was requested to be changed over to an air ship vessel around the year's end, yet this arrangement was additionally obviously dropped. "Argus" turned into a convenience send at Chatham in December and she was endorsed for rejecting on 6 May 1946. She was sold to Thos W Ward on 5 December 1946 and landed at Inverkeithing soon thereafter to be separated.
