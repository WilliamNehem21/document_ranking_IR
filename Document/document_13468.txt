Dick Rubin took care of the film's props, and set up a temporary office toward the side of stage 9 all through creation. Rubin's reasoning as property ace was that about each performer or additional should have something in their grasp. All things considered, Rubin concocted and created around 350 props for the film, 55 of which were utilized in the San Francisco cable car scene alone. A significant number of the props were refreshed structures of things recently found in the TV arrangement, for example, phasers and handheld communicators. The main prop that stayed from the first TV arrangement was Uhura's remote earpiece, which Nichols explicitly mentioned on the principal day of shooting (and all the generation team spare the individuals who had taken a shot at the network show had overlooked). The new phaser was totally independent, with its own hardware, batteries, and four flickering lights. The prop accompanied a heavy $4000 sticker price; to set aside extra cash, the lights were dropped, diminishing the extent of the phaser by a third. An aggregate of 15 of the gadgets were made for the film. The communicators were profoundly changed, as by the 1970s the small scale scaling down of gadgets persuaded Roddenberry that the massive handheld gadgets of the TV arrangement were never again authentic. A wrist-put together structure was chosen with respect to, with the arrangement that it appear to be far unique from the watch Dick Tracy had been utilizing for a considerable length of time past. Two hundred communicators were formed, however just a couple were the $3500 top models, utilized for close-ups of the gadget in real life. The vast majority of the props were produced using plastic, as Rubin believed that later on man-made materials would be utilized solely.
