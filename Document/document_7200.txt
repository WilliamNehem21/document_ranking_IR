The trains left Liverpool on schedule and with no specialized issues. The Duke of Wellington's exceptional train kept running on one track, and the other seven trains kept running on a neighboring and parallel track, now and again ahead and some of the time behind the Duke's train. Around out of Liverpool the first of numerous issues happened, when one of the trains wrecked and the accompanying train crashed into it. With no detailed wounds or harm, the crashed train was lifted back onto the track and the adventure proceeded. At Parkside railroad station, close to the midpoint of the line, the trains made a booked stop to take on water. In spite of the fact that the railroad staff prompted travelers to stay on the trains while this occurred, around 50 of the dignitaries on board landed when the Duke of Wellington's exceptional train halted. One of the individuals who got off was William Huskisson, previous bureau priest and Member of Parliament for Liverpool. Huskisson had been an exceedingly compelling figure in the making of the British Empire and an engineer of the regulation of organized commerce, however had dropped out with Wellington in 1828 over the issue of parliamentary change and had left the bureau. Wanting to be accommodated with Wellington, he moved toward the Duke's railroad carriage and shook his hand. Occupied by the Duke, he didn't see a moving toward train on the adjoining track, "Rocket". On acknowledging it was moving toward he terrified and endeavored to scramble into the Duke's carriage, however the entryway of the carriage swung open abandoning him hanging straightforwardly in the way of the approaching "Rocket". He fell onto the tracks before the train, enduring genuine leg wounds and kicking the bucket soon thereafter.
