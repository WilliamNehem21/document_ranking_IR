Age caste polyethism does not occur in "Nothomyrmecia", where the younger workers act as nurses and tend to the brood and the older workers go out and forage. The only ant known other than "Nothomyrmecia" which does not exhibit age caste polyethism is "Stigmatomma pallipes". Workers are strictly nocturnal, and only emerge from their nests on cold nights. They are most active at temperatures of , and are much more difficult to locate on warmer nights. Workers are possibly most active when it is cold because at these times they encounter fewer and less aggressive competitors, including other more dominant diurnal ant species that are sometimes found foraging during warm nights. Cold temperatures may also hamper the escape of prey items, so increasing the ants' hunting success. Unless a forager has captured prey, workers stay on trees for the remainder of the night until dawn, possibly relying on sunlight to navigate back to their nest. There is no evidence that they use chemical trails when foraging; instead, workers rely on visual cues to navigate around. Chemical markers may play an important role in recognising nest entrances. The ants are solitary foragers. Waste material, such as dead nestmates, cocoon shells, and food remnants, are disposed of far away from the nest.
