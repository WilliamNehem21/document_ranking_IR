Lynd visits Bond each day as he recovers in medical clinic, and he step by step understands that he cherishes her; he even thinks about leaving the Secret Service to settle down with her. When he is discharged from emergency clinic they get to know one another at a calm visitor house and in the long run become sweethearts. One day they see a puzzling man named Gettler following their developments, which enormously bothers Lynd. The next morning, Bond finds that she has ended it all. She deserts a note clarifying that she had been filling in as a reluctant twofold specialist for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. SMERSH had hijacked her sweetheart, a Polish Royal Air Force pilot, who had uncovered data about her under torment; SMERSH then utilized that data to extort her into helping them undermine Bond's main goal, including her very own faked seizing. She had endeavored to begin another existence with Bond, yet after observing GettlerÃ¢ÂÂa SMERSH operatorÃ¢ÂÂshe understood that she could never be free of her tormentors, and that remaining with Bond would just place him in peril. Bond educates his administration of Lynd's guile, icily telling his contact, "The bitch is dead at this point."
