Because of the episode of World War I, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and her sisters were brought out of hold and activated as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The boats were set up for war all around gradually, and were not prepared for administration in the North Sea until the finish of August. They were at first entrusted with beach front guard, yet they served in this limit with respect to an exceptionally brief time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was exchanged to the Baltic, under the direction of Prince Heinrich. He at first intended to dispatch a noteworthy land and/or water capable strike against the Russians at Windau, yet a lack of transports constrained an update of the arrangement. Rather, the V Squadron was to convey the arrival drive, however this too was dropped after Heinrich got bogus reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse " and her sisters came back to Kiel the next day, landed the arrival power, and after that continued toward the North Sea, where they continued watchman send obligations. Prior as far as possible of the year, the V Squadron was indeed exchanged to the Baltic.
