Inside the Quichean sub-branch KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼ (QuichÃÂ©), the Mayan language with the biggest number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼ Maya in the Guatemalan good countries, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the CuchumatÃÂ¡n mountains, just as by urban displaced people in Guatemala City. The renowned Maya fanciful archive, "Popol Vuh", is written in an obsolete KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼ regularly called Classical KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼ (or QuichÃÂ©). The KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼ culture was at its apex at the season of the Spanish success. QÃÂ¼umarkaj, close to the present-day city of Santa Cruz del QuichÃÂ©, was its monetary and stately focus. Achi is spoken by 85,000 individuals in Cubulco and Rabinal, two "municipios" of Baja Verapaz. In certain orders, for example the one by Campbell, Achi is considered a type of KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼. Be that as it may, inferable from an authentic division between the two ethnic gatherings, the Achi Maya don't view themselves as KÃÂ¼icheÃÂ¼. The Kaqchikel language is spoken by around 400,000 individuals in a territory extending from Guatemala City westbound toward the northern shore of Lake AtitlÃÂ¡n. TzÃÂ¼utujil has around 90,000 speakers in the region of Lake AtitlÃÂ¡n. Different individuals from the KÃÂ¼ichean branch are Sakapultek, spoken by around 15,000 individuals generally in El QuichÃÂ© division, and Sipakapense, which is spoken by 8,000 individuals in Sipacapa, San Marcos.
