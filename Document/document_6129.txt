In 1138 King Stephen picked Theobald to fill the empty archbishopric of Canterbury over Stephen's very own sibling Henry, the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped Stephen gain the position of authority of England. Stephen expected that Henry would be excessively incredible as ecclesiastical overseer, and would endeavor to control the lord. The race occurred on 24ÃÂ December; Stephen was available with the ecclesiastical legate, Alberic of Ostia, and a little gathering of noblemen and religious administrators, however Henry was missing administering the appointment of elders. Most students of history think about that Stephen organized the decision's planning to guarantee Henry's nonappearance. Henry trusted that Theobald had been chosen due to Stephen's worries as well as in light of the fact that Waleran of Meulan, the lay supporter of Bec, was endeavoring to put his own man in a standout amongst the most dominant positions in England. Waleran and his twin sibling Robert, Earl of Leicester, were Henry's central opponents for Stephen's support, and Henry loathed them two seriously. In spite of the fact that Theobald was devout and knowledgeable, he had just progressed toward becoming abbot the prior year, and his decision was presumably impacted by the notoriety of his religious community, which had just created two ecclesiastical overseers of Canterbury, Lanfranc and Anselm. Theobald had no imperative family associations with development his profession, and couple of administrative partners.
