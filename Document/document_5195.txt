In its first decades, the gathering adored in different areas in downtown Memphis, close to the Mississippi River waterfront. It got a $2,000 (today $) endowment from the domain of New Orleans giver Judah Touro, and utilized it to buy a great deal on Second Street, yet did not feel monetarily safe enough to manufacture a synagogue, and inevitably sold the property. The assemblage rather held administrations in individuals' homes in 1853, and in this way (until 1857) leased different premises on Front Street. The Touro reserves in the long run empowered the individuals to rent the Farmers and Merchants Bank working at Main and Exchange avenues in late 1857, which they changed over to a synagogue. Assets for the remodel were raised by two boards of trustees; one requested gifts from "every one of the Israelites in this city", while the other's undertaking was "to get memberships from Gentiles". Extra assets were raised by selling individuals saved seats in the new asylum. A sale was hung on , 1858, in which 50 men's seats were sold for $343 (today $), and 44 women's' seats for $158 (today $). The redesigned premises had seating for 150 men and roughly 50 ladies. In 1860, the gathering contracted to buy the property; by 1865, it possessed it by and large and was without obligation. On , 2007, 153 years to the day after the assemblage got its contract from the State of Tennessee, a recorded marker was raised by the Shelby County Historical Commission, the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, and Temple Israel, on the corner where the synagogue had once stood. It portrayed the structure as the "Principal Permanent Jewish House of Worship in Tennessee".
