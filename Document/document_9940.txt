While the repairman may not be as innovative as it was a couple of years prior, it's as yet a conventional amusement to look at. On the off chance that you never observed the PSP form or haven't played recreations like Fez or Echochrome, I'd prescribe looking at this to perceive what pounding is about." However, "Computerized Spy"s Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and expressed: "Regardless of the five-year hole between discharges, "Squash 3D" makes a couple of strides in reverse as far as visual style and introduction. Other than a fairly constrained and dreary determination of new dimensions and StreetPass highlights, it likewise offers next to no in the method for pristine reward content, making it hard to prescribe to anyone acquainted with its PSP partner. In spite of its weaknesses, be that as it may, "Pulverize 3D" hits the nail on the head where it matters most."
