After the separation was finished, Boyce sought Virginia Dorcas Lee, a vocalist from Oak Park, Illinois, who was 23ÃÂ years his lesser and the oldest offspring of Virginia and John Adams Lee, a previous Lieutenant Governor of Missouri. Both Virginia's folks and Boyce's child Ben contradicted the relationship. In May 1910, after the arranged marriage was reported, an angered Ben fought with his dad outside the Blackstone Hotel and Boyce continued a facial injury. Ben was captured for dislocated direct and fined $5 and court costs. After two days, Boyce and Virginia wedded and went to Europe on an all-inclusive special night. Very quickly, there was theory among relatives and in papers about issues inside the marriage. On April 9, 1911, Boyce and Virginia had a little girl, whom they named Virginia. A couple of months after the fact, in December 1911, Boyce consented to an arrangement to help and teach their baby little girl. After Boyce's better half sought legal separation in March 1912, she moved to Santa Barbara, California, with their little girl and her folks. Boyce did not challenge the separation and masterminded a $100,000 settlement. A long time later, the senior Virginia wedded Richard Roberts, a New York investor, and moved with her and Boyce's little girl to Greenwich, Connecticut. The more youthful Virginia took the surname Roberts. She didn't meet her characteristic dad, Boyce, until she was eight years of age.
