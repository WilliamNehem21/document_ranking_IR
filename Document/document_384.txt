The dorsal vertebrae of NHMUK R3078 are inadequate or fragmentary. A halfway foremost dorsal is known from a solitary centrum, which is about as long as wide, with a solid front articular ball (an opisthocoelous condition). On the sidelong surfaces (sides) of the centrum there are profound however little pleurocoels (despondencies in the sides of vertebrae for air sacs). A solitary center dorsal centrum is protected, being somewhat littler than the foremost dorsal. The pleurocoel is progressively prolong, yet like the front dorsal there is no ventral (underside) concavity. A back dorsal is additionally known and is likely the last dorsal before the sacrum (vertebrae between the pelves). It saves the whole centrum and the greater part of the neural curve, and is essentially abbreviated long contrasted with the different dorsals, despite the fact that it is about as wide crosswise over as tall. A shallow pleurocoel is likewise present, yet is put higher in favor of the centrum and vanishes into the neural curve. Not at all like the foremost dorsal, the back dorsal is truth be told, in all respects somewhat opisthocoelous. A tall and restricted hyposphene (slim vertical edge beneath the foremost procedures of the curve, giving extra vertebral verbalization) is available and very much extended off the curve. A solitary dorsal neural spine is likewise safeguarded. It is smoothed and not tall, with a limited tip, and the main perceptible laminae present are the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae running down the back corners of the spine to the postzygapophyses. This is not normal for most diplodocoids where there are numerous laminar running along the length of the spines. Four neural spines of the sacrum are saved, three of which structure a solitary plate and the fourth is discrete, as in "Diplodocus".
