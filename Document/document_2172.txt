The vast majority of Scotland's rural riches in this period originated from pastoralism, instead of arable cultivating. Arable cultivating developed essentially in the "Norman period", however with land contrasts, low-lying zones being liable to more arable cultivating than high-lying territories, for example, the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. Galloway, in the expressions of G. W. S. Cart, "effectively popular for its steers, was so overwhelmingly peaceful, that there is little proof in that locale of land under any changeless development, spare along the Solway coast". The normal measure of land utilized by a planter in Scotland may have been around 26 sections of land. The local Scots favored pastoralism, in that Gaelic masters were more joyful to give away more land to French and Middle English-talking pilgrims, while hanging on diligently to upland districts, maybe adding to the Highland/Galloway-Lowland division that developed in Scotland in the later Middle Ages. The fundamental unit of land estimation in Scotland was the "davoch" (for example "tank"), called the "arachor" in Lennox and furthermore known as the "Scottish ploughgate". In English-speaking Lothian, it was basically ploughgate. It might have estimated about , separated into 4 "rath"s. Cows, pigs and cheeses were among the main foodstuffs, from a wide scope of produce including sheep, fish, rye, grain, honey bee wax and nectar.
