In 1511, a Spanish caravel was wrecked in the Caribbean, and about a dozen survivors made landfall on the coast of YucatÃ¡n. They were seized by a Maya lord, and most were sacrificed, although two managed to escape. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish expeditions explored the YucatÃ¡n coast, and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants. After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521, HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s despatched Pedro de Alvarado to Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523. The KÊ¼icheÊ¼ capital, QÊ¼umarkaj, fell to Alvarado in 1524. Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into Iximche, the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya. Good relations did not last, due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute, and the city was abandoned a few months later. This was followed by the fall of Zaculeu, the Mam Maya capital, in 1525. Francisco de Montejo and his son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger, launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula in 1527, and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546. This left only the Maya kingdoms of the PetÃ©n Basin independent. In 1697, MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa launched an assault on the Itza capital NojpetÃ©n and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish.
