SRÃÂ 78 is a piece of the California Freeway and Expressway System, albeit just the metropolitan area of SRÃÂ 78 is a road. The segment of SR 78 from the western intersection of SR 79 toward the western intersection with SR 86 is assigned by the California State Legislature as qualified by law for the State Scenic Highway System; in any case, just the segment in Anza Borrego Desert State Park has authoritatively been assigned by Caltrans as being a piece of the framework, implying that it is a significant area of expressway going through a "paramount scene" with no "visual interruptions", where the potential assignment has increased famous support with the network; it picked up this status in 1971. SRÃÂ 78 from I-5 to I-15, and from the eastern intersection with SRÃÂ 86 toward the eastern intersection with SRÃÂ 111 is a piece of the National Highway System (NHS), a system of parkways that are viewed as fundamental to the nation's economy, protection, and versatility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, SRÃÂ 78 had a yearly normal day by day traffic (AADT) of 670 between the San DiegoÃ¢ÂÂ Imperial province line and the western SRÃÂ 86 intersection, and 163,000 between Twin Oaks Valley Road and Nordahl Road, the last of which was the most elevated AADT for the expressway.
