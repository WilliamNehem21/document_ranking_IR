The grown-up green rosella has a yellow head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the brow and upper legends. The yellow quills of the forecrown, lower legends, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow plumes of the sides and back of the head and neck, and the underparts have dim dark colored bases. The edges of the plumes on the underparts can be pale dark colored, bringing about a swoon scalloping, which vanishes with wear. A portion of the yellow plumes of the scruff have white bases and when worn, the feathered creature can have a whitish fix on their scruff. The yellow of the back of the head consolidates indistinguishably into the dim plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is dark or dull darker with green edges. The plumes of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These edges and tips are regularly worn by the completion of rearing season, leaving the plumage increasingly strong dark. The blue-violet plumes of the jawline, throat and cheeks have darker dark bases. The blackish plumage of the back stretches out to the rear end, and the long tail is dull green with darker shafts and dim blue external quills and tips. The wings are generally dark and green, with violet-blue negligible coverts, essential coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dull darker primaries and external secondaries. Underneath the quills of the wings are dull darker with blue-violet tips. The iris is darker with a dim orbital ring, and the bill is pale-dim, with a dim cere. The legs are dark. The yellow plumage of the female is more blunt and more probable set apart with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the dark plumage of the upperparts are increasingly noticeable.
