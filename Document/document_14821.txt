Particle Storm requested criticism from fans in the wake of showing progress on "Anachronox" at E3 1998, and guaranteed consideration of a multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, "It will be exceptionally realistic and about as non-direct as you can get. A few dimensions will be greater than anything at any point found in a 3-D condition. We are truly driving the motor for this, with heaps of surfaces." Developers made two showings; the second highlighted lasers, focal point flare, and volumetric haze. The gaming press got "Anachronox" well; one journalist composed the diversion was "amazingly beautiful...[with] probably the most eminent impacts at any point found in a PC amusement, including undulating water, dazzling laser lights and shadow impacts". Another composed that the diversion would be "graphically stupendous, with nitty gritty characters". Specialists at E3 selected "Anachronox" in the "Most Promising Game" and "Best RPG" classifications for the Game Critics Awards. Particle Storm made arrangements for a 1999 discharge, and revealed new screen captures at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the diversion's maps created in 1998 were Hephaestus (cleaned by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka KerÃÂ¤nen); Democratus, "Grid 0", and certain insides of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead software engineer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to go to Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, a few engineers at Ion Storm left to shape their own organization; among them was David Namaksy, lead level creator for "Anachronox".
