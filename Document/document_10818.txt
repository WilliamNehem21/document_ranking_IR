Newton's words especially established the legitimacy of this association among contemporary friends, and a few of them developed his perspectives. Dutch zoologist Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans recommended that the inconsistencies between the sketches and the old depictions were because of the artistic creations appearing female, and that the species was in this manner explicitly dimorphic. The British zoologist Walter Rothschild asserted the yellow wings may have been because of albinism in this specific example, since the old portrayals depicted these as dark. By the mid twentieth century, numerous different compositions and even physical remains were professed to be of white dodos, in the midst of much theory. Some trusted the solitaire of the old depictions was fairly an animal types like the Rodrigues solitaire. Rothschild dispatched British craftsman Frederick William Frohawk to reestablish the RÃÂ©union solitaire as both a white dodo, in light of the Withoos painting, and as an unmistakable winged creature dependent on the French explorer Sieur Dubois' 1674 portrayal, for his 1907 book "Wiped out Birds". In 1953, the Japanese author Masauji Hachisuka went similarly as alluding to the white dodos of the works of art as "Victoriornis imperialis", and the solitaire of the records as "Ornithaptera solitarius".
