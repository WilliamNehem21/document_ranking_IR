In 1967, Ray composed a content for a film to be designated "The Alien", in view of his short story "Bankubabur Bandhu" ("Banku Babu's Friend"), which he wrote in 1962 for "Sandesh", the Ray family magazine. Columbia Pictures was the maker for what was an arranged US-India co-generation, and Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers were given a role as the main on-screen characters. Beam found that his content had been copyrighted and the expense appropriated by Michael Wilson. Wilson had at first moved toward Ray through their common companion, Arthur C. Clarke, to speak to him in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the content credited to "Mike Wilson and Satyajit Ray", despite the fact that he contributed just a single word. Beam later said that he never got a penny for the content. After Brando dropped out of the task, the undertaking attempted to supplant him with James Coburn, however Ray ended up frustrated and came back to Calcutta. Columbia communicated enthusiasm for restoring the undertaking a few times during the 1980s, however nothing happened to it. Whenever "E.T." was discharged in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similitudes in the film to his prior "Outsider" content. Beam guaranteed that this film counterfeited his content. Beam said that Steven Spielberg's motion picture "would not have been conceivable without my content of 'The Alien' being accessible all through America in mimeographed duplicates." Spielberg denied any written falsification by saying, "I was a child in secondary school when this content was circling in Hollywood." (Spielberg really graduated secondary school in 1965 and discharged his first film in 1968). Other than "The Alien", two other unrealised undertakings that Ray had planned to coordinate were adjustments of the antiquated Indian epic, the "MahÃÂbhÃÂrata", and E. M. Forster's 1924 novel "A Passage to India".
