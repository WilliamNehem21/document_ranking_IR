Mindful of King George's disappointment at the coinage likeness, the Mint played for time. Post's renunciation in 1823 denied Pistrucci of a companion and supporter at the Mint. Stone carver Francis Chantrey had arranged a bust of the King which the ruler enjoyed, and requested that it be put on the coinage. Pistrucci would not duplicate crafted by another craftsman, and cannot. The new coinage of 1823Ã¢ÂÂ 1825 was engraved by Pistrucci's aide, Jean-Baptiste Merlen, and by William Wyon; Pistrucci was from that point rejected from work on the coinage. The Mint considered sacking Pistrucci, yet understood that on the off chance that it did, the ÃÂ£1,700 progressed for charges and costs on the Waterloo decoration would presumably be squandered, and he kept his position and pay on condition he concentrated on the finish of the award. In spite of this, by 1826, just a part of one side had been finished. Despite the fact that the expulsion of the George and Dragon structure from the sovereign after 1825 was all the more piece of a general overhaul of the coinage than an assault upon Pistrucci, as per Clancy he "can't have conceal the sense he more likely than not felt of tides betraying him".
