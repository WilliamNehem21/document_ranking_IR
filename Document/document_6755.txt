Gyllenhaal was conceived in Los Angeles, California, the child of movie maker and screenwriter Naomi Foner (nÃÂ©e Achs) and movie chief Stephen Gyllenhaal. On-screen character Maggie Gyllenhaal, his more seasoned sister, showed up with him in the film "Donnie Darko". Gyllenhaal's dad, who was raised as a Swedenborgian, is of Swedish and English plunge, and is a relative of the Swedish respectable Gyllenhaal family. Jake's last predecessor to be conceived in Sweden was his extraordinary incredible granddad, Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal. Jake's mom is Jewish, and was conceived in New York City to a Jewish family from Russia and Poland. Gyllenhaal has said that he views himself as Jewish. On his thirteenth birthday celebration, Gyllenhaal played out a "barmitzvah-like act, without the commonplace trappings", volunteering at a destitute safe house since his folks needed to give him a feeling of appreciation for his advantaged way of life. His folks demanded that he have summer employments to help himself and he in this manner filled in as a lifeguard and as a waiting assistant at an eatery worked by a family companion. Gyllenhaal said his folks energized creative articulation: "I do have guardians who always bolstered me in certain ways. In different ways, they were inadequate. Certainly, it's in articulation and imagination where my family has dependably been best at."
