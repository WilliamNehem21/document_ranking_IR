The external divider, by and high, is encompassed by a cover of open ground and a canal wide and more than 5 kilometers (3ÃÂ mi) in edge. Access to the sanctuary is by an earth bank toward the east and a sandstone highway toward the west; the last mentioned, the fundamental passage, is a later expansion, potentially supplanting a wooden scaffold. There are gopuras at every one of the cardinal focuses; the western is by a long shot the biggest and has three destroyed towers. Glaize noticed that this gopura the two stows away and echoes the type of the sanctuary appropriate. Under the southern pinnacle is a statue of Vishnu, known as "Ta Reach", which may initially have involved the sanctuary's focal sanctum. Displays keep running between the towers and to the extent two further doorways on either side of the gopura regularly alluded to as "elephant entryways", as they are sufficiently huge to concede those creatures. These exhibitions have square columns on the external (west) side and a shut divider on the inward (east) side. The roof between the columns is designed with lotus rosettes; the west substance of the divider with moving figures; and the east essence of the divider with balustered windows, moving male figures on dancing creatures, and devatas, including (south of the passage) the just a single in the sanctuary to go on the defensive.
