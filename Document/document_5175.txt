Yet, Polk saw the workplace as a springboard for his national desire, trying to be named as Van Buren's bad habit presidential running mate at the 1840 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore in May. Polk would have liked to be the substitution if Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson was dumped from the ticket; Johnson was disdained by numerous Southern whites for fathering two little girls by a biracial special lady, and endeavoring to bring them into white society. Johnson was from Kentucky, so Polk's Tennessee living arrangement would keep the New Yorker Van Buren's ticket adjusted. The tradition supported nobody for VP, expressing that a decision would be made once the prominent vote was thrown. Three weeks after the tradition, perceiving that Johnson was excessively prevalent in the gathering to be expelled, Polk pulled back his name. The Whig presidential applicant, General William Henry Harrison, directed a romping effort with the maxim "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too", effectively winning both the national vote and that in Tennessee. Polk crusaded futile for Van Buren and was humiliated by the result; Jackson, who had come back to his home, the Hermitage, close Nashville, was sickened at the possibility of a Whig organization. Harrison's passing following a month in office in 1841 remaining the administration to Vice President John Tyler, who before long broke with the Whigs.
