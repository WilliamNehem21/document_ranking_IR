Kirk and Spock in "Star Trek", first in the 1960s television series (later retitled ""), then in the 1970s television series "", and subsequently in several "Star Trek" films between 1979 and 1994. In "Mind Meld", they discuss the "Star Trek" media franchise and its enduring success. The film is, except for the title sequence, composed entirely of Shatner and Nimoy in conversation. Many of the topics they discuss were inspired by online questions from fans. The film starts in Nimoy's backyard, where the two sit on patio chairs, and then moves into Nimoy's library, which is filled with souvenirs.
The film focuses on the effects "Star Trek" had on the lives of Shatner and Nimoy, with each actor interviewing the other about his fame. They talk about "Star Trek"s origins and the death of DeForest Kelley, who had portrayed Leonard McCoy in both "The Original Series" and "The Animated Series". Shatner and Nimoy also discuss interactions between themselves and others on the set of "Star Trek", including conflicts. Both Shatner and Nimoy describe having had strained relationships with Gene Roddenberry, the creator of "Star Trek", and attest to other members of the "Original Series" cast disliking Shatner. Only one of these cast members is referred to by name: Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Nyota Uhura. "I never fully comprehended what it was that was bothering them", says Shatner.
