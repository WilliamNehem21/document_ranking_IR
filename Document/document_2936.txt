By the mid-1930s, forester Bob Marshall contended that the area ought to be put aside as wild. Adversary intrigues kept on argueing about whether the grounds ought to stay under the administration of the Forest Service or the National Park Service, however by the 1960s the tree hugger contention supporting for a national park won. President John F. Kennedy coordinated the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior to support a joint report into a conceivable national park in the North Cascades district, which was finished in January 1966 and submitted to Congress. The extent of the national park was liable to discuss locally and in Congress, just as its impact on the nearby logging industry. The North Cascades National Park Act assigned the locale as a National Park on October 2, 1968, and the National Park Service started direct administration on January 1, 1969. The North Cascades National Park Act likewise assigned Ross Lake and Lake Chelan National Recreation Areas. Redwood National Park in California was additionally marked into reality on a similar day as the North Cascades. By 1988, a lot of Bob Marshall's unique intend to set aside the future park as wild was accomplished when practically all of North Cascades National Park was assigned as the Stephen Mather Wilderness.
