The antiquated Greeks saw that the presence of Sirius proclaimed the sweltering and dry summer and expected that it made plants shrivel, men to debilitate, and ladies to end up excited. Because of its brilliance, Sirius would have been noted to twinkle more in the agitated climate states of late-spring. To Greek onlookers, this implied certain radiations which caused its harmful impact. Anybody enduring its belongings was said to be "captivated" (, "astrobÃÂ³lÃÂtos"). It was portrayed as "copying" or "blazing" in writing. The season following the star's return came to be known as the "hound days". The occupants of the island of Ceos in the Aegean Sea would offer penances to Sirius and Zeus to bring cooling breezes, and would anticipate the return of the star in summer. On the off chance that it climbed clear, it would forecast favorable luck; in the event that it was foggy or swoon, at that point it anticipated (or exuded) disease. Coins recovered from the island from the third century BC include puppies or stars with radiating beams, featuring Sirius' significance. The Romans praised the heliacal setting of Sirius around April 25, giving up a canine, alongside incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess Robigo with the goal that the star's spreads would not cause wheat rust on wheat crops that year.
