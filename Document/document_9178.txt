Scudder began to look all starry eyed at and wedded a neighborhood young lady named Flora Hawkins from Milfay, Oklahoma, with whom he had a child, Ben. At the point when Scudder felt his seeking after foe once more, he left his family and voyaged erratically all through the nation. After barely enduring a collapse in Babylon, he joined the HydeÃÂ &ÃÂ Teller Company, a little jubilee working the southeastern circuit. Scudder functioned as a sideshow nerd for about a year and became acquainted with Samson, Jonesy, Possum, Lila, Ruthie and Gabriel. In the interim, Belyakov utilized Lodz's following abilities and bought the HydeÃÂ &ÃÂ Teller Company, inadequately missing Scudder. To stay covert, Belyakov renamed the troupe "CarnivÃÂ le", expected the name "The executives", and supplanted Samson with Lodz as the new co-administrator. Lodz at long last found Scudder in St. Louis, however when Lodz bombed in keeping Scudder from remaining in isolation once more (with the Order Templar), Samson recaptured his old employment. Throughout the years, the CarnivÃÂ le took on new acts, for example, the crystal gazers Apollonia and Sofie, the conjoined twins, Gecko the Lizard Man, and the Dreifuss family. While Lodz embitteredly trusted that Management will satisfy his prior guarantee of reestablishing his sight, Samson ran the show, guided by Management and helped by Jonesy. Eighteen years passed by until Management felt Ben Hawkins, whom he had detected as his Ascendant since birth, was mature enough to be drawn nearer. Now, the primary period of "CarnivÃÂ le" resumes the story.
