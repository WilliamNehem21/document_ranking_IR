Like section one, the second part debuted to basic approval. IGN's Ramsey Isler composed that it "changed the entire scene of the show's primary plot circular segment. In spite of the fact that there were some unpleasant spots in the execution of this story, by and large it's a serious method to end the season." He appraised the scene 8.6/10. While applauding Noble's execution, Isler censured some plot perspectives. He was "somewhat torn" on the Peter-Olivia kiss, wished Peter and the doomsday gadget had been set up additional for the third season, and trusted the Olivia-Fauxlivia cooperation to be "somewhat weird," as the two went from talking about their particular families to "ass kicking". Isler praised the battle itself. Ken Tucker lauded the acting and the essayists, taking note of "The way that the arrangement can suit a fan like me just affirms what a well-fashioned bit of popular culture "Periphery" has progressed toward becoming." Tucker incorporated the second piece of the period in his mid-year "Top 10" list for 2010, incompletely ascribing this positioning to "Periphery" "offer[ing] the season's best cliffhanger", close by "Breaking Bad". Noel Murray pronounced that he delighted to some extent two marginally more, reviewing it an A. He adulated Torv and Noble's exhibitions for "possessing their individual universes so well", and Goldsman for "[shooting] this scene with an accentuation on the characters more than the setting".
