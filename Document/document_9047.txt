A recolored smiley face is a repetitive picture in the story, showing up in numerous structures. In "The System of Comics", Thierry Groensteen depicted the image as a common theme that produces "rhyme and surprising setups" by showing up in key portions of "Guardians", eminently the first and last pages of the arrangementÃ¢ÂÂscattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a burger on the last. Groensteen refers to it as one type of the circle shape that shows up all through the story, as a "repetitive geometric theme" and because of its emblematic implications. Gibbons made a smiley face identification as a component of The Comedian's outfit so as to "help" the general plan, later adding a sprinkle of blood to the identification to suggest his homicide. Gibbons said the makers came to respect the blood-recolored smiley face as "an image for the entire arrangement", taking note of its similarity to the Doomsday Clock ticking up to midnight. Moore drew motivation from mental trial of behaviorism, clarifying that the tests had displayed the face as "an image of complete honesty". With the expansion of a blood sprinkle over the eye, the face's significance was adjusted to turn out to be at the same time radical and sufficiently straightforward for the main issue's spread to stay away from human detail. Albeit most summonings of the focal picture were made intentionally, others were adventitious. Moore referenced specifically that on "the little attachments on the flash hydrants in the event that you flip around them, you find a little smiley face".
