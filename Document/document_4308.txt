The mellotron makes an arrival in the tune "Valentine's Day." Guitar parts for "The Fall of Adam" were recorded in the pouring precipitation with an end goal to remove a one of a kind sound. John 5 deliberately mistuned his Gibson for the's first experience with "produce a better solid." The last tune "Check to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)" has piano work from Bon Harris and utilizes a string synthesizer. It finishes up on a cliffhanger; it closes with the sound of a lone shot being stacked into a pistol against a foundation of inaccessible firecrackers pursued by the chamber being spun over and over. Its mallet is positioned multiple times, in spite of the fact that its trigger is pulled just multiple times. The aftereffect of the 6th and last chamber is left for the audience to decide.
