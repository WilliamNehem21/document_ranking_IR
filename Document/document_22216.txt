On 29 January 1960 Jacques appeared in the first episode of the BBC comedy series "Sykes and a...", co-starring with Eric Sykes as a pair of twins; Richard Wattis and Deryck Guyler were also regulars in the cast. Jacques's characterâHattie (Hat) Sykesâwas "a middle-class, slightly pretentious lady struggling to keep her dignity as the men made fools of themselves". "Sykes and a..." went on to run for sixty episodes over nine series during the next five years. According to the media historian Graham McCann, the show was "one of the best-natured, least pretentious and most successful British sitcoms of the 1960s". Because of the success, Jacques and Sykes "became embedded in the public mind as a priceless comic partnership"; to capitalise, they released a comedy album entitled "Eric and Hattie and Things<nowiki>!!!</nowiki>", but it failed to chart. In September 1960 she starred in her second television series, "Our House", alongside Charles Hawtrey, Bernard Bresslaw and Joan Sims; Jacques played the librarian Georgina Ruddy, who was forced to keep quiet at work and so made up for it by being extremely noisy at home. Later that year she played minor roles in two films: "Watch Your Stern", with many of the "Carry On" regulars, and "School for Scoundrels", opposite Ian Carmichael. After these her screen time increased with the part of Nanette Parry in "Make Mine Mink" in which she co-starred with Terry-Thomas and Athene Seyler. She later described this as her favourite film.
