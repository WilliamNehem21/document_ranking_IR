When ladies experienced difficulty looking for some kind of employment and specialists were frequently persecuted, Boyce felt their rights were vital: his organizations utilized numerous ladies and he bolstered trade guilds. His papers frequently conveyed tales about the "honorability of work". His organizations had the capacity to pay out wages and advantages amid the Panic of 1893, when numerous organizations were laying off laborers and cutting wages. Amid the Pullman Strike of the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1894, which spread to 20 organizations in over a large portion of the states, Boyce called Eugene V. Debs, the communist work national pioneer of the American Railway Union, an "extraordinary work pioneer" and industrialist George Pullman, innovator of the railroad traveler and resting vehicle, the man "who caused all the inconvenience" (at that point current work and social/political difficulty of the 1890s). In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in Marseilles, Illinois, burned to the ground, he paid the specialists quickly and afterward enlisted them back as development laborers to modify the paper plant so they would not lose salary. However, he was likewise defensive of his cash. In late 1894, when two of his specialists were harmed by a fallen smokestack and won $2,000 each in a court judgment, Boyce advanced the case right to the Supreme Court of Illinois, and lost. He was additionally tireless in getting what he needed; in 1902, he sued the Marseilles Land and Power Company for not providing enough water capacity to his plants and won a $65,300 judgment. By 1903, the Marseilles Land and Power Company fell into receivership and Boyce purchased the organization up.
