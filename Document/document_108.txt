Mary Shelley's last full-length book, written as letters and distributed in 1844, was "Meanders in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842 and 1843", which recorded her movements with her child Percy Florence and his college companions. In "Drifts", Shelley pursues the custom of Mary Wollstonecraft's "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" and her own "A History of a Six Weeks' Tour" in mapping her own and political scene through the talk of reasonableness and compassion. For Shelley, building thoughtful associations between individuals is the best approach to fabricate common society and to expand learning: "information, to illuminate and free the psyche from sticking stifling preferencesÃ¢ÂÂa more extensive hover of compassion for our individual animals;Ã¢ÂÂ these are the employments of movement". Between perceptions on landscape, culture, and "the general population, particularly in a political perspective", she utilizes the travelog structure to investigate her jobs as a widow and mother and to think about progressive patriotism in Italy. She likewise records her "journey" to scenes related with Percy Shelley. As indicated by commentator Clarissa Orr, Mary Shelley's reception of a persona of philosophical parenthood gives "Drifts" the solidarity of an exposition sonnet, with "death and memory as focal topics". In the meantime, Shelley puts forth a populist defense against government, class qualifications, bondage, and war.
