The sort example had a place with a matured person. Its taphonomy is unordinary as it was discovered lying on its back Ã¢ÂÂ conversely, most other almost total dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation more often than not are discovered lying on their sides. The example was discovered encased in cross-slept with sandstone kept by a waterway. The vast majority of the found vertebrae were still associated together, framing a nonstop arrangement that comprised of 8 dorsal, 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae. An extra 3 vertebrae were discovered separated from the arrangement and may have a place with the transitional region among back and neck. The rest of the pieces of the skeleton were moved somewhat out of their unique anatomical position. Both the left appendage and rib bones were found on the correct side of the body, while then again the correct appendage and rib bones were found on the left side. Nibble marks have been recognized on the skeleton, especially in the pelvis and the thigh bone, demonstrating that predators had benefited from the cadaver. The skull and neck are missing, showing that the carnivores may have diverted these body parts. The fulfillment of the remaining parts show that the individual had passed on close to the disclosure site. A flooding occasion may have transported the body a short separation and along these lines secured it with dregs, even before the delicate tissue had rotted totally.
