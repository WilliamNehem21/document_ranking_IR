"Melbourne" struck "Voyager" just aft of the destroyer's bridge, rolling the destroyer to starboard before cutting her in half. "Voyager"s forward boiler exploded, briefly setting fire to the bow of the carrier before it was extinguished by seawater. The destroyer's forward section sank quickly, under the weight of the two gun turrets. The aft section did not begin sinking until half an hour after the collision, completely submerging just after midnight. Messages were immediately sent to the Fleet Headquarters in Sydney, although staff in Sydney initially underestimated the extent of the damage to "Voyager". "Melbourne" launched her boats to recover survivors, and the carrier's wardroom and C Hangar were prepared for casualties. At 9:58Â pm, "Melbourne" was informed that search-and-rescue boats from , helicopters from , and five "Ton"-class minesweepers had been despatched to assist in the search.
"Melbourne" arrived in Sydney with the survivors on 14 February, and after spending time alongside at Garden Island, was moved to Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 25 March, where repairs were undertaken; the damaged section of the bow was cut away and repairs to the ship's internal structure were undertaken in drydock, while a 40-ton prefabricated bow was constructed. Once this was completed, "Melbourne" was removed while the new bow was put in place in the drydock; "Melbourne" was then returned to the drydock where her new bow was fitted. The work was eventually completed on 27 April, with the shipyard receiving a commendation.
