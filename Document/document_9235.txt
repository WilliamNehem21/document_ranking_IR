The returns from Perry's single "Some portion of Me" were given to the philanthropy MusiCares, which helps artists in the midst of need. Amid her California Dreams Tour, she raised over $175,000 for the Tickets-For-Charity pledge drive. The cash was separated between three philanthropies: the Children's Health Fund (CHF), Generosity Water, and The Humane Society of the United States. On her 27th birthday celebration, Perry set up a gifts page for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Auckland, and set up a comparable page profiting the David Lynch Foundation for her 28th birthday celebration. On March 29, 2014, she helped raise $2.4 million for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles alongside different big names, for example, Ryan Seacrest, Pharrell Williams, Tim Allen, Lisa Edelstein, and Riley Keough. In March 2018, Perry declared "Witness: Coming Home", an advantage show that was held in the place where she grew up of Santa Barbara, California on May 19, 2018. The show profited those recuperating from the outcome of the 2017 California out of control fires and 2018 Southern California mudflows. Perry joined forces with the Santa Barbara Foundation, the 93108 Fund and The 805 UndocuFund, associations which help in helping individuals from the network in the Santa Barbara zone through stipends and different magnanimous endeavors.
