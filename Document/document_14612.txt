In 1899 Vaughan Williams passed the examination for the level of Doctor of Music at Cambridge; the title was formally given on him in 1901. The tune "Linden Lea" turned into the first of his attempts to show up in print, distributed in the magazine "The Vocalist" in April 1902 and after that as discrete sheet music. Notwithstanding structure he involved himself in a few limits amid the principal decade of the century. He composed articles for melodic diaries and for the second version of "Woods' Dictionary of Music and Musicians", altered the primary volume of Purcell's "Appreciated Songs" for the Purcell Society, and was for some time associated with grown-up instruction in the University Extension Lectures. From 1904 to 1906 he was music editorial manager of another psalm book, "The English Hymnal", of which he later stated, "I currently realize that two years of close relationship with the absolute best (just as a portion of the most exceedingly awful) tunes on the planet was superior melodic instruction than any measure of sonatas and fugues". Continuously dedicated to music-production for the entire network, he helped found the beginner Leith Hill Music Festival in 1905, and was named its foremost conductor, a post he held until 1953.
