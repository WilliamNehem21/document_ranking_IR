In their mimes, the modest Leno and the monstrous Campbell were an outwardly funny team. They would regularly veer off from the content, ad libbing unreservedly. This was met with some wariness by makers, who expected that the scenes would not be entertaining to groups of onlookers and saw that, in any occasion, they were infrequently taking care of business until a couple of evenings subsequent to opening. George Bernard Shaw composed of one appearance: "I trust I never again need to suffer much else bleakly useless", and the English writer and caricaturist Max Beerbohm expressed that "Leno does not do himself equity working together with general society". He noted, notwithstanding, that Leno "was excellent in giving every one of his women her very own identity, from indulgent ruler to unsophisticated tattle". In "Dozing Beauty", Leno and Campbell made the group of onlookers chuckle notwithstanding when they couldn't see them: they would touch base in front of an audience in shut palanquins and trade the lines, "Make them anything to do this evening, my dear?"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "No, I have nothing on", before being taken away once more. Leno and Campbell's mimes from 1889 were "Jack and the Beanstalk" (1889 and 1899), "Excellence and the Beast" (1890 and 1900), "Humpty Dumpty" (1891 and 1903), "Little Bo-Peep" (1892), "Robinson Crusoe" (1893), "Dick Whittington and His Cat" (1894), "Cinderella" (1895), "Aladdin" (1896), "Darlings in the Wood" (1897) and the "Forty Thieves" (1898).
