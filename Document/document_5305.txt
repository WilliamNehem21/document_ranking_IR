In an offer to stem Haidar's ascent, the British shaped a partnership with the Marathas and the Nizam of Golconda, coming full circle in the First Anglo-Mysore War in 1767. Regardless of numerical predominance Haider Ali endured routs at the clashes of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai. The British overlooked his suggestions for harmony until Haider Ali had deliberately moved his armed forces to inside five miles of Madras (present day Chennai) and had the capacity to effectively sue for harmony. In 1770, when the Maratha multitudes of Madhavrao Peshwa attacked Mysore (three wars were battled somewhere in the range of 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider, in which Haider lost), Haider expected British help according to the 1769 bargain yet they sold out him by avoiding the contention. The British treachery and Haider's resulting rout strengthened Haider's profound doubt of the BritishÃ¢ÂÂa notion that would be shared by his child and one which would illuminate Anglo-Mysore contentions of the following three decades. In 1777, Haider Ali recuperated the recently lost regions of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas. Haider Ali's military progressed towards the Marathas and battled them at the Battle of Saunshi and turned out successful amid that year.
