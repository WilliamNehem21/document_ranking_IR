The ensuing 1901 season was, measurably, his best. He trailed just Fry and Ranjitsinhji in the national batting midpoints, and drew specific approval for his innings of 173 against Yorkshire. The all-vanquishing Yorkshire were ruling County Champions, unbeaten in 1900; the match against Somerset at Headingley was the just a single they lost in 1901. Somerset were rejected for 87 in their first innings, and Yorkshire achieved 325 to lead by 238 keeps running on first innings. Palairet and his kindred opener Len BraundÃ¢ÂÂboth of whom had been out without scoring in the main inningsÃ¢ÂÂat that point scored 222 runs together in 140 minutes toward the beginning of Somerset's second innings, each scoring a century. After the rejection of Braund for 107, Palairet proceeded, in the long run being gotten and bowled for 173. Forthright Phillips included a third century (122), and Somerset achieved an aggregate of 630. Yorkshire were bowled out on a wearing pitch for 113, with Braund and Beaumont Cranfield each taking four wickets, and Somerset won by 279 runs. The Yorkshire commander, Lord Hawke, pronounced that it was "a standout amongst the best matches I at any point lost." around the same time, Palairet scored 182 against Lancashire and 194 against Sussex. By and large he scored five centuries and eleven half-hundreds of years in 1901, averaging 57.75 for his 1,906 runsÃ¢ÂÂthe most astounding season's aggregate of his vocation.
