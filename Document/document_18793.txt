Rodney Dugue of "The Village Voice" called it one of the standout songs on "Good Girl Gone Bad", and Sarah Rodman of "The Boston Globe" said it was essential to the album. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters called it a "little gem" and compared it to Babyface's collaboration with Madonna on her 1994 single "Take a Bow". "Billboard" magazine called the song a highlight of the album, with "slinky-assisted Timberlake background vocals, tension-filled production, and contrasting strings and guitars." "Vibe"'s Shanel Odum, while reviewing "Good Girl Gone Bad", noted that the album predominantly consists of up-tempo songs, while the ballads are its weak part, eventually being "saved" by "Rehab". Spence D. of IGN stated that Timberlake and Rihanna work well together, thanks to their similar vocal ranges. He wrote that the song "reverts to Rihanna's old styled R&B swoon, the groove being built around tambourine shakes, acoustic guitar swirls, and a subtle backbeat." Doug Rule of "Metro Weekly" wrote that "Rehab" "is its own distinctive songâand a fetching one at thatâbut the resemblance to one of Timberlake's best is unmistakable." Sylvia Patterson from "The Guardian" described the song as a "mournful tale of lost love feeling like a catastrophic rehab meltdown".
