The Dodgers entered the diversion with a 0Ã¢ÂÂ 1 record, having lost to the Reds, who were 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 the day preceding. As Hershiser arranged for his first begin, he said that the continuation of the streak by means of the bullet did not mean a lot to him and that in his mind the streak was at that point over. His hill rival was Tom Browning who had pitched an ideal diversion the last time he had confronted the Dodgers (September 16, 1988). Todd Benzinger drove in Larkin to end Hershiser's streak in the primary inning and Hershiser was labeled with his first misfortune since August 24. The Dodgers persevered through three mistakes and a passed ball in the diversion. Leadoff hitter Larkin slashed a groundball over Hershiser into centerfield. Hershiser's pick off toss hit Larkin's armpit. After Hershiser resigned Chris Sabo and Eric Davis through strikeout, he strolled Kal Daniels, who had a profession .500 batting normal and four homers against Hershiser, on four pitches. At that point Benzinger, with whom Hershiser was new, singled through the correct side of the Dodger infield to score Larkin along these lines finishing Hershiser's streak. Howell did not permit an earned keep running in his second 1989 excursion on April 10. In this way, Howell's streak went from August 11, 1988, through April 9, 1989.
