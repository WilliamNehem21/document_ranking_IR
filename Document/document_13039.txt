Globally, Victoria took a distinct fascination for the improvement of relations among France and Britain. She made and facilitated a few visits between the British imperial family and the House of Orleans, who were connected by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert remained with King Louis Philippe I at chÃÂ¢teau d'Eu in Normandy; she was the principal British or English ruler to visit a French ruler since the gathering of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. At the point when Louis Philippe made a corresponding trek in 1844, he turned into the main French lord to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was removed in the insurgencies of 1848, and fled to banish in England. At the stature of a progressive alarm in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the more prominent security of Osborne House, a private bequest on the Isle of Wight that they had acquired in 1845 and redeveloped. Shows by Chartists and Irish patriots neglected to pull in far reaching support, and the alarm faded away with no real unsettling influences. Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was an advertising achievement, however it had no enduring effect or impact on the development of Irish patriotism.
