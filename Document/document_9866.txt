The Gateshead Senators (initially the Gateshead International Senators) are an American football club framed in 1988 when the Newcastle Senators, who played at Northern Rugby Club, moved over the Tyne to play at the Gateshead International Stadium. The club has had blended fortunes yet their best season came in 1999. Having won eight of their nine diversions in the normal season, the group won the Division One North title and progressed as far as possible of-season playoffs. In the wake of beating the Merseyside Nighthawks 43Ã¢ÂÂ 0 in the quarter-finals, the Senators vanquished the Essex Spartans 33Ã¢ÂÂ 19 in the semi-finals to achieve the title last. At the Saffron Lane Stadium in Leicester, the Senators confronted the Bristol Aztecs. In a tight experience, the Senators asserted the Division One British American Football League title with a 7Ã¢ÂÂ 2 triumph. The club achieved the playoffs again in the following three seasons yet were unfit to duplicate that achievement, and after a season willfully spent in Division Two of every 2003, came back to Division One North in 2004. They keep on playing in that division, and in the 2012 season neglected to make the playoffs subsequent to recording five successes and five annihilations in their ten amusements.
