Bax composed his seven finished ensembles somewhere in the range of 1921 and 1939. In an investigation of the seven, David Cox wrote in 1967 that they were "frequently rejected as nebulous by the individuals who envision that Bax comprises just of Celtic dimness and 'climate'. Truth be told they have extensive quality and incessant astringence; and formally the topical material is given consistency and reason." In Herbage's view, the cycle can be believed to fall into two gatherings Ã¢ÂÂ the initial three and the last three Ã¢ÂÂ with the Fourth Symphony as "a social butterfly interval between these to a great extent thoughtful works". Handley concurred that the initial three could be gathered together; Foreman sees a Celtic impact in each of the three, with Bax's feelings about the Easter rising and its consequence noticeable. The Fourth is for the most part viewed as a more hopeful work than its ancestors and successors. Handley calls it "bubbly", yet remarks that its thoughts formed into darker state of mind in the Fifth and Sixth. The Fifth is, for Herbage, "the best "visit de-compel""; the Sixth emerges for its "sublime last development", which the faultfinder Peter Pirie said "destroys the earth by its foundations"; and the Seventh has an elegiac tone, its straightforwardness far expelled from the rambling and complex music of Bax's prior years.
