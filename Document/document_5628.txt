Joel Asaph Allen previously portrayed "Oryzomys mexicanus" as a full species in 1897 from examples from Jalisco. In a similar production, he additionally depicted "Oryzomys bulleri" from close-by Nayarit, however he didn't contrast the two and one another. Merriam included a second animal groups from Nayarit, "Oryzomys rufus", in 1901, taking note of that it was littler and more rosy than "mexicanus". Goldman synonymized the three as "O.ÃÂ couesi mexicanus" in 1918 and in 2009 Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales agreed, contending that the contrasts among "rufus" and "mexicanus" were age-related and inside the typical scope of variety of the creature. Another subspecies, "Oryzomys couesi lambi", was depicted by Burt in 1934 from focal seaside Sonora, which expanded the scope of the species by at the time. This structure is dim dark colored, a lot darker than "mexicanus", and has a shorter tail and more fragile jugals. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales composed that it is like "mexicanus", however that further research is expected to decide if it ought to be perceived as a subspecies. Huge "O.ÃÂ couesi" from northern Sinaloa may likewise have a place with this structure. Goldman composed that "mexicanus" was fundamentally the same as name "couesi", however as a rule with paler hide; the upperparts are more buffy than in "couesi" and the underparts are generally white, yet might be buffy, the typical shading in "couesi".
