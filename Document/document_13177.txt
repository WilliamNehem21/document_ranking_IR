Most wooly mammoth populaces vanished amid the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, close by the vast majority of the Pleistocene megafauna (counting the Columbian mammoth). This eradication shaped piece of the Quaternary termination occasion, which started 40,000 years prior and crested somewhere in the range of 14,000 and 11,500 years back. Researchers are isolated about whether chasing or environmental change, which prompted the shrinkage of its living space, was the principle factor that added to the elimination of the wooly mammoth, or whether it was because of a blend of the two.

Most populaces vanished somewhere in the range of 14,000 and 10,000 years prior. The last territory populace existed in the Kyttyk Peninsula of Siberia 9,650 years back. A little populace of wooly mammoths made due on St. Paul Island, Alaska, well into the Holocene with the most as of late distributed date of termination being 5,600 years B.P. The keep going realized populace stayed on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years back, well into the beginning of human progress and simultaneous with the development of the Great Pyramid of antiquated Egypt.
