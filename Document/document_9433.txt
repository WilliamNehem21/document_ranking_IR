Amid Heseltine's four months at the "Day by day Mail", he expounded on 30 sees, predominantly short reports of melodic occasions however once in a while with some investigation. His first commitment, dated 9 February 1915, portrayed an execution by Benno Moiseiwitsch of Delius' Piano Concerto in C minor, as "skillful", while Delius was hailed as "the best author England has created for two centuries". The other work in the program was "the last incredible ensemble that has been conveyed to the world": the Symphony in D minor by Franck. He composed for different distributions; a 5000-word article, "A few notes on Delius and his Music", showed up in the March 1915 issue of "The Musical Times", in which Heseltine opined: "There can be no shallow perspective on Delius' music: it is possible that one feels it in the very profundities of one's being, or not under any condition". Just Beecham, Heseltine recommended, was fit for deciphering the music enough. Heseltine's last notice for the "Day by day Mail" was dated 17 June; soon thereafter he surrendered, disappointed by the paper's incessant cutting of his progressively basic assessments. Jobless, he went through his days in the British Museum, examining and altering Elizabethan music.
