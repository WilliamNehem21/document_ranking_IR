In the mid 1950s, novice excavator Anders FranzÃÂ©n thought about recuperating wrecks from the cool harsh waters of the Baltic since, he contemplated, they were free from the shipworm "Teredo navalis", which as a rule crushes submerged wood quickly in hotter, saltier oceans. FranzÃÂ©n had recently been effective in finding wrecks, for example, "RiksÃÂ¤pplet" and "Lybska Svan", and after long and repetitive research he started searching for "Vasa" also. He spent numerous years testing the waters without progress around the many expected areas of the destruction. He didn't prevail until, in light of records of an obscure geographical inconsistency only south of the Gustav V dock on Beckholmen, he limited his pursuit. In 1956, with a home-made, gravity-fueled coring test, he found a huge wooden article practically parallel to the mouth of dock on Beckholmen. The area of the ship got extensive consideration, regardless of whether the recognizable proof of the ship couldn't be resolved without nearer examination. Not long after the declaration of the discover, arranging got in progress to decide how to uncover and raise "Vasa". The Swedish Navy was included from the begin, as were different exhibition halls and the National Heritage board, agents of which in the long run framed the "Vasa" Committee, the forerunner of the "Vasa" Board.
