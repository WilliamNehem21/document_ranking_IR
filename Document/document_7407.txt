After the fizzled activity, the Swedish armada tied down off Trelleborg where King Charles was holding up with new requests to recover Gotland. The armada was to dodge battle with the partners in any event until they achieved the northern tip of ÃÂland, where they could battle in well disposed waters. At the point when the Swedish armada left Trelleborg on 30 May they were before long caught by the united armada, which at that point started an interest. At this point the partners had been fortified by another little squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 vast and medium boats of the line. The fortifications carried with them another officer, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, a standout amongst the most famous maritime strategists of his time. The two armadas cruised north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of ÃÂland in a solid hurricane. The Swedish boats fared ineffectively in the harsh breezes, losing poles and fights. The Swedish officers framed a fight line that held together just with incredible trouble. They attempted to stretch out beyond Tromp's boats to pick up the climate gage by getting between the partners and the shore, and in this way picking up a beneficial strategic position. The Dutch boats of the united armada figured out how to cruise close-pulled quicker than the remainder of the power and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, taking up the vital climate gage. Later that morning the two armadas surrounded one another and were soon inside terminating range.
