In May 1822 he previously exhibited the herbivorous teeth to the Royal Society of London yet the individuals, among them William Buckland, expelled them as fish teeth or the incisors of a rhinoceros from a Tertiary stratum. On 23 June 1823 Charles Lyell demonstrated some to Georges Cuvier, amid a soiree in Paris, yet the celebrated French naturalist on the double rejected them as those of a rhinoceros. In spite of the fact that the following day Cuvier withdrew, Lyell revealed just the expulsion to Mantell, who turned out to be fairly timid about the issue. In 1824 Buckland portrayed "Megalosaurus" and was on that event welcome to visit Mantell's accumulation. Seeing the bones on 6 March he concurred that these were of some monster saurianÃ¢ÂÂhowever as yet denying it was a herbivore. Encouraged all things considered, Mantell again sent a few teeth to Cuvier, who replied on 22 June 1824 that he had confirmed that they were reptilian and conceivably had a place with a goliath herbivore. In another version that time of his "Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles" Cuvier conceded his prior misstep, prompting a quick acknowledgment of Mantell, and his new saurian, in logical circles. Mantell attempted to verify his hypothesis further by finding an advanced parallel among surviving reptiles. In September 1824 he visited the Royal College of Surgeons however at first neglected to discover practically identical teeth. In any case, aide keeper Samuel Stutchbury perceived that they looked like those of an iguana he had as of late arranged, but multiple times longer.
