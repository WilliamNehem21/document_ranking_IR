In 1999, on the 200th commemoration of her introduction to the world, a global gathering of students of history, scientistss, fossil authorities, and others keen on Anning's life was held in Lyme Regis. In 2005 the Natural History Museum included her, close by researchers, for example, Carl Linnaeus, Dorothea Bate, and William Smith, as one of the exhibition characters it uses to watch its showcase cases. In 2007 American dramatist/entertainer Claudia Stevens debuted "Blue Lias, or the Fish Lizard's Whore", a performance play with music by Allen Shearer delineating Anning in later life. Among the moderators of its thirty exhibitions around the Charles Darwin bicentennial were the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, galleries of normal history at the University of Michigan and the University of Kansas, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. In 2009 Tracy Chevalier composed a recorded novel entitled "Amazing Creatures", in which Anning and Elizabeth Philpot were the principle characters, and another authentic novel about Anning, "Interest" by Joan Thomas, was distributed in March 2010. Additionally that month, as a feature of the festival of its 350th commemoration, the Royal Society welcomed a board of specialists to create a rundown of the ten British ladies who have most affected the historical backdrop of science. They included Anning in the rundown. In December 2018 it was reported that on-screen characters Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan would star in an up and coming film by Francis Lee entitled "Ammonite", which would be founded on Anning's life and inheritance and present a lesbian sentiment plot set during the 1840s.
