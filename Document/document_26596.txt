For the localizations of "Persona 3" and "4", the team incorporated as much of the original content as possible, such as using Japanese honorifics and keeping the game's currency as yen rather than changing it. As a general rule, they incorporate cultural elements from the original versions unless they would not be understood by the player, such as with certain jokes. Nevertheless, some changes had to be made. In one instance, the character Mitsuru Kirijo was originally an English speaker, but her second language for the localized version was changed to French due to her cultured appearance. School tests also needed to be changed due to similar language-based issues. The Social Links were originally called but this was changed as the word "Community" had a very specific meaning in English. The new name was inspired by the way the character Igor made reference to the concept using words such as "society" and "bonds". Some in-game Easter egg references were also changed: in "Persona 3" references to "Shin Megami Tensei" by a character in an in-game MMORPG were changed to reference earlier "Persona" games, while mentions of a fictional detective in "Persona 4" were altered to reference the Kuzunoha family from "Eternal Punishment" and the "Devil Summoner" series. Character names have also needed adjustment, such as the stage name of "Persona 4" character Rise Kujikawa, and the way characters referred to each other was adjusted to appeal more to a western audience. "Persona 5" was also localized in this fashion.
