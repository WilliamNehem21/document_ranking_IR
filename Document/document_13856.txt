"ThÃÂ¼ringen" and her three sisters were to have made part in a last armada move toward the finish of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to produce results. The main part of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to connect with the British Grand Fleet; ScheerÃ¢ÂÂat this point the Grand Admiral ("GroÃÂadmiral") of the armadaÃ¢ÂÂplanned to deliver however much harm as could be expected on the British naval force, to improve Germany's dealing position, notwithstanding the normal setbacks. However, a significant number of the war-tired mariners felt that the activity would disturb the harmony procedure and drag out the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the request was given to cruise from Wilhelmshaven the next day. Beginning the evening of 29 October, mariners on "ThÃÂ¼ringen" and afterward on a few different war vessels mutinied. Stokers killed the boilers and would not work. The next day, the torpedo water crafts and came close by and the U-vessel pointed her weapons at the ship. A noteworthy bit of the team, 314 mariners and 124 stokers, were captured and removed the ship. This was insufficient to stop the revolt, which rapidly spread all through the armada. The agitation at last constrained Hipper and Scheer to drop the task. Educated of the circumstance, the Kaiser expressed "I never again have a naval force".
