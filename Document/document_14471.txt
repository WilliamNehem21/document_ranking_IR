Angelou kept on extending the settings of her collections of memoirs in her consequent volumes. "The Heart of a Woman" had three essential settingsÃ¢ÂÂthe San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and EgyptÃ¢ÂÂand two optional onesÃ¢ÂÂLondon and Accra. Lupton expressed that like the majority of Angelou's books, the structure of "The Heart of a Woman" depended on a voyage. Angelou accentuated the topic of development by opening the book with an otherworldly ("The ole ark's a moverin'"), expressing, "That old profound could have been the signature tune of the United States in 1957". This otherworldly, which contained a reference to Noah's ark, exhibited Angelou as a kind of Noah and showed her otherworldliness. Angelou additionally referenced Allen Ginsberg and "On the Road", the 1951 novel by Jack Kerouac, in this way interfacing her own voyage and vulnerability about the future with the adventures of artistic figures. Despite the fact that the reason Angelou headed out to Africa is a possible fizzled relationship, she made an association with the mainland, both in this book and in the one that tails it, "Every one of God's Children Need Traveling Shoes". As Lupton expressed, "Africa is the site of her development". Angelou's time in Africa made her increasingly mindful of her African roots. Lupton demanded, be that as it may, that despite the fact that Angelou adventures to numerous spots in the book, the most critical adventure she depicted is "a voyage into oneself".
