"Miniopterus aelleni" is known to live from above sea level in northern and western Madagascar, at on Montagne d'Ambre, northern Madagascar, and from on Anjouan in the nearby Comoros. On Madagascar, it has been recorded in forest and caves in karst areas; its distribution broadly overlaps that of "M.Â griveaudi" and the two have been found in the same roost sites on several occasions. On Anjouan, "M.Â aelleni" is less common than "M.Â griveaudi"; there, it is known from four specimens only, all collected in 2006. These come from two nearby sites: a rocky area near a river and a disturbed forest. These animals, collected in late November, were in reproductive condition, with two females pregnant and a third lactating. "M.Â griveaudi" were reproductively active at the same time, suggesting that the reproductive seasons of the two do not differ significantly. Although some ecological and behavioral data has been published on "Miniopterus manavi", the recognition of several cryptic species within this group, more than one of which may occur in any given locality, renders the association of these data with any of the individual species uncertain; however, species of "Miniopterus" generally feed on insects. Because "M.Â aelleni" is widespread and occurs in many protected areas on Madagascar, Goodman and colleagues inferred that its conservation status is secure.
