Hathaway featured (close by Jake Gyllenhaal) as a free-vivacious craftsman experiencing Parkinson's malady in Edward Zwick's suggestive rom-com dramatization "Love and Other Drugs", in light of the genuine book "Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman" by Jamie Reidy. For the job, Hathaway invested energy with a Parkinson's patient to look into the infection. Planning for the film's bare scenes, she watched crafted by the on-screen characters Kate Winslet and PenÃÂ©lope Cruz who, as she would see it, have done nakedness with affectability and pride. Hathaway trusted that these scenes would not demoralize socially traditionalist individuals from watching the film. Commentators for the most part adulated the film's grown-up sentiment however were apathetic about its plot components. Hathaway's execution, which Ebert called "warm, adorable", earned her a Satellite Award and an assignment for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress Ã¢ÂÂ Comedy or Musical. Together with on-screen character Denzel Washington, Hathaway facilitated the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway in December 2010. After two months, she and James Franco facilitated the 83rd Academy Awards. Commentators were apathetic about their science, yet thought Hathaway put forth a strong effort and completed a superior occupation than Franco, who they felt appeared to be uninterested. At the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, she collected an Outstanding Variety Special (Live) designation.
