"The Bard" was about the English devastation of Welsh culture and the resulting decay of the House of Plantagenet and its substitution by the Welsh House of Tudor, and there was a general inclination among faultfinders that Etty had misconstrued the purpose of the illustrations utilized by Gray. Etty asserted that his unordinary understanding of the content was expected to make "a general purposeful anecdote of Human Life, its void vain delightsÃ¢ÂÂif not established on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages", and that the artistic creation filled in as an ethical cautioning about the quest for void joy. This clarification seems to have left faultfinders unconvinced. Indeed, even those commentators most good towards Etty's specialized achievements in making the image thought that it was difficult to find out what the artistic creation should speak to; different pundits were all the more transparently threatening, with "The Morning Chronicle" censuring it as "guilty pleasure of what we once trusted an established, yet which are currently persuaded, is an indecent personality". Obtained for a tremendous entirety by Robert Vernon on its presentation, "Youth and Pleasure" stayed dubious long after Etty's passing, with Farr's 1958 history portraying it as "uniquely incompetent".
