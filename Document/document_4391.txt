Soon after "Hands over the City", Steiger consented to show up in another Italian film, "Time of Indifference" (1964), in which he featured inverse Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. In spite of the fact that Steiger's ground-breaking execution was unaffected, the creation was defaced by a debate between chief Francesco Maselli and maker Franco Cristaldi, with one needing it to be a simply political film and the other needing accentuation on the sexual subplot and his association with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's abrasive dramatization "The Pawnbroker" (1964), Steiger played a disenthralled, sincerely pulled back overcomer of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM takes note of that Steiger's profession was melting away at the time, and he needed to "scramble for paying gigs for 10 years" before getting this part. Steiger consented to a diminished charge of $50,000. He read Edward Lewis Wallant's tale and the content commonly to build up a close comprehension of the character, and demanded decreasing his lines to make his character increasingly reasonable and distanced from society. Lumet noticed that amid the generation Steiger tended to be excessively sensational, expressing: "Beyond any doubt, Rod has shortcomings of talk, however you can talk them through with him. I clarified that this singular Jew couldn't ascend to statures of feeling; he had been pounded by life and by individuals. The confidence he needed to discover was in other individuals, since God had sold out him."
