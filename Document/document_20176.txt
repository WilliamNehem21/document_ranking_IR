To prevent this merger of the Austrian forces, MassÃ©na established a forward line centred at Winterthur, and under overall command of the experienced Jean Victor Tharreau. The French forces were arrayed in an uneven semicircle, in which Winterthur formed the central part. The command of the Winterthur brigades was the most important. If the center could not hold its position, the flanks would be isolated and crushed. MassÃ©na sent newly promoted General of Division Michel Ney to Winterthur on 27 May 1799 to take command of the center. MassÃ©na recalled him from his assignment commanding an outpost of Claude Lecourbe's force in central Switzerland, and gave him a command more fitting with his new rank. Ney arrived with the reputation for boldness considered typical of cavalry officers, but with minimal experience in commanding mixed forces. Anxious to prove himself but aware of protocols, he had hurried to Tharreau's headquarters, but had to wait for his "letters of service" before he could take command. These arrived on 25 May. The troops at Winterthur included a brigade of four battalions commanded by Dominique Mansuy Roget, a weak brigade commanded by ThÃ©odore Maxime Gazan, and a cavalry brigade commanded by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Henri Walther.
