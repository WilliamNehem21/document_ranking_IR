Blackbeard and Bonnet left Delaware Bay and came back to the Caribbean in November, where they effectively proceeded with their robbery. On 17ÃÂ November, a 200-ton send named the "Concorde" was assaulted by two privateer make almost far from the island of Martinique. The lieutenant on board depicted the privateer vessels as one having 12 firearms and 120 men and the other having eight weapons and 30 men. The group of the "Concorde" set up a battle, however surrendered after the privateers barraged them with "two volleys of guns and musketry". Blackbeard took the "Concorde" and cruised south into the Grenadines, where he renamed the ship "Ruler Anne's Revenge", potentially as an affront to King George I. Some time after 19ÃÂ December, Bonnet and Blackbeard isolated. Hood currently cruised into the western Caribbean. In March 1718, he experienced the 400-ton shipper vessel "Protestant Caesar" off Honduras. The ship got away him, and his baffled team ended up fretful. At the point when Bonnet experienced Blackbeard again in the blink of an eye thereafter, Bonnet's group left him to join Blackbeard. Blackbeard put a cohort named Richards in direction of the "Retribution". Cap, amazed that his associate had sold out him, ended up as a visitor on board the "Ruler Anne's Revenge". Hood trusted in a couple of faithful team individuals that he was prepared to surrender his criminal life on the off chance that he could oust himself in Spain or Portugal. Hat would not practice direction again until the mid year of 1718.
