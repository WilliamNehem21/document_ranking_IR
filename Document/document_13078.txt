"Triaenops menamena" is right now one of four living animal groups in the variety "Triaenops"; a 2009 amendment by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African "T.ÃÂ afer" and the Yemeni "T.ÃÂ parvus" from "T.ÃÂ persicus" and evacuated three different species, including two from Madagascar, to the different sort "Paratriaenops". A wiped out species, "Triaenops goodmani", is known from northwestern Madagascar. In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and partners utilized phylogenetic and coalescent techniques to examine the historical backdrop of the "Triaenops" gathering. They found that "T.ÃÂ menamena" (as "T.ÃÂ rufus") was nearest to territory African "Triaenops" (however did not consider Middle Eastern bats) and presumed that "T.ÃÂ menamena" and the types of "Paratriaenops" (at that point still put in "Triaenops") freely achieved Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by "T.ÃÂ menamena" was dated to around 660,000 years back. Benda and Vallo additionally examined phylogenetic connections in "Triaenops" and included Middle Eastern "T.ÃÂ persicus" and "T.ÃÂ parvus" in their examination. They discovered little goals of connections inside "Triaenops", however some proof recommended that "T.ÃÂ menamena" is all the more firmly identified with the Middle Eastern species than to "T.ÃÂ afer" in territory Africa; along these lines, "T.ÃÂ menamena" may have achieved Madagascar from the Middle East or northeastern Africa. They likewise put the split among "T.ÃÂ menamena" and different species a lot further back, at around 4 million years prior.
