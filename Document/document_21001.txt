Upon the 30th anniversary of the album's release, Julian Kimble of "Billboard" magazine wrote: "In hindsight, "Control" is both evolutionary and revolutionary. As Jacksonâs first album to land atop the Billboard 200, it marked professional and personal breakthroughs. Distancing herself from the immense Jackson family shadow, she created one of the most influential projects across contemporary R&B and pop music. And not only was Jacksonâs maiden voyage with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at the forefront of R&B, pop and hip-hopâs intersection, it birthed a novel sound in the process." MTV's Meaghan Garvey asserted "itâs hard to overstate the significance of Control, whether in terms of the pop landscape, the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression, or Top 40 feminist anthems." She also argued "itâs important to note that "Control"âs self-actualization anthems were expressions of black female pride. "Control" spawned a whopping six videosâgreat ones, at thatâwhich played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop." Gerrick D. Kennedy of "Los Angeles Times" wrote that Jackson's continued influence is evident in the careers of Rihanna, BeyoncÃ©, Ciara, FKA Twigs and Tinashe in that "all of them take cues from Jackson's blueprint. And all that began with "Control"."
