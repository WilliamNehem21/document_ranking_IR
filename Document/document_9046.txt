In spite of the bans, there have been battles in European groups. In 2001, an amusement between the Nottingham Panthers and the Sheffield Steelers in the British Superleague saw "a portion of the most exceedingly awful scenes of viciousness seen at a British ice hockey arena". At the point when Sheffield master Dennis Vial crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers authority Barry Nieckar thusly battled with Vial, which in the long run swelled into a 36-man seat clearing fight. Arbitrator Moray Hanson sent the two groups to their storage spaces and postponed the amusement for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the authorities dealt with the punishments. Eight players and the two mentors were shot out, and a British record aggregate of 404 punishment minutes were brought about amid the second time frame. The alliance gave out 30 diversions in suspensions to four players and Steelers' mentor Mike Blaisdell and a sum of ÃÂ£8,400 in fines. Russia's Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) had a seat clearing fight between Vityaz Chekhov and Avangard Omsk in 2010. Authorities were compelled to desert the diversion as there were just four players left. Thirty-three players and the two groups' mentors were shot out, and a world record aggregate of 707 punishment minutes were acquired amid the diversion. The KHL forced fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and considered the amusement a 5Ã¢ÂÂ 0 thrashing for the two groups, without any focuses being granted.
