Arrangement maker Eric Kripke's first involvement as executive was slated for the twentieth scene of the period, and Raelle Tucker was planned to pen it. Kripke needed a content that was as "executive evidence as could be expected under the circumstances", however that would "play with structure and truly accomplish something other than what's expected". He shot down each thought the journalists pitched to him until Tucker proposed an other reality scene. Drawing motivation from the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" scene "Ordinary Again", Kripke was energized by the idea. He felt Dean's conclusive minute was the demise of his mom Mary, so the "preoccupation way" of the new reality would be founded on the inquiry, "Imagine a scenario in which mother never kicked the bucket?" This change enables Sam and Dean to live typical lives, however at the expense of their relationship. The purpose of the bogus reality, as Kripke would see it, was to demonstrate that the siblings would not be close on the off chance that they had not progressed toward becoming seekers. The staff endeavored to convince him to evacuate this angle, yet he figured it would be "faltering" for Sam and Dean to have a ""seventh Heaven" relationship". When the story was completely created, Tucker was sans given rein over the content; this shocked her since she expected Kripke to "be to a greater extent a busybody than he was".
