"Diamonds Are Forever" was published on 26 March 1956 by Jonathan Cape with a cover designed by Pat Marriott. As with the three previous Bond books, the first edition of 12,500 copies sold out quickly; the US edition was published in October 1956 by Macmillan. The novel was serialised in "The Daily Express" newspaper from 12 April 1956 onwardsâthe first of Fleming's novels he had sold to the newspaperâwhich led to an overall rise in the sales of the novels. From November 1956 sales of "Diamonds Are Forever", and Fleming's other novels, all rose following the visit of the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, to Fleming's Goldeneye estate to recuperate following the Suez Crisis; Eden's stay was much reported in the British press. The book received boosts in sales in 1962 when Eon Productions adapted "Dr. No" for the cinema, and in 1971 when "Diamonds Are Forever" was produced for the big screen. In February 1958 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 68,000 copies before the end of the year. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.
