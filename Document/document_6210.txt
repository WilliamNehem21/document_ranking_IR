Quite a bit of Barrymore's initial life was disrupted. In October 1882, the family visited in the US for a season with Polish performing artist Helena Modjeska. The next year his folks visited again with Modjeska however left the youngsters behind. Modjeska was persuasive in the family, and she demanded that every one of the three youngsters be submersed into the Catholic Church. In 1884 the family made a trip to London as a component of Augustin Daly's dramatic organization, coming back to the US two years after the fact. As a youngster, Barrymore was at times severely acted, and he was sent away to schools trying to ingrain discipline. The system was not constantly effective, and he went to grade schools in four states. He was sent first to the young men's extension of the Convent of Notre Dame in Philadelphia. One discipline that he got there was being made to peruse a duplicate of Dante's "Inferno"; he later described that, as he took a gander at the representations by Gustave DorÃÂ©, "my advantage was excited, and another inclination was conceived inside me. I needed to be a craftsman". He was removed from the school in 1891 and was sent to Seton Hall Preparatory School in New Jersey, where Lionel was at that point considering. Barrymore was troubled at Seton and was before long pulled back, after which he went to a few state funded schools in New York, including the Mount Pleasant Military Academy.
