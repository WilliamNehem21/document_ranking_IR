In the wake of distributing two books, "Dead Men Tell No Tales" in 1899 and "Peccavi" in 1900, Hornung distributed a second gathering of Raffles stories, "The Black Mask", in 1901. The almost broke Manders is advised to apply for the post of a medical caretaker to an older invalid, who at that point uncovers himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders depicts, had "matured twenty years; he looked fifty in any event. His hair was white; there was no trap about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the edges of the eyes and mouth were both numerous and profound". In the last story of the accumulation, "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enroll in the military to battle in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders injured and Raffles killed. The faultfinders again grumbled about the criminal angle; "The Spectator" announced "this kind of book presents wrongdoing in a structure excessively engaging and alluring to be moral", while the analyst for "The Illustrated London News" suspected that Hornung's "innovation has clearly flaggedÃÂ ... It is bizarre, one might say which the creator never expected, to hear these robbers rage about the respect of Old England. It is a pity that the man who stated "Peccavi" should stoop to this".
