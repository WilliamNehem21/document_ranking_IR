As Branco would like to think, head author Ron Carlivati needed to utilize the storyline to return Todd to his dim roots by appearing as a beast once more, expressing, "Carlivati accomplished something one of a kind, striking and dangerous with one of his marquee characters", exhibiting Todd's harmed identity and raising doubt about his psychological steadiness. Carlivati said that Todd was persuaded that Starr's supposed assault was karmic recompense, notwithstanding when Starr demanded that she had not been assaulted. Branco proposed that Todd's decision and solid response to seeing the two in bed together was Todd's powerlessness to isolate sex from savagery, expressing, "Todd, in that example, ended up unhinged, neurotic, and crazy". Todd was trying to claim ignorance, and even nearly hit Starr twice when she tested his convictions. The scenes were applauded as "arresting". Cleanser writer Marlena De Lacroix, a self-portrayed "Todd hater" who felt that the character was insane, communicated trust that they were "the start of a storyline that will dig into Todd's psyche and illuminate watchers with regards to the complexities of a character who is rationally sick". De Lacroix stressed that despite the fact that the storyline could be paramount, it could be another approach to fabricate compassion toward Todd.
