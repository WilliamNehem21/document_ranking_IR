Monteux's later London exhibitions were not just with the LSO. In 1960 he directed Beecham's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performing "accomplishments of wizardry" in works by Beethoven, Debussy and Hindemith. The LSO offered him the post of central conductor in 1961, when he was eighty-six; he acknowledged, on condition that he had an agreement for a quarter century, with an alternative of recharging. His huge and fluctuated collection was shown in his LSO shows. Notwithstanding the French collection with which, to his periodic bothering, he was for the most part related, he modified Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Wagner, just as later arrangers including Granados, Schoenberg, Scriabin, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Richard Strauss and Vaughan Williams. With the LSO, Monteux gave a fiftieth commemoration exhibition of "The Rite of Spring" at the Royal Albert Hall within the sight of the author. Despite the fact that the chronicle of the event uncovers a few failures of group and slack rhythms, it was an exceptional and enthusiastic show, and Monteux ascended to Stravinsky's case to grasp him toward the end. Players trusted that in his couple of years in control he changed the LSO; Neville Marriner felt that he "made them feel like a global ensemble ... He gave them broadened skylines and a portion of his accomplishments with the symphony, both at home and abroad, gave them a significant diverse constitution."
