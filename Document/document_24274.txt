An American patrol located the Japanese defensive position on 1Â January 1944. "B"Â Troop of the 112thÂ Cavalry Regiment launched an attack later that morning, but was beaten off by heavy fire; the Americans suffered three killed and 15 wounded in this action. On 4Â January, "G"Â Troop incurred three killed and 21 wounded in an unsuccessful attack on well-built Japanese positions. This operation had been conducted without artillery support in an attempt to surprise the Japanese, and also included a feint against Umtingalu involving several LCMs. Further attacks on 6, 7 and 11Â January failed to make any headway, but gave the cavalrymen experience in maneuvering through the Japanese defensive positions. These American operations were conducted on a limited scale as Cunningham and the 112thÂ Cavalry Regiment's other senior officers believed that the unit had already achieved the goals of the landing at Arawe and did not want to incur unnecessary casualties.
On 6Â January, Cunningham requested further reinforcements, including tanks, to tackle the Japanese defenses. Krueger approved this request and ordered "F"Â Company, 158thÂ Infantry Regiment and "B"Â Company of the USMC 1st Tank Battalion to Arawe; the two units arrived on 10 and 12Â January respectively. The Marine tanks and two companies of the 158thÂ Infantry Regiment subsequently practiced tank-infantry cooperation from 13 to 15Â January; during this period the 112thÂ Cavalry continued to conduct patrols into Japanese-held areas. By this time, the Komori Force had incurred casualties of at least 65 killed, 75 wounded and 14 missing in action as a result of its offensive actions as well as the attacks on it conducted by the Director Task Force. The Japanese were also suffering from severe supply shortages and an outbreak of dysentery.
