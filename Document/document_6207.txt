The OTMA endeavored to achieve concurrence with Gutzon Borglum, originator of the Stone Mountain piece, yet he needed an excess of cash and time. Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, who had assumed a minor job in the Columbian half dollar of 1892Ã¢ÂÂ 93, was eager, yet did not have the national notoriety the Association felt the coin's artist required. In the wake of getting recommendations from the American Numismatic Society, the Association swung to the couple group of James Earle Fraser and Laura Gardin Fraser. James Fraser had planned the Buffalo nickel; Laura Gardin Fraser had made a few dedicatory coins, including the Grant Centennial dollar and half dollar. It picked the Frasers at the encouraging of Minnie Howard, who felt that James Fraser's work managed the West, and might make show, in his coin plan, the significance of the movement by secured wagon. The Association decided upon a structure idea of a guide demonstrating the Oregon Trail on one side, and on the other a man driving a bull drawn wagon, with his significant other and newborn child tyke riding. In spite of the fact that he isn't formally celebrated by the coin, the man was intended to be Meeker.
