All in all, "A.ÃÂ subrubescens" can be recognized from other "Albatrellus" species by its white top that winds up orange when wounded, its basic septate hyphae, little amyloid spores, and natural surroundings under pines. In the field, "Albatrellus ovinus" is hard to separate from "A.ÃÂ subrubescens" because of its comparable appearance. "A.ÃÂ ovinus" generally comes up short on the violet shading regularly found in the top and stem of "A.ÃÂ subrubescens". Minute qualities can be utilized to dependably recognize the two species: the spores of "A.ÃÂ subrubescens" are amyloid, rather than those of "A.ÃÂ ovinus", and "A.ÃÂ ovinus" spores are littler, normally 3.8Ã¢ÂÂ 4.6 by 3.3Ã¢ÂÂ 3.5ÃÂ ÃÂµm. Other comparative species incorporate "A.ÃÂ tianschanicus", depicted from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species "A.ÃÂ cantharellus". Dissimilar to "A.ÃÂ subrubescens", these species have furry scales on the outside of their tops, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Likewise, the sizes of "A.ÃÂ subrubescens" are very little darker than the region between the scales. Both of these Asian species have bigger spores than "A.ÃÂ subrubescens": those of "A.ÃÂ cantharellus" are 4.5Ã¢ÂÂ 7 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5.5ÃÂ ÃÂµm, while those of "A.ÃÂ tianschanicus" are 5Ã¢ÂÂ 7 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ÃÂµm.
