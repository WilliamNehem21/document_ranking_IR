The way that all pilots in the novel are ladies (rather than the infantry, which is totally male) has been refered to as proof of dynamic sexual orientation legislative issues inside the story, despite the fact that the thought communicated by Rico that ladies are the inspiration for men to battle in the military is a counter-guide to this. A 1996 sci-fi reference book said that like quite a bit of Heinlein's fiction, "Starship Troopers" exemplified "macho male culture". The prosthetically upgraded fighters in the novel, every one of whom are men, have been portrayed for instance of the "hyper-manliness" expedited by the nearness of these men to innovation. The story depicts the Arachnids as so outsider that the main reaction to them can be war. Women's activist researchers have depicted this response as a "routinely masculinist" one. Steffen Hantke has portrayed the motorized suits in the novel, which influence the wearer to look like a "steel gorilla," as characterizing manliness as "something strongly physical, in light of creature power, impulse, and animosity". He calls this type of manliness "all body, in a manner of speaking, and no mind". Therefore, in Hantke's perusing, "Starship Troopers" communicates fears of how manliness might be safeguarded in a situation of high innovation. This dread is exacerbated by the themes of pregnancy and birth that Heinlein utilizes while portraying how the fighters in suits are dropped from spaceships, which are constantly guided by ladies. In spite of the fact that Rico says he discovers ladies "sublime", he demonstrates no craving for sexual movement; the war appears to have subsumed sex in this regard. A 1979 synopsis contended that notwithstanding the motions towards ladies' fairness, ladies in the story were still items, to be secured, and to battle wars over.
