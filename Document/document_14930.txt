The groups of the American trader vessels had just little arms, yet their escort, "Examination", was a significantly more dominant vessel. Directed by William Maley, the 135-ton "Investigation" was furnished with 12 six-pounder weapons and had a supplement of 70 men. In correlation, Rigaud's underlying assault constrain comprised of eleven scows manned by 40 to 50 men each in the littler ones, and 60 or 70 in the bigger vessels. These scows were fundamentally moved by paddles, with 26 for each vessel. The Haitian specialty were each outfitted with a blend of swivel weapons and four-pounder gun, with most vessels equipped with a few firearms just as little arms. Notwithstanding the vessels that set out to assault the guard, there were more freight ships and men close-by that the Haitians could call upon if fortifications were required. In all out exactly 37 freight ships and 1500 men were at Rigaud's prompt transfer, however the Americans did not know this amid the assault. Independently the Haitian canal boats exhibited just a little risk to the guard, however while assaulting "all at once" they could without much of a stretch overpower and catch the American boats on the off chance that they figured out how to board them.
