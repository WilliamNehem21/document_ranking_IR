Following the clearing of Rabaul, Lerew took direction of a composite squadron in Port Moresby which later moved toward becoming No.ÃÂ 32 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron. On 11ÃÂ February 1942, he drove a trip of three Hudsons in a strike on Gasmata harbor, making what the official history of the RAAF in World WarÃÂ II depicted as "the principal pole tallness assault on foe delivering in the New Guinea battle". Having set two ships ablaze, the Hudsons were assaulted by foe contenders and two were shot down, including Lerew's. With his flying machine on fire, he requested his team to ransom of the back bring forth while he parachuted from the front window. Lerew arrived in the wilderness and barely maintained a strategic distance from catch before advancing toward a Coastwatcher post and coming back to Port Moresby in a clipper, nine days in the wake of having been posted missing; his group individuals had kicked the bucket. On 7ÃÂ April, Lerew was granted the Distinguished Flying Cross for "extraordinary mettle, assurance, aptitude and constancy over the span of bombarding attacks on foe positions in New Britain". The accomplishment of the Gasmata task provoked the Chief of the Air Staff to laud Lerew's squadron for the "exertion required by the two groups and ground work force inferable from our little numbers and general condition".
