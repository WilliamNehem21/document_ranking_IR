Following this occasion, Zwingli and other humanist companions appealed to the religious administrator on 2 July to cancel the prerequisite of chastity on the ministry. After two weeks the appeal was reproduced for general society in German as "Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung a bite the dust Eidgenossen" (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not only a conceptual issue for Zwingli, as he had covertly hitched a widow, Anna Reinhard, prior in the year. Their dwelling together was outstanding and their open wedding occurred on 2 April 1524, three months before the introduction of their first youngster. They would in the end have four youngsters: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the request was routed to the common specialists, the priest reacted at a similar dimension by telling the ZÃÂ¼rich government to keep up the religious request. Different Swiss priests participated in Zwingli's motivation which urged him to own his first real expression of confidence, "Apologeticus Archeteles" (The First and Last Word). He shielded himself against charges of affecting distress and apostasy. He denied the clerical chain of command any privilege to make a decision on issues of chapel request in light of its undermined state.
