Alkan's arrival to the show stage in 1844 was welcomed with eagerness by faultfinders, who noticed the "praiseworthy flawlessness" of his system, and commended him as "a model of science and motivation", a "sensation" and a "blast". They likewise remarked on the going to famous people including Liszt, Chopin, Sand and Dumas. Around the same time he distributed his piano ÃÂ©tude "Le chemin de fer", which faultfinders, following Ronald Smith, accept to be the primary portrayal in music of a steam motor. Somewhere in the range of 1844 and 1848 Alkan delivered a progression of virtuoso pieces, the 25 "PrÃÂ©ludes" Op.ÃÂ 31 for piano or organ, and the sonata Op.ÃÂ 33 "Les quatre ÃÂ¢ges". Following an Alkan presentation in 1848, the writer Giacomo Meyerbeer was impressed to the point that he welcomed the musician, whom he considered "a most striking craftsman", to set up the piano course of action of the suggestion to his approaching musical show, "Le prophÃÂ¨te". Meyerbeer heard and affirmed Alkan's game plan of the suggestion for four hands (which Alkan played with his sibling NapolÃÂ©on) in 1849; distributed in 1850, it is the main record of the suggestion, which was rejected amid practices at the OpÃÂ©ra.
