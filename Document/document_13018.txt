Feynman is remembered in different ways. On May 4, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the "American Scientists" memorial set of four 37-penny self-cement stamps in a few setups. The researchers delineated were Richard Feynman, John von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, and Josiah Willard Gibbs. Feynman's stamp, sepia-conditioned, highlights a photo of a 30-something Feynman and eight little Feynman graphs. The stamps were planned by Victor Stabin under the imaginative course of Carl T. Herrman. The principle working for the Computing Division at Fermilab is named the "Feynman Computing Center" in his respect. A photo of Richard Feynman giving an address was a piece of the 1997 blurb arrangement dispatched by Apple Inc. for their "Think Different" publicizing effort. The Sheldon Cooper character in "The Big Bang Theory" is a Feynman fan who copies him by playing the bongo drums. On January 27, 2016, Bill Gates composed an article "The Best Teacher I Never Had" depicting Feynman's abilities as an educator which roused Gates to make Project Tuva to put the recordings of Feynman's Messenger Lectures, "The Character of Physical Law", on a site for open review. In 2015 Gates made a video on why he thought Feynman was unique. The video was made for the 50th commemoration of Feynman's 1965 Nobel Prize, because of Caltech's solicitation for considerations on Feynman.
