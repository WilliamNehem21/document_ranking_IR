ÃthelflÃ¦d was born around 870, the oldest child of King Alfred the Great and his Mercian wife, Ealhswith, who was a daughter of Ãthelred Mucel, ealdorman of the Gaini, one of the tribes of Mercia. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal house, probably a descendant of King Coenwulf (796â821). ÃthelflÃ¦d was thus half-Mercian and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was sealed by her marriage to Ãthelred, Lord of the Mercians. They are mentioned in Alfred's will, which probably dates to the 880s. ÃthelflÃ¦d, described only as "my eldest daughter", received an estate and 100 mancuses, while Ãthelred, the only ealdorman to be mentioned by name, received a sword worth 100 mancuses. ÃthelflÃ¦d was first recorded as Ãthelred's wife in a charter of 887, when he granted two estates to the see of Worcester "with the permission and sign-manual of King Alfred" and the attestors included "ÃthelflÃ¦d "conjux"". The marriage may have taken place earlier, perhaps when he submitted to Alfred following the recovery of London in 886. Ãthelred was much older than ÃthelflÃ¦d and they had one known child, a daughter called Ãlfwynn. Ãthelstan, the eldest son of Edward the Elder and future king of England, was brought up in their court and, in the view of Martin Ryan, certainly joined their campaigns against the Vikings.
