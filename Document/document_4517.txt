He was in charge of the staff work for the assaults on Bardia and Tobruk. In January 1941, Berryman progressed toward becoming Commander, Royal Artillery, seventh Division, and was elevated to brigadier. Amid the Syria-Lebanon crusade, he directed "Berryforce". He came back to Australia in 1942, getting to be Major General, General Staff, of the First Army. Soon thereafter, he moved toward becoming Deputy Chief of the General Staff under the Commander in Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, who conveyed him up to Port Moresby to at the same time go about as head of staff of New Guinea Force. Berryman was personally included with the arranging and execution of the Salamaua-Lae battle and the Huon Peninsula crusade. In November 1943 he ended up acting administrator of II Corps, which he drove in the Battle of Sio. In the last piece of the war, he was Blamey's delegate at General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's base camp and the Australian Army agent at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay.
