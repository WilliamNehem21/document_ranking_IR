Dunn additionally asserted that Lodge put DiÃ¡Â»Âm on hold so as to educate Conein where the NgÃÂ´ siblings were so the commanders could catch them. At the point when gone up against about Dunn's case by a student of history, Conein denied the record. It was additionally uncovered that Conein had called the consulate right off the bat a similar morning to ask about the commanders' solicitation for a plane to transport DiÃ¡Â»Âm and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff revealed to Conein that the plane would need to go legitimately to the faraway refuge offering nation, with the goal that the siblings couldn't land at an adjacent stopover nation and remain there to incite a counter-overthrow. Conein was informed that the closest plane that was prepared to do such a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the essential game plans. Minh was flabbergasted and disclosed to Conein that the officers couldn't hold DiÃ¡Â»Âm for that period. Conein did not presume a purposeful postponement by the American international safe haven. Conversely, a US Senate analytical commission in the mid 1970s raised a provocative idea: "One marvels what was the fate of the US military air ship that had been dispatched to remain by for Lodge's takeoff, planned for the earlier day." The student of history Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown DiÃ¡Â»Âm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American locale, before taking him to the last goal. Moyar theorized that "when Lodge had offered the fly the day preceding, he had done it to incite DiÃ¡Â»Âm to surrender when the result of the insurgence was especially in uncertainty. Since the overthrow plainly had succeeded, Lodge never again expected to offer such a motivation."
