In an investigation of the film in the "History and Memory" diary, Aileen Blaney composed that it is Nesbitt's genuine commonly recognized name status that made his depiction of Cooper such a triumph. She contemplated that Nesbitt's big name status reflects that of Cooper's during the 1970s: "An easily recognized name crosswise over Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic [sic], Nesbitt's across the board famous intrigue is decidedly not dependent upon his Protestant Ulster personality, and therefore the twofold voicing of the character he plays does not estrange watchers of an option, or no, partisan influence." "Watchman" columnist Susie Steiner proposed that his appearance in "Wicked Sunday" was an endeavor to determine the statement of his "Irishness" on screen: "Where he has participated in a partisan topic, his insight as an on-screen character has frequently been covered by an unnecessary, animation style parody. However in his increasingly fruitful, prominent jobs, (remarkably in "Chilly Feet", and as Pig Finn in the delicately peaceful film "Waking Ned"), Nesbitt's Irishness has been misused for its sentimental appeal. It has been sugared and, all the while, de-politicized." A commentator distinguished "Bleeding Sunday" as Nesbitt's "transitioning" film, and Nesbitt considered it a defining moment in his vocation. He alludes to his profession since the film was discharged as "post-"Grisly Sunday"".
