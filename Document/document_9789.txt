In 1923, Bagramyan was designated leader of the Alexandropol Cavalry Regiment, a position he held until 1931. After two years, Bagramyan moved on from the Leningrad Cavalry School and, in 1934, from the Frunze Military Academy. In his journals, Pyotr Grigorenko, a Ukrainian leader who went to Frunze, reviewed how Bagramyan was removed from the institute by his bosses after they had discovered that he had been a mystery individual from the prohibited Dashnak Armenian patriot party for over 10 years. Pending his capture, Grigorenko depicted Bagramyan "profoundly discouraged, saying he just wished they'd capture him soon so he could get it over with." Grigorenko exhorted that he request the capture warrant which Bagramyan reluctantly did and, with the assistance of Armenian politburo part Anastas Mikoyan, the capture warrant was repudiated and he acknowledged to be "restored." From 1934 to 1936, he filled in as the head of staff of the fifth Cavalry Division, and from 1938, he functioned as a senior teacher and speaker at the Military Academy of the Soviet General Staff. Simultaneously, Soviet pioneer Joseph Stalin had cleansed a great part of the Soviet officer corps of its veteran administrators. While individual understudies from the military foundation, Andrei Yeremenko and Georgy Zhukov, had seen their professions rise, Bagramyan's had stayed dormant.
