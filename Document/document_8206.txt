It is asserted that Stoke Ramblers was framed in 1863 when previous students of Charterhouse School shaped a football club while they were understudies at the North Staffordshire Railway works in Stoke-on-Trent. Be that as it may, Stoke Ramblers' initially recorded match was five years after the fact, on 17 October 1868, at the club's unique home, the Victoria Cricket Club ground against E.W May's XV, the 15-a-side match finished in a 1Ã¢ÂÂ 1 draw. In the amusement, the club's first objective was scored by Henry Almond, Stoke's author and chief. Stir played four further installations in 1868, recording their first triumph with a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 0 success against Newcastle-under-Lyme. In 1875, to adapt to rising attendances, the club changed to a ground at Sweetings Field, not a long way from the Victoria Cricket Ground. Right now, the main installations were benevolent matches; this changed in 1877 when the Staffordshire Football Association was shaped and made another challenge, the County Cup, which Stoke won in the debut season, beating Talke Rangers 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0 in the last. In a prior round, Stoke had recorded what is as yet the club's record triumph, a 26Ã¢ÂÂ 0 triumph over Mow Cop. Stir held the County Cup in the accompanying season with a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1 success over Cobridge and set up themselves as the biggest club in the region.
