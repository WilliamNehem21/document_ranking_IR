The Mets resigned Stengel's uniform number, 37, on September 2, 1965, after which he came back to his home in California. He was kept in the group finance as a VP, however in every practical sense he was out of baseball. His life sunk into an everyday practice of going to the World Series (particularly when in California), the All-Star Game, Mets spring preparing, and the baseball journalists' supper in New York. The authors, who choose individuals from baseball's Hall of Fame, thought of it as vile that Stengel ought to need to hold up the standard five years after retirement for race, and postponed that standard. On March 8, 1966, at an unexpected service at the Mets spring preparing site in St. Petersburg, Stengel was recounted his decision; he was accepted in July alongside Ted Williams. From that point, he included the yearly Hall of Fame enlistment service to his timetable. In 1969, the "Amazin' Mets" legitimized their epithet by out of the blue prevailing upon the World Series the favored Orioles. Stengel went to the Series, tossed out the principal ball for Game 3 at Shea, and visited the clubhouse after the Mets triumphed in Game 5 to win the Series. The Mets gave him a title ring.
