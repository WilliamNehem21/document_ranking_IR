Full albums were also made available as downloadable content; the remaining songs from "Abbey Road", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", and "Rubber Soul" have since been released on the consoles' respective store services. While there is potential for the entire Beatles catalogue to be made available, this will be unlikely, according to John Drake of Harmonix. Drake identified the costly development process as a potentially prohibitive factor: "Every time we do one song, it's not like "Rock Band" where we wait for the masters to come in and just author themÂ ... its like, send people to Abbey Road, use the original tape, separate them outÂ ... it costs thousands of dollars." Drake asserted that Harmonix would take sales of the currently announced albums into consideration before continuing development of downloadable content. Harmonix's Foster stated that solo acts from the Beatles' members will not be included as downloadable content for "The Beatles: Rock Band"; however, he did not rule out the possibility of these acts appearing in other "Rock Band" games. A three pack of songs from Paul McCartney's 2009 live album, "Good Evening New York City", was made available for the main "Rock Band" series on 5 January 2010. John Lennon's "Imagine" is a part of the "Rock Band 3" soundtrack, with the full "Imagine" album arriving later as downloadable content in celebration of Lennon's 70th birthday. A pack featuring Paul McCartney's band Wings was also released as DLC for "Rock Band 3" on December 28, 2010.
