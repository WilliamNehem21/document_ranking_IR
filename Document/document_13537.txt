The Fourth Test at Manchester demonstrated questionable. The Old Trafford pitch had little grass, maybe because of prior wet climate. Once more, Johnson lost the hurl and England batted first. Johnson and his turning accomplice, Richie Benaud were unfit to abuse the turn agreeable conditions and the English made 459ÃÂ runs. In answer, the Australians couldn't understand the conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for only 84. In the midst of wild climate, the Australians were approached to pursue on. A decided batting act was insufficient to keep an English triumph by an innings and 170ÃÂ runs. Laker's execution was noteworthy. He took 10/53, the first run through in a Test coordinate a bowler had taken each of the ten wickets in an innings. With his 9/37 in the primary innings, he had caught 19ÃÂ wickets for the match, still a world record in five star cricket. "Wisden" announced that the Australians were "amazingly harsh over the state of the pitch". Previous Test cricketer and columnist Bill O'Reilly stated "This pitch is a finished disrespect" while Colin McDonald later stated, "Britain deceived: if by swindling you incorporate the act of planning wickets to suit your own motivation." Johnson was liberal towards the victors. Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he stated: "When the debate and side issues of the match are overlooked, Laker's great bowling will remain." The media revealed that Australia had been "Lakered".
