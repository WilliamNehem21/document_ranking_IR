Another way the designers wished to upgrade the player's Batman experience was through the bigger diversion world. "Arkham City" has a virtual impression multiple times bigger than that of "Arkham Asylum", and the navigational angles were improved to offer the player "the opportunity and elation of skimming down back streets and taking off over the horizon". In spite of the fact that the ideas were contrasted with an open world amusement, Hill noticed that such freestyle nature would not be proper for a Batman diversion since it would restrain the climate they needed to make, and that "Arkham City" was intended to move the player to think like Batman to endure. To balance the bigger amusement world, the designers likewise tried to incorporate more difficulties and side missions while keeping the player alert with regards to the essential mission, to such an extent that the players continually know about "extraordinary weight of the difficulties that they face". The Riddler Trophies were structured towards the finish of the diversion's advancement and were fused into each region of the guide without overpopulating it, bringing about 440 trophies. Rocksteady meant to make the player think imaginatively when gathering trophies by requiring the utilization of devices to explain bewilders, instead of putting the trophies in cloud regions of the guide as negligible accumulation things.
