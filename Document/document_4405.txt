"Aiphanes horrida" is the most broadly disseminated species. It ranges from Trinidad to Bolivia however is missing from Ecuador and northern Peru. Different species have smaller extents with one focus of decent variety in western Colombia and Ecuador and another minor one in northeastern Peru. The 2006 IUCN Red List incorporates three species which are jeopardized by natural surroundings demolitionÃ¢ÂÂ"A.ÃÂ grandis", "A.ÃÂ leiostachys" and "AÃÂ verrucosa"Ã¢ÂÂ and three others thought about helpless against a similar riskÃ¢ÂÂ"A.ÃÂ chiribogensis", "A.ÃÂ duquei" and "A.ÃÂ lindeniana". Rodrigo Bernal and Gloria Galeano extended this rundown in a 2005 survey of the status of Colombian palms. They recorded two species as basically imperiledÃ¢ÂÂ"A.ÃÂ graminifolia", a species that was first depicted in 2002, and "A.ÃÂ leiostachys" (which was named jeopardized in the IUCN Red List). They characterized two species as imperiledÃ¢ÂÂ"A.ÃÂ acaulis" and "A.ÃÂ parvifolia"Ã¢ÂÂ and two species as helplessÃ¢ÂÂ"A.ÃÂ gelatinosa" and "A.ÃÂ pilaris". They additionally grouped six species as close compromisedÃ¢ÂÂ"A.ÃÂ erinacea", "A.ÃÂ hirsuta", "A.ÃÂ lindeniana" (defenseless as per the IUCN Red List), "A.ÃÂ linearis", "A.ÃÂ macroloba" and "A.ÃÂ simplex". The dangers to these species were not recorded, yet Jens-Christian Svenning revealed that "A.ÃÂ erinacea" was undermined by logging given its restricted dissemination and poor capacity to recover in irritated backwoods. Notwithstanding these, "A.ÃÂ deltoidea", which is broadly appropriated over the western Amazon Rainforest, is available at such low densities that it was delegated an uncommon animal groups by Francis Kahn and Farana Moussa in 1994.
