Papers covering "Enterprise"s retraction and its last scene regularly said that the disappointment of "Big business" was proof that the establishment had moved excessively a long way from its underlying foundations and become excessively dim. Andy Dehnhart of MSNBC said that "while the scholars and creation planners merit credit for offering universes that were maybe somewhat increasingly acceptable, they lost the awesome, wondrous way to deal with space travel that "The Next Generation" obtained from the first "Star Trek" and after that idealized." "USA Today"s Michael Peck said that without the "fantasies" of prior arrangement, ""Star Trek" turns out to be simply one more TV dramatization." Melanie McFarland of the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer", in the interim, said the show "never found the feeling of uniqueness inside the "Trek" universe that each variant that preceded it had." Despite the crossing out, Paramount stayed hopeful. Studio head David Stapf looked "forward to another part of this suffering establishment later on." Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendrensen built up an idea for another film occurring after "Big business" however before the 1960s TV program. Then, Paramount approached Roberto Orci for thoughts to resuscitate the establishment, bringing about the generation of a reboot movie set in a substitute course of events from the 1966Ã¢ÂÂ 2005 establishment basically titled "Star Trek", discharged in May 2009 and coordinated by J. J. Abrams.
