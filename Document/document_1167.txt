One original copy of the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" says that, following the triumph at Hatfield Chase, Cadwallon and Penda proceeded to desolate "the entire land" of the Northumbrians. Unquestionably Cadwallon proceeded with the war, yet the degree of Penda's further investment is dubious. Bede says that the agnostics who had killed EdwinÃ¢ÂÂprobably a reference to the Mercians under Penda, albeit possibly it could be a contemptuous misnomer intended to allude to the Christian BritishÃ¢ÂÂconsumed a congregation and town at Campodonum, in spite of the fact that the time at which this happened is unsure. Penda may have pulled back from the war sooner or later before the annihilation and demise of Cadwallon at the Battle of Heavenfield, about a year after Hatfield Chase, since he was absent at this fight. Moreover, Bede makes no notice of Penda's essence in the former attack and fight in which Osric of Deira was vanquished and murdered. Penda's effective support in the clash of Hatfield Chase would have raised his status among the Mercians thus empowered him to move toward becoming lord, and he may have pulled back from the war before Heavenfield to verify or combine his situation in Mercia. Alluding to Penda's triumphs against the West Saxons and the Northumbrians, D. P. Kirby composes of Penda's development in these years as "a Mercian pioneer whose military adventures far rose above those of his dark forerunners."
