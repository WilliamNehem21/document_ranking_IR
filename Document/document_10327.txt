Likewise, in 672 three extraordinary Muslim armadas were dispatched to verify the ocean paths and build up bases among Syria and the Aegean. Muhammad ibn Abdallah's armada wintered at Smyrna, an armada under a certain Qays (maybe Abdallah ibn Qays) wintered in Lycia and Cilicia, and a third armada, under Khalid, went along with them later. As per the report of Theophanes, the Emperor Constantine IV (), after learning of the Arab armadas' methodology, started preparing his own armada for war. Constantine's deadly implement included siphon-bearing boats expected for the arrangement of a recently created combustible substance, Greek flame. In 673, another Arab armada, under Gunada ibn Abu Umayya, caught Tarsus in Cilicia, just as Rhodes. The last mentioned, halfway among Syria and Constantinople, was changed over into a forward supply base and place for Muslim maritime attacks. Its battalion of 12,000 men was consistently pivoted back to Syria, a little armada was joined to it for guard and attacking, and the Arabs even sowed wheat and conveyed along creatures to touch on the island. The Byzantines endeavored to hinder the Arab plans with a maritime assault on Egypt, yet it was fruitless. All through this period, overland strikes into Asia Minor proceeded, and the Arab troops wintered on Byzantine soil.
