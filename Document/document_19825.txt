"Wind Chimes", "Wonderful", and most parts of "Vegetables" were completely rerecorded with dramatically scaled-down arrangements. "Vegetables" was reworked as a kind of campfire song, "Wonderful" traded its harpsichord, strings, and horns with a haphazardly-played organ, high-pitched backing vocals, and a doo-wop sing-along section, and the marimbas in "Wind Chimes" were replaced by organ and dissonant noise. Other tracks took elements of "Smile" era compositions to make something slightly different; "She's Goin' Bald" borrows the verse melody from a "Smile" fragment known as "He Gives Speeches", "With Me Tonight" is a variation on "Vegetables", and "Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)" lifts a recurring melodic hook from "". David Anderle thought that "what Brian tried to do with "Smiley Smile" is he tried to salvage as much of "Smile" as he could and at the same time immediately go into his [long-discussed] humor album." Jardine felt that "there are some pretty cool songs on that album but I didn't like rehashing some of the "Smile" songs. That didn't work for me."
"Smiley Smile" was produced without any direct involvement from Van Dyke Parks. The only songs that appeared to have no connection to the original "Smile" album were "Little Pad" and "Gettin' Hungry". In addition, while the Beatles' Paul McCartney was present at an April 1967 session for "Vegetables", the recording where he allegedly provides celery biting sounds was not used on "Smiley Smile".
