"Ankylosaurus" was the biggest known ankylosaurine dinosaur and potentially the biggest ankylosaurid. In 2004 the American scientist Kenneth Carpenter evaluated that the person with the biggest known skull (example CMN 8880), which is long and wide, was about long and had a hip tallness of about . The littlest known skull (example AMNH 5214) is long and wide, and Carpenter evaluated that it gauged about long and about tall at the hips. In 2017, in view of examinations with progressively total ankylosaurines, the Canadian scientistss Victoria Arbor and Jordan Mallon assessed a length of for CMN 8880 and for AMNH 5214. Despite the fact that the last is the littlest example of "Ankylosaurus", its skull is as yet bigger than those of some other ankylosaurins. A couple of different ankylosaurs came to about long. Since the vertebrae of AMNH 5214 are not essentially bigger than those of different ankylosaurines, Arbor and Mallon considered their upper range gauge of about for huge "Ankylosaurus" excessively long, and proposed a length of. Arbor and Mallon assessed a weight of for AMNH 5214 and probably evaluated the heaviness of CMN 8880 at . Benson and associates additionally assessed the weight for the creature of AMNH 5214 at in 2014.
