On 11 November, "Argus" cruised again from Liverpool with a deck-heap of twelve Hurricanes and two Skuas for conveyance to Malta (Operation White). She rendezvoused with Force H four days after the fact and propelled the flying machine on the morning of 17 November. Eight of the Hurricanes came up short on fuel in transit because of headwinds and one Skua was compelled to crash arrive on Sicily after it had been harmed by Italian fire. In mid-December, the ship left six Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft of 821X Squadron for conveyance to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from 825 Squadron for self-protection. The transporter rendezvoused with "Enraged" and Convoy WS-5A before the joined power was found by the on 25 December, yet little harm was exacted by "Cooler" before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser in light of the fact that the Swordfish were left in "Argus" with bombs that they couldn't convey and the torpedoes were on board "Irate". After "Furious"s Skuas had taken off to scan for "Cooler", space was cleared to permit "Argus" Swordfish to stack the torpedoes, yet the Skuas couldn't find "Cooler" in view of the poor perceivability. "Argus" conveyed 821X Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941.
