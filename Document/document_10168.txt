Females have two sets of mammary organs (four areolas), however just a single pair is useful. The front pair (nearest to the head) are near the axillae (armpit). Furless fragrance organs are available on the two guys and females. Both genders have little, dim antebrachial (lower arm) organs estimating 1ÃÂ cm long and situated on the internal surface of the lower arm about over the wrist joint. (This quality is shared between the "Lemur" and "Hapalemur" genera.) The organ is delicate and compressible, bears fine dermal edges (like fingerprints), and is associated with the palm by a fine, 2ÃÂ mmÃ¢ÂÂ high, bald strip. In any case, just the male has a horny goad that overlays this aroma organ. The goad creates with age through the gathering of discharges from a fundamental organ that may interface through the skin through upwards of a thousand minute channels. The guys additionally have brachial (arm) organs on the axillary surface of their shoulders (close to the armpit). The brachial organ is bigger than the antebrachial organ, canvassed in short hair around the outskirts, and has a bare bow molded hole close to the inside. The organ secretes a putrid, dark colored, sticky substance. The brachial organ is scarcely created if present at all in females. The two sexual orientations likewise have apocrine and sebaceous organs in their genital or perianal districts, which are shrouded in hide.
