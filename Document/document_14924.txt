Lat wants to depict his thoughts with as meager hostility as could reasonably be expected. He notices the exhortation of his tutor, Rejabhad, and knows about sensitivities, particularly those of race, culture, and religion. As he devises the idea for his animation, he dispenses with anything he accepts to be malignant or heartless. At the Fourth Asian Cartoon Exhibition in Tokyo, Lat uncovered that when it came to making religious remarks in his work, he just did as such without anyone else religion (Islam). In such cases, Lat utilizes his specialty to help teach the youthful about his confidence. Lat confides in his editors to carry out their responsibilities and separate what is socially unsuitable for print. In a meeting, he uncovered his uneasiness with the idea of independently publishing, trusting that unadulterated or unsupervised animation attracting could prompt "trash". He likes to be emphatic in zones with which he is agreeable or equipped. Lat is unyielding on not changing what he has officially drawn; a few bits of his kid's shows stay unpublished on the grounds that editors would not print them unaltered. At the point when that occurs, the editors spike (clear) the space for his standard animation in the paper. Lat conceded to his unprinted works: "Alright, perhaps I've pushed the line a smidgen, yet I've never got into inconvenience and, in all honesty, just a bunch of my kid's shows were ever spiked."
