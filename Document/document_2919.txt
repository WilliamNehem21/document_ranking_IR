In spite of his ignominy, Teach was not the best of privateers. Henry Every resigned a rich man, and Bartholomew Roberts took an expected multiple times the sum Teach stole. Fortune seekers have since a long time ago busied themselves hunting down any hint of his supposed crowd of gold and silver, however nothing found in the various destinations investigated along the east shoreline of the US has ever been associated with him. A few stories propose that privateers frequently executed a detainee on the spot where they covered their plunder, and Teach is no special case in these accounts, yet that no finds have become visible isn't remarkable; covered privateer treasure is regularly viewed as an advanced legend for which no supporting proof exists. The accessible records incorporate nothing to propose that the internment of fortune was a typical practice, aside from in the creative impulses of the essayists of anecdotal records, for example, "Fortune Island". Such stores would require a well off proprietor, and their alleged presence disregards the order structure of a privateer vessel, in which the group served for an offer of the benefit. The main privateer known to cover treasure was William Kidd; the main fortune so far recuperated from Teach's adventures is that taken from the destruction of what is dared to be the "Ruler Anne's Revenge", which was found in 1996. Starting at 2009 in excess of 250,000 ancient rarities had been recuperated. A determination is on open presentation at the North Carolina Maritime Museum.
