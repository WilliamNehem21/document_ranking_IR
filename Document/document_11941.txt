The regular clarification for the ship's name was that it was enlivened by Henry VIII's most loved sister, Mary Tudor, and the rose as the insignia of the Tudors. As indicated by antiquarians David Childs, David Loades and Peter Marsden, no immediate proof of naming the ship after the King's sister exists. It was unmistakably increasingly normal at an opportunity to give ships devout Christian names, a long-standing convention in Western Europe, or to connect them with their imperial benefactors. Names like "Effortlessness Dieu" (Thank God) and "Holighost" (Holy Spirit) had been normal since the fifteenth century and other Tudor naval force ships had names like the "Official" and "Three Ostrich Feathers" (alluding to the peak of the Prince of Wales). The Virgin Mary is a more probable possibility for a namesake, and she was likewise connected with the Rosa Mystica (spiritualist rose). The name of the sister ship of the "Mary Rose", the "Dwindle Pomegranate", is accepted to have been named to pay tribute to Saint Peter, and the identification of the Queen Catharine of Aragon, a pomegranate. As indicated by Childs, Loades and Marsden, the two boats, which were worked around a similar time, were named to pay tribute to the lord and ruler, individually.
