Kratos' principle weapon is a couple of cutting edges appended to chains that are folded over the character's wrists and lower arms. Called Athena's Blades (otherwise called the Blades of Athena) in this amusement, they can be swung obnoxiously in different moves. As the diversion advances, Kratos procures new weaponsÃ¢ÂÂthe Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and intermittently, the Blade of OlympusÃ¢ÂÂoffering elective battle choices. In spite of the fact that Kratos starts the amusement with Athena's Blades and the enchantment capacity Poseidon's Rage (both at most extreme power), the cutting edges' capacity is diminished and the enchantment is surrendered after an experience with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be recaptured by getting a specific urn). Likewise with past diversions, Kratos figures out how to utilize around four supernatural capacities, for example, Typhon's Bane that goes about as a bow and bolt for removed targets, giving him an assortment of approaches to assault and slaughter adversaries. Other new supernatural capacities incorporate Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The extraordinary capacity Rage of the Gods, included in the past diversion is supplanted by Rage of the Titans; in contrast to the past amusement, the Rage meterÃ¢ÂÂwhich permits use of the capacityÃ¢ÂÂdoes not need to be full so as to utilize the capacity, and can be turned on and off voluntarily.
