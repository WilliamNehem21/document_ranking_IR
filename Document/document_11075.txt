Shooting started on Monday, December 11, 1989, and went on for seven days. The scene was coordinated by David Carson, who had just shot one other "People to come" scene before "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his overall absence of experience helped in light of the fact that he had no previously established inclinations about how scenes ought to be coordinated. Since a great part of the scene occurred in the darker imaginary world, Carson needed to underline the toll that times of war had taken on the group and the scaffold. "Picard truly looked drained and worn and like a fight fatigued administrator, and that is the thing that we needed the extension to resembleÃ¢ÂÂa fight exhausted scaffold. I had heaps of musings about making it as solid as conceivable utilizing a ton of low lights, a great deal of dim blues, making it particularly progressively ill humored", he said. To uplift the effect of the physical set changes, Carson adopted an alternate strategy to how he built shots. "It was my expectation to make it however much like a submarine as could reasonably be expected and to utilize low-point lighting; essentially, to do everything the contrary way that the "Undertaking" was regularly shot." The cameras were outfitted with longer focal points than expected so as to lessen the profundity of the scenes and give a grittier vibe. The utilization of low points constrained the lighting to be altered to keep the scene from, in Carson's words, looking "like an inn anteroom".
