In spite of the fact that 47 drivers were entered in the qualifier, as per NASCAR's passing strategy no one but 43 could race. Every driver ran two laps, with the beginning request dictated by the contender's quickest occasions. Drivers who recorded their lap times right off the bat in the session were at leeway in light of the fact that the track was cooler and in this manner gave more hold. Edwards felt his vehicle had oversteer amid his run. Kyle Busch won the third post position of his vocation with a period of 29.613 seconds. He was joined on the lattice's first line by Edwards, who was 0.125 seconds slower and had the shaft position until Kyle Busch's lap. Martin qualified third, Gordon fourth, and Mike Skinner fifth. Biffle, Scott Riggs, Earnhardt, Kurt Busch, and Sadler finished the main ten qualifiers. The four drivers that neglected to qualify were A. J. Allmendinger, Joe Nemechek, John Andretti, and Sauter (who slammed at turn-two on his first passing lap). Burney Lamar pulled back from the race before qualifying. After the qualifier Busch said his group knew about the vehicle's potential which was shown in Friday's sole practice session and the January test session; he was stressed over his vehicle being exceptionally tight going into the first and second turns having been on the quickening agent pedal all through his quickest lap.
