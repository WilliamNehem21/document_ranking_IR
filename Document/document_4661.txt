Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988, at 18 years old, and discharged his first collection with the gathering, "Mother's Milk", the next year. The subsequent collection, "Glucose Sex Magik", was recorded in a vacant house that the band chose to live in for the length of account. Frusciante adjusted well to the earth, and regularly invested his energy alone painting, tuning in to music, and recording tunes that would inevitably make up the principal half of the collection, "Niandra LaDes". "Glucose Sex Magik" was discharged on September 24, 1991 and was a moment achievement. The collection crested at number three in the U.S. what's more, proceeded to sell more than 12 million duplicates around the world. Not long after the collection's discharge, Frusciante built up an abhorrence of the band's recently discovered ubiquity. He felt that the band was excessively renowned, and wished they were all the while playing little clubs like they were before he joined the gathering. By his very own affirmation, the band's ascent to notoriety overwhelmed Frusciante, and he couldn't adapt to it. Amid "Glucose Sex Magik's" limited time visit, Frusciante started utilizing heroin and cocaine intensely. He and vocalist Anthony Kiedis regularly contended when exhibitions. As per Kiedis, Frusciante deliberately undermined the "Saturday Night Live" execution of "Under the Bridge" by playing the wrong introduction for the tune and out of key. His association with the band had turned out to be logically increasingly stressed, and he unexpectedly quit amid the Japanese leg of their reality visit in 1992.
