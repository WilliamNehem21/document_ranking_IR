Itala driver Maurice Fabry began the quickest of the contenders; he shrouded the main kilometer in 43.4ÃÂ seconds. Over the full separation of the lap Brasier's Baras was the speediest; his lap time of 25.4ÃÂ seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position out and about and into the lead in general. A mechanical issue made Gabriel lose control of his vehicle at Saint-Calais; he recaptured control so as to stay away from a genuine mishap yet was compelled to resign. Baras kept up his lead after the second lap, yet fell back to second the following lap as Szisz assumed control over the lead. As the day developed more sizzlingÃ¢ÂÂit achieved a high of Ã¢ÂÂ the tar started to liquefy, which ended up being a more noteworthy issue than the residue; it was kicked up by the vehicles into the essences of the drivers and their mechanics, leaking past their goggles and aggravating their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was especially influenced: his broken goggles enabled more tar to leak past and rendered him almost visually impaired. His endeavors to change the goggles at a pit stop were dismissed by authorities because hardware couldn't be supplanted mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he proceeded for two additional laps before resigning.
