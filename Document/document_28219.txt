A request by the city of Oceanside to restore access to Jefferies Ranch Road from SRÂ 76 was declined by Caltrans in late 2012, due to concerns about future expressway expansion to six lanes. In May 2013, construction at the I-15 and SRÂ 76 interchange uncovered a "Bison latifrons" fossil. Revisions to the interchange were finished in August 2013. The final portion east to I-15 was contracted out in August, and construction was to begin soon afterward and extend until 2017, at a cost of $201Â million. In AugustÂ 2016, traffic was to switch from the existing roadway to the newly constructed one west of I-15, from Gird Road to Old Highway 395. This would allow for the older roadway to be reconfigured to carry westbound traffic, while the new roadway would handle eastbound traffic. The new roadway was described as having fewer turns than the older road, which would increase safety. The expansion of the road to four lanes was completed in May 2017; this meant that from about east of the interchange with I-15 west to CRÂ S21 the roadway was four lanes wide, including the widening that had been paid for by the owners of a rock quarry.
