In June 2001, the administration set up Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada as an autonomous government office to deal with the private school document. In 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process was propelled as a major aspect of a bigger National Resolution Framework which included wellbeing bolsters, a celebration segment and a technique for prosecution. As clarified by the TRC, the ADR was structured as an "intentional procedure for goals of specific cases of sexual maltreatment, physical maltreatment, and persuasive imprisonment, without experiencing the common suit process". It was made by the Canadian government without discussion with Indigenous people group or previous private school understudies. The ADR framework additionally made it the obligation of the previous understudies to demonstrate that the maltreatment happened and was purposeful, bringing about previous understudies finding the framework hard to explore, re-damaging, and prejudicial. Numerous survivor support gatherings and Indigenous political associations, for example, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) attempted to have the ADR framework broken up. In 2004 the Assembly of First Nations discharged a report condemning of the ADR underscoring, among different issues, the disappointment of survivors to naturally get everything of remuneration without consequent ligation against the congregation and inability to adjust for lost family, language and culture. The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development discharged its own report in April 2005 observing the ADR to be "a too much exorbitant and improperly connected disappointment, for which the Minister and her authorities are unfit to raise a persuading safeguard". Inside a month of the report's discharge a Supreme Court of Canada choice conceded school participants the privilege to seek after class-activity suits, which at last prompted an administration audit of the remuneration procedure.
