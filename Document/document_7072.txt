Conceived in the western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine on 28 November 1919, Keith Ross Miller was the most youthful of Leslie (Les Sr) and Edith (Edie) Miller's four kids. He had two more established siblings and a sister. Sister Gladys was 12 when Miller was conceived, while Les Jr and Ray were nine and seven individually. Mill operator was named after the Australian pioneer pilot siblings Keith and Ross Smith, who were part of the way through their notable departure from England to Australia at the season of his introduction to the world. Mill operator's two Christian names mirrored his Scottish legacy; his dad's family began from the dock region of Edinburgh and Dundee, and his fatherly granddad touched base in Australia in April 1849. The family lived in a one-level patio house in Sunshine, which at the time was a different town of 900 individuals, west of Melbourne's downtown area. The region was and remains an average workers zone. The town's backbone was the ranch apparatus producer H. V. McKay, which utilized a vast extent of the populace. Mill operator's dad began as an educator in Warracknabeal in rustic Victoria, before functioning as a specialist for McKay in Ballarat until an exchange conveyed him to Sunshine.
