The three subspecies likewise contrast in their shading. "A. m. angolensis" has a darker to brownish coat, with thick, dull dark colored stripes on the face stretching out 66% down to the nose. While the parallel stripe is almost dark, the stripe on the rear end is dull darker. The medium darker temple fix reaches out to eye level and is isolated from the splendid white face by a dim darker fringe. A dark colored spot is seen on the nose. "A. m. hofmeyri" is a light grovel, with slender, dull dark colored face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dim darker to dark, and the back stripes are respectably darker. The temple fix, dull dark colored or grovel, stretches out past the dimension of the eyes and blends with the white of the face with no reasonable obstructions. The nose may have a pale smear. "A. m. marsupialis" is a rich chestnut darker, with flimsy, light face stripes. The stripe close to the back end is all around checked, and that on the flanks is profound darker. The temple is darker, grovel, or white, the fix not stretching out past the eyes and having no sharp limits. The nose is white or set apart with darker.
