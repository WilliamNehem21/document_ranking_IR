Stafford's mother's death in 1438 transformed his fiscal position. He now received the remainder of his father's estatesâworth about Â£1,500âand his mother's half of the de Bohun inheritance, which was worth another Â£1,200. The latter also included the earldom of Buckingham, worth Â£1,000 on its own; Stafford had become one of the greatest landowners in England overnight. "His landed resources matched his titles", explained Albert Compton-Reves, scattered as they were throughout England, Wales and Ireland, with only the King and the Richard, Duke of York wealthier. One assessment of his estates suggests that, by the late 1440s, his income was over Â£5,000 per annum, and K. B. McFarlane estimated Stafford's total potential income from land to have been Â£6,300 gross annually, at its peak between 1447 and 1448. On the other hand, the actual yield may have been lower; around Â£3,700: rents, for example, were often difficult to collect. Even a lord of the status of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, owed Stafford over Â£100 in unpaid rent for the manor of Drayton Bassett in 1458. In the 1440s and 1450s, Stafford's Welsh estates were particularly notable for both their rent arrears and public disorder. Furtherâand like most nobles of the periodâhe substantially overspent, possibly, says Harriss, by as much as Â£300 a year. His treasurer, William Wistowe, when rendering his accounts for the years 1452â1453, noted that Stafford was owed Â£730 by his reckoning, some debts being 20 years old. Despite this, says Woolgar, "there [is] no suggestion that [Stafford] found it difficult to obtain cash or goods".
