Religion is a critical topic in "Heavens Lost". As per theoretical fiction researcher Brian Attebery, the novella was a reaction to an ascent in religious fundamentalism in the U.S. also, somewhere else. Le Guin responded to the inclination inside Christian, Islamic, and Hindu fundamentalism to dismiss logical reasoning and social change, and to utilize shared convictions as reinforcement against political weight. Le Guin said in first experience with the story that she was unfit to begin "Heavens Lost" until she worked in the religious subject, which in her words "started to lace itself with the possibility of the fixed ship in the dead vacuum of room, similar to a case, brimming with change, transmutation, imperceptible life: the pupa body, the winged soul". The disciples of Bliss trust they are a piece of an unceasing voyage towards flawlessness; its convictions explicitly address fears that create in the encased space of the ship. Attebery composes that the story fills in as an illustration for the job of religion on Earth, yet that the setting of an age transport keeps the "parallel from [becoming] excessively prominent." The story likewise investigates why certain characters are impervious to the charm of Bliss; by talking about their experience and childhood, Attebery says, Le Guin "causes us trust in their capacity to pick an extreme material reality".
