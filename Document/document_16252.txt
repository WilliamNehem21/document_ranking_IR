Several molecular studies published in the 2000s demonstrated that "Psilocybe", as it was defined then, was polyphyletic. The studies supported the idea of dividing the genus into two clades, one consisting of the bluing, hallucinogenic species in the family Hymenogastraceae, and the other the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the family Strophariaceae. However, the generally accepted lectotype (a specimen later selected when the original author of a taxon name did not designate a type) of the genus as a whole was "Psilocybe montana", which is a non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species. If the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the study were to be segregated, it would have left the hallucinogenic clade without a valid name. To resolve this dilemma, several mycologists proposed in a 2005 publication to conserve the name "Psilocybe", with "P.Â semilanceata" as the type. As they explained, conserving the name "Psilocybe" in this way would prevent nomenclatural changes to a well-known group of fungi, many species of which are "linked to archaeology, anthropology, religion, alternate life styles, forensic science, law enforcement, laws and regulation". Further, the name "P.Â semilanceata" had historically been accepted as the lectotype by many authors in the period 1938â68. The proposal to conserve the name "Psilocybe", with "P.Â semilanceata" as the type was accepted unanimously by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi in 2009.
