Mucho Macho Man initially dashed at Calder Race Course. He was scratched by the track veterinarian from the primary race into which he was entered; he had been marginally harmed when the pony by him raised and flipped over in the beginning door. He was entered in another race seven days after the fact, a lady race in which he completed second, losing to a foal named Gourmet Dinner. After that race, Mucho Macho Man was acquired by Reeves Thoroughbred Racing. Senior member and Patti Reeves had thought about obtaining Gourmet Dinner, however Dean Reeves said at the time, "Call me insane, yet I like the second pony." After the deal, Tim Ritvo assumed control over the preparation of Mucho Macho Man from his unique coach, Bill White. The foal came in third at his next race, at Saratoga in New York state; he won his first race on SeptemberÃÂ 19, 2010, at Monmouth Park in New Jersey. After that race, the foal's preparation was swung over to Kathy Ritvo when Tim started working for Gulfstream Park. In November 2010, Mucho Macho Man climbed to evaluated class and completed second behind To Honor and Serve twice in succession at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City, first in the Nashua Stakes and after that in the Remsen Stakes. All through his two-year-old year the youthful pony was effectively occupied, so he hustled with signals for both White and Ritvo.
