Sheep visited his auntie and uncle in Windsor on leave in May 1975, "gladly wearing his uniform", columnist Tony Wanless composes. Turned out in the RLI's plaid green stately dress and green beret, he was obvious strolling along Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's primary lanes. Unintentionally, a burial service parade was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandma along that very road in the meantime, driving Edith's more youthful sibling Richard to spot Lamb on the asphalt. The officer stayed unmindful, however his essence stunned the Chaykoski family. "He had the uniform and looked somewhat changed," Richard told the "Windsor Star" after a year, "yet I always remembered his face." Chaykoski's mom was so angry with the episode that for quite a while a short time later she wouldn't disregard the house. While remaining with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and disclosed to him that serving in the Rhodesian security powers had enhanced him actually and made him regard himself out of the blue. In light of this he wished to disregard his past life in Canada; specifically he said he "didn't need it related with his received nation". He communicated his worry that on the off chance that he were murdered or caught, the Canadian press may uncover his earlier history and humiliate the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental medical clinic. Be that as it may, he stated, he felt extraordinary unwaveringness towards Rhodesia would in any case return to proceed with his administration.
