In the recording studios Solti's career took off after 1956, when John Culshaw was put in charge of Decca's classical recording programme. Culshaw believed Solti to be "the great Wagner conductor of our time", and was determined to record the four operas of "Der Ring des Nibelungen" with Solti and the finest Wagner singers available. The cast Culshaw assembled for the cycle included Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, Birgit Nilsson and Wolfgang Windgassen. Apart from "Arabella" in 1957, in which he substituted when Karl BÃ¶hm withdrew, Solti had made no complete recording of an opera until the sessions for "Das Rheingold", the first of the "Ring" tetralogy, in September and October 1958. In their respective memoirs Culshaw and Solti told how Walter Legge of Decca's rival EMI predicted that "Das Rheingold" would be a commercial disaster ("'Very nice,' he said, 'Very interesting. But of course you won't "sell" any.'") The success of the recording took the record industry by surprise. It featured for weeks in the "Billboard" charts, the sole classical album alongside best sellers by Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, and brought Solti's name to international prominence. He appeared with leading orchestras in New York, Vienna and Los Angeles, and at Covent Garden he conducted "Der Rosenkavalier" and Britten's "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
