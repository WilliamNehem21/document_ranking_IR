In spite of Mary Shelley's endeavors to help Gatteschi monetarily, he attempted to coerce her one year later in 1845ÃÂ using tactless letters she had composed. After not got notification from Gatteschi for quite a long time, she got compromising letters, which asserted that she had guaranteed him monetary achievement and even potentially marriage. He guaranteed that her letters would exhibit this. The substance of Mary Shelley's letters are obscure as they were later pulverized, yet she more likely than not felt some peril, for she went to considerable lengths to recoup the letters and composed anguished letters to her companions: "[The letters] were composed with an open heart Ã¢ÂÂ and contain subtleties as to my previous history, which it [would] decimate me for ever on the off chance that they at any point saw light." Shelley swung to Alexander Knox for help. In the wake of getting assistance from the British government, he went to Paris and had the Paris police catch Gatteschi's correspondence. Suggesting that Gatteschi was a peril to the state, Knox and the Paris police called upon the "bureau noir" framework so as to recover the letters. On 11 October, "Le National" and "Le Constitutionnel" announced in shock that Gatteschi's own papers were seized on the grounds that he was a presumed progressive. Mary wrote to Claire that "It is a horrendous power this seizure", yet she didn't lament utilizing it. After Knox recovered her letters, he consumed them. Shelley burned through ÃÂ£250 of her own cash to fund the activity. She was humiliated by the whole occurrence.
