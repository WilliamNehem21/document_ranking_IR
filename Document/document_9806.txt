Amid the 2012 WonderCon, participants at the movie's board were given Weyland Corporation business cards that guided them to a site and phone number. Subsequent to calling the number, the guest was sent an instant message from Weyland Corporation that connected them to a video that was exhibited as a commercial for the "David 8" android, described by Fassbender. An all-inclusive rendition of the video, discharged on April 17, 2012, records the android's highlights, including its capacity to flawlessly recreate human feelings without the confinements of morals or misery. A full page "David 8" ad was put in "The Wall Street Journal"; a Twitter account worked by a David8, that permitted Twitter clients to ask the character questions, was incorporated. An association with Verizon FiOS was propelled, offering a virtual voyage through the "Prometheus" spaceship. Another video, "Calm Eye", featuring Rapace as Shaw, was discharged on May 16, 2012, and appeared on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page. In a phone call observed by Yutani, an anecdotal organization from the "Outsider" arrangement, Shaw demands Weyland's guide to search out outsider life. In France, the Saint-Martin apparition train station was changed over to look like outsider engineering from the film, and was noticeable to passing suburbanites. The crusade proceeded after the film's discharge with a site that was recorded amid the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel "Accordingly Spoke Zarathustra" by Friedrich Nietzsche, and highlighted a video of Weyland, who cites from the book. Another video followed in September 2012, highlighting Elba's Captain Janek getting ready for a mission.
