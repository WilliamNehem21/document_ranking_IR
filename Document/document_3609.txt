In January 1929, "Saratoga" partook in her first armada work out, Fleet Problem IX, a reenacted assault on the Panama Canal. These activities tried the Navy's advancing regulation and strategies for the utilization of bearers. The ship was isolates from the armada with just the light cruiser as escort and made a wide breadth toward the south to assault the trench, which was shielded by the Scouting Fleet and "Lexington", from a startling course. In spite of the fact that the bearer was spotted by two protecting boats before she propelled her air strike, her flying machine were esteemed to have decimated the waterway locks. "Saratoga" was "sunk" later that day by an airstrike from "Lexington". Commander Frederick J. Horne expected order on 20 April. The next year, "Saratoga" and "Langley" were "crippled" by an unexpected assault from "Lexington" in Fleet Problem X in the Caribbean. "Saratoga" gave back where its due in the blink of an eye a short time later in Fleet Problem XI, further exhibiting the powerlessness of bearers to flying assault. Following the activities, "Saratoga" took an interest in the Presidential Review at Norfolk, Virginia in May and after that came back to San Pedro. Chief Frank McCrary soothed Horne on 5 September 1930.
