By this point in the diversion, Florida State was completely dedicated to running down the clock and executed three straight surging plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was compelled to utilize two of its timeouts to stop the clock, yet was inevitably effective in constraining a Seminole punt. The kick moved inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being brought down, sticking the Hokies somewhere down in their region. The primary play of Tech's drive was right around a fiasco for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick bobbled the ball while endeavoring to maintain a strategic distance from a sack. Luckily for the Hokies, the ball was jumped on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive remained alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with trouble. Because of the restricted time remaining, Virginia Tech was compelled to depend primarily on passing plays, which halted the clock when fragmented or were finished for a first down. A 14-yard go to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard toss to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then finished a 19-yard go to Jeff King and Florida State submitted a 15-yard roughing the passer punishment on Marcus Vick, which was attached onto the finish of the play. After the punishment, Virginia Tech's offense was somewhere down in Florida State an area, and two plays later, Marcus Vick kept running into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. As opposed to endeavor another two-point transformation, the Hokies kicked the additional point, and with 1:44 residual, Virginia Tech had shut the hole to 27Ã¢ÂÂ 22.
