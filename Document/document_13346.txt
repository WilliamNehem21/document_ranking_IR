Capel went up against 22 different pitchers for a MLB list spot in the Brewers' spring preparing camp. The Brewers optioned Capel to their Triple-A subsidiary, the Denver Zephyrs, on April 5, preceding the beginning of Milwaukee's 1990 season. On May 17, Denver set Capel on the DL with a stressed Achilles ligament, which opened a program spot on the Zephyrs and enabled the Brewers to send Jaime Navarro back to Denver. At the point when the Brewers required a swap for the harmed Bill Wegman, Capel was called up to the real associations. For his Brewers debut, Capel confronted five hitters and permitted four runs (two charged to Capel) against the Baltimore Orioles. His strikeout of Billy Ripken was the main MLB out Capel recorded in 1990. On June 8, he made his second and last trip with the Brewers and permitted four runs (three charged to Capel) against the Toronto Blue Jays; consolidated, hitters hit .857 against Capel as he completed the season with a 135.00 ERA. At the point when Greg Vaughn, coming back from a turf toe damage and a sprained left lower leg, was actuated from the DL on June 11, Capel was sent to Triple-A. He completed the season with Denver where he had a 4Ã¢ÂÂ 3 record with a 4.26 ERA. On October 4, the Brewers conceded Capel free office; he marked with the Astros on January 5, 1991.
