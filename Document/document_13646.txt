Holst was in Venice when the updates on Joseph's demise contacted him; despite the fact that Imogen records that he got it unemotionally, he was secretly crushed. Joseph had, composed Imogen, "come closest to his optimal of unwavering discernment and clear inclination". In his own tribute, Holst attracted consideration regarding Joseph's "interminable limit with respect to making careful arrangements which adds up to virtuoso". No Whitsun celebration was held in 1929, however toward the beginning of July, at an outside generation of Holst's "The Golden Goose" at Warwick Castle, an exceptional execution of his "St Paul's Suite" was played in Joseph's memory. On 5 December 1929, at a focused music celebration, Vaughan Williams led the choir in Joseph's "Song for Whitsuntide" while the group of onlookers remained in tribute. A similar psalm was played at the first continued Whitsun celebration, at Chichester in May 1930. In July 1931 Holst incorporated her music in a show that he directed at Chichester Cathedral, close by works by William Byrd, Thomas Weelkes and Vaughan Williams. Through the span of the following couple of years Joseph's works were played at shows and occasions sorted out by Morley College, the SWM, SPGS and the English Folk Dance Society. At Eothen a "Jane Joseph Memorial Prize" was set up, and music grants were blessed in her name at Eothen and SPGS.
