This record expresses that the twins were joined at the hip just, as opposed to at both the hip and the shoulder, and that they lived to a generally seniority. The article unequivocally expresses that their names were not recorded, and that they were referred to just as the "House keepers of Biddenden". The mysterious creator relates the tale of their inheritance of the grounds to the ward to help the yearly dole, and proceeds to state that regardless of the vestige of the occasions depicted, he has no uncertainty as to their legitimacy. Likewise with all records of the convention before 1790 the creator does not make reference to their supposed birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these subtleties originally showed up in a broadside distributed in 1790. "The Antiquarian Repertory" of 1775 says that the sisters had lived "as custom says, two hundred and fifty years back". Illustrations of Biddenden cakes from this period demonstrate that they highlighted a picture of two ladies, conceivably conjoined, however no names, dates or ages.
