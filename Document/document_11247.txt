Students of history showed shifting reactions to Blassingame's utilization of mental hypothesis. In an audit in the "William and Mary Quarterly", George Mullin is particularly incredulous of Blassingame's utilization of brain science, expressing that Blassingame "reduc[es] slave conduct and culture to an issue of jobs and mental qualities". He presumes that an "E. P. Thompson for the American Black people group amid subjugation is still off-organize", and that the point needs investigation by a social or financial student of history. Rawick states that Blassingame's "first real mistake lies in embracing the entirely faulty deterministic social mental job speculations related with ... Irving Goffman and Henry Stack Sullivan." He grumbles that it "spoofs the essential multifaceted nature of the 'brain science' of the mistreated who all the while see themselves in socially negative terms while battling against the perspective on themselves and their conduct". Rawick is persuaded that Blassingame would have achieved similar ends from the sources without the utilization of brain research "on the grounds that the verifiable proof as observed through an unadulterated responsibility to the battles of the slaves and a similarly solid threatening vibe toward the experts would have driven him there." On the other hand, Eugene D. Genovese and Earl E. Thorpe lauded Blassingame for his utilization of mental hypothesis, yet concede they incline toward Freudian and Marxist understandings over Sullivanian hypothesis.
