"DÃ©jÃ  Vu" was performed by BeyoncÃ© at the 2006 BET Awards on June 27 at the Shrine Auditorium. The show was opened with a performance of the song and Jay-Z joined BeyoncÃ© onstage during the second half of the song. William Keck of "USA Today" commented that BeyoncÃ© "sizzled in a revealing silver ensemble" as she performed the song. She also performed "DÃ©jÃ  Vu" at the Fashion Rocks on September 8, 2006. According to Farrah Weinstein of MTV News, BeyoncÃ©'s performance of the song was billed as a tribute to Josephine Baker, and both her stage set and outfit were in homage to the singer and dancer. The set was designed like an old cabaret club, complete with male dancers bearing saxophones, and both BeyoncÃ© and her female dancers wore Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. She performed the song on the American morning news and talk show, "Good Morning America" during an episode which aired on September 8, 2006. BeyoncÃ© also performed the song at "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" on September 9, 2006, and at "The Tyra Banks Show" on September 15, 2006.
