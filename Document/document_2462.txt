Enduring Macedonian painted work of art incorporates frescoes and wall paintings, yet in addition adornment on etched craftsmanship, for example, statues and reliefs. For example, follow hues still exist on the bas-reliefs of the late fourth century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian compositions have enabled history specialists to examine the dress designs just as military rigging worn by the old Macedonians. Beside metalwork and painting, mosaics are another huge type of enduring Macedonian fine art. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional characteristics and illusionist style, show clear impact from painted work of art and more extensive Hellenistic craftsmanship patterns, despite the fact that the provincial subject of chasing was custom fitted to Macedonian tastes. The comparative Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella delineates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his buddy Craterus, or basically a regular representation of the regal redirection of chasing. Mosaics with fanciful topics incorporate scenes of Dionysus riding a puma and Helen of Troy being kidnapped by Theseus, the last of which utilizes illusionist characteristics and sensible shading like Macedonian sketches. Normal topics of Macedonian depictions and mosaics incorporate fighting, chasing, and forceful manly sexuality (for example kidnapping of ladies for assault or marriage); these subjects are on occasion joined inside a solitary work and maybe show an allegorical association.
