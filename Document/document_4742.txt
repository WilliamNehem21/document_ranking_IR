In its first year, the Referendum Party had minimal set up association and generally remained an idea with restricted solid nearness. Goldsmith's accounts had enabled its appearance to be went with mass attention however it did not have the standard hardware of an ideological group, for example, a mass enrollment or politically experienced faculty. To counter this issue, Goldsmith looked to make a refined authoritative focus and to verify the skill to complete a political battle, building up his base camp in London. By October 1995, the gathering had set up a various leveled structure comprising of three levels: the inside, district and supporters. Working the middle was Goldsmith and a bureau whose enrollment included Lord McAlpine, who was a previous treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two previous individuals from the Conservative Central Office staff. The inside had around 50 staff, who handed-off Goldsmith's directions through to the ten local co-ordinators, who thus transmitted them to the imminent competitors in the voting demographics. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated basic leadership with Goldsmith and the middle and gave little independence to the areas and supporters, in spite of the fact that this was regarded important to guarantee productivity in its battle.
