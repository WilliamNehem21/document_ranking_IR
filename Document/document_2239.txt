The Jewish essayist Michael Steinberg depicted the ensemble's prosperity as basically a wonder of the minimized plate, and keeping in mind that live exhibitions are as yet given, they don't generally sell out. A few commentators, standing amazed at the unexpected achievement of the piece almost two decades after its organization, propose that it reverberated with a specific disposition in the mainstream culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in "A manual for the ensemble", pondered whether the business achievement of the work was "an insignificant blip on a few people's radar" or would end up having enduring criticalness. In 1998, the Jewish faultfinder Michael Steinberg asked, "[are people] truly tuning in to this orchestra? What number of CD purchasers find that fifty-four minutes of moderate music with a touch of singing in a language they don't comprehend is more than they need? Is it being played as ambient melodies to Chardonnay and brie?" Steinberg contrasted the achievement of GÃÂ³recki's ensemble with the "Specialist Zhivago" wonder of 1958: "Everyone raced to purchase the book; few oversaw really to peruse it. The presence of the film in 1965 safeguarded all of us from the need." GÃÂ³recki was as astounded as any other individual at the chronicle's prosperity, and later hypothesized that "maybe individuals discover something they need in this bit of musicÃ¢ÂÂ¦ . By one way or another I hit the correct note, something they were absent. Something, some place had been lost to them. I feel that I intuitively comprehended what they required."
