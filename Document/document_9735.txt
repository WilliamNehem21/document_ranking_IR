In 1950, No. 38 Squadron was chosen to shape some portion of the Australian power alloted to the Commonwealth Far East Air Force. As a component of this power, the Australian Government concurred for the unit to be entrusted with dispatch flights crosswise over Asia and offering help for the British-drove counterinsurgency tasks in Malaya. The squadron's development party touched base at RAF Changi in Singapore on 19 June 1950, and the majority of its faculty and eight Dakotas were operational there by 6 July. While in Malaya the squadron went under the direction of No. 90 (Composite) Wing, alongside the Avro Lincoln-prepared No. 1 Squadron. A large portion of the squadron's aircrew were veterans of the Berlin Airlift, yet none had any immediate experience of tropical situations. No. 38 Squadron started flying transport missions in Malaya toward the beginning of July, with British and New Zealand pilots going with its aircrews amid the initial two weeks of activities to enable them to get comfortable with nearby conditions. From July 1950 until February 1951, No. 38 Squadron's fundamental assignment was to direct dispatch flights to Borneo, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines, and these remained an imperative obligation all through the period it was based at Singapore. Following the episode of the Korean War, the squadron flew British troops and supplies from Singapore to Japan and Korea, and four of No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas were exchanged to No. 30 Communication Unit in Japan amid November 1950.
