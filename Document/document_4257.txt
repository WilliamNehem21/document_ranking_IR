In the 21st century, Adams stays less notable than a large number of America's other Founding Fathers. McCullough contended that "[t]he issue with Adams is that most Americans think nothing about him." Todd Leopold of CNN wrote in 2001 that Adams is "recognized as that person who served a solitary term as president among Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, to some degree round man whose stature appears to have been predominated by his lean partners." He has dependably been seen, Ferling says, as "legit and devoted", however notwithstanding his protracted profession in open administration, Adams is still eclipsed by the emotional military and political accomplishments and solid identities of his counterparts. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 life story of Adams, portrayed the man as "staunch, fair obstinate and to some degree restricted." In his two-volume 1962 memoir, Page Smith praises Adams for his battle against radicals, for example, Thomas Paine, whose guaranteed changes predicted political agitation and hopelessness. Ferling, in his 1992 life story, composes that "Adams was the cause all his own problems." He censures him for his "negligibility ... envy, and vanity", and deficiencies him for his regular divisions from his better half and kids. He lauds Adams for his readiness to recognize his inadequacies and for endeavoring to beat them. In 1995, Peter Shaw distributed "The Character of John Adams". Ferling trusts that the man who develops is one "never-endingly at war with himself", whose craving for acclaim and acknowledgment prompts charges of vanity.
