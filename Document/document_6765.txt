On the morning of 25 October, "HyÃÂ«ga" was situated close to the light transporters and to secure them with her enemy of air ship firearms. Her radar grabbed the first of five American airstrikes at a scope of at 07:13, however the war vessel was not an essential target. Sections from close misses by bombs harmed the ship's enemy of torpedo rankle and she built up a 5ÃÂ° list that was effectively remedied. Regardless of "HyÃÂ«ga"s insurance, "Chiyoda" was set ablaze and her motors were impaired. Matsuda requested the warship and the light cruiser to tow the injured bearer, yet "HyÃÂ«ga" was unfit to do as such and rejoined the fundamental body at 18:30. The American submarine detected the Fourth Carrier Division at 17:42 and manoeuvered to assault, missing with six torpedoes at 18:43. At 19:00 Ozawa requested Matsuda to take his boats south to protect "Isuzu" and her escorting destroyers that were endeavoring to save "Chiyoda"s survivors, notwithstanding gunfire from a gathering of four American cruisers. Unfit to find either gathering of boats, Ozawa requested Matsuda to switch course at 23:30 and head for Amami ÃÂshima to refuel. Regardless of being spotted by American submarines in transit, the division arrived securely on 27 October. That equivalent day Ozawa exchanged his banner to "HyÃÂ«ga". In the wake of leaving the island the next day, they were ineffectively assaulted by the submarine before their landing in Kure on the 29th.
