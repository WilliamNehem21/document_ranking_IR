In 2015, Chastain assumed the piece of an administrator in Ridley Scott's sci-fi film "The Martian". Featuring Matt Damon as a botanist who is stranded on Mars by a group of space travelers directed by Chastain's character, the movie depends on Andy Weir's epic of a similar name. Chastain met with space travelers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johnson Space Center, and put together her job with respect to Tracy Caldwell Dyson, with whom she invested energy in Houston. "The Martian" turned into her second film to procure over $600ÃÂ million in two successive years. Chastain next featured as a royal lady who plots with her sibling (played by Tom Hiddleston) to threaten his new lady of the hour (played by Mia Wasikowska) in Guillermo del Toro's gothic sentiment "Ruby Peak". She moved toward the disgusting part with sympathy, and in planning read memorial park verse and watched the movies "Rebecca" (1940) and "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" (1962). Del Toro cast her to loan availability to a section he considered "psychopathic", however Peter Debruge of "Assortment" discovered her "alarmingly miscast" and condemned her for neglecting to viably pass on her character's weakness and mercilessness. On the other hand, David Sims of "Slate" adulated her for depicting her character's "envious force to the handle".
