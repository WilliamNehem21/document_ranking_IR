There was no across the country decision day in 1840, and numerous states, when they held the presidential vote, had just directed balloting in neighborhood races and for the House of Representatives. One state, South Carolina, did not have a prominent vote in favor of president, with voters picked by the council. These state and government races, from March to October 1840, prompted Whig triumphs in everything except a couple of states, mostly Democratic fortifications like New Hampshire. Among the triumphs was that of Whig Governor-choose Corwin in Ohio. The main presidential balloting started on October 29, in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the surveys finished with Rhode Island on November 23. Monday, November 2 was the biggest surveying day, as 12 states, including New York, casted a ballot. As those states incorporated the vote, natives checked fanatic and untrustworthy papers, attempting to perceive a pattern. Despite the fact that Harrison drove in 10 of the initial 11 states to report, previous president Jackson kept in touch with Van Buren, "don't trust an expression of it. Nor will I trust that you are not chosen until I see all the official returns." But when the Whigs took New York by 13,000 votes, unmistakably Harrison and Tyler had won the race.
