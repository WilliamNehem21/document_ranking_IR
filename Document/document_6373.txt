In view of ship perceptions in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, a low-weight territory grew north of Key West toward the beginning of August. It formed into a tropical sadness at 12:00ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃÂ 8, and reinforced into a typhoon at 06:00ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃÂ 9 while moving northwestward off the west shore of Florida. Progressive escalation proceeded, and at 06:00ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃÂ 11 the tempest fortified to tropical storm status. At 22:00ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃÂ 11, the typhoon achieved its pinnacle force and simultaneously made landfall close to the fringe among Alabama and Florida as a little tropical violent wind. Amid this time, the tempest's greatest supported breezes were evaluated at 80ÃÂ mph (130ÃÂ km/h), making it what might be compared to a CategoryÃÂ 1 storm on the present day SaffirÃ¢ÂÂ Simpson sea tempest wind scale. A respite in the tempest went with the close-by entry of its eye before conditions by and by crumbled. Despite the fact that the most minimal barometric weight estimated ashore was 1007ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 29.74ÃÂ inHg) in Pensacola, Florida, the tempest's weight was assessed to be much lower at 982ÃÂ mbar (hPa: 29.00ÃÂ inHg). In the wake of making landfall, the sea tempest debilitated and gradually floated westbound, debilitating to a tropical gloom over Louisiana on AugustÃÂ 13, before scattering over Arkansas by 12:00ÃÂ UTC the following day.
