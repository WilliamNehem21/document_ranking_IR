He picked up a Second Class in the main History Tripos in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an article on political parody in English verse. He won a similar prize again in 1910, and that year increased top of the line praises in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having questions about his future as a pastor and counseled with the college Law Reader with regards to the likelihood of a vocation as an advodate. On the Reader's recommendation, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, going with inferior distinctions. Birkett met with the editors of "The Guardian" and "The Observer" as he continued looking for an occupation to support him while he got through the law oriented scrutinization. He accepted a position as close to home secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a compensation of ÃÂ£200 every year, which he wanted to hold until he qualified as an attorney. After just a month of working for Cadbury, his compensation was raised to ÃÂ£500, and he was offered a stable situation. While there, he proceeded with his political work and talked for the benefit of the Liberal Party, solidifying his notoriety for being a viable speaker by, on one event, holding the consideration of in excess of a thousand people for 60 minutes. He took the initial segment of the Bar Examination in 1912, yet fizzled the paper on genuine property; he passed it on his second endeavor, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.
