Club" and "Slant" have received the album favourably; likewise, "Rolling Stone" gave the album five stars in the 2004 edition of "The Rolling Stone Album Guide", with critic Rob Sheffield saying "Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering." "Most would rate "OK Computer" the apogee of pomo texture", Christgau said in retrospect.
