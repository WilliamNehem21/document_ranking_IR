David Keevill contends that the unequivocally hostile to Christian frame of mind of most Viking metal specialists is a chronologically erroneous perspective on the Viking Age. Keevill clarifies that "while groups have utilized [Viking mythology] as the reason for their melodic existenceÃÂ ... the chronicled truth of the Viking Age (late eighth century to the eleventh century) is a checkered scenery of a large number of conviction frameworks and different political components". As a recorded precedent, he refers to the assault on Lindisfarne in 793, an occasion considered the start of the Viking Age and celebrated by Enslaved in its melody "793 (Slaget Om Lindisfarne)". He battles that this assault was just a pioneering strike, not a coordinated assault on the developing intensity of Christianity, and that the expressions "barbarian" and "agnostic" verifiably did not really signify "hostile to Christian", yet that the general population being referred to did not fit under a denominational mark. Besides, Norse religion and Christianity mixed and impacted each other all through the time, and Christianity was regularly forced through monarchical routines, for example, Harald Klak and Harald Bluetooth or change developments, for example, those started by Ansgar. Keevill reasons that, "It isn't so much that groups like Amon Amarth shouldn't spurn their Norse legacy, the hostile idea of the predecessors or the sort of practices that would have occurred in remote social orders, it's simply that decision out the nearness of a tyrannical Christian impact on the Viking Age is unfathomably close-disapproved."
