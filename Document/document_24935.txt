The Tudor Gothic building which housed the school after only 17 years of use was undermined in 1892 by the construction of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel running north under Howard Street from Camden Street Station to the newly constructed Mount Royal Station and the City College collapsed, damaging several buildings around it j
including several theaters and the Academy of Music. After a long municipal political controversy for three years, by 1895, a new larger structure, designed in the Romanesque Revival style by the noted local architects Baldwin & Pennington, was erected on the same site, only turned to be facing the Centre Street northern side. This new building quickly became overcrowded and an annex was established on 26th Street. The addition did not help with the increase in school-aged youth beginning to attend City College by World WarÂ I (1914-1918). During the 1920s, alumni began organizing a campaign to provide the school with a more suitable building with campus grounds and, in 1926, ground was broken for a massive Collegiate Gothic stone castle designed by the architectural partnership of Buckler and Fenhagen on renamed "Collegian Hill" southwest of newly laid out 33rd Street and The Alameda boulevards in the newly developing northeast section of the city. This new structure cost almost $3Â million and one of the 
most expensive public school projects at that time in America, and officially opened April 10, 1928.
