The armada left for a journey in the North Sea on 26ÃÂ February 1916; Jellicoe had planned to utilize the Harwich Force to clear the Heligoland Bight, however terrible climate averted activities in the southern North Sea. Accordingly, the activity was limited toward the northern end of the ocean. Another breadth started on 6ÃÂ March, yet must be deserted the next day as the climate became unreasonably extreme for the escorting destroyers. The evening of 25ÃÂ March, "Neptune" and the remainder of the armada cruised from Scapa Flow to help Beatty's battlecruisers and other light powers attacking the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. When the Grand Fleet moved toward the zone on 26ÃÂ March, the British and German powers had just separated and a solid hurricane compromised the light specialty, so the armada was requested to come back to base. On 21ÃÂ April, the Grand Fleet directed an exhibition off Horns Reef to occupy the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its protective minefields in the Baltic Sea. Amid the evening of 22/23ÃÂ April, "Neptune" was inadvertently smashed by the unbiased vendor send in thick mist, however the warship was just delicately harmed. The armada came back to Scapa Flow on 24ÃÂ April and refueled before continuing south in light of insight reports that the Germans were going to dispatch a strike on Lowestoft, yet just touched base in the region after the Germans had pulled back. On 2Ã¢ÂÂ 4ÃÂ May, the armada made another showing off Horns Reef to keep German consideration concentrated on the North Sea.
