The careful number of El Greco's works has been a fervently challenged issue. In 1937, a very compelling examination by craftsmanship student of history Rodolfo Pallucchini had the impact of significantly expanding the quantity of works acknowledged to be by El Greco. Pallucchini ascribed to El Greco a little triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena based on a mark on the work of art on the back of the focal board on the Modena triptych ("", Created by the hand of DomÃÂ©nikos). There was agreement that the triptych was to be sure an early work of El Greco and, thusly, Pallucchini's production turned into the measuring stick for attributions to the craftsman. All things considered, Wethey denied that the Modena triptych had any association whatsoever with the craftsman and, in 1962, delivered a responsive list with an extraordinarily diminished corpus of materials. Though craftsmanship student of history JosÃÂ© CamÃÂ³n Aznar had credited somewhere in the range of 787 and 829 sketches to the Cretan ace, Wethey decreased the number to 285 genuine works and Halldor SÃÂhner, a German specialist of Spanish workmanship, perceived just 137. Wethey and different researchers dismissed the idea that Crete took any part in his arrangement and upheld the end of a progression of works from El Greco's .
