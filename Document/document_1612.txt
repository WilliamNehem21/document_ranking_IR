From the 1930s agents of the American Museum of Natural History worked with the Alaska College and the Fairbanks Exploration Company to gather examples revealed by pressure driven gold digging close Fairbanks, Alaska. Childs Frick was an examination partner in fossil science with the American Museum who had been working in the Fairbanks area. In 1930, he distributed an article which contained a rundown of "wiped out Pleistocene well evolved creatures of Alaska-Yukon". This rundown included one example of what he accepted to be another subspecies which he named "Aenocyon dirus alaskensis" - the Alaskan desperate wolf. The American gallery alluded to these as a common Pleistocene animal groups in Fairbanks. Be that as it may, no sort example, depiction nor definite area was given, and in light of the fact that critical wolves had not been discovered this far north this name was later proposed as nomen nudum (invalid) by the scientist Ronald M. Nowak. Somewhere in the range of 1932 and 1953 twenty-eight wolf skulls were recuperated from the Ester, Cripple, Engineer, and Little Eldorado springs found north and west of Fairbanks. The skulls were believed to be 10,000 years of age. The geologist and scientist Theodore Galusha, who amassed the Frick accumulations of fossil warm blooded creatures at the American Museum of Natural History, took a shot at the wolf skulls over various years and noticed that, contrasted and current wolves, they were "short-confronted". The scientist Stanley John Olsen proceeded with Galusha's work with the short-colored wolf skulls, and in 1985, in view of their morphology, he characterized them as "Canis lupus" (dim wolf).
