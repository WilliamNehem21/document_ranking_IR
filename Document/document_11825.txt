The spotted green pigeon was first referenced and portrayed by the English ornithologist John Latham in his 1783 work "A General Synopsis of Birds". Latham expressed that he had seen two examples, in the accumulations of the British significant Thomas Davies and the naturalist Joseph Banks, however it is unsure how these wound up in the particular accumulations, and their provenance is obscure. Despite the fact that Banks got numerous examples from the British pioneer James Cook, and Davies got examples from contacts in New South Wales, inferring an area in the South Pacific Ocean, there are no records of spotted green pigeons having been sent from these sources. After Davies' passing, his example was purchased in 1812 by Edward Smith-Stanley, thirteenth Earl of Derby, who kept it in Knowsley Hall. Smith-Stanley's gathering was exchanged to the Derby Museum in 1851, where the example was set up from the first presented mount (which had maybe been taxidermised by Davies himself) into an examination skin. This historical center later ended up World Museum, where the example is housed today (numbered WML 3538), yet Banks' example is presently lost. Latham additionally referenced an illustration of a seen green pigeon in the accumulation of Ashton Lever, however it is obscure which example this depended on; it could have been either, or a third person. Latham incorporated an outline of the seen green pigeon in his 1823 work "A General History of Birds", and however the reason for his representation is obscure, it varies from Davies' example in certain subtleties. It is conceivable that it depended on the attracting the Leverian accumulation, since Latham expressed that this illustration demonstrated the finish of the tail as "profound ferruginous" (rust-hued), a component additionally portrayed in his own delineation.
