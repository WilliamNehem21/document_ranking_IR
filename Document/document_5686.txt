At the point when "Confined Bird" was distributed in 1969, Angelou was hailed as another sort of memoirist, one of the principal African-American ladies who had the capacity to openly talk about her own life. Up to that point, Black ladies scholars were minimized to the indicate that they were not able present themselves as focal characters. Author Julian Mayfield, who called "Confined Bird" "a masterpiece that evades depiction", has demanded that Angelou's collections of memoirs set a point of reference for African-American personal history overall. Als demanded that "Confined Bird" checked one of the primary occasions that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, "expound on darkness from within, without expression of remorse or protection". Through the composition of her personal history, Angelou ended up perceived as a regarded representative for blacks and ladies. "Confined Bird" made her "without a doubtÃÂ ... America's most unmistakable dark lady autobiographer". In spite of the fact that Als considers "Confined Bird" a vital commitment to the expansion of Black women's activist works during the 1970s, he ascribes its prosperity less to its inventiveness than to "its reverberation in the common Zeitgeist" of now is the right time, toward the finish of the American Civil Rights Movement. Angelou's compositions, more intrigued by self-disclosure than in legislative issues or women's liberation, liberated numerous other ladies journalists to "open themselves up without disgrace to the eyes of the world".
