In a matter of seconds before the senior Bowie passed on around 1820, he gave ten slaves just as ponies and dairy cattle to both James and Rezin. For the following seven years, the siblings cooperated to build up a few expansive domains in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's populace was developing quickly, and the siblings would have liked to exploit its rising area costs through theory. Without the capital required to purchase vast tracts, they went into an association with privateer Jean Lafitte in 1818 to fund-raise. By at that point, the United States had prohibited the importation of slaves, and most southern states permitted any individual who educated on a slave merchant to get half of what the imported slaves would gain at sale as a reward. Bowie made three outings to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each event, he purchased snuck slaves and took them legitimately to a customhouse to educate individually activities. At the point when the traditions officers offered the slaves available to be purchased, Bowie bought them and got back a large portion of the value he had paid, as permitted by the state laws. He at that point could lawfully transport the slaves and exchange them at a more noteworthy market an incentive in New Orleans or territories more distant up the Mississippi River. Utilizing this plan, the siblings gathered $65,000 to be utilized for their property theory.
