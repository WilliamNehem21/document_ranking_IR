The plan for the $50 got contemporary analysis; some proposed that the nearness of the dolphins on the octagonal coin suggested that the waterway had been developed for cetacean comfort. A 1916 section in the "American Journal of Numismatics" contained the end that "the analysis frequently heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin with the exception of the engraving' is completely justified." Swiatek and Breen rejected reactions as "various and for the most part superfluous, in view of all out misreading of the iconography. [McAdoo started it] with idiotic cases that Pallas Athena made no difference on a U.S. coin except if she could be related to Liberty, and that Athena's owl could never mean anything to us all". Vermeule considered the $50 coins "a visit de compel, dated certainly, yet sufficiently abnormal in all regards to be deserving of what American numismatic craftsmanship could accomplish". Later Chief Engraver Elizabeth Jones felt that the $50 pieces were "elaborately in venture with the period [and have] extensive creative benefits". Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. gold coins, regarded the PanamaÃ¢ÂÂ Pacific $50 pieces "a standout amongst the most shocking issues at any point created by the U.S. government".
