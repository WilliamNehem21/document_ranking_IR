Stephens placed "D.Â regia" in section "Psychophila" Planch., which at that time included "D.Â arcturi", "D.Â stenopetala", and "D.Â uniflora", though she noted that the many-flowered inflorescence was unusual for this group. In 1970, the South African botanist Anna Amelia Obermeyer suggested that "D.Â regia" did not fit into any of the taxonomic groups established by Ludwig Diels in his 1906 monograph on the family. Obermeyer noted the unusual characteristics that set "D.Â regia" apart from any other "Drosera" species: the operculate pollen, circinate leaf vernation, undivided styles, and woody rhizomes. In 1994, RÃ¼diger Seine and Wilhelm Barthlott proposed classifying "D.Â regia" as the sole species in a new subgenus, "Drosera" subg. "Regiae", to "give adequate recognition to the isolated position of "D.Â regia" within the genus." This taxonomic position was affirmed by Jan Schlauer in his dichotomous key and taxonomic revisions published in 1996. Also in 1996 two Czech researchers, JindÅich Chrtek and ZdeÅka SlavÃ­kovÃ¡, proposed changes to the taxonomy of the genus by splitting "D.Â regia" off into its own, monotypic genus, "Freatulina". Chrtek and SlavÃ­kovÃ¡ cited the many morphological differences between "D.Â regia" and every other member of the genus "Drosera" in support of their decision to make this taxonomic split. They reaffirmed their taxonomic opinions in a 1999 article that also split the tuberous "Drosera", members of the subgenus "Ergaleium", to Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's resurrected genus "Sondera". These taxonomic revisions, however, have not gained any support, being rejected or largely ignored by recent publications on the genus.
