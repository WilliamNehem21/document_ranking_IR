Helen left for a period in June 1941, amid which Parsons, urged to do as such by the explicitly lenient demeanor of the O.T.O., started a sexual association with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's arrival, Sara attested that she was Parsons' new spouse, and Parsons himself conceded that he discovered Sara more explicitly alluring than Helen. Clashed in her emotions, Helen looked for solace in Smith and started an association with him that went on for a mind-blowing remainder; the four remained companions. The two couples, alongside various different Thelemites (some of whom with their youngsters), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style chateau. They all added to the lease of $100 every month and lived publicly in what supplanted Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, keeping up an assignment and butchering their very own animals for meat just as blood customs. Parsons embellished his new stay with a duplicate of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his accumulation of swords and blades. He changed over the carport and pantry into a substance research center and regularly had sci-fi talk gatherings in the kitchen, and engaged the kids with chases for pixies in the 25-section of land garden.
