Trajan's successor Hadrian ("r".ÃÂ 117Ã¢ÂÂ 138ÃÂ AD) reaffirmed the Roman-Parthian outskirt at the Euphrates, deciding not to attack Mesopotamia because of Rome's presently constrained military assets. Parthamaspates fled after the Parthians rebelled against him, yet the Romans made him lord of Osroene. Osroes I kicked the bucket amid his contention with Vologases III, the last prevailing by Vologases IV of Parthia ("r". c.ÃÂ 147Ã¢ÂÂ 191ÃÂ AD) who introduced a time of harmony and security. Be that as it may, the RomanÃ¢ÂÂ Parthian War of 161Ã¢ÂÂ 166ÃÂ AD started when Vologases attacked Armenia and Syria, retaking Edessa. Roman head Marcus Aurelius ("r".ÃÂ 161Ã¢ÂÂ 180ÃÂ AD) had co-ruler Lucius Verus ("r".ÃÂ 161Ã¢ÂÂ 169ÃÂ AD) protect Syria while Marcus Statius Priscus attacked Armenia in 163ÃÂ AD, trailed by the intrusion of Mesopotamia by Avidius Cassius in 164ÃÂ AD. The Romans caught and consumed Seleucia and Ctesiphon to the ground, yet they were compelled to withdraw once the Roman officers gotten a dangerous infection (conceivably smallpox) that before long assaulted the Roman world. In spite of the fact that they pulled back, starting now and into the foreseeable future the city of Dura-Europos stayed in Roman hands. At the point when Roman head Septimius Severus ("r".ÃÂ 193Ã¢ÂÂ 211ÃÂ AD) attacked Mesopotamia in 197ÃÂ AD amid the rule of Vologases V of Parthia ("r". c.ÃÂ 191Ã¢ÂÂ 208ÃÂ AD), the Romans by and by walked down the Euphrates and caught Seleucia and Ctesiphon. Subsequent to accepting the title "Parthicus Maximus", he withdrew in late 198ÃÂ AD, flopping as Trajan once did to catch Hatra amid an attack.
