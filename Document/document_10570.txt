Baldwin pulled in the consideration of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in around 1161, after Baldwin's dad's passing. Baldwin was known as an ordinance legal advisor amid his holding of Totnes. He got a letter from John of Salisbury in 1167, griping about Bartholomew's direct amid the Becket debate. John blamed Bartholomew for not appropriately supporting Thomas Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury in his debate with the ruler, asking Baldwin to impact the cleric to build his help, and not to sign any intrigue by the English religious administrators against Becket. Different letters from John managed gossipy tidbits concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was talking gravely of Becket. John's motivation appears to have been to have Baldwin go along a notice from Becket to Roger about his conduct; John was a supporter of Becket's amid the last's outcast. In 1169 Baldwin was by and by incidentally associated with the Becket debate, when he protested Becket's suspension of various aristocrats and ministry for contradicting Becket's motivation. Baldwin's complaint was not so much that they were banned, however that no notice had been given that such an activity was thought about.
