Gay and Julianne Pidduck expressed that sexual orientation contrasts are communicated by appearing female characters inside, while their male partners are delineated outside certainly moving all through the farmland. Nora Stovel saw that Thompson "accentuates Austen's women's activist parody on Regency sexual orientation financial aspects," attracting consideration not exclusively to the monetary situation of the Dashwoods yet in addition to eighteenth-century ladies as a rule.
