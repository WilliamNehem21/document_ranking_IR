In 2012, the palaeontologist Matthew T. Carrano and colleagues noted that though "Giganotosaurus" had received much attention due to its enormous size, and in spite of the holotype being relatively complete, it had not yet been described in detail, apart from the braincase. They pointed out that many contacts between skull bones were not preserved, which lead to the total length of the skull being ambiguous. They found instead that the skulls of "Giganotosaurus" and "Carcharodontosaurus" were exactly the same size as that of "Tyrannosaurus". They also measured the femur of the "Giganotosaurus" holotype to be long, in contrast to the original measurement, and proposed that the body mass would have been smaller overall. In 2013, the palaeontologist Scott Hartman published a Graphic Double Integration mass estimate (based on drawn skeletal reconstructions), wherein he found "Tyrannosaurus" ("Sue") to have been larger than "Giganotosaurus" overall. He estimated the "Giganotosaurus" holotype to have weighed , and the larger specimen . "Tyrannosaurus" was estimated to have weighed , and Hartman noted that it had a wider torso, though the two seemed similar in side view. He also pointed out that the "Giganotosaurus" dentary that was supposedly 8% larger than that of the holotype specimen would rather have been 6.5% larger, or could simply have belonged to a similarly sized animal with a more robust dentary. He conceded that with only one good "Giganotosaurus" specimen known, it is possible that larger individuals will be found, as it took most of a century to find "Sue" after "Tyrannosaurus" was discovered. In 2014, Nizar Ibrahim and colleagues estimated the length of "Spinosaurus" to have been over , by extrapolating from a new specimen scaled up to match the snout described by Dal Sasso and colleagues. This would make "Spinosaurus" the largest ever carnivorous dinosaur.
