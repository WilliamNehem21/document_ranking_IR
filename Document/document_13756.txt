"VAdm" Friedrich von Ingenohl had Holtzendorff's spot that day; however just a single day later, on the 31st, he brought down his banner on board "Deutschland" to exchange to the new man of war , which supplanted "Deutschland" as lead. The brilliant bow adornment that indicated the lead was expelled, and "Deutschland" came back to the positions of the II Battle Squadron.
