Amid the streak, the Elias Sports Bureau changed its criteria for the authority successive scoreless innings record for beginning pitchers from incorporating fragmentary innings in which a couple of outs had been recorded to checking just total scoreless innings. Since the streak was dynamic toward the finish of the 1988 season, it would have traversed two separate seasons if Hershiser had pitched any extra scoreless innings to start the following year. In any case, he yielded a keep running in his first inning of work in the 1989 season against the Cincinnati Reds, in this way finishing the streak. The streak just incorporates innings contributed the customary season, barring eight scoreless innings Hershiser pitched to begin Game 1 of the 1988 National League Championship Series on October 4 (informally stretching out his streak to 67 joined innings). In spite of the fact that he finished the ninth inning in each begin, the streak's last diversion kept going 16 innings, of which he just pitched the initial ten. Along these lines, Hershiser did not coordinate Drysdale's record of six sequential complete amusement shutouts. Like Drysdale's streak, the penultimate round of Hershiser's streak was a DodgersÃ¢ÂÂ Giants diversion that highlighted a dubious umpire's deciding that spared the streak.
