"Enraged", requested to stay behind after the greater part of the Home Fleet left on 15 April, withdrew the Narvik region on 14 April, escorted by three destroyers, to refuel at TromsÃÂ¸. In transit, her Swordfish assaulted Junkers Ju 52 transports that had arrived on solidified Lake Hartvikvatnet roughly upper east of Narvik. Two of the Ju 52s were crushed and a few others harmed. She achieved the port on 16 April with just 27% of her fuel remaining. She remained there until 18 April when she traveled south to scout the Narvik region. She was assaulted in transit by a solitary Heinkel He 111 aircraft of the II./KG 26 wing from high height. Two expansive bombs barely missed the ship, the nearest just off the port side toward the back. The stun shook her propeller shafts askew and jolted the port internal high-weight turbine with the goal that she was constrained to . "Irate" stayed off the shoreline of Norway in spite of the harm and endeavored to take off flying machine on 22 April, in spite of extreme climate, to debilitate German flying machine from conveying supplies to the German powers in Narvik. One flying machine was shot somewhere around the Germans and the others returned revealing substantial snowstorms between the ship and Narvik. The climate compounded the following day and Captain Troubridge chose to go to Harstad to check the harm from the close miss. It demonstrated more regrettable than foreseen and he was requested back to the United Kingdom. Just six of the nine outstanding Swordfish were useful.
