The dimension configuration got blended remarks. Mueller called a few dimensions "amazingly disappointing". Helgeson expressed that the quick paced "levels are ineffectively planned", and Andrew Reiner, who composed a second-feeling audit for "Amusement Informer", called the dimension structure "deplorable". "Official Xbox Magazine" was progressively blended, adjusting the likelihood of losing all sense of direction in the substantial dimensions with the feasible intrigue of these phases to 3D "Sonic" gamers, especially the individuals who had appreciated "Sonic Heroes". GameTrailers found that "the dimensions are either dull and urban, or brilliant and hallucinogenic. In any case, they fit in well to the "Sonic" universe. They are stacked with speed slopes, circles and a combination of different lifts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." Bettenhausen included "the great run-like-damnation exciting ride plan reasoning" of certain phases in his restricted applause. Casamassina hated the "inept dimension configuration", saying that "[j]ust on the grounds that they amazed players six years back does not imply that Sonic Team can reorder the very same circles and twists into each new establishment emphasis and anticipate that everybody should be content with the result." GameSpy saw that "the territories are considerably less open than in past "Sonic" amusements, yet the dimension architects haven't exploited the imperatives." "Nintendo Power" singled out the trouble of the missions that require the player to find objects.
