Hasekura had a son, named Rokuemon Tsuneyori. Two of his son's servants, Yogoemon (ä¸äºå³è¡é) and his wife, were convicted of being Christian but refused to recant their faith under torture (reverse hanging, called "Tsurushi", é£æ®ºã) and as a result died in August 1637 (as the lives of Christians were spared if they recanted, these executions indicate that they were steadfast and refused to deny their faith). In 1637, Rokuemon Tsuneyori himself also came under suspicion of Christianity after being denounced by someone from Edo, but escaped questioning because he was the master of the Zen temple of Komyoji (). In 1640, two other servants of Tsuneyori, TarÅzaemon (å¤ªéå·¦è¡é, 71), who had followed Hasekura to Rome, and his wife (59), were convicted of being Christians, and, also refusing to recant their faith under torture, died. Tsuneyori was held responsible this time and decapitated the same day, at the age of 42, for having failed to denounce Christians under his roof, although it remained unconfirmed whether he was himself Christian or not. Also, two Christian priests, the Dominican Pedro Vazquez and Joan Bautista Paulo, had given his name under torture. Tsuneyori's younger brother, Tsunemichi, was convicted as a Christian, but managed to flee and disappear.
