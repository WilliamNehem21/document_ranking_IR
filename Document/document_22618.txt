"Suillus pungens" is characterized by the very distinct color changes that occur in the cap as it develops. The range of color variation makes it possible to misidentify the species with others whose color overlaps. "Suillus pungens" has been misidentified as "S.Â placidus" because of the white color of the young fruit bodies and the droplets of exudate. "S.Â placidus" has a wider distribution, is usually found in association with eastern white pine, is generally smaller, with a maximum cap diameter up to , and has smaller spores, measuring 7â9 by 2.5â3.2Â Î¼m. It does not have any distinctive taste or odor. North American "S.Â granulatus" is another potential lookalike species, and at maturity it is nearly identical to "Suillus pungens". The cap of "S. granulatus" is variable in color, ranging from pale yellow to various shades of brown, while the pore surface is initially whitish, later becoming yellowish, and similar to "S. placidus", its typical host is eastern white pine. Unlike "S.Â pungens", it lacks a characteristic odor and taste. The Californian species "Suillus glandulosipes" has veil material attached to the edge of the cap when young. It also lacks the distinctive changes in cap color during development, is associated with lodgepole pine, has smaller spores (6.6â8.8 by 2.5â3Â Î¼m), and lacks any obvious taste and odor. Another Californian species, "Suillus quiescens", newly described in 2010, may resemble "S.Â pungens", especially at maturity. "S.Â quiescens" can be distinguished by its lack of white or olive colors when young and by a less glandular stipe when mature.
