Many consider the "Astronomica" to be a work of savviness, tastefulness, and enthusiasm. Scaliger and Bentley adulated Manilius' treatment of numbers in refrain, and the Harvard University Press later reverberated this recognition, composing that Manilius "exhibit[s] incredible virtuosity in rendering scientific tables and graphs in section structure", and that the artist "composes with some energy about his Stoic convictions and shows much mind and silliness in his character representations of people brought into the world under specific stars". Housman, in any case, calls Manilius "easy and unimportant" yet in addition depicts him as "the one Latin artist who exceeded expectations even Ovid in verbal point and keenness". The ballad, while metrically right, has been noted for its specialized language and abnormal word decisions. The classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall contends that while "getting it done, Manilius may help us to remember Lucretius", the "meter [that he uses] has the ordinary and repetitive stream of the age". Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have credited the "Astronomica" eccentricities to Manilius' accounted for African birthplace; they contend he composed and talked a type of "Africitas"Ã¢ÂÂ a putative African tongue of Latin "with firmly checked idiosyncrasies of vocabulary, grammar, sentence-structure, and style"Ã¢ÂÂ in this manner clarifying the lyric's characteristics. Beside the disastrously guessed nearness of "Africitas" in the lyric, in any case, M. Dorothy Brock contends there is almost no proof that Manilius was from Africa.
