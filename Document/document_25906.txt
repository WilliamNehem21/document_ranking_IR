The King Island emu was the smallest emu taxon, and was about half the size of the mainland birds. It was about tall. According to FranÃ§ois PÃ©ron's interview with a local sealer, the largest specimens were up to 137Â cm (4.5Â ft) in length, and the heaviest weighed 20 to 23Â kg (45 to 50Â lb). It had a darker plumage, with extensive black feathers on the neck and head, and blackish feathers on the body, where it was also mixed with brown. The bill and feet were blackish, and the naked skin on the side of the neck was blue. The 2011 genetic study did not find genes commonly associated with melanism in birds, but proposed the dark colouration could be due to alternative genetic or non-genetic factors. PÃ©ron stated there was little difference between the sexes, but that the male was perhaps brighter in colouration and slightly larger. The juveniles were grey, while the chicks were striped like other emus. There were no seasonal variations in plumage. Since the female mainland emus are on average larger than the males, and can turn brighter during the mating season, contrary to the norm in other bird species, some of these observations may have been based on erroneous conventional wisdom.
