Reviewers concluded that "Donkey Kong 64" lacked the revolutionary potential of "Donkey Kong Country" but was of a sufficient high quality to sell well during the holiday season. "The 3D platform genre doesn't evolve with "Donkey Kong 64"", "AllGame" wrote. While hyped fans would be disappointed, "IGN" felt that "Donkey Kong 64" remains an excellent and expansive platformer with an overwhelming amount of things to do. "GameFan", on the other hand, was most disappointed by how the game "truly offers nothing new" and compared its monotony and repetition with the film "Eyes Wide Shut": "a big bloated project with not enough brilliant moments to justify the numbness ... [of] sitting through the whole thing", it "fails to live up to the Rare name". "Donkey Kong 64" 3D platforming was commonplace by the time of its release and, according to "GameSpot", would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 launch title. With its competition considered, "Daily Radar" wrote that "Donkey Kong 64" was simply the best 3D platform game on the console. "Edge" qualified this thought: "Donkey Kong 64" was the closest any third-party developer had come to outdoing Nintendo's mastery of game structure, but its gameplay was derivative and unimaginative compared to the freedom and flexibility of Nintendo's "Super Mario 64". Nevertheless, the 3D "Donkey Kong" was "a fine effort ... in its own right".
