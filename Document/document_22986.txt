In anticipation of the film's debut at Sundance, John Brodie from "Variety" said the film could be the "thunder from Down Under the way "Shine" was last year." Having watched the film at Sundance, David Rooney from "Variety" praised several of the actors' performances and said the film "should score with kids the protagonists' age, but its soap-opera-style plotting and overwritten dialogue will limit wider acceptance". "Premiere" also gave a negative review of the film's debut, commenting that audiences had been expecting to see another "Shine", though left the screening disappointed. Elfick acknowledged that the initial screening of "Blackrock" at Sundance was less well received, which he blamed on sound problems. He stated that the issue was rectified for the second and third screenings, which were much more successful. Diane Carmen of "The Denver Post" gave the film a positive review of the film, which she said left audiences at Sundance "reeling with its intensity", concluding it was "almost guaranteed to find a distributor in the U.S", though in the event the film never received American distribution. Having viewed the film at the Boston Film Festival, Chris Wright from "The Phoenix" concluded, "Even with its slightly over-the-top dÃ©nouement, "Blackrock" is a believable, touching teen drama. It's also a gripping thriller".
