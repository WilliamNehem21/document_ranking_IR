Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, "Lion", "Princess Royal" and , were doing in pursuit and "Lion" opened fire at very long range. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves about 20 minutes later and concentrated their fire on "Lion". and combined their fire to cripple "Lion" over the next hour even though "Princess Royal" engaged "Derfflinger" during this period. Another signalling failure caused the British ships to focus on sinking "BlÃ¼cher" when Beatty intended most of his ships to continue the pursuit of the battlecruisers. During this time "Princess Royal" hit "BlÃ¼cher" at least twice, including the hit that crippled her and allowed the other British ships to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze. He then transferred to a destroyer and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before "BlÃ¼cher" sank and boarded "Princess Royal". Beatty ordered the pursuit resumed of the German battlecruisers, but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking "BlÃ¼cher" and that Hipper's ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. "Lion" was headed home at when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her. Later that afternoon, the battlecruiser was ordered to take "Lion" under tow. It took almost two days to reach port. The ship was under repair for the next three months and did not rejoin the fleet until 7 April. "Princess Royal" was not damaged during the battle.
