"Inocybe saliceticola" was first described in 2009 by Jukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen in the journal "Karstenia", based on around 20 specimens from Finland, the majority of which were collected by the authors. The holotype was collected from the shore of lake Pahakala, near Nurmes. The specific name "saliceticola" is in reference to the fact that the species grows among willow ("Salix"). Within the genus "Inocybe", "I.Â saliceticola" belongs to the section "Marginatae", as defined by Rolf Singer. The section has been defined in several ways. It was established in 1933 by Robert KÃ¼hner, who identified two key characteristics: a stem which does not feature a cortina (a fragile, cobweb-like partial veil) but is entirely covered by cystidia, and the presence of a marginate "bulb" at the base of the stem. Singer emended the section in 1986 to take into account that a bulb is not always present. A slightly different infrageneric taxonomy was offered by Thom Kuyper in 1986. He, like Singer, grouped "Marginatae" under "Inocybe" subg. "Inocybe", but he labelled it a "supersection". However, phylogenetic studies have indicated that neither Singer's section "Marginatae" nor Kuyper's "supersection" "Marginatae" truly form monophyletic groups, but that Singer's section comes closer to doing so. Species within "Marginatae" similar to "I.Â saliceticola" include "I.Â obtusiuscula", "I.Â dunensis", "I.Â salicis-herbaceae", "I.Â substellata", "I.Â praetervisa", "I.Â salicis" and "I.Â mixtilis". These species are all known to associate with willow, and all have macroscopic similarities.
