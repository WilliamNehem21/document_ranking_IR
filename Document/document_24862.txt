According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Ãthelberht reigned "in good harmony and in great peace" and "in peace, love and honour". He appears to have been on good terms with his younger brothers and in a charter of 861 (S 330) he granted land to St Augustine's, Canterbury in return for the abbot's continuing loyalty to him, Ãthelred and Alfred. Some historians believe that the three brothers agreed that each would succeed to the throne in turn. In two charters in 862 and 863 (S 335 and S 336) Ãthelred makes grants as king of the West Saxons and Ãthelberht is not mentioned. In Keynes's view, Ãthelberht may have delegated some power in Wessex, perhaps in his own absence. However, a charter of Ãthelberht dated December 863 (S 333) is attested by Ãthelred and Alfred as "filius regis" (king's son). Ãthelberht granted immunity from royal and judicial services to Sherborne church in honour of the souls of his father Ãthelwulf and his brother Ãthelbald. Unlike most charters, which were in Latin, this one is in Old English, and historians disagree whether this reflects a trend towards greater use of the vernacular as better suited to recording legal documents or support for Alfred's later claim that knowledge of Latin had declined disastrously when he came to the throne in 871.
