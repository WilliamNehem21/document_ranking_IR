Henry Edwards was destined to Hannah and Thomas Edwards (c. 1794 Ã¢ÂÂ 1857) at Brook House in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, England, on 27 August 1827, and was dedicated on 14 September. From his more established sibling William, he grabbed an enthusiasm for looking at creepy crawlies. He gathered butterflies as a diversion, and contemplated them under the tutelage of Edward Doubleday. His specialist father proposed a law vocation for his child, yet after a short time of ineffective examination, Edwards took a situation at an including house in London, and started acting in novice theater. He at that point traveled to join his sibling William who had settled in Australia, nine miles (14ÃÂ km) north-west of Melbourne along the bank of Merri Creek, an area at that point called Merrivale. On board the cruising ship "Ganges" from March to June 1853, he composed depictions of animals, for example, the gooney bird that he experienced out of the blue. Subsequent to touching base in Melbourne, Edwards started gathering and listing the bugs he found on his sibling's territory, and further away from home. Inside two years, he had assembled 1,676 types of creepy crawlies, shot and mounted 200 winged animals, and squeezed around 200 natural examples. This accumulation and that of William Kershaw were acquired by Frederick McCoy to shape the core of the new National Museum of Victoria.
