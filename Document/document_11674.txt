By mid-June 1943, he had set up Group Headquarters at Milne Bay, and No.ÃÂ 73 Wing HQ at Goodenough Island. On 22ÃÂ July, he mounted an activity against Gasmata runway utilizing 62ÃÂ aircraft from five of his squadrons, the biggest strike attempted by the Australians to that date.

On 8ÃÂ November, Hewitt conveyed an arrangement of three Bristol Beauforts in an extreme electrical tempest to assault the vigorously shielded harbor at Rabaul. This was imagined as a "represent the deciding moment" exertion to demonstrate the value or generally of the Beaufort as a torpedo aircraft, in which job it had so far been a mistake; in what the official history of the RAAF in World War II portrayed as "a brave assault", no less than one foe tanker was struck, for the loss of one Beaufort.
