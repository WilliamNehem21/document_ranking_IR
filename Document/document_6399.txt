The Overland Campaign was a progression of ruthless fights battled in Virginia for seven weeks amid May and June 1864. Sigel's and Butler's endeavors fizzled, and Grant was disregarded to battle Lee. On the morning of Wednesday, May 4, wearing his full uniform, with sword next to him, Grant rode out from his central command at Culpeper towards Germanna Ford, mounted on his war horse, "Cincinnati". That day Grant crossed the Rapidan unopposed, while supplies were transported on four barge spans. On May 5, the Union armed force assaulted Lee in the Wilderness, a three-day fight with assessed losses of 17,666 Union and 11,125 Confederate. Instead of retreat, Grant flanked Lee's military toward the southeast and endeavored to wedge his powers among Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House. Lee's military got to Spotsylvania first and an exorbitant fight resulted, enduring thirteen days, with high setbacks. On May 12, Grant endeavored to get through Lee's "Muleshoe" notable protected by Confederate mounted guns, bringing about one of the bloodiest strikes of the Civil War, known as the Bloody Angle. Unfit to break Lee's lines, Grant again flanked the dissidents toward the southeast, meeting at North Anna, where a fight endured three days.
