In the course of the action, "Emden" scored sixteen hits on "Sydney", killing three of her crew and wounding another thirteen. A fourth crewman died later from his injuries. "Sydney" had meanwhile fired some 670Â rounds of ammunition, with around 100Â hits claimed. "Emden" had suffered much higher casualties: 133Â officers and enlisted men died, out of a crew of 376. Most of her surviving crew, including MÃ¼ller, were taken into captivity the following day. The wounded men were sent to Australia, while the uninjured were interned at a camp in Malta; the men were returned to Germany in 1920. MÃ¼cke's landing party evaded capture. They had observed the battle, and realized that "Emden" would be destroyed. MÃ¼cke therefore ordered the old schooner "Ayesha" to be prepared for sailing. The Germans departed before "Sydney" reached Direction Island, and sailed to Padang in the Dutch East Indies. From there, they traveled to Yemen, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire, an ally of Germany. They then traveled overland to Constantinople, arriving in June 1915. There, they reported to "Vizeadmiral" Wilhelm Souchon, the commander of the ex-German battlecruiser . In the meantime, the British sloop arrived at the Cocos Islands about a week after the battle to bury the sailors killed in the battle.
