It was accepted all through the nineteenth and mid twentieth hundreds of years that sauropods like "Brachiosaurus" were too huge to even consider supporting their own load on dry land, and rather lived somewhat submerged in water. Riggs, insisting perceptions by John Bell Hatcher, was the first to guard long that most sauropods were completely earthly creatures in his 1904 record on "Brachiosaurus", calling attention to that their empty vertebrae have no simple in living sea-going or semiaquatic creatures, and their long appendages and minimal feet demonstrate specialization for earthbound movement. "Brachiosaurus" would have been exceptional adjusted than different sauropods to a completely earthly way of life through its slim appendages, high chest, wide hips, high ilia and short tail. In its dorsal vertebrae the zygapophyses were exceptionally diminished while the hyposphene-hypanthrum complex was incredibly created, bringing about a hardened middle unequipped for twisting sideways. The body was fit for quadrupedal development ashore. Despite the fact that Riggs' thoughts were progressively overlooked amid the principal half of the twentieth century, the idea of sauropods as earthly creatures has picked up help since the 1950s, and is currently all around acknowledged among scientistss. In 1990 the scientist Stephen Czerkas expressed that "Brachiosaurus" could have entered water every so often to chill (thermoregulate).
