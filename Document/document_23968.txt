The school moved several times at its beginnings and was housed in three different locations in its first three years before returning again to the original townhouse building on Courtland Street. Finally, in 1843, the City Council allocated $23,000 to acquire the vacant old landmark "Assembly Rooms" structure, two blocks south of the old City Hall / Peale Museum, at the northeastern corner of East Fayette and Holliday Streets for the new school. The famous Assembly Rooms, built by Col. Nicholas Rogers of Druid Hill mansion in 1797, the year of the town's incorporation as a city, was operated by the old Baltimore Dancing Assembly and were the site of many fine social functions, dinners, banquets, receptions and dances /soirÃ©es for the upcoming middle class who did not yet have fine drawing rooms and mansions for throwing parties
also served as the intellectual and educational center of town, with the upper floors holding rooms where the newly organized private non-circulating subscription Library Company of Baltimore and the later Mercantile Library were located there for several years. It was designed of Georgian / Federal styles of architecture and designed by the early famous city architect Robert Cary Long, Sr. Built of two stories of brick with stone trim, and a slight pitched roof with a central pediment facing Fayette Street. In its later social declining years, by 1835, a third floor with a short balustrade around the roof ledge was added giving it a flat roof, which was its appearance when municipal interest was shown, and purchased by the city in 1843 for $23,000 dollars for use by its new type of elevated school.
