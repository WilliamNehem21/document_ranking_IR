The primary state roadways along the USÃÂ 131 passage were assigned as ahead of schedule as 1919. At the point when the US Highway System was framed on November 11, 1926, USÃÂ 131 was made along the course of M-13 in Michigan. Initially finishing at Fife Lake on the north end, the roadway was stretched out to Petoskey in the late 1930s. Further changes were made, beginning during the 1950s, to change over portions of the way to a full interstate. The state began this transformation all the while at two areas: traveling north from Three Rivers, and heading both north and south from a point in southern Kent County. A third section was manufactured south of Cadillac and over resulting years Michigan filled the holes in the interstate. Cadillac and Manton were circumvent in the early piece of the 21st century, bringing about the present turnpike setup. Another huge scale development venture in 2000 remade a bizarre segment of the turnpike through Grand Rapids known as the S-Curve. Two extensions once in the past utilized by USÃÂ 131 have been marked by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as noteworthy structures; one of them has been recorded on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
