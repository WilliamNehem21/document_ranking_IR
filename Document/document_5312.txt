Sierra found that Williams would in general earn amazingly good press, even as "Phantasmagoria" got pessimistic press, so the organization started having her talk about the diversion face to face. In light of the backfire, Williams said she trusted PC recreations were liable to harsher norms than movies and TV, which she said regularly have more brutal substance than "Phantasmagoria", to some degree since PC diversions are frequently viewed as kids' stimulation instead of for grown-ups. Williams said "Phantasmagoria" was less unnecessarily brutal than amusements like "Fate" and "Mortal Kombat", and that not at all like those recreations, "Phantasmagoria" is "the hero ... not circumventing shooting up individuals". Sierra representative Rebecca Buxton and Dennis Cloutier, the organization's VP of offers, both communicated shock at the response to the amusement since Sierra endeavored solid endeavors to caution watchers about the grown-up substance in its showcasing, box admonitions and controlling choices. Cloutier said the organization was basically "blue penciling ourselves". Steven L. Kent of "The Seattle Times" said there were more fierce amusements than "Phantasmagoria", yet that most computer game viciousness shows up in PC livelinesss, and along these lines can be more not entirely obvious than in a cutting edge diversion, which inspires a more grounded passionate reaction.
