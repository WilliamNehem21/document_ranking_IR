In his 1981 monograph "The class Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)", Australian botanist Alex George restored "B.ÃÂ blechnifolia" as a legitimate species, putting it in "B."ÃÂ subgenus "Banksia" since its inflorescence is a run of the mill "Banksia" bloom spike shape, in "B."ÃÂ section "Banksia" as a result of its straight styles, and "Banksia" arrangement "Prostratae", as a result of its prostrate propensity, alongside five other firmly related species. George, as von Mueller, held it to be identified with "B.ÃÂ repens" and . In 1996, botanists Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges distributed a plan educated by a cladistic investigation of morphological attributes. This course of action kept up the species' situation in ser. "Prostratae" however found the most firmly related taxon to be , dependent on their basic limited lobed leaves, and the following nearest in respect to be "B. repens". George later distributed a refreshed adaptation of his 1981 course of action in his 1999 treatment of "Banksia" for the "Greenery of Australia" arrangement of monographs. In every one of the three courses of action, area "Prostratae" is encircled with next to zero contrasts, however its position inside the more extensive framework varies. The situation of "B.ÃÂ blechnifolia" in George's 1999 course of action might be condensed as pursues:
