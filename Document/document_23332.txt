Howard earned his only career NBA All-Star Game selection for the February 11, 1996 game. A "Sports Illustrated" story showed examples of him dominating games at will during that season. Howard also made news that season for his theatrics after being ejected from a February 27 game against the Charlotte Hornets. He kicked a water cooler across the court and was fined $5,000 for making an obscene gesture. He concluded the season by scoring at least 20Â points in his last 16Â games. Howard became just the second player in Washington franchise history, after Bernard King, to post back-to-back 40-point games (against Boston on April 17, 1996, with 40, and at Toronto on April 19, 1996, with 42). The 42Â points proved to be his career high. His strong finish earned him an NBA Player of the Month award for April. In spite of the injuries to key teammates, 1995â96 was Howard's best season, statistically. During the season, he finished 3rd in the NBA in minutes played, 6th in points scored and 10th in points per game (22.1). He was the Bullets' leading scorer. Over the course of the season, he accumulated 22Â double-doubles in 81Â games, including 6 in his last 8Â games. At the end of the season, he was named to the All-NBA team. In addition to his two 40-point performances, he posted 3 additional 30-point performances and scored at least 20Â points in 56 of 81Â games. Averaging 22.1Â points, 8.1Â rebounds and 4.4Â assists, he helped the Bullets record 39Â victories. This was not enough for the Bullets to make the playoffs during their ninth consecutive losing season.
