Hordern saw the 1950s as a decent decade to show up in film, in spite of the fact that he didn't then especially think about the medium. Writing in 1993 he stated: "With film one needs to jump into fight completely furnished. From the beginning of the film the character must be bound like a butterfly on a load up. One doesn't generally get this right, obviously, some of the time beginning toward the start of shooting a film on a comedic level that can't be continued." He hated his physical appearance, which he observed to be "frightful", and therefore abhorred viewing back his exhibitions. He favored radio in light of the fact that the group of onlookers just heard his voice, which he at that point thought about his best quality. Another reason was his acknowledgment of the contrasts between his feeling of individual accomplishment inside a performance center contrasted with that on a movie set: "You get a specific kind of fulfillment in conveying what the executive needs of you, yet the odds of being candidly included are thin." He recognized his great capacity at learning lines, something which he observed to be particularly useful for learning film contents which often changed. He delighted in the test of winning however much incentive as could be expected out of a scene and delighted in having the capacity to hit "the correct imprint for the camera". With the experience of "Nina" still crisp in his brain, Hordern enjoyed a reprieve from the stage and chose to focus on his movie profession.
