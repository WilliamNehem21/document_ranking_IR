In his book "Lord Solomon's Ring", Konrad Lorenz portrayed and broke down the intricate social cooperations in a western jackdaw run that lived around his home in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for ID and confined them in the winter to keep their yearly movement. He found that the flying creatures have a straight various leveled amass structure, with higher-positioned people commanding lower-positioned winged animals, and pair-fortified flying creatures having a similar position. Youthful guys build up their individual status before matching with females. After matching, the female accept a similar social position as her accomplice. Unmated females are the least individuals in the pecking request, and are the last to approach sustenance and safe house. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, missing amid the strength battles and pair bondings, came back to the herd, turned into the predominant male, and picked one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female quickly expected a predominant position in the social chain of command and exhibited this by pecking others. As indicated by Lorenz, the most critical factor in social conduct was the prompt and instinctive handle of the new progressive system by every one of the western jackdaws in the herd.
