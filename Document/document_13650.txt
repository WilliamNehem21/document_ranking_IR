Following the movies accomplishment of J. J. Abrams' "Star Trek" reboot and the declaration that performing artists Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto had probably consented to show up in two continuations, Internet bits of gossip started circling about the plot of the second film. Abrams indicated that in view of the substitute timetable made in the principal film, reintroducing Khan into "Star Trek" legend remained a plausibility. Abrams told MTV, "[Khan and Kirk] existÃ¢ÂÂand keeping in mind that their history may not be actually as individuals know about, I would contend that an individual's character is the thing that it is," Abrams said of the thought that his Khan could be similarly as insidious, regardless of whether Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. "Certain individuals are bound to run into each other and meet up, and Khan is out there... regardless of whether he doesn't have similar issues." Writer Damon Lindelof announced that Khan's "serious gravity," especially with respect to the character's conveyance of monologs, made him a required character to utilize, regardless of whether its notorious status made the group scared of the fan response. Lindelof tongue in cheek expressed that "it was never extremely a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it might have been 'We truly need to do this yet on the off chance that we don't hit the nail on the head individuals are going to execute us.'"
