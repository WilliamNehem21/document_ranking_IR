In the expressions of his biographer, Pei has won "each honor of any result in his craft", including the Arnold Brunner Award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1963), the Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1979), the AIA Gold Medal (1979), the first "Praemium Imperiale" for Architecture from the Japan Art Association (1989), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, the 1998 Edward MacDowell Medal in the Arts, and the 2010 Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1983 he was granted the Pritzker Prize, in some cases called the Nobel Prize of engineering. In its reference, the jury stated: "Ieoh Ming Pei has given this century a portion of its most excellent inside spaces and outside formsÃÂ ... His adaptability and ability in the utilization of materials approach the dimension of verse." The prize was joined by a US$100,000ÃÂ award, which Pei used to make a grant for Chinese understudies to think about engineering in the US, depending on the prerequisite that they come back to China to work. In being granted the 2003 Henry C. Turner Prize by the National Building Museum, historical center board seat Carolyn Brody lauded his effect on development advancement: "His eminent plans have provoked designers to devise inventive auxiliary arrangements, and his demanding desires for development quality have urged temporary workers to accomplish exclusive expectations." In December 1992, Pei was granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bramble.
