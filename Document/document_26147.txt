After its release, the pair embarked on a five-stop signing tour to promote the book in October 2008 at Waterstone's branches in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, and Cardiff. The book received positive reviews: Veronica Horwell of "The Guardian" wrote that Davies was the "Scheherazade of Cardiff Bay" and opined that the book should have been twice the published length; Ian Berriman of science fiction magazine "SFX" gave the book five stars and commented that it was the only book about "new Who" that a reader needed; television critic Charlie Brooker was inspired by the book to devote an entire episode of his BBC Four show "Screenwipe" to interviewing television writers; and chat show couple Richard and Judy selected the book as a recommended Christmas present in the "Serious Non-Fiction" category of their book club. A second edition of the book, "The Writer's Tale: The Final Chapter", was released in January 2010 by BBC Books. The second edition added 350 pages of correspondenceâbefore excising draft scripts included in the first editionâand covered Davies' final months as executive producer of "Doctor Who" as he co-wrote the five-part BBC One "Torchwood" miniseries "", planned David Tennant's departure and Matt Smith's arrival as the Doctor, and moved to the United States.
