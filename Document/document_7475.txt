The standard type of the Maya stela fusing workmanship, calendrical dates and hieroglyphic content onto an illustrious landmark just started to be raised in the Maya marshes after 250 AD. The late fourth century saw the presentation of non-Maya symbolism connected to the goliath city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. This remote impact is seen at Tikal, Uaxactun, RÃÂ­o Azul and ElÃÂ Zapote, all in the PetÃÂ©n Department of Guatemala. At Tikal this was started by the lord YaxÃÂ NuunÃÂ AyiinÃÂ I, from that point it spread to his vassal urban communities. In the fifth century, this firmly Teotihuacan-connected symbolism was surrendered by YaxÃÂ NuunÃÂ AyiinÃÂ I's child SiyajÃÂ ChanÃÂ KÃÂ¼awiilÃÂ II, who reintroduced symbolism related with the Pacific Coast and neighboring good countries. Minor references to Teotihuacan proceeded, for instance as Teotihuacan war insignias. His StelaÃÂ 31 was initially raised in 445 yet was later parted from its butt and was discovered covered in the downtown area, straightforwardly over his tomb. It portrays the delegated of SiyajÃÂ ChanÃÂ KÃÂ¼awiilÃÂ II, with his dad drifting above him as an otherworldly being and is executed in customary Maya style. On the sides of the stela are cut two representations of his dad in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the focal Mexican atlatl stick hurler not received by the Maya, and conveying a shield embellished with the essence of the Mexican god Tlaloc. The turn around of the stela bears a protracted hieroglyphic engraving specifying the historical backdrop of Tikal, including the Teotihuacan attack that built up Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his administration.
