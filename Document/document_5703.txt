The goldcrest is the littlest European flying creature, long, with a wingspan and a weight of . It is comparable in appearance to a lark, with olive-green upper-parts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with prominent dark irises. The crown of the head has dark sides and a tight dark front, and a brilliant peak, yellow with an orange focus in the male, and totally yellow in the female; the peak is raised in presentation, making the particular orange stripe of the male considerably more obvious. The little, slim bill is dark, and the legs are dim tissue darker. Aside from the peak shading, the genders are indistinguishable, despite the fact that in crisp plumage, the female may have in all respects marginally paler upper-parts and greyer underparts than the grown-up male. The adolescent is like the grown-up, however has more blunt upper-parts and does not have the hued crown. In spite of the fact that the tail and flight plumes might be held into the primary winter, by then the youthful winged animals are practically indistinct from grown-ups in the field. The flight is unmistakable; it comprises of buzzing wing-beats with infrequent abrupt alters of course. Shorter flights while bolstering are a blend of dashing and rippling with regular floating. It moves eagerly among foliage, routinely crawling on branches and all over trunks.
