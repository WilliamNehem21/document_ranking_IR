The last execution of the first Experience lineup occurred on June 29, 1969, at Barry Fey's Denver Pop Festival, a three-day occasion held at Denver's Mile High Stadium that was set apart by police utilizing nerve gas to control the crowd. The band barely got away from the setting in the back of a rental truck, which was mostly smashed by fans who had hopped over the vehicle. Prior to the show, a writer incensed Redding by inquiring as to why he was there; the columnist at that point educated him that two weeks sooner Hendrix declared that he had been supplanted with Billy Cox. The following day, Redding quit the Experience and came back to London. He reported that he had left the band and planned to seek after a performance vocation, accusing Hendrix's arrangements to grow the gathering without taking into consideration his contribution as an essential explanation behind leaving. Redding later remarked: "Mitch and I hung out significantly together, yet we're English. On the off chance that we'd go out, Jimi would remain in his room. Be that as it may, any awful emotions originated from us being three folks who were voyaging excessively hard, getting excessively worn out, and taking such a large number of drugsÃÂ ... I enjoyed Hendrix. I don't care for Mitchell."
