The acting of the fundamental cast was conflictingly gotten. Lloyd Miller of the "St. Petersburg Times" said the characters "come back to their unique jobs with an energy and mind concealed in before scenes of the film arrangement". Deny Salem of "The Toronto Star" jested that however the on-screen characters looked senseless once in a while, this was an advantage; "as their ability for activity has reduced, their comedic gifts have bloomed [...] they have all moved toward becoming experts of self-deploring self-spoof." "The Boston Globe"s Matthew Gilbert called the on-screen characters' exhibitions "photocopies" of past movies: "Shatner and Nimoy are good, yet need vitality. There's no place else to run with their jobs, and they know it. DeForest Kelley is strangely out of it." Plummer and Warner's depictions of their Klingon characters were generally welcomed; Maslin remarked that "at whatever point a gifted performer [...] figures out how to rise up out of behind this [makeup] with his identity flawless, it's a prominent achievement." The other supporting characters got comparative applause; H.J. Kirchhoff, composing for "The Globe and Mail", said that the visitor stars joined the "family fun" of the film as "fiery, outlandish and brilliant heroes and trouble makers". A "Cinefantastique" review audit considered the film to have the best visitor stars at any point gathered for a "Star Trek" film.
