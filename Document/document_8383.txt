Stalin's demise in 1953 permitted a specific unwinding of the social tyranny in Russia and its satellite states. By 1956, political occasions had prompted an incomplete defrosting of the melodic atmosphere, and the Warsaw Autumn Festival of Contemporary Music was established. Considered as a biennial celebration, it has been held every year as far back as 1958 (with the exception of under Martial law in 1982 when, in dissent, the ZKP wouldn't sort out it). The main execution of his "Musique funÃÂ¨bre" (in Polish, "Muzyka ÃÂ¼aÃÂobna", English "Depressing Music" or "Music of Mourning") occurred in 1958. It was composed to recognize the tenth commemoration of the passing of BÃÂ©la BartÃÂ³k, yet took the author four years to finish. This work brought universal acknowledgment, the yearly ZKP prize and the International Rostrum of Composers prize in 1959. LutosÃÂawski's consonant and contrapuntal reasoning were created in this work, and in the "Five tunes" of 1956Ã¢ÂÂ 57, as he presented his twelve-note framework, the products of numerous long periods of thought and investigation. He set up another element of his compositional strategy, which turned into a LutosÃÂawski signature, when he started bringing irregularity into the careful synchronization of different pieces of the melodic group in "Jeux vÃÂ©nitiens" ("Venetian diversions"). These symphonious and worldly strategies turned out to be a piece of each resulting work, and fundamental to his style.
