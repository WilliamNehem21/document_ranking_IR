John Kricfalusi, the maker of "The Ren and Stimpy Show", asserted the Mr. Hankey idea was stolen from his animation short, "Nutty the Friendly Dump", which was a piece of an animation book arrangement visible on the web. Kricfalusi even affirmed that he pitched the thought for an enlivened arrangement of "Nutty the Friendly Dump" to Comedy Central, who turned it down. Kricfalusi said after the show broadcast, "I got nine or 10 messages from companions shouting, 'I can't trust this! They completely stole your story!'ÃÂ ... This thought of [feces] singing or moving and being companions, well, that is my thought." Kricfalusi said he felt different components of "South Park" were lifted from his work, and he told news sources his organization SpÃÂ¼mcÃÂ¸ was mulling over making lawful move against Parker and Stone. Good times TV representative Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were inexperienced with "Nutty the Friendly Dump" and that the case was "ridiculous". Parker said he had never observed the greater part a scene of "Ren and Stimpy", which he said he didn't appreciate on the grounds that the characters were too ludicrous and the voice acting was excessively irritating. Parker said Kricfalusi in the long run reached the "South Park" makers: "He composed a letter back saying, 'Goodness, OK, I perceive how it could simply be a happenstance, however you should simply admit to the press that no doubt about it "Ren and Stimpy" fan.' Ã¢ÂÂ I'm not a "Ren and Stimpy" fan."
