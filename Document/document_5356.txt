In 1968, the Army Small Arms Program created plans for another 5.56ÃÂ mm bore LMG, however no assets were allotted (5.56ÃÂ mm ammo was seen as underpowered by numerous individuals in the military). Investigations of improved 5.56ÃÂ mm ammo, with better execution attributes, started. The most punctual reference to investigations of other gauge cartridges for the LMG did not show up until 1969. In July 1970, the U.S. Armed force at long last affirmed improvement of a LMG, with no predefined bore. As of now, the terminology "Squad Automatic Weapon" (SAW) was presented. Real structure of elective cartridges for the LMG did not start until July 1971. After a month, Frankford Arsenal settled on two cartridge structures for the new LMG: a 6ÃÂ mm cartridge and another 5.56ÃÂ mm cartridge with an a lot bigger case. Neither one of the designs was settled by March 1972, when the Army distributed the details record for the arranged SAW. The 6ÃÂ mm cartridge configuration was in the long run endorsed in May that year. Preceding July 1972, SAW advancement contracts were granted to Maremont, Philco Ford, and the Rodman Laboratory at Rock Island Arsenal. These organizations delivered structures with Army assignments XM233, XM234 and XM235 separatelyÃ¢ÂÂX signifying "test". Structures were required to have a weight of under 9.07ÃÂ kg (20ÃÂ lb) including 200 rounds of ammo, and a scope of in any event 800ÃÂ meters (2,600ÃÂ ft).
