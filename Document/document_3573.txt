In 1879, a time of twenty years of practically continuous development arrived at an end, and the slate business was hit by a retreat which kept going until the 1890s. The executives reacted by fixing standards and making it progressively troublesome for the men to get some much needed rest. Work relations were compounded by contrasts in language, religion and legislative issues between the opposite sides. The proprietors and top supervisors at a large portion of the quarries were English-speaking, Anglican and Tory, while the quarrymen were Welsh-talking and for the most part Nonconformist and Liberal. Exchanges between the opposite sides normally included the utilization of translators. In October 1885, there was a question at Dinorwig over the reducing of occasions which prompted a lock-out enduring until February 1886. At the Penrhyn Quarry, George Sholto Gordon Douglas-Pennant took over from his dad Edward Gordon Douglas-Pennant in 1885, and in 1886 named E. A. Youthful as boss administrator. An increasingly stringent administration routine was presented, and relations with the workforce crumbled. This finished in the suspension of 57 individuals from the association council and 17 other men in September 1896, prompting a strike which kept going eleven months. The men were in the long run obliged to return to work, basically on the administration's terms, in August 1897. This strike wound up known as "The Penrhyn Lockout".
