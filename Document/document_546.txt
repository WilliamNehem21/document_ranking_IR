The historical backdrop of the Haflinger horse follows to the Middle Ages. Beginnings of the breed are unsure, however there are two fundamental hypotheses. The first is that Haflingers drop from steeds relinquished in the Tyrolean valleys in focal Europe by East Goths escaping from Byzantine troops after the fall of Conza in 555ÃÂ AD. These relinquished ponies are accepted to have been impacted by Oriental bloodlines and may help clarify the Arabian physical qualities found in the Haflinger. A sort of light mountain horse was first recorded in the Etsch Valley in 1282, and was most likely the precursor of the cutting edge Haflinger. The second hypothesis is that they slipped from a stallion from the Kingdom of Burgundy sent to Margrave Louis of Brandenburg by his dad, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, when the Margrave wedded Princess Margarete Maultasch of the Tyrol in 1342. It has additionally been proposed that they drop from the ancient Forest pony. Haflingers have close associations with the Noriker, a consequence of the covering geographic territories where the two breeds were created. Whatever its starting points, the breed created in a bumpy atmosphere and was well ready to flourish in unforgiving conditions with negligible support.
