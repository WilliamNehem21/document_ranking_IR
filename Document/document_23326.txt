Klepacki's solo work debuted in 2002 with "Morphscape". Production began in 1996 with the song "Cybertek", though an album was not planned at this time. The rest of "Morphscape"s songs were composed after "Red Alert 2". Klepacki composed the album's title track while working on "Command & Conquer: Renegade", and feels the game's style is visibly present in "Morphscape". Klepacki released the final product after Westwood's dissolution. His biggest inspiration in creating solo works is the legion of fans interested in "Command & Conquer". Klepacki took a hiatus from composing video game music to write two other solo albums, the first of which is entitled "Rocktronic". Released in 2004, the album was described as dark, edgy, and heavy in a way that will appeal to "Command & Conquer" fans. Klepacki sought out specific samples and instruments used in the Command & Conquer soundtrack for use in the release; the title "Rocktronic" was an attempt to name his style of music. Featuring live drumming in certain songs, the album is Klepacki's best-seller. Following "Rocktronic" was "Virtual Control", released in 2005. Klepacki complemented his usual style with experiments in hip hop on the album. Tracks from each release have been periodically used in "The Ultimate Fighter", along with certain custom themes written for the show.
