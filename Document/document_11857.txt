The headliner at The Great American Bash was a standard wrestling match for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Batista shielded the title against John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL). The development to the match started when WWE Champion John Cena was drafted to the Raw brand, taking the title with him and leaving SmackDown! without a top-level title for the heavyweight division. General Manager Theodore Long, a depicted relational arranger and principles implementer, reported a match between six wrestlers for another top-level SmackDown! title. On the June 30 scene of the "SmackDown!" TV program, the match occurred between JBL, Chris Benoit, Christian, Booker T, Muhammad Hassan, and The Undertaker. JBL was triumphant in the match, however Long declared that he was as yet not the boss. Rather he had won the privilege to a match against the World Heavyweight Champion, Batista, who was SmackDown's! last 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship selective to SmackDown!. On the July 14 scene of "SmackDown!", Batista vanquished Orlando Jordan in a standard match subsequent to playing out a Batista Bomb. After the match, JBL effectively assaulted Batista by executing a clothesline. The next week on "SmackDown!", JBL, who was joined by Jordan, arranged himself a festival party with the conviction that he had effectively won the World Heavyweight Championship. Batista showed up, and as JBL fled the scene, played out a spinebuster on Jordan.
