Acton, in her prelude to "Present day Cookery", composes that her "first and best consideration has been offered onÃÂ ... what are generally named plain English dishes" for her formulas, and Christopher Driver, the columnist and nourishment faultfinder, considers the book "as English asÃÂ ... [its] eighteenth-century forerunners". Elizabeth Ray sees that while Acton "is fundamentally an extremely English cook", a large number of the formulas are marked as French dishes, and outside nourishment is given its own part. These are formulas from the cooking styles of Indian, Syria, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Mauritius, Switzerland and the West Indies. Acton was eager to gain from outside sustenance societies, and expressed "Without receiving indiscriminately remote modes in anything simply on the grounds that they "are" outside, most likely we ought to be savvy to gain from different countries". So also, "The English Bread Book" was centered around British bread and, in her prelude, Acton expressed "Bread is a first need of life to the extraordinary mass of the English individuals; being to some extent the nourishment of allÃ¢ÂÂthe central sustenance of manyÃ¢ÂÂand nearly the sole sustenance of some more." She commits an entire section to the way to deal with bread and bread-production in France, Germany and Belgium, and the book contains formulas for German pumpernickel, French loaves, Italian polenta bread, Turkish rolls and Indian breads.
