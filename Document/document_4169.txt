In her book "Who Killed Leigh?", Kerry Carrington, a criminologist and conspicuous specialist of the homicide, portrayed the examination as being "fuelled by shared doubt and by gossip and counter-talk". Individuals who went to the gathering grumbled of living in dread of being the following reputed executioner; Matthew Webster, Jason Robertson and two different young men showed up on the first page of "The Newcastle Herald" on 8 November with such grumblings. For a period the most well known talk was that Leigh had been killed by her stepfather, and that he had been engaging in sexual relations with her for a considerable length of time. In November 1990 Detective Chaffey told writer Mark Riley that police had heard this gossip so often that they considered Shearman to be a suspect. Riley's article expressed that the network of Stockton harbored doubts about Shearman directly until Webster was accused of homicide. On 16 November Webster conceded to attacking Leigh and to providing cannabis tar to a minor. He was discharged on safeguard, with his condemning planned for 21 February 1990. On 19 January Wilson conceded to attacking Leigh; he was discharged on safeguard pending condemning. On 28 January, after being provoked by four young men with respect to the homicide, Webster ambushed one of them. On 31 January, Brad Shearman moved toward Guy Wilson out in the open, and punched him in the head multiple times after Wilson supposedly revealed to him he would get Leigh's more youthful sister next. Shearman was charged and confessed to attack.
