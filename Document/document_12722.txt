On the second day of the preliminary, Wood called Dr. Karl A. Parshall, Palsgraf's doctor. He affirmed that he had treated Palsgraf sometimes for minor afflictions before the occurrence at East New York, yet on the day after discovered her shaken and wounded. He gave it as his conclusion that Palsgraf's ills were brought about by the mishap. Beauty Gerhardt, Herbert's significant other, was the following observer. She vouched for being hit by one of "the two youthful Italian colleagues" who were dashing to make the train, and how one made it unaided and the other just with the assistance of two LIRR workers. She didn't have anything to state about the scale or Palsgraf, having seen not one or the other. Elizabeth and Lillian Palsgraf, the senior and more youthful little girl of the offended party, were beside affirm and talked about what they had seen. Wood demonstrated his solitary outstanding observer was a nervous system specialist, a specialist witness, and McNamara for the LIRR moved to reject the case on the ground that Palsgraf had neglected to introduce proof of carelessness, however Justice Humphrey denied it. The nervous system specialist, Graeme M. Hammond of Manhattan, had analyzed Palsgraf two days prior, watching her stammering, talking just with trouble. She let him know of sorrow and cerebral pains. He determined her to have horrendous delirium, for which the blast was a conceivable reason, and said the craziness was probably going to proceed as long as the case did, for just once it was settled were the stresses associated with it liable to evaporate.
