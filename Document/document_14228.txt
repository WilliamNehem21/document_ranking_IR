Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by issues including her girl Solange and Solange's life partner, the youthful fortune-chasing artist Auguste ClÃÂ©singer. The author every now and again agreed with Solange's stance in fights with her mom; he likewise confronted envy from Sand's child Maurice. Chopin was completely apathetic regarding Sand's radical political interests, while Sand looked on his general public companions with despise. As the author's sickness advanced, Sand had turned out to be to a lesser extent a darling and to a greater degree a medical attendant to Chopin, whom she called her "third youngster". In letters to outsiders, she vented her fretfulness, alluding to him as a "tyke," a "little holy messenger", a "sufferer" and a "cherished little carcass." In 1847 Sand distributed her novel "Lucrezia Floriani", whose fundamental charactersÃ¢ÂÂa rich performing artist and a ruler in powerless wellbeingÃ¢ÂÂcould be deciphered as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who couldn't have missed the implications as he helped Sand right the printer's galleys. In 1847 he didn't visit Nohant, and he unobtrusively finished their ten-year relationship following a furious correspondence which, in Sand's words, made "a bizarre end to nine years of selective fellowship." The two could never meet again.
