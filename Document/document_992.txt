The 32X's diversion library comprises of fortyÃÂ titles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD. Among the titles for the 32X were ports of arcade amusements "Space Harrier" and "Star Wars Arcade", a sidescroller with a hummingbird as a principle character in "Kolibri", and a 32X-selective diversion in the "Sonic the Hedgehog" arrangement titled "Knuckles' Chaotix". A few of the amusements discharged for the 32X are improved ports of Genesis diversions, including "Max engine propulsion", "NFL Quarterback Club", and "World Series Baseball '95". In a review audit of the support, "Star Wars Arcade" was viewed as the best amusement for the 32X by "IGN" for its helpful play, soundtrack, and unwavering propagation of the encounters of "Star Wars". In a different survey, "IGN's" Buchanan lauded the 32X title "Shadow Squadron" as better than "Star Wars Arcade". "Retro Gamer" author Damien McFerran, in any case, lauded "Virtua Fighter" as "the gem in the 32X's crown", and "GamesRadar+" named "Knuckles' Chaotix" as the best amusement for the framework. "People to come" called "Virtua Fighter" "the brilliant wreath on 32X's pine box", mirroring the agreement among contemporary pundits that the diversion was on the double ostensibly the 32X's best discharge and an unmistakable harbinger of the stage's inevitable suspension, since it was obviously second rate compared to the Saturn renditions of "Virtua Fighter Remix" (which had just been discharged) and "Virtua Fighter 2" (which was expected out in only a couple of months). In light of fan request, Sega expressed that the 32X engineering was not sufficiently amazing to deal with a port of "Virtua Fighter 2".
