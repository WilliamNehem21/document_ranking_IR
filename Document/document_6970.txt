In 1913, the Met had denied a merger proposition made by the UERL and it remained obstinately autonomous under the initiative of Robert Selbie. The Railways Act 1921, which progressed toward becoming law on 19 August 1921, did not list any of London's underground railroads among the organizations that should have been gathered, in spite of the fact that at the draft arrange the Met had been incorporated. At the point when proposition for combination of open transport in London were distributed in 1930, the Met contended that it ought to have a similar status as the four principle line railroads, and it was inconsistent with the UERL on account of its cargo tasks; the administration saw the Met comparatively to the District as they together worked the internal circle. After the "London Passenger Transport Bill", pointed basically at co-ordinating the little free transport administrations, was distributed on 13 March 1931, the Met burned through ÃÂ£11,000 contradicting it. The bill endure an adjustment in government in 1931 and the Met gave no reaction to a proposition made by the new organization that it could stay autonomous if it somehow managed to lose its running controls over the circle. The executives swung to arranging remuneration for its investors; by then traveler numbers had fallen because of rivalry from transports and the discouragement. In 1932, the last entire year of activity, a percent profit was announced. On 1 July 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), was made as an open partnership and the Met was amalgamated with the other underground railroads, tramway organizations and transport administrators. Met investors got ÃÂ£19.7 million in LPTB stock.
