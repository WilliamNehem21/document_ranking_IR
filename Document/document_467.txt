He recovered control of his vehicle to keep running in ninth spot. A large portion of the pioneers made pit stops. Johnson drove at the lap-190 restart, trailed by Vickers and Kenseth. Johnson held a one-moment lead over Vickers by the 200th lap, by which time Edwards moved past Stewart. Vickers retook the lead from Johnson on lap 206. Fifteen laps later, the eighth alert was activated when Edwards' vehicle endured a cut right-back tire, impeded on the track and spun at turn four while driving carefully to the pit street. Edwards gathered his partner, Ragan, who was kept running into by Elliott. Mears was near to the episode however abstained from harming his vehicle. On lap 222, Vickers detailed a power guiding issue, and Kyle Busch was losing battery control. A large portion of the pioneers, including Vickers, made pit stops. Kyle Busch's vehicle had a substitution battery fitted and Vickers finished up with more liquids; the two drivers rejoined in twelfth and thirteenth positions. Johnson drove at the lap-227 restart, with Kenseth in second spot. One lap later, Kenseth ignored Johnson to come out ahead of the pack, while Kyle Busch reached the divider on his correct side; an alert was not required. Johnson recovered the principal position from Kenseth on the backstretch on the 245th lap. Kyle Busch's correct front tire was cut, and went into the turn four divider on lap 252, setting off the ninth alert. Amid the alert, the majority of the pioneers, including Johnson, made pit stops. Johnson made changes to his vehicle's left and right back spring elastic, and Stewart's vehicle's pneumatic stress was balanced.
