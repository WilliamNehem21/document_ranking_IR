In 2016, Chopra starred as a police officer in Prakash Jha's social drama "Jai Gangaajal". Writing for "The Hindu", Namrata Joshi thought that she "looks off-colour, disinterested and uninvolved with the goings on through most of the film". It did not perform well commercially. She next produced the Marathi comedy-drama "Ventilator" under her production company Purple Pebble Pictures, which went on to win three awards at the 64th National Film Awards. The following year, Chopra made her Hollywood live-action film debut by playing the antagonist Victoria Leeds in Seth Gordon's action comedy "Baywatch" opposite Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. The feature received unfavorable reviews. Scott Mendelson of "Forbes" wrote "Chopra has fun as the baddie, but she stays in the background until the end of the movie and really only gets one big scene at the end of the picture." "Baywatch" was not a commercial success in North America but the film performed better in the overseas markets. The 2018 Sundance Film Festival marked the release of Chopra's next American film, "A Kid Like Jake", a drama about gender variance, starring Jim Parsons and Claire Danes. Amy Nicholson of "Variety" commended her "charming presence" but thought that her role added little value to the film. A year later, Chopra had another supporting part, as a yoga ambassador, in Todd Strauss-Schulson's comedy "Isn't It Romantic", which starred Rebel Wilson in the lead role. Dana Schwartz of "Entertainment Weekly" considered her to be "perfectly cast" but Benjamin Lee of "The Guardian" thought that she was "not quite interesting enough".
