The principal accumulation of "Nothomyrmecia" was made in December 1931 by novice entomologist, Amy Crocker, whose partners had gathered a scope of bug tests for her amid a field journey, including examples of two laborer ants, allegedly close to the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia. Crocker then passed the ants to Australian entomologist John S. Clark. Perceived right away a short time later as another species, these examples turned into the syntypes. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor in this way communicated uncertainty about the exactness of chronicle of the first revelation site, expressing the examples were likely gathered from the western end of the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. The disclosure of "Nothomyrmecia" and the presence of its one of a kind body structure drove researchers in 1951 to start a progression of ventures to discover the subterranean insect in Western Australia. More than three decades, groups of Australian and American gatherers neglected to re-discover it; entomologists, for example, E. O. Wilson and William Brown, Jr., made endeavors to scan for it, however nor was effective. At that point, on 22 October 1977, Taylor and his gathering of entomologists from Canberra fortunately found a single specialist subterranean insect at Poochera, South Australia, southeast of Ceduna, some from the detailed site of the 1931 disclosure. In 2012, a report talking about the conceivable nearness of "Nothomyrmecia" in Western Australia did not affirm any locating of the insect among Balladonia and the Western Australian beach front locales. Following 46 years of hunting down it, entomologists have named the subterranean insect the 'Blessed Grail' of myrmecology.
