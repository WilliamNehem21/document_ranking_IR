In 1918 Stefansson returned following four years' nonattendance, revealing the disclosure of three new islands. He was regarded by the National Geographical Society, got tributes from polar veterans, for example, Peary and Adolphus Greely, and was given the administration of the Explorers Club of New York. In Canada his gathering was progressively quieted; there were questions identifying with the general expenses of the endeavor, its poor beginning association, and his treatment of the Southern Party which, under Rudolph Anderson, finished its work autonomously of Stefansson. Anderson and different individuals from the Southern Party later requested of the Canadian government to examine proclamations made by Stefansson in his 1921 book "The Friendly Arctic", which they felt thought about inadequately their respect. The solicitation was declined on the ground that "awful could happen to the enquiry." In his book Stefansson assumes liability for the "intense" choice to take "Karluk" into the ice as opposed to embracing the coast while in transit to Herschel Island, and acknowledges that he "picked the wrong option". In any case, McKinlay felt that the book gave an off base record of the "Karluk" voyage and its outcomes, "putting the blameÃÂ ... on everybody except Vilhjalmur Stefansson." The student of history Tom Henighan trusts that McKinlay's greatest grumbling against his pioneer was that "Stefansson never whenever appeared to be ready to express a proper distress over his lost men." Stefansson, who stayed away forever to the Arctic, kicked the bucket in 1962 at 82 years old.
