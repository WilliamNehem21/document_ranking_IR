From 1915 Joseph's relationship with Holst turned out to be nearer. Overextended by his showing obligations and different responsibilities, Holst required help with the assignment of sorting out his music for distribution and execution, and utilized a gathering of young ladies volunteersÃ¢ÂÂhis "copyists"Ã¢ÂÂ to make reasonable duplicates of his scores, work out instrumental or vocal parts, or get ready piano courses of action. In 1915 the arranger was chipping away at his biggest and best-known work, the symphonic suite "The Planets", and welcomed Joseph, in her excursions, to join his copyists. Among these were Vally Lasker, a piano instructor from SPGS, and Nora Day, who had been a student with Joseph at the school and since 1913 had been educating there. Joseph's fundamental task for "The Planets" was to duplicate the "Neptune" development, of which nearly the whole unique original copy is written in her grasp. For the remainder of her vocation she stayed a standout amongst Holst's most ordinary amanuenses, and he came to depend on her more than on some other. Her duties to melodic exercises at Girton, joined with her work for Holst, adversy affected her formal examinations. In the 1916 Classical Tripos examinations she was granted just a Class III pass, a frustrating outcome noted in her separating tribute from the school.
