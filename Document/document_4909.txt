The tooth was exhibited at the 45th yearly gathering of the Palaeontological Association in 2001, and recognized as a dromaeosaur. In 2003 the tooth (MGUH 27218/DK 315) was made the holotype example of "Dromaeosauroides bornholmensis"Ã¢ÂÂ named and depicted by Christiansen and Bonde. The class name consolidates "Dromaeosaurus" with the Greek ("through"), alluding to the similarity between the teeth of the two genera. The particular name alludes to Bornholm. The name "Dromaeosaurus" itself has been interpreted as "quick" or "running reptile". Bonde and Christiansen had expected the main Danish dinosaur stays to be teeth of herbivorous dinosaurs, for example, hypsilophodonts or "Iguanodon", and were amazed to discover a dromaeosaur tooth rather, since these are uncommon in Early Cretaceous developments; herbivores would have been more bounteous than carnivores. Since the dromaeosaur appears to have been substantial, they anticipated that strong bones, for example, hooks, may be found later on. The scientistss did not anticipate that bones of bigger dinosaurs should be found in the development (since these would no doubt have been discovered when the sand was industrially abused), yet trusted the remaining parts of a Mesozoic well evolved creature would be found. The holotype tooth has been outlined in a few books and research articles. It was affirmed ""DanekrÃÂ¦"" ("Danish animal", as indicated by a 1990 Danish exhibition hall law verifying vital fossils) when its logical significance was assessed by the Geological Museum in Copenhagen.
