The disintegration of the religious communities (1536Ã¢ÂÂ 1541) met little obstruction in Dorset and a considerable lot of the region's monasteries, including Shaftesbury, Cerne and Milton, were sold to private proprietors. In 1642, at the beginning of the English Civil War, the Royalists assumed responsibility for the whole region separated from Poole and Lyme Regis. In any case, inside three years their additions had been on the whole turned around by the Parliamentarians. An uprising of ClubmenÃ¢ÂÂvigilantes fatigued of the plunders of the warÃ¢ÂÂoccurred in Dorset in 1645. Somewhere in the range of 2,000 of these renegades offered fight to Lord Fairfax's Parliamentary armed force at Hambledon Hill yet they were effectively steered. Sherborne Castle was taken by Fairfax that equivalent year and in 1646 Corfe Castle, the final Royalist fortress in Dorset, was caught after a demonstration of double-crossing: both were in this manner insulted. The Duke of Monmouth's ineffective endeavor to topple James II started when he arrived at Lyme Regis in 1685. A progression of preliminaries known as the Bloody Assizes occurred to rebuff the revolutionaries. Over a five-day time frame in Dorchester, Judge Jeffreys managed 312 cases: 74 of the denounced were executed, 175 were transported, and nine were openly whipped. In 1686, at Charborough Park, a gathering occurred to plot the ruin of James II of England. This gathering was viably the beginning of the Glorious Revolution.
