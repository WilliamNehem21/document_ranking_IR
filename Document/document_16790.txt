These lemurs have a specialized diet of tree gums and sap. Their diet consists mainly of gum from trees in the genus "Terminalia" (known locally as "Talinala"), which are often parasitized by beetle larvae that burrow beneath the bark. Fork-marked lemurs either consume the gum as it seeps from cracks in the bark of parasitized trees or gouge open the bark with their toothcomb to scoop it up directly with their long tongue. Between March and May, gums compose the majority of the diet. They have also been documented eating gums from "Commiphora" species and "Colvillea racemosa", bud exudates from "Zanthoxylum tsihanimposa", sap from baobab trees ("Adansonia" species), nectar from "Crateva greveana" flowers, the sugary excretions from bugs (family Machaerotidae) which feed on trees of the genus "Rhopalocarpus", and very small amounts of fruit. Although fork-marked lemurs have widely varied forest habitat, gum and other plant exudates of other species are likely to dominate their diet. They are not known to estivate or accumulate fat reserves for the dry season.
To meet their protein requirements and obtain nitrogen, these lemurs also hunt small arthropods. In captivity, "P.Â furcifer" strongly favored preying mantises and moths of the family Sphingidae while ignoring grasshoppers, larva of the moth genus "Coeloptera", and small reptiles. Hunting usually occurs later at night, following gum collection, and typically happens in the canopy or on tree trunks. Insects are captured by rapidly grasping them with the hands, a stereotypic behavior seen in other members of their family, as well as galagos. The exudates of several tree species they are known to feed on are high in protein, so some fork-marked lemurs may meet their protein requirements without preying on insects.
