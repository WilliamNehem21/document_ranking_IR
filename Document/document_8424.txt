Following its development in 1874, the Whipple bracket connect over the South Branch Potomac River served Romney and explorers along the Northwestern Turnpike for a long time. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission started sorting out an undertaking to supplant the Whipple support extension, and development of the new scaffold had started by 1936. In November of that year, a vehicle slammed into the south side of the eastern Whipple support length, which thumped the range totally off its eastern projection. The vehicle dove into the South Branch Potomac River, trailed by the bargained support length, which crumbled over the vehicle. Uninformed of the range's breakdown, a vehicle going from the west drove off the finish of the west range at the scaffold's middle wharf, and fell onto the crumbled range. As per the "Hampshire Review", the main genuine damage supported was a broken wooden leg. Following the breakdown of the eastern Whipple bracket length, a transitory wooden range was hurriedly built between the western support length and the eastern projection, with the goal that traffic was continuous until the new scaffold was finished and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 extension was utilized until 2010 when it was supplanted by the present South Branch Bridge.
