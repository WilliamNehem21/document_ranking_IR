Since 1864, when he got a solitary spontaneous vote at the Democratic National Convention, Hancock had been an enduring competitor. As military legislative leader of Louisiana and Texas in 1867, Hancock had won the regard of the white traditionalist populace by issuing his General Order Number 40, in which he expressed that if the inhabitants of the area acted gently and the regular citizen authorities played out their obligations, at that point "the military power should stop to lead, and the common organization continue its normal and legitimate territory." He had a bigger after at the 1868 tradition, completing as high as second spot in certain rounds of balloting. In 1876, Hancock again drew a significant after, however never completed higher than third spot at that year's tradition. In 1880, another Hancock blast started, this time focused for the most part in the South. In March of that year, the "New Orleans Picayune" ran a publication that required the general's selection, incompletely for his identityÃ¢ÂÂa war legend with preservationist political standardsÃ¢ÂÂand halfway for his identity notÃ¢ÂÂa known factional of either side of the money related or tax discusses. As Tilden and Bayard rose and fell in the estimation of Democratic voters, Hancock's offered for selection assembled steam. Some were uncertain whether, following eight years of Grant, himself a previous general, the gathering would be insightful to give the designation to another "man on horseback", however Hancock stayed among the main contenders as the tradition started that June.
