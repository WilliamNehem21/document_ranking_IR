A total investigation into Cancellor's passing was started. His body was taken for post-mortem examination on 28ÃÂ April and was observed to be canvassed in blood under the gloves and leggings. His thighs were "decreased to an ideal jam" and his body was canvassed in wounds and cuts, including two inch-profound openings in his correct leg, sufficiently profound to permit the therapeutic inspector, Robert Willis, to contact the bone underneath. Willis detailed that other than these wounds, the kid was sound and his inward organs (counting the heart) were free of infection. He consequently reasoned that Cancellor had not kicked the bucket of characteristic causes, as Hopley had recommended, and noticed that the kid had clearly been beaten instantly before his passing. A female hireling named Ellen Fowler, when addressed by agents, detailed that she had heard Cancellor shouting and being beaten from 10ÃÂ pm until late and that, presently, he suddenly fell quiet. She additionally noted hints of blood in the house and on Hopley's candle, which was left outside Cancellor's room, and proof that Cancellor's and Hopley's garments had been washed soon before the previous was articulated dead. Two different workers affirmed in the request and gave comparative records.
