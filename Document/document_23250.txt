In 1978, at the urging of protesting faculty and concerned alumni, City College's landmark "Castle" underwent its first major capital renovations requiring the school to temporarily relocate for two years. One year was spent at the Calvert Educational Center on North Avenue and North Calvert Street during 1978-1979 (coincidentally the former home of rival Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, built 1912 until Poly moved to its new joint campus with Western High School in the northwest section of the city alongside the Jones Falls stream, paralleling the Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83), at Cold Spring Lane and Falls Road, a decade earlier in 1967). The second academic year saw the "New Baltimore City College" housed on the basement level of neighboring all-female Eastern High School across Loch Raven Boulevard to the west of the Castle reconstruction project. When the B.C.C. campus reopened, the ancient high school welcomed women for the first time. The 140 years all-male tradition did not end easily; alumni and some faculty had argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex educational system and convinced the task force studying the make-up of a "New City College" amidst issues of higher selective admissions standards and a rigorous extensive humanities oriented curriculum, with a specially interviewed/screened and selected faculty and administrators. On the subject of single-sex status, voted 11â6 in favor of keeping the then 140 years all-male tradition. The Board of School Commissioners, in a reversal, voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns, as the only proposal of the 2-year long Task Force not accepted by the higher board.
