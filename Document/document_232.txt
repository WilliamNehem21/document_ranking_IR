The length and interior structure of Peking-musical show plays is exceptionally factor. Preceding 1949, "zhezixi", short plays or plays made up of short scenes from longer plays, were frequently performed. These plays typically focus on one basic circumstance or highlight a determination of scenes intended to incorporate every one of the four of the primary Peking musical drama abilities and exhibit the virtuosity of the entertainers. This organization has turned out to be less common as of late, yet plays of one act are still performed. These short works, just as individual scenes inside longer works, are set apart by a passionate movement from the earliest starting point of the play as far as possible. For instance, the mistress in the one demonstration play "The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated" starts in a condition of happiness, and after that moves to outrage and envy, tipsy perkiness, lastly to a sentiment of thrashing and acquiescence. A full-length play more often than not has from six to at least fifteen scenes. The general story in these more drawn out works is told through differentiating scenes. Plays will switch back and forth among common and military scenes, or scenes include heroes and adversaries. There are a few noteworthy scenes inside the work that pursue the example of passionate movement. It is these scenes that are typically excerpted for some other time "zhezixi" creations. The absolute most complex plays may even have a passionate movement from scene to scene.
