Pentland surrendered his RAF bonus and came back to Australia toward the finish of the war, winning cash by giving joyrides in an AvroÃÂ 504K. Searching for an increasingly secure future, he joined the recently settled Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in August 1921, after a meeting with Wing Commander Stanley Goble, a wartime colleague through the RAF. Positioned flight lieutenant, Pentland was placed accountable for the RAAF's supplement of S.E.5 warriors at Point Cook, Victoria, some portion of the Imperial Gift as of late given by Great Britain. The youthful Air Force had the climate of a flying club, where everybody knew every other person. Pressures here and there emerged between the individuals who had presented with British powers amid the war, and the individuals who had a place with the Australian Flying Corps (AFC); the previous thought about that they were oppressed when it came to filling senior positions, and came the day Pentland and individual ex-RAF part Hippolyte De La Rue tossed a "cocky" AFC man into a wreck chimney. Choosing that his RAAF profession was not advancing, Pentland connected for a short-administration commission as a flying officer with the RAF in 1923, which was allowed as of 23ÃÂ April. He traveled to Britain with new spouse Madge (nÃÂ©e Moffat), whom he wedded on 5ÃÂ March, just before leaving Australia; they had one girl, Carleen, the next year. Pentland finished the course at Central Flying School, Uphavon, and turned into a teacher there, picking up advancement to flight lieutenant before leaving the RAF on 20ÃÂ July 1926 and coming back to Australia.
