In 1974 Klein examined the fossils of "Hippotragus" species in South Africa. The vast majority of these were found to speak to the bluebuck and the roan eland. The fossil record proposed that the bluebuck happened in substantial numbers amid the last frosty period (almost 0.1million years prior), and was more typical than sympatric elands. The bluebuck could adjust to more open living spaces than could the roan impala, an eminent purpose of contrast between these species. Fossils of the bluebuck have been found in the Klaises River and the Nelson Bay Cave (close Plettenberg Bay) and Swartklip (toward the west of the Hottentots Holland mountains). Confidence et al. 2013 noticed that the western and southern CFR were isolated by biogeographical hindrances, for example, the Cape Fold Belt and afromontane backwoods. A recent report recommended that low ocean levels encouraged movements for huge warm blooded creatures; in this manner the ascent in ocean levels with the start of the Holocene would have prompted divided bluebuck populaces and removed numerous populaces from the western coast (fossils dating to this period are rare in the western coast yet have been recorded from the southern coast). Subsequently, a mass eradication could have occurred, deserting chiefly the populaces that stayed in the asset rich western CFR. The reasons for the exceptional decrease in bluebuck populaces just before the fifteenth and sixteenth hundreds of years have not been researched; rivalry with animals and living space weakening could have been main considerations in its consumption.
