As a spot name, Trafford is an Anglo-French variant of Stratford, getting from the Old English words "strÃÂ¦t" (a road, all the more explicitly a Roman street) and "portage" (a stream crossing). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since 1974, however the zone it covers has a long history. Neolithic sharpened stones have been found in Altrincham and Sale, and there is proof of Bronze Age home in Timperley. Sections of Roman ceramics have been found in Urmston, and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman street between the legionary fortifications at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum) crosses Trafford, going through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The settlements in Trafford have been based to a great extent around agribusiness, despite the fact that Altrincham was established as a market town in the mid thirteenth century. Despite the fact that the Industrial Revolution influenced Trafford, the territory did not encounter a similar rate of development as the remainder of Greater Manchester. A 100% expansion in populace in the Trafford zone somewhere in the range of 1841 and 1861 was an immediate aftereffect of a flood because of the development of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, which enabled inhabitants to drive all the more effectively from Trafford into Manchester. The region built up its own focuses of industry in Broadheath (established in 1885) and Trafford Park (established in 1897). They have since declined, in spite of the fact that Trafford Park still utilizes 40Ã¢ÂÂ 50,000 individuals. Today, Trafford is for the most part a suburbanite region. The precinct was framed on 1ÃÂ April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as one of the ten metropolitan regions of Greater Manchester.
