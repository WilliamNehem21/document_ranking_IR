In 1919, King Hussein would not approve the Treaty of Versailles. After February, 1920, the British stopped to pay appropriation to him. In August, 1920, five days after the marking of the Treaty of SÃÂ¨vres, which formally perceived the Kingdom of Hejaz, Curzon requested that Cairo get Hussein's mark to the two settlements and consented to make an installment of ÃÂ£30,000 contingent on mark. Hussein declined and in 1921, expressed that he couldn't be relied upon to "attach his name to a report appointing Palestine to the Zionists and Syria to outsiders." Following the 1921 Cairo Conference, Lawrence was sent to attempt and get the King's mark to a bargain, a ÃÂ£100,000 yearly appropriation being proposed; this endeavor likewise fizzled. Amid 1923, the British made one further endeavor to settle extraordinary issues with Hussein and by and by, the endeavor foundered, Hussein proceeded in his refusal to perceive the Balfour Declaration or any of the Mandates that he saw similar to his area. In March 1924, having quickly thought about expelling the culpable article from the arrangement, the administration suspended any further exchanges; inside a half year they pulled back their help for their focal Arabian partner Ibn Saud, who continued to vanquish Hussein's kingdom.
