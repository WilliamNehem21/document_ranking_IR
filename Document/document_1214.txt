The 6th nocturne, committed to EugÃÂ¨ne d'Eichthal, is generally held to be one of the best of the arrangement. Cortot stated, "There are not many pages in all music equivalent to these." Morrison calls it "among the most rich and articulate of all FaurÃÂ©'s piano works." The musician and author Nancy Bricard calls it "a standout amongst the most energetic and moving works in piano writing." FaurÃÂ© composed it following a six-year break from forming for the piano. The piece starts with a passionate, overflowing expression, with echoes of FaurÃÂ©'s melody cycle "La bonne chanson". The second subject, at first apparently peaceful, has what the author Charles Koechlin calls a diligent inquietude, accentuated by the syncopated backup. The underlying topic returns, and is trailed by a significant improvement of a delicate, thoughtful song. A summarization of the important subject takes the piece to its decision. Copland composed that it was with this work FaurÃÂ© first completely rose up out of the shadow of Chopin, and he said of the piece, "The breath and pride of the opening song, the anxious C sharp minor area which pursues (with the impossible to miss syncopated harmonies so frequently thus all around utilized by FaurÃÂ©), the smooth smoothness of the third thought: every one of these components are conveyed to a stormy peak in the short advancement segment; at that point, after stopping for a moment, comes the arrival of the supporting first page."
