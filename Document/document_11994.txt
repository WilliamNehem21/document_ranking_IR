"Consistently Changing Times", discharged on February 22, 2008, is an accumulation of tunes Lukather recorded in 2007 between Toto visits. The collection contains commitments from individual session artists Bill Champlin, Abe Laboriel, Jr., Leland Sklar, Steve Porcaro, and numerous others. Lukather's child Trevor contributed too. Joseph Williams gives backing vocals on five of the tracks. Lukather composed the melodies for the collection in a lodging with his child and a bunch of different artists, utilizing essential gear. His tune composing reasoning is that if a tune sounds great with just guitars and vocals, it will probably stable great after a full creation. Lukather worked together with Grammy Award-winning designer and maker Steve MacMillan on the task, with the objective of presenting some new strategies and methods into the chronicle procedure. Lukather portrayed the last tracks as "consummately flawed", wanting to record with the five-piece backing band in one room and in one take. MacMillan urged Lukather to utilize "natural, vintage tones". Accordingly, Lukather shunned impacts and played the guitar parts straightforwardly through cylinder speakers fabricated by Marshall, Vox, and some boutique brands. Lukather remarked that MacMillan filled in as a significant "second arrangement of ears" in the studio, regularly reassuring him to keep parts that he ordinarily would have disposed of. As Toto had as of late disbanded when "Regularly Changing Times" was discharged, Lukather set out on a performance visit to advance the collection. The shows highlighted a blend of tunes from the collection, tunes composed for opposite side activities, and "a couple Toto obscurities".
