In his examination of "Lord Priam", Bowen contends that the adjustment in Tippett's melodic style emerged at first from the idea of the musical show, a catastrophe profoundly unique in tone from the warm good faith of "The Midsummer Marriage". Clarke sees the change as something progressively crucial, the increments in cacophony and atonality in "Priam" being illustrative of a pattern that proceeded and achieved a peak of astringency a couple of years after the fact in Tippett's third musical drama, "The Knot Garden". Tippett's new futuristic language, composes Clarke, was attached in his craving to speak to a more extensive scope of human encounters, normal for an evolving world: "War, savagery, sex, homoeroticism, and social and relational estrangement [would now feature] significantly more obviously in [his] emotional works or works with content". Faultfinders recognized "Priam" as an extensive accomplishment, yet got the new melodic style carefully. While Gloag thought the change was not an outright takeoff from Tippett's prior style, Milner saw "Lord Priam" as a total break with Tippett's past work, calling attention to the absence of contrast, the impressively expanded cacophonies, and the move towards atonality: "next to no of the music is in a distinct key".
