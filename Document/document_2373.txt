Meanwhile, Reid's administration took various arrangement activities. It passed enactment approving the administration buy of cows from ranchers who could never again bear the cost of feed, and worked out a cost-offering consent to the central government and the railroads to migrate ranchers escaping the territory's residue belt. Reid likewise required the production of a government wheat advertising board, and proposed enactmentÃ¢ÂÂthe "Horticultural Industry Stabilization Act"Ã¢ÂÂ that shielded from loan bosses any part of a rancher's income that was utilized on working expenses for his homestead or everyday costs for his family. Notwithstanding these measures, Reid wound up inconsistent with his gathering's participation, which was responding to the Great Depression by following an inexorably communist way. He observed UFA President Robert Gardiner to be of the "extreme left", and thought about the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, in whose establishing numerous UFA individuals had taken an interest, to be an "unholy amalgamation". All things being equal, his administration explored different avenues regarding a type of all inclusive medical coverage, to be mutually financed by government, bosses, and workers, that would give Albertans free restorative, dental, and emergency clinic care; the task was to be propelled as a pilot venture in Camrose, yet was never started in light of the intercession of the 1935 race. All the more questionably, Reid's administration responded to McPherson's separation and its chaperon inclusion by proposing to prohibit papers from covering divorce procedures, a suggestion that incited Liberal MLA Joseph Miville Dechene to contrast Reid with Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin.
