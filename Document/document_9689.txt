To dissipate worries about his age (74), falling flat visual perception, and heart issues, Barkley touched base in Chicago for the 1952 Democratic National Convention and energetically strolled seven squares from the transport station to his battle central command. The endeavor was rendered disputable on July 20 when a gathering of work pioneers, including United Automobile Workers President Walter Reuther, issued an announcement calling Barkley excessively old and mentioning that Democrats select somebody more youthful like Stevenson. At a gathering with work pioneers the following morning, Barkley neglected to convince them to withdraw the announcement, which caused designations from expansive modern states like Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania to falter on their duties to Barkley. On July 21, he declared his withdrawal from the race. Welcome to make a goodbye address on July 22, he got a 35-minute applause when he took the platform and 45-minute one at the discourse's end. In a show of regard, a Missouri delegate selected Barkley for president and House Majority Leader McCormack favored it, yet Stevenson was effectively designated. A month after the tradition, Barkley facilitated a Stevenson excursion and battle rally at his home in Paducah and later presented him at a rally in Louisville. In spite of Barkley's expectations of a Democratic triumph, Stevenson lost in overpowering style to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.
