The 1844 passing of Justice Henry Baldwin left an empty spot on the Supreme Court, yet Tyler had been unfit to get the Senate to affirm a chosen one. At the time, it was the custom to have geographic equalization on the Supreme Court, and Baldwin had been from Pennsylvania. Polk's endeavors to fill Baldwin's seat wound up entangled in Pennsylvania legislative issues and the endeavors of factional pioneers to verify the rewarding post of Collector of Customs for the Port of Philadelphia. As Polk endeavored to discover his way through the minefield of Pennsylvania governmental issues, a second position on the high court wound up empty with the passing, in September 1845, of Justice Joseph Story; his substitution was relied upon to originate from his local New England. Since Story's passing had happened while the Senate was not in session, Polk had the capacity to make a break arrangement, picking Senator Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire, and when the Senate reconvened in December 1845, Woodbury was affirmed. Polk's underlying chosen one for Baldwin's seat, George W. Woodward, was dismissed by the Senate in January 1846, in expansive part because of the restriction of Buchanan and Pennsylvania Senator Simon Cameron.
