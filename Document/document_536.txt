The shows were an extensive monetary cost for Bache, who did not have a standard pay until 1881 and needed to support himself through instructing. By 1873, he composed, he needed to "choose whether I will forfeit myself completely to the creation of Liszt's symphonic and choral works (which after all can never be everlasting as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that BÃÂ¼low is correct). Or on the other hand will I make my own improvement an incredible object, and not spend 33% of my pay in one night." BÃÂ¼low wound up sufficiently concerned about the circumstance to forgo his expense after one show he led, and to contribute ÃÂ£50 out of his own pocket. Liszt was additionally concerned, stating, "For a considerable length of time [Bache] has yielded cash for the execution of my works in London. A few times I exhorted him against it, yet he addressed imperturbably, 'That is my business.'" Whenever Bache was approached about funds for the shows, he would tell whoever was asking that the expense was "a simply reward" and include that regardless of whether Liszt had charged him for his exercises at a similar rate as the normal town piano instructor, he would even now be profoundly in his obligation.
