Despite the fact that no skull remains were found with the first "Brachiosaurus" skeleton, one halfway skull from an alternate area may have a place with "Brachiosaurus": the Felch Quarry skull (example USNM 5730). Since there is no covering material between the two examples, the skull has just been doled out to "Brachiosaurus" sp. (of questionable species). As reproduced, the skull was about long from the occipital condyle at the back of the skull to the front of the premaxillae (the front bones of the upper jaw), making it the biggest sauropod skull from the Morrison Formation. It seems to have been most like and middle of the road between that of "Giraffatitan" and "Camarasaurus". By and large, the skull was tall as in "Giraffatitan", with a nose that was long (about 36% of the skull length) before the nasal bar between the nostrils Ã¢ÂÂ common of brachiosaurids. The nose, set at an edge in respect to the remainder of the skull, gave the impression of pointing descending. The frontal bones over the skull were short and wide (like "Giraffatitan"), combined and associated by a suture to the parietal bones, which were likewise intertwined. The outside of the parietals between the supratemporal fenestrae (openings at the back skull rooftop) was more extensive than that of "Giraffatitan", yet smaller than that of "Camarasaurus". The skull varied from that of "Giraffatitan" in its U-formed (rather than W-molded) suture among frontal and nasal bones, a shape which seems increasingly articulated by the frontal bones stretching out forward over the circles (eye attachments).
