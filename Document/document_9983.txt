Then again, a content can likewise start the introduction of a choral orchestra, just for that work to turn into a simply instrumental one when the automatic focal point of the work changes. Shostakovich initially arranged his Seventh Symphony as a solitary development choral orchestra much like his Second and Third Symphonies. Shostakovich supposedly proposed to set a content for the Seventh from the Ninth Psalm, on the subject of retribution for the shedding of blameless blood. In doing this he was affected by Stravinsky; he had been profoundly inspired with the last's "Orchestra of Psalms", which he needed to imitate in this work. While the Ninth Psalm's subject passed on Shostakovich's shock over Stalin's persecution, an open execution of a work with such a content would have been inconceivable before the German intrusion. Hitler's hostility made the execution of such a work possible, from a certain point of view; the reference to "blood" could then be related in any event authoritatively with Hitler. With Stalin speaking to the Soviets' enthusiastic and religious conclusions, the experts were never again smothering Orthodox topics or pictures. In any case, Shostakovich in the end understood that the work included undeniably more than this symbology. He extended the orchestra to the customary four developments and made it absolutely instrumental.
