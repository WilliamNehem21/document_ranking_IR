After the strike compel was recuperated, a great part of the Home Fleet cruised far from the Norwegian coast to refuel. A gathering including "Imposing", "Incensed", two cruisers and a few destroyers lay out steps to arrive at the two armada oilers, and the escort bearer bunch pulled back so the transporters could refuel their escorts. At 5:25 pm, "Nabob" was struck by a torpedo terminated from "U-354". The bearer endured genuine harm and 21 fatalities yet had the capacity to proceed with constrained flight activities. In the blink of an eye a short time later "U-354" torpedoed the frigate as the last hunt down "Nabob"s aggressor. "Nabob" was compelled to come back to the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow that night, escorted by "Trumpeter", a cruiser and a few destroyers. "Considerable" and "Enraged" secured their withdrawal; amid this period "Angry" likewise refueled from the Home Fleet's tankers. The flight of both escort transporters implied that the mine-dropping segment of Operation Goodwood must be dropped. "Bickerton"s stern was destroyed by the torpedo, and she could have possibly been rescued. Be that as it may, the power's administrator did not have any desire to need to secure two disabled boats, and the frigate was left at around 8:30 pm on 22 August. Soon after the assaults on "Nabob" and "Bickerton", Seafires from 894 Naval Air Squadron shot down two German Blohm and Voss BV 138 surveillance flying machine.
