Subfossil bones of a starling-like fowl were first found on Rodrigues by the police justice George Jenner In 1866 and 1871, and by the reverend Henry Horrocks Slater in 1874. They were found in caverns on the Plaine Coral, a limestone plain in south-west Rodrigues. These bones incorporated the skull, mandible, sternum, coracoid, humerus, metacarpus, ulna, femur, tibia, and metatarsus of a few flying creatures; the bones were kept in the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum. In 1879, the bones turned into the premise of a logical depiction of the flying creature by ornithologists Albert GÃÂ¼nther and Edward Newton (the sibling of Alfred). They named the winged creature "Necropsar rodericanus"; "Nekros" and "psar" are Greek for "dead" and "starling", while "rodericanus" alludes to the island of Rodrigues. This binomial was initially proposed by Slater in a 1874 composition he sent to GÃÂ¼nther and Newton. Slater had arranged the original copy for a 1879 distribution, which was never discharged, however GÃÂ¼nther and Newton cited Slater's unpublished notes in their own 1879 article, and credited him for the name. BirdLife International credits Slater instead of GÃÂ¼nther and Newton for the name. GÃÂ¼nther and Newton confirmed that the Rodrigues starling was firmly identified with the hoopoe starling, and they just kept it in a different class because of what they named "present ornithological practice". Because of the firmly manufactured bill, they considered the new species likely equivalent to the feathered creature referenced in Tafforet's record.
