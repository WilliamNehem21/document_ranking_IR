Sustenance at different phases of processing has been found in the digestion tracts of a few wooly mammoths, giving a decent image of their eating regimen. Wooly mammoths continued themselves on plant sustenance, for the most part grasses and sedges, which were enhanced with herbaceous plants, blossoming plants, bushes, greeneries, and tree matter. The piece and accurate assortments varied from area to area. Wooly mammoths required a shifted eating routine to help their development, similar to current elephants. A grown-up of 6 tons would need to eat day by day, and may have scrounged up to 20 hours consistently. The two-fingered tip of the storage compartment was most likely adjusted for getting the short grasses of the last ice age (Quaternary glaciation, 2.58 million years back to introduce) by folding over them, though current elephants twist their trunks around the more extended grass of their tropical surroundings. The storage compartment could likewise be utilized for pulling off substantial grass tufts, gently picking buds and blossoms, and detaching leaves and branches where trees and bushes were available. The "Yukagir mammoth" had ingested plant matter that contained spores of waste growth. Isotope investigation demonstrates that wooly mammoths encouraged for the most part on C3 plants, in contrast to steeds and rhinos.
