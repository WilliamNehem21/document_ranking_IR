In the early morning of 2 November, DiÃ¡Â»Âm consented to surrender. The ARVN officers had proposed to oust DiÃ¡Â»Âm and Nhu, having guaranteed the NgÃÂ´ siblings safe section out of the nation. At 06:00, just before first light, the officers held a gathering at JGS base camp to examine the destiny of the NgÃÂ´ siblings. As per Lucien Conein, the US Army officer and CIA employable who was the American contact with the upset, the greater part of the officers, including Minh, needed DiÃ¡Â»Âm to have a "decent retirement" from office, trailed by outcast. Not the majority of the senior officers went to the gathering, with having effectively left to make game plans for the entry of DiÃ¡Â»Âm and Nhu at JGS central station. General LÃÂª, a previous police boss under DiÃ¡Â»Âm in the mid-1950s, firmly campaigned for DiÃ¡Â»Âm's execution. There was no formal vote taken at the gathering, and LÃÂª pulled in just minority support. One general was accounted for to have said "To slaughter weeds, you should pull them up at the roots". Conein revealed that the officers had never shown that death was in their brains, since a methodical change of intensity was a high need in accomplishing their definitive point of increasing worldwide acknowledgment.
