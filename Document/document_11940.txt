Lindow Man's legitimate name is LindowÃÂ II, as there are different finds from the territory: LindowÃÂ I (Lindow Woman) alludes to a human skull, LindowÃÂ III to a "divided headless body", and LindowÃÂ IV to the upper thigh of a grown-up male, perhaps that of Lindow Man. After the revelation of Lindow Man, there were no further archeological unearthings at Lindow Moss until 1987. A vast bit of skin was found by laborers on the lift on 6 February 1987. On this event, the police left the examination to the archeologists. Over 70ÃÂ pieces were found, comprising LindowÃÂ III. In spite of the fact that the bone was not also protected as that of Lindow Man, different tissues made due in better condition. The last revelation was that of LindowÃÂ IV on 14 June 1988. Some portion of a left leg and bum were found on the lift, from a site only west of where Lindow Man was found. About three months after the fact, on 12 September, a correct thigh was found in the peat on the container of a digger. The vicinity of the disclosure locales, combined with the way that the remaining parts were appeared to originate from a grown-up male, implies that LindowÃÂ IV is most likely piece of Lindow Man.
