Bellette had turned into a "spectator" to the neighborhood craftsmanship scene. This was to some extent on account of a change in Australian craftsmanship that incorporated the ascent of dynamic expressionism, the solid impact of few display proprietors, and victimization ladies that achieved "record levels". Bellette was in any case ready to verify a few displays in Sydney and Melbourne. These rare displays were gotten in all respects decidedly by pundits. At the point when her work was hung at the South Yarra Gallery in 1964, noted workmanship student of history and faultfinder Bernard Smith expressed in his survey for "The Age" that he "couldn't review a presentation in Melbourne of this quality since I started to compose this segment." Reviewing her 1966 show in Sydney, the "Messenger" pundit thought of it as was her "capacity to join the quiet excellence of type of her dearest elegance of substance with a dim sentimental soul that has picked up her such a good spot in Australian painting...the vestige of nature and man's developments are investigated with an unpretentious, ground-breaking request." In 1971, Melbourne commentator Alan McCulloch believed her traditional structures to be her best. Drawing parallels between traditional disaster and contemporary worldwide outcast emergencies, he noted "there is unending delicacy in these depictions and interminable misery. For despite the fact that these rough, shadowed scenes are inhabited with the phantoms and shades of an old civilisation, they are likewise inquisitively representative of present day strains and disasters."
