Whenever Martill and associates originally depicted "Irritator challengeri", the holotype was still broadly encased in calcareous shake framework. Analyst Diane M. Scott from the University of Toronto expected the assignment of completely wiping out the skull, taking into account a definite redescription in 2002. Composed by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, this review of the now completely arranged example invalidated a large number of Martill and partners' unique perceptions, which depended on misinterpretations of the harmed and generally disguised skull. The evaluated length of the total skull was shorter than recently proposed. What was initially thought to be a noticeable head peak turned out to be to be an unattached, uncertain bone piece. Besides, extra skull bones were recognized. As in the past examination, Sues and partners respected the African family "Spinosaurus" as the most comparable taxon to "Irritator", on the grounds that they shared numerous dental highlights, including generally straight cone shaped tooth crowns, slim lacquer, very much characterized edges with no , and longwise fluting. Since little was known about "Spinosaurus"s skull at the time, these similitudes were sufficient for the creators to propose a conceivable junior synonymy of "Irritator" with "Spinosaurus". Sues and associates noticed that all the more covering skull material was required for further conclusion. As a greater amount of "Spinosaurus"s skull wound up known, later research kept up partition of the two taxa.
