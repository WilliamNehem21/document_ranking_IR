On 3 August 1940, he wedded Eldwyth Ruth Alford (1910Ã¢ÂÂ 2013), by whom he had a child and two girls, and who teamed up with him in a lot of his work. Ruth Alford was an auxiliary teacher from Tavistock, Devon, the girl of Roger Rice Alford a Methodist evangelist and city hall leader of Tavistock. At the point when their commitment was reported in "The Times", Stearn was immensely entertained to see that he was portrayed as an "Individual of the Linen Society", a typographical mistake for Linnean Society. Stearn was raised an Anglican, yet was a noncombatant and after the Second World War he turned into a Quaker. In his later years, following authority retirement in 1976 he kept on living in Kew, Richmond. His entrance in's "Who" records his interests as "cultivating and talking". He passed on 9 May 2001 of pneumonia at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, at 90 years old. His memorial service occurred on 18 May at Mortlake crematorium. He was made due by his widow and three youngsters (Roger Thomas Stearn, Margaret Ruth Stearn and Helen Elizabeth Stearn) leaving a home of ÃÂ£461,240. His better half, whose 100th birthday celebration was commended at the Linnean Society in 2010, lived to the age of 103.
