At Basel, where the landscape leveled, the Rhine made a wide, northerly turn at the Rhine knee, and entered what local people call "the Rhine Ditch" ("Rheingraben"). This framed piece of a break valley some wide circumscribed by the uneven Black Forest on the east (German side) and the Vosges muntains on the west (French side). At the most distant edges of the eastern flood plain, tributaries cut profound pollutes into the western incline of the mountains; this turned out to be particularly essential in the stormy harvest time of 1796. Further toward the north, the waterway wound up further and quicker, until it extended into a delta, where it exhausted into the North Sea. During the 1790s, this piece of the stream was wild and erratic and armed forces crossed at their danger. Waterway channels twisted through bog and glade, and made islands of trees and vegetation that were occasionally submerged by floods. Streak floods starting in the mountains could submerge ranches and fields. Any military wishing to navigate the stream needed to cross at explicit focuses: in 1790, frameworks of viaducts and interstates made access over the waterway solid, yet just at Kehl, by Strasburg, at HÃÂ¼ningen, by Basel, and in the north by Mannheim. Some of the time, intersection could be executed at Neuf-Brisach, among Kehl and HÃÂ¼ningen, yet the little bridgehead made this problematic. Just toward the north of Kaiserslauten did the stream secure a characterized bank where invigorated extensions offered solid intersection focuses.
