The new magazine was titled "Venture Science Fiction", and the first issue was dated January 1957. Mills was managing editor of "F&SF" throughout "Venture"'s first run; he became editor of "F&SF" shortly after "Venture" ceased publishing in July 1958. The editorial philosophy was laid out by Ferman in the inaugural issue: "strong stories of action and adventureÂ ... There will be two prime requisites for "Venture" stories: In the first place, each must be a well-told "story", with a beginning, middle and end; in the second place, each must be a strong storyâa story with pace, power and excitement." Ferman hoped to take advantage of a gap in the science fiction magazine market opened up by the demise of "Planet Stories", one of the last sf pulps, which had ceased publication in late 1955. "Planet Stories" had focused on adventure stories, as opposed to the realistic style becoming more popular in science fiction in the 1950s, and Ferman hoped to combine the virtues of the melodramatic pulp fiction style with the literary values that were key to "F&SF"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success. "Venture"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bias towards action-oriented adventure led to stories with relatively more sex and violence than those in competing magazines, and sf historian Mike Ashley has commented that it was perhaps five or ten years ahead of its time. One story, "The Girl Had Guts", by Theodore Sturgeon, involved an alien virus that caused its victims to vomit up their intestines; Ashley records a reviewer saying that the story made him physically ill.
