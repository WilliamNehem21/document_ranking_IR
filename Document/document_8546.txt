A gathering between the Manhattan District and Kellogg on 12 December 1942 suggested that the K-25 plant be worked by Union Carbide. This would be through a completely possessed auxiliary, Carbon and Carbide Chemicals. An expense in addition to fixed-charge contract was marked on 18 January 1943, setting the expense at $75,000 every month. This was later expanded to $96,000 per month to work both K-25 and K-27. Association Carbide did not wish to be the sole administrator of the office. Association Carbide proposed that the molding plant be assembled and worked by Ford, Bacon and Davis. The Manhattan District discovered this worthy, and an expense in addition to fixed-charge contract was consulted with a charge of $216,000 for administrations up to the finish of June 1945. The agreement was ended at an opportune time 1 May 1945, when Union Carbide assumed control over the plant. Portage, Bacon and Davis was in this manner paid $202,000. The other special case was the fluorine plant. Hooker Chemical was solicited to manage its development from the fluorine plant, and at first to work it for a fixed charge of $24,500. The plant was swung over to Union Carbide on 1 February 1945.
