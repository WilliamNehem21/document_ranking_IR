While struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London. Pitt's acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films "No Way Out" (1987), "No Man's Land" (1987) and "Less Than Zero" (1987). In May 1987, his television debut came with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera "Another World". In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom "Growing Pains". He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series "Dallas" between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall). Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama "21 Jump Street". In the same year, the YugoslavianâU.S. co-production "The Dark Side of the Sun" (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997. Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy "Happy Together"; the second a featured role in the horror film "Cutting Class", the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters. He made guest appearances on television series "Head of the Class", "Freddy's Nightmares", "Thirtysomething", and (for a second time) "Growing Pains".
