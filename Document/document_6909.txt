As death succeeded demise, Dickinson discovered her reality overturned. In the fall of 1884, she composed that "The Dyings have been unreasonably profound for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come." That mid year she had seen "an incredible dimness coming" and blacked out while preparing in the kitchen. She stayed oblivious late into the night and long stretches of sick wellbeing pursued. On November 30, 1885, her weakness and different indications were worrying to the point that Austin dropped an excursion to Boston. She was limited to her bed for a couple of months, yet figured out how to send a last burst of letters in the spring. What is believed to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and basically read: "Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily". On May 15, 1886, following a few days of intensifying side effects, Emily Dickinson kicked the bucket at 55 years old. Austin wrote in his journal that "the day was dreadful ... she stopped to inhale that horrendous breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six." Dickinson's main doctor gave the reason for death as Bright's sickness and its span as over two years.
