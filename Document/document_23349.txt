Francisco Goya etched a print of "Las Meninas" in 1778, and later used VelÃ¡zquez's painting as the model for his "CharlesÂ IV of Spain and His Family". As in "Las Meninas", the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of "Las Meninas" with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of "imminent suffocation". Goya's royal family is presented on a "stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim smile, points and says: 'Look at them and judge for yourself!'Â "
The 19th-century British art collector William John Bankes travelled to Spain during the Peninsular War (1808â1814) and acquired a copy of "Las Meninas" painted by Mazo, which he believed to be an original preparatory oil sketch by VelÃ¡zquezâalthough VelÃ¡zquez did not usually paint studies. Bankes described his purchase as "the glory of my collection", noting that he had been "a long while in treaty for it and was obliged to pay a high price". The copy was admired throughout the 19th century in Britain, and is now in Kingston Lacy. Recently there have been suggestions that it might be by VelÃ¡zquez after all (see below).
