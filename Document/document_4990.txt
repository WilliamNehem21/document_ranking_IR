Late that night, the evening of 16 July, the family was stirred and advised to come down to the lower dimension of the house in light of the fact that there was distress in the town everywhere and they would need to be moved for their very own wellbeing. The family rose up out of their rooms conveying cushions, sacks, and different things to make Alexandra and Alexei agreeable. The family delayed and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and whelps that remained on the arrival, maybe as an indication of regard for the dead. Nicholas told the workers and family "Well, we will escape this spot." They made inquiries of the watchmen yet did not seem to speculate they would have been slaughtered. Yurovsky, who had been an expert picture taker, guided the family to accept diverse positions as a photographic artist may. Alexandra, who had griped about the absence of seats for herself and Alexei, sat to her child's left. The Tsar remained behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin remained to the Tsar's correct, Olga and her sisters remained behind Alexandra alongside the workers. They were left for roughly 30 minutes while further arrangements were made. The gathering said small amid this time, however Alexandra murmured to the young ladies in English, abusing the watchman's decides that they should talk in Russian. Yurovsky came in, requested them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Olga and her mom endeavored to make the indication of the cross and the remainder of the family had time just to absolute a couple of disjointed hints of stun or challenge before the demise squad under Yurovsky's order started shooting. It was the early long periods of 17 July 1918.
