On 11 April, fourth Regiment Hurricanes effectively shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 overwhelming contender over Nova GradiÃÂ¡ka. The next day, a few of the staying 105th Squadron Hurricanes were singed by ground groups at Veliki Radinci, while different machines from a similar squadron traveled to Bijeljina, where other airplane had concentrated. This move had just barely been finished when an expansive arrangement of German Bf 110s cleared over the landing strip and annihilated more than two dozen air ship, including everything except one of the 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At KniÃÂ, moving toward German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, traveling to Zemun. The primary pilot landed securely, yet was promptly caught by equipped "Volksdeutsche". The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not protected, severed and endeavored to travel to Bjeljina, however came up short on fuel and was murdered when he attempted to crash-land close Valjevo. Indeed, even at this late stage, the fourth Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They kept on pursuing observation flying machine for the duration of the day, shooting down one Ju 88 close Banja Luka. At the point when German aircraft again assaulted the runways around Mostar, the one outstanding Hurricane of the Air Training School assaulted a Ju 88 yet was hit by return fire, compelling the pilot to salvage.
