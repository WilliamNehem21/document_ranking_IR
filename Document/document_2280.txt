Later in 2002, Hoffman featured inverse Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in Anderson's widely praised fourth picture, the surrealist lighthearted comedy dramatization "Dazed Love" (2002), where he played an illicit telephone sex "director". Drew Hunt of the "Chicago Reader" saw the execution as a fine case of Hoffman's "skill for transforming little jobs into original exhibitions" and adulated the performing artist's comedic capacity. In an altogether different film, Hoffman was next observed with Anthony Hopkins in the high-spending spine chiller "Red Dragon", a prequel to "The Silence of the Lambs", depicting the nosy sensationalist Freddy Lounds. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in Spike Lee's dramatization "25th Hour", playing an English educator who commits a staggering inebriated error. Both Lee and the film's lead Edward Norton were excited to work with Hoffman, and Lee admitted that he had since quite a while ago needed to complete an image with the performer, yet had held up until he discovered the correct job. Hoffman thought about his character, Jakob, to be a standout amongst the most hesitant characters he had ever played, a no nonsense "corduroy-pants-wearing sort of fellow." Roger Ebert advanced "25th Hour" to one of his "Extraordinary Movies" in 2009, and alongside A. O. Scott, believed it to be a standout amongst the best movies of the 2000s.
