Playing for the Lions, Kieswetter moved into the center request, as opposed to opening the batting; this was planned to set him up for a comparative switch with the senior England group to permit Kevin Pietersen to open. He scored a century and 50 years to enable England to win the arrangement 3Ã¢ÂÂ 2, however he was outflanked by Buttler. In mid 2012, playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, Kieswetter just batted twice in the ODI arrangement, and was lauded for his 43-run commitment in the fourth match, however George Dobell of "ESPNcricinfo" distinguished his wicket-keeping as "still not as cleaned as he might want". In spite of the fact that Kieswetter dropped down the request in ODIs, he held his place opening the batting in T20Is. Rather than the 2010 World Twenty20, when the England players were advised to assault bat sacrificially, in 2012 the group was told to abstain from losing early wickets, and Kieswetter attempted to adjust his diversion to score generally safe singles and turn the strike. Amid the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, he lost his place in England's T20I group after a match against New Zealand in which he scored four keeps running from fourteen balls. That was his last worldwide Twenty20 match. In his 25 diversions, he scored at a normal of 21.91 and a strike rate of 111.91.
