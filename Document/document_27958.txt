The poem is traditionally attributed to Faltonia Betitia Proba largely on the assertion of Isidore, who wrote in his "Etymologiae" that "De laudibus Christi" was the product of a woman named Proba who was the wife of a man named Adelphus ("Proba, uxor Adelphi, centonem ex Vergilio" ... "expressit"). But the classicist and medievalist Danuta Shanzer has argued that the poem was not the work of Faltonia Betitia Proba, but rather her granddaughter, Anicia Faltonia Proba, who lived in the late-fourth and early-fifth centuries. Shanzerwho is of the opinion that Faltonia Betitia Proba likely died in AD 351bases much of her assertion on supposed date inconsistencies and anachronisms within the text. For instance, Shanzer points out that lines 13â17 of "De laudibus Christi" strongly resemble lines 20â24 of the poem "Carmen contra paganos", which was written sometime after Faltonia Betitia Proba's death. Shanzer also claims that "De laudibus Christi" alludes to a notable debate about the date of Easter that took place in AD 387, thereby suggesting that the poem must date from the latter part of the fourth century. Finally, Shanzer argues that the reference to the war between Magnentius and Constantius in the work's proem precludes the possibility that Faltonia Betitia Proba arranged "De laudibus Christi", due to the fact that the war took place in the same year as her supposed death. Shanzer rounds out her hypothesis by also invoking a textual argument, noting that the author of "De laudibus Christi" is often referred to in later manuscripts by titles that only Anicia Proba would have received, such as "mother of the Anicians" or the "eminent Roman Mistress".
