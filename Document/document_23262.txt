Retrospective reviews have been largely positive. In 2007, "Game Informer" called "Saga" one of the greatest games ever made, and praised the use of dramatic camera angles and animations to make the battles "very cinematic even by modern standards". In a 2007 article for 1UP.com, James Mielke rated the game 9/10, describing it as "the greatest RPG you've never played" and one of the "most unique" RPGs of all time. According to Mielke, "for a 3D shooter to suddenly make the unexpected jump from shooter to RPG so gracefully was a major accomplishment." "Retro Gamer's" Phil Harrison echoed this sentiment, praising the fusion of action and RPG elements. In "1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die" (2013), Jason Brookes wrote that only the cutscenes had aged poorly and that "many aspectsÂ of the game impress above and beyond even many of the RPGs produced nowadays". Mielke, Harrison and Brookes all praised the story's restraint and lack of clichÃ©. In 2018, "The Ringer" praised the complexity of its characters, none of whom are "truly heroic". John Szczepaniak, author of "The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers", wrote that "I genuinely cannot think of a game whose story impresses me more" and argued that the primitive graphics assisted the sense of an ancient, alien world.
