The film has been described by CBS News, Rotten Tomatoes, and ComingSoon.com as a science fiction cult classic. However film critic Mark Kermode reported that "The Fifth Element" was one of the most divisive films among his readers, regarded as both the best and the worst summer blockbuster of all time. Kermode recalled his own experience: "I remember very clearly being in Cannes when "[The] Fifth Element" was first played, and it "really" divided the audience." Stephen Cass of "Discover" ranked the film the third-best science fiction film on subscription service Hulu, writing, "People seem to either like or loathe "The Fifth Element "...Â Lavish visuals and entertaining performances from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman make this movie worth watching." In some circles the film has gained a "so-bad-it's-good" status; Meredith Woerner of io9 listed "The Fifth Element" as one of "The 20 Best Worst Science Fiction Movies of All Time". In 2007 the Visual Effects Society placed "The Fifth Element" at No. 50, tied with "Darby O'Gill and the Little People", on their list of the 50 most influential visual effects films of all time. In 2014, "Time Out" listed the film at No. 42 on their "100 best sci-fi movies" list.
