After the game's release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the "Commander Keen" engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the "Wolfenstein 3D" engine or derivatives of it include "", the Capstone Software games "" and "Operation Body Count", as well as "Super 3D Noah's Ark". Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled "Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II", designed by Tom Hall using the "Wolfenstein 3D" engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, "Rise of the Triad". Additionally, Softdisk produced "Catacomb Abyss" using the prototype "Wolfenstein 3D" engine from "Catacomb 3-D" as part of the "Catacomb Adventure Series" trilogy of sequels. Although "Wolfenstein 3D" was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content. John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others. The modding efforts of "Wolfenstein" players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like "Doom" and "Quake" to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games. The source code for the original "Wolfenstein 3D" engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release. The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as "Ken's Labyrinth", "Nitemare 3D", "", "Terminal Terror" and "The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki", among others.
