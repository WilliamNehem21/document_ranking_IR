"The Raft of the Medusa" was first appeared at the 1819 Paris Salon, under the title "ScÃÂ¨ne de Naufrage" ("Shipwreck Scene"), despite the fact that its genuine subject would have been indisputable for contemporary watchers. The presentation was supported by Louis XVIII and included almost 1,300 sketches, 208 models and various different etchings and building plans. GÃÂ©ricault's canvas was the star at the show: "It strikes and pulls in everyone's eyes" ("Le Journal de Paris"). Louis XVIII visited three days before the opening and stated: """", or "Monsieur GÃÂ©ricault, you've painted a wreck, however it's not one for you". The commentators were partitioned: the repulsiveness and "terribilitÃÂ " of the subject practiced interest, however fans of elegance communicated their aversion for what they depicted as a "heap of carcasses", whose authenticity they considered a long ways from the "perfect excellence" spoken to by Girodet's "Pygmalion and Galatea", which triumphed that year. GÃÂ©ricault's work communicated a Catch 22: how could a repulsive subject be converted into a ground-breaking painting, how could the painter accommodate workmanship and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of GÃÂ©ricault, if one answer: "Monsieur GÃÂ©ricault appears to be mixed up. The objective of painting is to address the spirit and the eyes, not to repulse." The composition had intense admirers as well, including French essayist and workmanship pundit Auguste Jal, who adulated its political subject, its liberal positionÃ¢ÂÂ its headway of the negro and scrutinize of ultra-royalismÃ¢ÂÂ and its advancement. The antiquarian Jules Michelet endorsed: "our entire society is on board the pile of the Medusa".
