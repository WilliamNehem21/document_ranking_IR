Between the late 1940s and mid 1950s there were various projects in Spain to build up a self-impelled howitzer dependent on a current body. For instance, amid the mid 1950s, Spanish architects endeavored to retrofit a R-43 105-millimeter (4.1ÃÂ in) L/26 howitzer into a StuG III. This required remaking of the turret's casemate, in a design like the Verdeja 75-millimeter self-pushed howitzer. Albeit one vehicle started change, the program was never concluded. There were comparative projects to fit a 88-millimeter L/56 and a 122-millimeter L/46 howitzer from there on, however these did not progress past the arranging stage, either. A standout amongst the best projects was simply the endeavor to deliver a 75-millimeter self-pushed howitzer dependent on the frame of the VerdejaÃÂ 1 model. Starting in 1945,ÃÂ  currently Major Verdeja was requested to start structuring this piece utilizing a quick terminating 75-millimeter L/40 howitzer planned by "Sociedad EspaÃÂ±ola de ConstrucciÃÂ³n Naval". The accessibility of the required parts and the absence of convoluted changes implied that the vehicle was immediately arranged and tried widely. The destiny of oneself pushed piece was much equivalent to that of the VerdejaÃÂ 2, and the vehicle was left immaculate at the demonstrating grounds in Carabanchel until 1973, when it was moved to the Spanish base "Alfonso XIII", lodging the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment "Wad RassÃÂ nÃÂºÃÂ 55". It was before long moved to another base, lastly conveyed to the base of "El Goloso", outside of Madrid, as a piece of a heavily clad vehicles gallery.
