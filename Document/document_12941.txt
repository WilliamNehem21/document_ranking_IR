The enthusiast Pundalik, hurler of the block (see Legend underneath), is a noteworthy character in the legends of Vithoba. He is ordinarily seen to be a recorded figure, associated with the foundation and proliferation of the Vithoba-driven Varkari faction. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar considers Pundalik to be the organizer of the Varkari organization and the person who proclaimed the group in Maratha nation. Stevenson (1843) goes further, proposing he may have been a Jain or a Buddhist, since Varkari custom is a blend of Jain and Buddhist ethics, and Vithoba is seen as Vishnu in his structure as Buddha. Frazer, Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar (1922) all recommend that Pundalik endeavored to bring together Shiva and Vishnu, and that this faction began in Karnataka. Ranade (1933) imagines that Pundalik, a Kannada holy person, was the originator of the Varkari faction as well as the principal extraordinary aficionado or first devout cleric of the Pandharpur sanctuary. Upadhyaya underpins the cleric hypothesis yet decays the Kannada starting point hypothesis. As indicated by M. S. Mate, Pundalik was instrumental in cajoling the Hoysala lord Vishnuvardhana to fabricate the Pandharpur sanctuary to Vishnu, putting him in the mid 12thÃÂ century. Different researchers like Raeside (1965), Dhanpalvar (1972), and Vaudeville (1974) have scrutinized the accuracy of Pundalik by and large, and expelled him as a legendary figure.
