Quickly southeast of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, a broadly dissolved fountain of liquid magma containing a north-south slanting edge. It has a rise of and is one of the more seasoned volcanic highlights in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, however its extensive measure of analyzation and proof of frigid ice abrogating the well of lava demonstrates that it shaped more than 75,000ÃÂ years prior before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Hence, volcanism at Mount Fee does not show proof of collaboration with chilly ice. The rest of the items from Fee's soonest volcanic movement is a minor segment of pyroclastic shake. This is proof of unstable volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, just as its first volcanic occasion. The second volcanic occasion created an arrangement of magmas and breccias on the eastern flank of the fundamental edge. These volcanics were likely stored when a grouping of magma streams and broken magma sections ejected from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks amid the development of an expansive well of lava. Following broad analyzation, reestablished volcanism delivered a thick arrangement of magma streams framing its restricted, level topped, soak sided northern breaking point and the northern end of the principle edge. The course for which these magma streams began from was likely vertical in structure and encroached through more seasoned volcanics stored amid Fee's before volcanic occasions. This volcanic occasion was additionally trailed by a time of disintegration, and likely at least one frigid periods. Broad disintegration following the last volcanic occasion at Mount Fee has made the rough north-south slanting edge that as of now shapes a conspicuous milestone.
