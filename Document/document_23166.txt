The solution of Adriaan van Roomen (1596) is based on the intersection of two hyperbolas. Let the given circles be denoted as "C", "C" and "C". Van Roomen solved the general problem by solving a simpler problem, that of finding the circles that are tangent to "two" given circles, such as "C" and "C". He noted that the center of a circle tangent to both given circles must lie on a hyperbola whose foci are the centers of the given circles. To understand this, let the radii of the solution circle and the two given circles be denoted as "r", "r" and "r", respectively (FigureÂ 3). The distance "d" between the centers of the solution circle and "C" is either or , depending on whether these circles are chosen to be externally or internally tangent, respectively. Similarly, the distance "d" between the centers of the solution circle and "C" is either or , again depending on their chosen tangency. Thus, the difference between these distances is always a constant that is independent of "r". This property, of having a fixed difference between the distances to the foci, characterizes hyperbolas, so the possible centers of the solution circle lie on a hyperbola. A second hyperbola can be drawn for the pair of given circles "C" and "C", where the internal or external tangency of the solution and "C" should be chosen consistently with that of the first hyperbola. An intersection of these two hyperbolas (if any) gives the center of a solution circle that has the chosen internal and external tangencies to the three given circles. The full set of solutions to Apollonius' problem can be found by considering all possible combinations of internal and external tangency of the solution circle to the three given circles.
