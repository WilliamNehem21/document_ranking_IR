Mercia was the predominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and kept up its situation until it endured a conclusive thrashing by Wessex at the Battle of Ellandun in 825. From there on the two kingdoms moved toward becoming partners, which was to be a vital factor in English protection from the Vikings. In 865 the Danish Viking Great Heathen Army arrived in East Anglia and utilized this as a beginning stage for an attack. The East Anglians were compelled to satisfy the Vikings, who attacked Northumbria the next year. They designated a manikin ruler in 867, and after that proceeded onward Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867Ã¢ÂÂ 868. Ruler Burgred of Mercia was joined by King ÃÂthelred of Wessex and his sibling, the future King Alfred, for a consolidated assault on the Vikings, who declined a commitment; at last the Mercians purchased harmony with them. The next year, the Danes vanquished East Anglia, and in 874 they ousted King Burgred and, with their help, Ceolwulf turned into the last King of Mercia. In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, taking the eastern locales for themselves and permitting Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. In mid 878 they attacked Wessex, and numerous West Saxons submitted to them. Alfred, who was presently lord, was decreased to a remote base in the Isle of Athelney in Somerset, however the circumstance was changed when he won a conclusive triumph at the Battle of Edington. He was along these lines ready to keep the Vikings from taking Wessex and western Mercia, despite the fact that regardless they involved Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern Mercia.
