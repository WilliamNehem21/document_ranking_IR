The accompaniment served with rice is called "laoka" in the highlands dialect, the official version of the Malagasy language. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking. In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes. Laoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish; "trondro gasy", (, various freshwater fish); shredded cassava leaves with peanuts, beef or pork; "henan'omby" (, beef) or "akoho" (, chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called "ritra" ); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more. A variety of local greens such as "anamamy" (, Morelle greens), "anamafaitra" (, Martin greens) and particularly "anamalao" (, paracress)âdistinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produceâare commonly sold alongside "anandrano" (, watercress) and "anatsonga" (, bok choy). In the arid south and west, such as among the Bara or Tandroy peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, millet and maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.
