Japanese triumphs amid the opening a long time of the Pacific War invalidated pre-war US plans for assaults against the Japanese country and a progression of endeavors to begin a little scale battle from bases in China were fruitless. Before the flare-up of war, the USAAF had intended to bomb Japan from Wake Island, Guam, the Philippines and beach front territories in China. In any case, these territories were quickly caught by Japanese powers, and the USAAF overwhelming aircraft drive in the Philippines was to a great extent devastated when Clark Air Base was assaulted on 8ÃÂ December 1941. The USAAF in this manner endeavored to send thirteen substantial planes to China in March and April 1942 to assault the Japanese home islands. These air ship achieved India, however stayed there as the Japanese victory of Burma caused coordinations issues and Chinese Nationalist pioneer Chiang Kai-shek was hesitant to enable them to work from an area under his control. A further 13 B-24 Liberator substantial aircraft were dispatched from the United States to work from China in May 1942 as the HALPRO drive, however were re-entrusted to help Allied activities in the Mediterranean. In July 1942, the authority of the American Volunteer Group, Colonel Claire Lee Chennault, looked for a power of 100 P-47 Thunderbolt contenders and 30 B-25 Mitchell medium planes, which he accepted would be adequate to "crush" the Japanese flying machine industry. After three months Chennault disclosed to United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt that a power of 105 present day contenders and 40 planes (counting twelve overwhelming aircraft) would most likely "achieve the defeat of Japan" inside six to a year. The USAAF's base camp did not see these cases as sound, and Chennault's solicitations for fortifications were not allowed.
