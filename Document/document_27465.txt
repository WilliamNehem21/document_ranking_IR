By June 1917, Dallas had achieved over 20Â victories in aerial combat. This experience, and his leadership ability, led to his appointment as commanding officer of No.Â 1 Naval Squadron on 23Â June 1917. The unit had been forced to cut back its operational strength from 18 aircraft to 15 due to lack of pilot replacements and a shortage of spare parts for the aging Triplanes. It had also moved airfields, to an unprepared site at Bailleul. As a leader, Dallas made a point of shepherding new pilots through their first flights, and even setting them up with their first victories by manoeuvring enemy aircraft into a good position for the rookie to take a shot. On the ground, he proved to be an efficient organiser, designing and directing construction of the new air base. It was also during this time that he wrote a treatise on air combat tactics, extracts of which have survived. Both the air base layout and the treatise displayed his talent as a sketch artist. On 2Â November, No.Â 1 Squadron moved airfields once more, to Middle Aerodrome, which put it back under overall RNAS control. The unit received its first eight new Sopwith Camels on 9Â November as replacements for the Triplanes. On 11Â November, Dallas was again mentioned in despatches, this time by Field Marshal Haig. After gaining its full complement of Camels, No.Â 1 Squadron was transferred to England, and took up home defence duties at Dover. On 16Â February 1918, Dallas led his squadron back to France, where it was based at TÃ©teghem, supporting units on operations along the Belgian coast. He commanded it for another six weeks, until 31Â March.
