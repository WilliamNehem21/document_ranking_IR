In the formative progress from "Divine force of War III" to "Rising", one of the illustrations engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noticed that the points of confinement of the "Lord of War III" motor confined craftsman innovativeness, so they "endeavored to expel or drive those breaking points beyond what many would consider possible without losing any execution." For instance, the quantity of UV sets was expanded to three for each work. For an unpredictable character display like Kratos, "free surfaces are required for body parts remarkable to him, each folding over the head, middle and appendages - all of which structure an editable 'UV set' when spread out level." Allowing more UV sets likewise made it conceivable to have a progressively regular look to nature. "Climb" was not as sensational a development in illustrations over its forerunner as "Divine force of War III" had been: "From a designs 'specialized' point of view, to a huge degree "Lord of War: Ascension" was greater refinement on the illustrations front" said another illustrations engineer, Ben Diamand, who concentrated on enhancement amid "Ascension"s advancement. The advancement group additionally included powerful lighting, which took into consideration improvement of the Life Cycle interactivity repairman. Molecule impacts were additionally extraordinarily improved from "Lord of War III": "the thought was to give craftsmen more control to accomplish better outcomes with less particles" said Perthuis.
