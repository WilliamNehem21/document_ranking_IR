In June 1399, Louis, Duke of OrlÃÂ©ans, dealt with the court of the crazy Charles VI of France. The arrangement of "rapprochement" with the English crown did not suit Louis' political aspirations, and hence he thought that it was perfect to enable Henry to leave for England. With a little gathering of adherents, Bolingbroke arrived at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the finish of June 1399. Men from everywhere throughout the nation before long mobilized around the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his very own second thoughts about the ruler, Bolingbroke demanded that his solitary article was to recover his own patrimony. Percy trusted him and declined to meddle. The ruler had taken the vast majority of his family unit knights and the devoted individuals from his respectability with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little opposition as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was going about as Keeper of the Realm, had minimal decision however to agree with Bolingbroke. In the interim, Richard was deferred in his arrival from Ireland and did not arrive in Wales until 24 July. He advanced toward Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for exchanges. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to renounce if his life were saved. The two men at that point came back to London, the irate ruler riding right behind Henry. On landing, he was detained in the Tower of London on 1 September.
