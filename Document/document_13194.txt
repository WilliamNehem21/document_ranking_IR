Albeit different sources recount to an alternate story, Ward composed that McAleer named his "break" with Johnson as the consequence of a "disloyalty" of trust. McAleer demonstrated that his controlling enthusiasm for the Red Sox qualified him for settle on every single significant choice with respect to the association, Ward composed. This perspective on McAleer's forces, notwithstanding, was not shared by the club's supervisor, Stahl, the article included. To additionally confound matters, Stahl's dad in-law, a Chicago-based financier, was supposedly an investor in the Red Sox. After one especially warmed trade among Stahl and McAleer at the end of the 1912 season, Stahl went to Chicago to meet with Johnson. The article showed that, after this gathering, Johnson sent McAleer a "sternly worded" letter, which may have been intended to safeguard his association with Stahl and Stahl's dad in-law. As per the article, Johnson later trusted to McAleer that he owed Stahl's dad in-law cash and in this manner felt obliged to agree with Stahl's position in the question. McAleer, in any case, accepting the counsel from Johnson as a disloyalty of their fellowship, wouldn't acknowledge Johnson's clarifications, and speedily resigned, Ward composed. This form of occasions is to a great extent verified by the early research of baseball student of history David Fleitz.
