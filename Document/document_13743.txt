Improvement of "South Park: The Stick of Truth" took four years, starting in 2009 when "South Park" co-makers Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached Obsidian Entertainment to examine their craving to make a "South Park" diversion. Parker, a fanatic of Obsidian recreations, including "" (2010), needed to make a pretending diversion, a kind which he and Stone had delighted in since their childhoods. Parker and Stone demanded that the diversion must imitate the show's visual style. Parker's unique idea was for a "South Park" form of the 2011 pretending dream amusement "", and he assessed the primary content he delivered to be 500 pages in length. The South Park Digital Studios group energized an idea of the amusement's opening scene to demonstrate what they needed to achieve with Obsidian as far as appearance and ongoing interaction mechanics. While the arrangement had enlivened a few authorized amusements, for example, "South Park" (1998) and "South Park Rally" (1999), Parker and Stone were not associated with these recreations' advancement and later condemned the titles' quality. Negative response to those recreations made the pair defensive of their property and prompted their more prominent contribution on "The Stick of Truth"; they denied a few solicitations to permit the arrangement for new pursuits.
