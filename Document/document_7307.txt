Instruct had at some stage educated of the idea of an illustrious absolution and likely trusted in Bonnet his eagerness to acknowledge it. The absolution was available to all privateers who surrendered at the very latest 5ÃÂ September 1718, yet contained an admonition stipulating that resistance was offered just against wrongdoings submitted before 5ÃÂ January. Despite the fact that in principle this left Bonnet and Teach in danger of being hanged for their activities at Charles Town Bar, most experts could postpone such conditions. Instruct imagined that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, yet to ensure, he hung tight to perceive what might happen to another commander. Hood left quickly on a little cruising watercraft for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and got his absolution. He at that point ventured out back to Beaufort Inlet to gather the "Retribution" and the rest of his group, proposing to sail to Saint Thomas Island to get a commission. Lamentably for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its resources and arrangements, and had marooned its team; Bonnet set out for retribution, yet was unfit to discover him. He and his team came back to theft and were caught on 27ÃÂ September 1718 at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. Everything except four were attempted and hanged in Charles Town.
