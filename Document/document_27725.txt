All named species of "Plateosaurus" except the type species and "P.Â gracilis" have turned out to be junior synonyms of the type species or invalid names. Von Huene practically erected a new species and sometimes a new genus for each relatively complete find from Trossingen (three species of "Pachysaurus" and seven of "Plateosaurus") and Halberstadt (one species of "Gresslyosaurus" and eight of "Plateosaurus"). Later, he merged several of these species, but remained convinced that more than one genus and more than one species of "Plateosaurus" was present in both localities. Jaekel also believed that the Halberstadt material included several plateosaurid dinosaurs, as well as non-plateosaurid prosauropods. Systematic research by Galton drastically reduced the number of genera and species. Galton synonymised all cranial material, and described differences between the syntypes of "P.Â engelhardti" and the Trossingen material, which he referred to "P.Â longiceps". Galton recognised "P.Â trossingensis" ("P.Â fraasianus" and "P.Â integer" are junior objective synonyms) to be identical to "P.Â longiceps". Markus Moser, however, showed that "P.Â longiceps" is itself a junior synonym of "P.Â engelhardti". Furthermore, a variety of species in other genera were created for material belonging to "P.Â engelhardti", including "Dimodosaurus poligniensis", "Gresslyosaurus robustus", "Gresslyosaurus torgeri", "Pachysaurus ajax", "Pachysaurus giganteus", "Pachysaurus magnus" and "Pachysaurus wetzelianus".
