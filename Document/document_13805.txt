Before the arrangement could be executed, Somashkar Nayaka kicked the bucket and was prevailing by a newborn child grandson Basava Nayaka, his progression questioned by the Queen Mother, who supported another petitioner, Timmaya Nayaka. The 1671 settlement grieved in the midst of the progression battle until 1678, when one more bargain was consulted with Basava Nayaka who rose as the victor. Since the two gatherings in the progression battle had been keen on acquiring European ordnance from the Portuguese, the possible arrangement of 1678 was considerably increasingly ideal to the last mentioned. Under it, Basava consented to pay 30,000 xerafins in Portuguese war-charges for the decade-long clash with the Dutch (whom the Nayakas of Ikkeri had bolstered), to give development material to the manufacturing plant at Mangalore, to give 1,500 sacks of clean rice every year, to pay a yearly tribute for Mangalore and Barcelore, to wreck the production lines of the Omani Arabs on the Kanara coast, and to enable Catholic houses of worship to be worked at various areas in Kanara. With the bargain set up, Portuguese power came back to Kanara after an interregnum of practically 50 years. The Nayakas of Ikkeri, in their turn, figured out how to control the district until 1763, at which time Haidar Ali claimed it and proclaimed the aim of making another capital, later called Nagar.
