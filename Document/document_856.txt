As per Latin American writing researcher Richard Callan, the division among demolition and fruitfulness is exemplified in the restriction between the President and Miguel Angel Face. While the President speaks to sterility and annihilation, his top choice, Miguel Angel Face, encapsulates richness, a positive and generative power of nature. Callan takes note of that Miguel Angel Face's change from the President's most loved to a positive generative power isn't think. Rather, Callan contends that "it results from the introduction of intimate romance in his some time ago desolate heart. Nonetheless, he is excessively immersed in his affection to see the move in his association with the President." The President, of course, recognizes himself authentically with death. Precedents from the novel incorporate the capital punishments he provides for Abel Carvajal (for a wrongdoing the President is completely mindful the man did not submit) and to Lucio Vasquez, a man in his administration that did his desire for the Zany to be murdered but is as yet executed. Rather than the President, Callan features Miguel Angel Face's relationship with adoration. The adoration that Miguel Angel Face produces for Camila recognizes him with affection and life, and prompts multiplicationÃ¢ÂÂthe introduction of his child. Rosello contends that even before his change, Miguel Angel Face knew about the President's damaging nature. All things considered, Rosello contends that Miguel Angel Face "knew from the earliest starting point that the main 'wellbeing' in the President's reality is a type of implosion: just by losing his character and giving the President's mind a chance to attack his very own might he be able to plan to stay alive". In this way, when he neglected to agree, he did without a doubt lose his life.
