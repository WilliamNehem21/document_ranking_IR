At the point when Moorcock understood that the magazine would need to overlap, he made game plans with Sphere Books to proceed "New Worlds" as a quarterly soft cover collection arrangement. Circle created eight issues, in spite of the fact that the quarterly timetable was not clung to after the fourth issue; the eighth issue showed up in 1975. Six issues were reproduced in the US. The early issues did well monetarily, with around 25,000 duplicates sold, not including US deals. Moorcock turned over the editorship to Charles Platt with the 6th volume, and to Hilary Bailey from there on, to give himself more opportunity to give to his own composition: he additionally remarked that at this point "I never again had my publication contact (I couldn't peruse sf by any stretch of the imagination)". Circle dropped the arrangement after two additional issues; it was quickly taken over by Corgi Books, however deals were frail and Corgi dropped the arrangement with "New Worlds 10" in 1976, albeit as per Moorcock he and Bailey chose to end the arrangement when they got into conflicts with Corgi. In the US Berkley Books distributed volumes 1 through 4, and when they dropped the arrangement Platt, who was a counseling supervisor at Avon Books, republished two further volumes, number 6 and 7 of the UK arrangement.
