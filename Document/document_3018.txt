Amid Brain's residency at de Havilland, the organization made sixty-nine Vampire T35 stream coaches at its Bankstown industrial facility for conveyance to the RAAF, just as Sea Venoms for the RAN. Leaving deÃÂ Havilland upon its merger with Hawker Siddeley in 1960, he surrendered all day work and joined the leading group of East-West Airlines as an advisor in January 1961. In August 1964, he started arrangements with the Federal government for the benefit of International Parcels Express Company (presently Toll IPEC), which was endeavoring to enter the airship cargo business in Australia with the buy of five DC-4 Skymasters; the legislature dismissed the proposition soon thereafter. Alongside Arthur Coles, Brain was a visitor at the opening of TAA's new home office at Franklin Street, Melbourne in November 1965. In 1978, he met with traveler Dick Smith, who was going to dispatch a campaign to recuperate the "Kookaburra" from the Tanami Desert. Smith was quick to get bearings from the man who had discovered the missing plane in 1929, despite accepting guidance against taking the expression of somebody from the "top and goggles" period. He rediscovered the "Kookaburra" in August that year "precisely where Lester Brain had saidÃÂ ...ÃÂ Lester was totally chuffed when I got back and revealed to him I'd discovered the "Kookaburra" on account of his bearings and how appreciative I was that, notwithstanding every other person's recommendations, I'd accepted Lester's recommendation."
