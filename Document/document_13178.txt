Walker protested Kenney's proposal that the planes direct assaults from low dimension with bombs furnished with immediate circuits. Kenney requested Walker to attempt the quick breakers for two or three months, with the goal that information could be increased about their adequacy; half a month later Kenney found that Walker had ceased the utilization of the immediate wires. In November, Kenney organized an exhibit assault on the SS "Pruth", a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was regularly utilized for target practice. After the assault Walker and Kenney took a vessel out to the disaster area to investigate the harm. Of course, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck; however the immediate circuits had exploded the bombs when they struck the water, and bomb parts had torn gaps in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly surrendered the point. "Ken was alright," Kenney later reviewed. "He was obstinate, over-touchy, and a diva, yet he worked extremely hard constantly. His group preferred him a ton however he would in general get a staff of 'yes-men'. He didn't care to assign expert. I was anxious about the possibility that that Ken was not sturdy enough to keep going extremely long under the high pressure of this show."
