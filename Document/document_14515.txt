From Turkic people groups of Central Asia amid the Northern Wei (386Ã¢ÂÂ 535 AD) period the Eastern Romans obtained one more name for China: "Taugast" (Old Turkic: "Tabghach"). Theophylact Simocatta, a student of history amid the rule of Heraclius (r. 610Ã¢ÂÂ 641 AD), composed that Taugast (or Taugas) was an incredible eastern realm colonized by Turkic individuals, with a capital city upper east of India that he called "Khubdan" (from the Turkic word "Khumdan" utilized for the Sui and Tang capital Chang'an), where worshipful admiration was rehearsed however the general population were insightful and lived by just laws. He delineated the Chinese domain as being isolated by an incredible waterway (the Yangzi) that filled in as the limit between two opponent countries at war; amid the rule of Byzantine Emperor Maurice (582Ã¢ÂÂ 602 AD) the northerners wearing "dark coats" vanquished the "red coats" of the south (dark being a particular shading worn by the general population of Shaanxi, area of the Sui capital Sui Chang'an, as indicated by the sixteenth century Persian voyager Hajji Mahomed, or Chaggi Memet). This record may relate to the triumph of the Chen line and reunification of China by Emperor Wen of Sui (r. 581Ã¢ÂÂ 604 AD). Simocatta names their ruler as "Taisson", which he asserted implied Son of God, either connecting to the Chinese "Tianzi" (Son of Heaven) or even the name of the contemporary ruler Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626 Ã¢ÂÂ 649 AD). Later medieval Europeans in China composed of it as two separate nations, with "Cathay" in the north and "Mangi" in the south, amid the period when the Yuan line driven by Mongol ruler Kublai Khan (r. 1260Ã¢ÂÂ 1294 AD) vanquished the Southern Song Dynasty.
