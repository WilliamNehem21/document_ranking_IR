The Royal Commission handed its findings and recommendations to the government in August 1913. It concluded that international relations were deteriorating in the Pacific and there was an increased risk of the NEI becoming involved in a war between western and Asian powers. As a result, the Commission argued that the Netherlands should develop a powerful fleet of warships to enforce Dutch neutrality and offer a credible defense should any nation attack the NEI or the home country itself. The Commission was very specific in its call for nine dreadnoughts, stating that they should be ships of , possessing a speed of , and mounting eight guns, sixteen , and twelve guns. It was also recommended that the fleet include six "torpedo cruisers"âbelieved by "Conways" to be closer to large destroyersâeight destroyers (a role which would be filled by the "Fret" class), eight torpedo boats (also already completed, though they were old), eight large submarines and two large minelayers. This ambitious plan was estimated to cost nearly Æ17,000,000 each year for the next 35 (until 1949), adding up to about Æ595,000,000; this would triple the Navy's budget. The Commission recommended that the cost of the fleet be partially offset by reducing the size of the ""Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger"" (Royal Dutch East Indies Army) as the Navy would provide a stronger defense from attack than the Army could.
