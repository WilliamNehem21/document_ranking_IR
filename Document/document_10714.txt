In March 1940, Hancock's Directorate of Works and Buildings was exchanged from the workplace of the Chief of the Air Staff to the recently shaped Organization and Equipment Branch under Air Marshal Richard Williams. Considered a key piece of the Air Force's extension amid the early piece of World WarÃÂ II, "Works and Bricks" immediately consumed all staff with structural designing and building background in the RAAF dynamic hold. As Director, Hancock was in charge of looking over and building up a military aerodrome at Evans Head, close to the Queensland and New South Wales outskirt, which ended up home to No.ÃÂ 1 Bombing and Gunnery School (No.ÃÂ 1 BAGS). Elevated to wing leader, he held direction of No.ÃÂ 1 BAGS, working Fairey Battle single-engined aircraft, from August 1940 until November 1941. He was elevated to acting gathering commander in April 1941. Delegated an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 1ÃÂ January 1942, Hancock ended up Assistant Director of Plans at Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area, that April. He was made Director of Arrangements at the Air Force's primary operational development, RAAF Command, when it was set up in September. In 1943Ã¢ÂÂ 44, he filled in as Staff Officer Administration for Western Area Command, which kept up two plane squadrons for hostile to submarine watches and two warrior squadrons to make preparations for conceivable assault on the territory by Japanese transporter borne air ship.
