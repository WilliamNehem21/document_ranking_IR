As the train leaves towards King's Cross, the video grouping in the compartments starts with Hagrid waving farewell outside of the window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can likewise been seen strolling down the train hallway, searching for a vacant compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts can be found out of sight. Not long after, the train enters a backwoods where centaurs are running. After leaving the backwoods, Hogwarts can be seen by and by out of sight. Fred and George Weasley show up, flying broomsticks and playing with firecrackers. The Hogwarts Express at that point enters a passage, after which riders wind up amidst a tempest and pass Malfoy Manor. The voyage at that point enters a second passage; Harry, Ron, and Hermione show up again in the train hall. As a bug slithers up the compartment entryway, Ron eats it and the trio keep on strolling on down the hall. After the passage the voyage proceeds into London going by a modern industrial facility and afterward a neighborhood. The Knight Bus at that point shows up; crushing among structures and contracting to go under a scaffold. As the transport heads out, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody welcomes travelers.
