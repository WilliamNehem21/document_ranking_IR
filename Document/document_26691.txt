Mukerji's career marked a turning point in 2002 when Yash Raj Films, a leading production company in India, cast her for two high-profile productions: "Mujhse Dosti Karoge!", a romantic comedy co-starring Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor, and "Saathiya", a remake of the Tamil box office hit "Alaipayuthey". "Mujhse Dosti Karoge!" was heavily promoted before release and proved a success internationally, but failed to earn profits in India. The romantic drama "Saathiya" proved a major turning point in her career, winning her a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress in addition to a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. Mukerji was director Shaad Ali's only choice to play the lead role; he said, "She was born to play this role. She looked the character. She looked vulnerable. She looked the right age. She was perfect". The film co-starred Vivek Oberoi, and her paternal aunt Tanuja, and proved an economic success. Mukerji's portrayal of Suhani Sharma, a medical student who deals with the tensions and discontent of being married at a young age, met with critical acclaim. The BBC stated that "Mukerji plays the character of a middle class girl with great conviction", and Udita Jhunjhunwala of "Mid Day" added, "Her expressions and acting are understated in a role that fits her like a glove."
