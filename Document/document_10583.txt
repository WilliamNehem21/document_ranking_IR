In spite of the fact that Bogue's proposition was eventually dismissed, a few components of the arrangement were freely considered by others, including a quick travel tram in Downtown Seattle. In 1920, City Engineer Arthur H. Dimmock distributed a report suggesting a quick travel framework for the city of Seattle, based on a cut-and-spread metro burrow under third Avenue from Virginia Street to Yesler Way. The line was to interface with surface and raised lines at Dexter Avenue, Olive Way and South Jackson Street, serving the areas of Fremont, Eastlake, Capitol Hill, and North Delridge in West Seattle. The proposition, which was required not to be followed up on for somewhere around 15 years, increased little help, and was known as a task of "simply scholarly enthusiasm" by Mayor Hugh M. Caldwell, who questioned that any fast travel proposition would be genuinely considered amid his term. The Seattle City Planning Commission proposed its very own fast travel framework in 1926, fixated on a raised line over Western Avenue with a conceivable parallel tram under third Avenue from Yesler Way to Pike Street. The Seattle Traffic Research Commission distributed a report in 1928 prescribing a metro under second Avenue from King Street Station to Pike Street as a major aspect of a more drawn out quick travel line serving the University District and Fremont. In the late 1950s, the Seattle Transit Commission proposed constructing a fast travel framework on the current option to proceed utilized by Interstate 5 between Tacoma, Seattle and Everett, with a two-station tram under fifth Avenue in Downtown Seattle.
