Van der Weyden's posture for the Magdalene is like various female religious figures painted by his lord Robert Campin or his workshop. It intently looks like, in subject and tone, the figure of Saint Barbara in Campin's "Werl Altarpiece", and furthermore the Virgin in an "Annunciation" credited to Campin in Brussels. Ordinarily for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has a nearly etched look, and the components of her garments are passed on in moment detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval workmanship the Magdalene is normally portrayed exposed (at times clad just in her long hair) or in lavishly shaded dress, ordinarily red, blue or green, never in white. Her robe is firmly pulled beneath her bust by a blue band, while the gold brocade of her underskirt is enhanced by a jeweled stitch. Craftsmanship commentator Charles Darwent saw that the Magdalen's past as a "fallen lady" is alluded to by the rest in the hide coating of her dress and the few strands of hair free from her cloak. Darwent stated, "Even her fingers, missing mindedly surrounded, recommend fulfillment. In her blend of immaculateness and suggestion, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels like everything is ok; yet she isn't." In the medieval period, hide symbolized female sexuality and was usually connected with the Magdalene. Medieval antiquarian Philip Crispin clarifies that specialists, for example, Memling and Matsys frequently depicted the Magdalen in hides and notes that she "is observably wearing hide lined articles of clothing in "The Magdalen Reading" by Rogier van der Weyden".
