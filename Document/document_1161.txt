Amid the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Chinese patriots laid attack to the outside government offices in Peking and killed Baron Clemens von Ketteler, the German diplomat. The far reaching brutality against Westerners in China prompted a partnership among Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those fighters who were in China at the time were excessively very few to crush the Boxers; in Peking there was a power of marginally in excess of 400 officers and infantry from the militaries of the eight European forces. At the time, the essential German military power in China was the East Asia Squadron, which comprised of the secured cruisers "Kaiserin Augusta", , and , the little cruisers and , and the gunboats and . There was likewise a German 500-man separation in Taku; joined with the other countries' units the power numbered approximately 2,100 men. Driven by the British Admiral Edward Seymour, these men endeavored to achieve Peking however were compelled to stop in Tientsin because of overwhelming opposition. Accordingly, the Kaiser decided an expeditionary power would be sent to China to strengthen the East Asia Squadron. The campaign included "Brandenburg" and her three sisters, six cruisers, ten tankers, three torpedo water crafts, and six regiments of marines, under the direction of "Generalfeldmarschall" (General Field Marshal) Alfred von Waldersee.
