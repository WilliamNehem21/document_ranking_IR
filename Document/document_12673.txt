Roosevelt did not at first react to Long's cases, purportedly considering the writer "excessively little amusement to shoot twice." He did, in any case, keep in touch with Burroughs that he had "no fight with Mr. Long for the ends he draws from the realities. Our squabble with him is on the grounds that he imagines the actualities." Burroughs continued to freely guard the President against Long's assaults, censuring him and the master observers Long created to help his cases about the occasions and practices he delineated in his works. Papers around the nation ceaselessly distributed meetings with the two naturalists, while comedic delineations of the discussion and its members were getting to be well known with perusers. One such farce alluded to a non-existent book called "How to Tell the Animals from the Wild Flowers", including a delineation which portrayed a human "Dandy Lion" with a stick, top cap and monocle. This joke enlivened a comparably sarcastic book, which was distributed under the title "How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers"; a gathering of amusing outlines and ballads by physicist and kids' writer Robert Williams Wood, the work included pairings of winged creatures and their relating blossoms, underscoring their visual similitudes. Making a not at all subtle reference to the much advanced contention encompassing those writers who were currently called "nature fakers", the book finishes up: "I have uninhibitedly drawn upon/crafted by Gray and Audubon,/Avoiding however the continuous goofs/Of the individuals who contemplate Nature's miracles."
