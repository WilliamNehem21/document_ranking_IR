Crafted by Mario Vargas Llosa are seen as both pioneer and postmodernist books. In spite of the fact that there is still much discussion over the contrasts among pioneer and postmodernist writing, artistic researcher M. Keith Booker asserts that the trouble and specialized intricacy of Vargas Llosa's initial works, for example, "The Green House" and "Discussion in the Cathedral", are plainly components of the cutting edge novel. Moreover, these prior books all convey a specific earnestness of demeanorÃ¢ÂÂanother vital characterizing part of pioneer craftsmanship. On the other hand, his later books, for example, "Skipper Pantoja and the Special Service", "Auntie Julia and the Scriptwriter", "The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta", and "The Storyteller" ("El hablador") seem to pursue a postmodernist method of composing. These books have an a lot lighter, ludicrous, and comic tone, attributes of postmodernism. Looking at two of Vargas Llosa's books, "The Green House" and "Skipper Pantoja and the Special Service", Booker examines the complexity among innovation and postmodernism found in the essayist's works: while the two books investigate the topic of prostitution just as the operations of the Peruvian military, Booker calls attention to that the previous is gravely genuine though the last is strangely funny.
