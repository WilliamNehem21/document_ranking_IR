A couple of months after Edgardo's introduction to the world, the Mortara family connected with another worker: Anna "Nina" Morisi, a 18-year-old Catholic from the close-by town of San Giovanni in Persiceto. Like all her family and companions, Morisi was uneducated. She had gone to the city, following her three sisters, to work and set aside extra cash towards a settlement so she could in the end wed. In mid 1855, Morisi wound up pregnant, as was normal for unmarried hirelings in Bologna as of now. Numerous businesses would basically sack young ladies in such circumstances, yet the Mortaras did not; they paid for Morisi to go through the most recent four months of her pregnancy at a maternity specialist's home and convey the kid, at that point had her arrival to work with them. To shield Morisi and themselves from humiliation, they told neighbors that their house keeper was debilitated and recovering at home. Morisi gave her infant to a halfway house, as the Papal States required unwed moms to do, at that point came back to work with the Mortaras. She stayed there until she was enlisted by another Bologna family in 1857; not long after that she wedded and moved back to San Giovanni in Persiceto.
