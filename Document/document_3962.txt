The designs for the attack of Borneo advanced impressively amid April. At first, the hostile was to begin on 23 April with the arrival of a detachment from the sixth Division on the island of Tarakan, off the east shore of Borneo. The ninth Division would then strike Balikpapan pursued by Banjarmasin in south-east Borneo. These positions would be utilized to help the intrusion of Java by the rest of I Corps. After the assault on Java was dropped, it was chosen to utilize two detachments of the seventh Division at Brunei Bay, and I Corps led further arrangements on this premise. In any case, on 17 April General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (to which I Corps detailed) swapped the jobs of the seventh and ninth Divisions. In like manner, the last arrangement for the assault against Borneo determined that one of the ninth Division's detachments would arrive on Tarakan island on 29 April (later deferred to 1 May), with the rest of the division to attack the Brunei Bay zone on 23 May. The seventh Division was booked to attack Balikpapan on 1 July. The Borneo crusade was assigned the "Oboe" period of the Allied hostile through the southern Philippines towards the Netherlands East Indies, and the arrivals at Tarakan, Brunei Bay and Balikpapan were assigned Operations Oboe One, Six and Two individually.
