The holotype skull of "Livyatan" was about long. Like other raptorial sperm whales, "Livyatan" had a wide hole in the middle of the transient fossae on the sides of the skull and the zygomatic procedures on the facade of the skull, demonstrating a substantial space for holding solid fleeting muscles, which are the most dominant muscles between the skull and the jaw. The nose was vigorous, thick, and moderately short, which enabled it to clasp down more enthusiastically and better handle battling prey. The left and right premaxillae on the nose likely did not converge at the tip of the nose, however the premaxillae took up a large portion of the front end of the nose. Not at all like in the cutting edge sperm whale, the premaxillae achieved the sides of the nose. The upper jaw was thick, particularly halfway through the nose. The nose was hilter kilter, with the correct maxilla in the upper jaw winding up somewhat arched towards the back of the nose, and the left maxilla ending up marginally inward towards the back of the nose. The vomer achieved the tip of the nose, and was somewhat inward, diminishing in thickness from the back to the front. An abrupt thickening in the center left half of the vomer may demonstrate the area of the nose plug muscles. Every mandible in the lower jaw was higher than it was wide, with a bigger hole in the middle of the two than in the advanced sperm whale. The mandibular symphysis which associates the two parts of the mandibles amidst the lower jaw was unfused. The condyloid procedure, which interfaces the lower jaw to the skull, was situated close to the base of the mandible like other sperm whales.
