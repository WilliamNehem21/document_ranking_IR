Before leaving, Rutherford's administration had called a Royal Commission into the Alberta and Great Waterways undertaking, and this commission had not revealed when that Sifton got down to business. Among that and the proroguing of the governing body, the new Premier appreciated a quiet that kept going until November 10, when the lawmaking body reconvened. Preservationist pioneer Edward Michener assaulted the administration's discourse from the position of authority for neglecting to submit itself on railroad approach and assaulted Sifton for neglecting to consider a general race or look for the certainty of the governing body amid his first half year in office. Meanwhile, Sifton was confronting a rupture in his own gathering on the railroad question. Numerous Liberals from the south of the region, including Sifton himself, felt slanted to desert the development of "pioneer" railroads, (for example, the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) intended to hurry the settlement of the region's emptier zones, and focus just on those interfacing real populace focuses. Individuals from the north of the area, who involved a large portion of the Liberal council, deviated, and were energetic in their request that the A&GW be fabricated. Indeed, even among this last gathering there were divisions: a few Liberals concurred with the Conservatives that the railroad ought to be straightforwardly worked by the legislature, while others, including Cross, supported an association with a "dependable organization". These divisions were not quieted by the arrival of the commission's report, whose larger part denounced Rutherford and Cross for misguided thinking even as it reasoned that there was deficient proof to find that they had occupied with ill-advised conduct.
