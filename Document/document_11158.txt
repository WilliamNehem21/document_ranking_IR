The Beast of Exmoor is a cryptozoological feline (see apparition feline) that is accounted for to meander Exmoor. There have been various reports of onlooker sightings. The BBC calls it "the acclaimed yet-subtle mammoth of Exmoor". Sightings were first announced during the 1970s in spite of the fact that it wound up infamous in 1983, when a South Molton rancher professed to have lost more than 100 sheep over the course of about three months, every one of them evidently killed by fierce throat wounds. In light of these reports Royal Marine Commandos were conveyed from bases in the West Country to look for the legendary brute from clandestine perception focuses. Following a half year no sightings had been made by the Royal Marines and the arrangements were finished. Depictions of its colouration extend from dark to tan or dim. It is perhaps a cougar or dark panther which was discharged after a law was passed in 1976 making it unlawful for them to be kept in imprisonment outside zoos. In 2006, the British Big Cats Society detailed that a skull found by a Devon rancher was that of a panther; in any case, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states, "In view of the proof, Defra does not trust that there are huge felines living in the wild in England."
