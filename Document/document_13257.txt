A few commentators noticed a complexity between the track's verses and generation. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork expressed that the melody "differentiates a monster snare and ensemble with smart sections loaded up with unobtrusively particular, regularly unusual symbolism: of [Lo] having her supper in the bath, getting plastered munchies, tempting fathers on play areas". Chris Jordan of "Asbury Park Press" portrayed "Propensities (Stay High)" as a "synth-based pop melody with a broad tune", however noticed that the expressive substance of the track was like that of Rock 'n' Roll music. The vocalist herself expressed that: "You can feel the verses and the dull and pitiful yet on the off chance that you consolidate it with, conveys a little to the dim cleverness too. I like the thing of moving along and after that tuning in to what I'm really saying."
