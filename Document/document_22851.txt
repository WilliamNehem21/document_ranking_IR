Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan's "The Dark Knight" (2008), the sequel to "Batman Begins", before starring in "The Edge of Love"âabout a love quadrangle involving the poet Dylan Thomasâwith Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and Matthew Rhys. Murphy also made a debut appearance in another mediumâon a postage stamp: in July 2008, the Irish Post Office, An Post, released a series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of films recently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still from "The Wind That Shakes the Barley". In 2009, Murphy starred opposite rock singer Feist and actor David Fox in "The Water", directed by Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene. The 15-minute Canadian short film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to the end. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene and the prospect of making a silent movie, which he considered to be the "hardest test for any actor". Murphy also starred in "Perrier's Bounty", a crime dramedy from the makers of "Intermission", in which he portrayed a petty criminal on the run from a gangster played by Brendan Gleeson.
