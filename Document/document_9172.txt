In November 1915, "KÃÂ¶rÃÂ¶s" and different screens were gathered at Ruschuk, Bulgaria. The situation of Romania was questionable; the Central Powers knew that the Romanians were consulting to enter the war on the contradicting side of the Entente. To secure the Danube's outskirt among Romania and Bulgaria, the flotilla built up a shielded base in the Belene Canal. At the point when the Romanians entered the war on 27 August 1916, the screens were again at Rustschuk, and were promptly assaulted by three extemporized torpedo vessels working out of the Romanian waterway port of Giurgiu. The torpedoes that were terminated missed the screens however hit a lighter stacked with fuel. The Second Monitor Division, comprising of "KÃÂ¶rÃÂ¶s" and three different screens, was entrusted with shelling Giurgiu. This assault set flame to oil stockpiling tanks just as the railroad station and magazines, and sank a few Romanian lighters. While the assault was in progress, the First Monitor Division escorted supply transports back to the Belene mooring. The "KÃÂ¶rÃÂ¶s" and her colleagues at that point wrecked two Romanian watch water crafts and an extemporized minelayer on their way back to Belene. This was trailed by raids of the screens both east and west of Belene, amid which both Turnu MÃÂgurele and Zimnicea were shelled.
