In contrast to numerous popular scholars, Kafka is once in a while cited by others. Rather, he is noted more for his dreams and point of view. Shimon Sandbank, an educator, scholarly faultfinder, and author, recognizes Kafka as having affected Jorge Luis Borges, Albert Camus, EugÃÂ¨ne Ionesco, J. M. Coetzee and Jean-Paul Sartre. A "Monetary Times" abstract faultfinder credits Kafka with affecting JosÃÂ© Saramago, and Al Silverman, an author and proofreader, expresses that J. D. Salinger wanted to peruse Kafka's works. In 1999 a board of trustees of 99 creators, researchers, and artistic commentators positioned and the second and ninth most critical German-language books of the twentieth century. Sandbank contends that in spite of Kafka's inescapability, his baffling style still can't seem to be imitated. Neil Christian Pages, an educator of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Binghamton University who has practical experience in Kafka's works, says Kafka's impact rises above writing and artistic grant; it impacts visual expressions, music, and mainstream culture. Harry Steinhauer, a teacher of German and Jewish writing, says that Kafka "has had a more dominant effect on proficient society than some other author of the twentieth century". Brod said that the twentieth century will one day be known as the "time of Kafka".
