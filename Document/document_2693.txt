"Quiet Alarm" does not contain a singular expressive focus and essentially watches individuals' lives. Okereke needed to leave singular audience members space to make their own decisions, yet has conceded that the record "works in the domain of social governmental issues". A significant part of the songwriting is roused by the style of confession booth verse writers like Anne Sexton and artists Thom Yorke and BjÃÂ¶rk. All in all, "Quiet Alarm" endeavors to clarify an existential pointlessness throughout everyday life. Looking back, Okereke noted subjects of "vulnerability and exhaustion" in light of the collection's attention on how he was feeling between the agesÃÂ ofÃÂ 18ÃÂ andÃÂ 20. Teacher John Sutherland has called attention to scholarly components, frequently like Sylvia Plath's work, in the lyricist's composition. Talking about the opening track "Like Eating Glass", he clarified, "It strikes me that whoever did the verses more likely than not read a portion of her work. It has the equivalent rather spiked, astounding symbolism. It could sit decently serenely in a verse treasury." The repetitive line "We have crosses on our eyes" is enlivened via animation characters who have crosses on their eyes when they bite the dust. Okereke attempted to pass on the emotions in a falling flat relationship, "of being totally disorientated", utilizing youth allegories.
