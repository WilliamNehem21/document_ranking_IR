The Earl of Dorset, the ruler's cousin, got care of the de Ros bequests. Before he acquired, John made a trip to France with the new ruler in 1415 and battled at the Battle of Agincourt at seventeen years old or eighteen. He kicked the bucket in 1421 at the Battle of BaugÃÂ© with the lord's sibling, Thomas, Duke of Clarence and Sir Gilbert Umfraville. William de Ros' second child Thomas was just fourteen at John's demise, and battled with Thomas, Earl of Salisbury at the Siege of OrlÃÂ©ans in 1428; he passed on after an engagement outside Paris two years after the fact. Thomas' beneficiary (additionally named Thomas) acquired the lordship as ninth noble and assumed an essential job in the Wars of the Roses battling for the Lancastrian ruler, Henry VI; he was executed after his thrashing by the Yorkists at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor in 1464. De Ros' significant other, Margaret Fitzalan, lived until 1438. She had gotten her dower by February 1415 and, at the marriage of Henry V to Katherine of Valois in 1420, entered the new ruler's administration as a woman in-pausing. Margaret went to Katherine's crowning ritual and headed out with her to see Henry in France two years after the fact.
