The design essayist Geoffrey Tyack has composed that Nuffield College was Oxford's "most critical engineering undertaking of the quick post-war years". Assessments about the engineering benefits of the school have shifted, albeit most have been horrible. The writers of a 1961 booklet on the engineering of present day Oxford said that it was "Oxford's greatest landmark to infertile response". The Cotswold style was "taken ridiculously outside of any relevant connection to the issue at hand and hardheartedly extended", and did not "blend with the awkward pinnacle", while the tower "[perched] uneasilyÃÂ ... regardless of its detailed base". An anonymous writer wrote in "The Times" in 1959 that the principle structures of the quadrangles were "to some degree strangely married to little bowls which compellingly propose a Lilliputian Versailles". A similar essayist said that the pinnacle rose "Manhattan-wise for 10 stories through the twentieth century, just to have a minor tower, got away from the fifteenth, push through its top to take the last giggle". Dwindle Sager, as well, suspected that the "tall building library" could "without much of a stretch remain on the Hudson". Sir Howard Colvin said that the "utilitarian capacity" of the pinnacle "concurred sick with its unique fancy reason", and that the draftsmen had "neglected to locate an acceptable arrangement" to the "dull consistency of fenestration". Of the flÃÂ¨che, Colvin said that it "makes its commitment to the Oxford horizon with no unmistakable reference to recorded point of reference". Geoffrey Tyack likewise loathed the pinnacle, depicting it as "a gawky structure" that was "lit by a repetitive cluster of windows punched out of the divider surface"; be that as it may, he suspected the lobby was "a powerful reinterpretation of the conventional university design".
