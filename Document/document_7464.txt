"Australia"s ship's organization had reliably experienced low assurance since the battlecruiser entered administration, and the extent of "Australia"s mariners who were put on disciplinary charges amid World War I was among the most astounding in the RAN. A considerable lot of the Australian mariners were scraping under the seriousness of maritime order and what they saw as exorbitant discipline for minor ruptures; one model was of a mariner who was accused of departure, detained for three months, and lost all compensation for remaining out past the point of no return on Armistice Day. Elements which added to low spirit and poor control included dissatisfaction at not partaking in the Battle of Jutland, high rates of disease, constrained open doors for leave, delays or complete absence of conceded pay, and low quality sustenance. The continuation of severe wartime schedules and control after the peace negotiation baffled the ship's group. There was additionally the observation that "Australia"s British faculty were being advanced quicker than their Australian partners and were ruling administration positions. The battlecruiser's entry in Fremantle on 28 May was met with broad friendliness, which was responded where conceivable by the mariners with solicitations and voyages through their vessel. There were open doors for shore leave, yet these were restricted as "Australia" was just in port for three days, and needed to cruise from the get-go 1 June for Melbourne.
