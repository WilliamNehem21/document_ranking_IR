MacArthur in this manner suggested that Australian troops calm the American battalions on New Britain, Bougainville and New Guinea. Be that as it may, MacArthur recoiled from Blamey's proposition to supplant the seven American divisions with only seven Australian units, bringing about the sixth Division being utilized too. The bigger battalions allowed hostile activities, and requested them if the sixth Division was to be liberated for business somewhere else. These activities excited extensive analysis in light of the fact that they were pointless, that the troops ought to have been utilized somewhere else, and that the Army's hardware and coordinations were lacking. Blamey vivaciously protected his forceful strategy to diminish the skirted Japanese battalions and free the regular citizen populace, however some felt that he went excessively far in putting his case openly in a national radio communicate. He was likewise condemned for not investing enough energy in forward territories, in spite of the fact that he invested the greater part his time outside Australia in 1944, and between April 1944 and April 1945 gone via air, via ocean and via land. Blamey asked that the seventh Division not be sent to Balikpapan, a task that he viewed as superfluous. On this event, he was not bolstered by the administration, and the activity proceeded as arranged.
