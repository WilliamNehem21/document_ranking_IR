Lewis passed on in 1893, and in the following decade the DL&C assembled no new lines. Nonetheless, a gathering of financial specialists purchased the organization, including the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis' beneficiaries. The primary section of the line into downtown Dayton was finished in late 1902, diverging the fundamental line at Hempstead and completion at Lambeth, site of the Dayton State Hospital. Unfit to get an establishment from Dayton, and still unrewarding, the DL&C entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at abandonment in April 1907 and revamped in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had composed the new organization prevailing with regards to getting the establishment, and sold the stock to another gathering of financial specialists in January 1909. Development was restarted in April, and in November the branch achieved the crossing point of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the National Cash Register plant. At last, in the wake of finishing the cuts and fills required along the east bank of the Great Miami River, the DL&C opened its new principle line in 1912, to a traveler stop on the north side of Washington Street, a few squares south and west of the city's fundamental Union Station. A cargo warehouse was found just toward the north, at Eaker Street, and just past was an exchange track (not part of the first line) associating with the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (B&O framework) and, through that line, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Panhandle Route, some portion of the Pennsylvania framework).
