In London in 886 Alfred had gotten the formal accommodation of "all the English individuals that were not under subjection to the Danes", and from that point he embraced the title "Anglorum Saxonum rex" (King of the Anglo-Saxons), which is utilized in his later sanctions and everything except two of Edward's. This is seen by Keynes as "the innovation of a completely new and particular country", covering both West Saxons and Mercians, which was acquired by Edward with the help of Mercians at the West Saxon court, of whom the most critical was Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 903 Edward issued a few contracts concerning land in Mercia. Three of them are seen by the Mercian pioneers and their little girl ÃÂlfwynn, and they all contain an explanation that ÃÂthelred and ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d "then held rulership and control over the race of the Mercians, under the previously mentioned lord". Different contracts were issued by the Mercian pioneers which did not contain any affirmation of Edward's position, yet they didn't issue their very own coinage. This perspective on Edward's status is acknowledged by Martin Ryan, who expresses that ÃÂthelred and ÃÂthelflÃÂ¦d had "an impressive at the end of the day subordinate offer of imperial expert" in English Mercia.
