Howard registered to the University of Michigan and joined his individual first year recruits for the 1991Ã¢ÂÂ 92 Michigan Wolverines in shaping a gathering that wound up known as the Fab Five. He likewise joined future NBA identities Eric Riley and Rob Pelinka. As Michigan observed Midnight Madness on October 15, 1991, there was at that point talk that something like four of the five rookies would begin before the season finished. (The five in the long run began in a consolidated 304 of a conceivable 350 man-diversions among them amid their initial two seasons.) Early in his green bean season, Howard began in certain amusements and fell off the seat in others for the exceptionally appraised Wolverines. After some time, he won a beginning job from Riley. In Michigan's first matchup against Illinois, Howard scored 13ÃÂ points and denied Thomas the ball reliably enough to hold him to 8ÃÂ shots. His greatest commitment in the amusement was getting his hand on a free ball to constrain a bounce ball with 16ÃÂ seconds left and Michigan driving by just three points. In the Elite Eight round of the 1992 NCAA Men's DivisionÃÂ I Basketball Tournament, Michigan confronted a Jimmy Jackson-drove Ohio State Buckeyes group that had beaten them twice amid the standard season by twofold digit edges. Michigan won the rematch, amid which the Fab Five scored everything except two of the Wolverines' focuses.
