The success was not pursued with more achievement and the group performed gravely in the accompanying seasons. At the AGM in October 1982, it was uncovered that the club were in ÃÂ£1.6ÃÂ million of obligation, for the most part due to heightening wages and building costs, including the development of the North Stand. Toward the finish of November Ron and Donald Bendall left the board to be supplanted by Doug Ellis, who purchased Ron Bendall's 42% shareholding. In January 1983, Villa beat Barcelona 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1 on total to win the 1982 UEFA Super Cup. Barton stayed in control for two seasons after the European Cup triumph, however was sacked toward the finish of the 1983Ã¢ÂÂ 84 season regardless of Villa completing tenth in the First Division and achieving the semi-finals of the League Cup. Shrewsbury Town director Graham Turner was acquired as his successor. Turner was unfit to switch the decay, and in 1986 Villa barely stayed away from assignment to the Second Division. A dreary begin to the accompanying season saw Turner sacked part of the way through September. Billy McNeill was contracted in his place, however was unfit to spare Villa from transfer. They were consigned to the Second Division only five years subsequent to winning the European Cup. McNeill turned in his notice and moved to Celtic when the season finished. Executive Ellis convinced Watford director Graham Taylor to assume control over the reins and begin remaking the group.
