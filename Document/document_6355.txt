The ruler was missing in France in 1159, and Rhys accepted the open door to assault Dyfed and afterward to lay attack to Carmarthen, which was spared by a help compel driven by Earl Reginald of Cornwall. Rhys withdrew to Cantref Mawr, where a military driven by five barons, the Earls of Cornwall, Gloucester, Hertford, Pembroke and Salisbury, walked against him. The dukes were helped by Cadwaladr, sibling of Owain Gwynedd, and Owain's children, Hywel and Cynan. Anyway they were compelled to pull back and a dÃÂ©tente was orchestrated. In 1162, Rhys again endeavored to recoup a portion of his lost grounds, and caught Llandovery chÃÂ¢teau. The next year Henry II came back to England following a nonattendance of four years and arranged for another intrusion of Deheubarth. Rhys met the lord to examine terms and was obliged to give more prisoners, including another child, Maredudd. He was then seized and taken to England as a prisoner. Henry seems to have been questionable how to manage Rhys, yet following half a month chose to free him and enable him to govern Cantref Mawr. Rhys was brought to show up before Henry at Woodstock to do praise together with Owain Gwynedd and Malcolm IV of Scotland.
