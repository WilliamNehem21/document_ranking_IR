The time each car set on the first day determined the time they set off on the second day, hence Szisz's first-day time of 5Â hours and 45Â minutes meant he started at 5:45Â am. Following the same principle, ClÃ©ment began at 6:11Â am and Nazzaro at 6:26Â am. This method ensured that positions on the road directly reflected the race standings. A horse, which had been trained before the race to be accustomed to the loud noise of an engine starting, towed each competitor out of parc fermÃ© to the start line. As neither driver nor mechanic could work on their car until they had been given the signal to start the day's running, Szisz and ClÃ©ment began by heading directly to the pit lane to change tyres and service their cars. ClÃ©ment completed his stop more quickly than Szisz, and Nazzaro did not stop at all, and so ClÃ©ment closed his time gap to Szisz and Nazzaro closed on ClÃ©ment. Jenatzy and Lancia, who were both suffering eye problems from the first day, had intended to retire from the race and be relieved by their reserve drivers. As planned, "Burton" took over Jenatzy's car, but Lancia was forced to resume in his street clothes when his replacement driver could not be found when the car was due to start.
