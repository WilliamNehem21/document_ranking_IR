In Croatian convention, objects of two unique sorts are alluded to as "badnjak". The principal type incorporates leaved branches cut from Turkey oaks or hazel trees, up to long with whatever number catkins as could be expected under the circumstances. Such a branch used to be set on Christmas Eve morning over the house entryway, under the overhang, or on the rooftop, and had a stylish job. The other sort incorporates logs cut for the most part from oak trunks. At night the family used to ceremonially carry three such logs into the house and consume them on the hearth. These practices are never again performed, yet in certain spots a changed type of badnjak is utilized: a cross is cut into the bark of bits of kindling which are singed in kitchen stoves on Christmas Eve. In Bulgaria, the most youthful man of the family goes on the Eve into a backwoods to chop down an oak, elm, or pear tree, which will be utilized as the "badnik" (ÃÂ±ÃÂÃÂ´ÃÂ½ÃÂ¸ÃÂº). After the man carries it into the house, an opening is exhausted in one end of the "badnik" and loaded up with wine, cooking oil, and incense. The opening is stopped, and that finish of the log is wrapped with a white material fabric before the "badnik" is happily scorched on the hearth.
