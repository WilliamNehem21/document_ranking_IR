Sherman was brought up in a Roman Catholic family unit, in spite of the fact that he later left the congregation, refering with the impact of the Civil War on his religious perspectives. As indicated by a story that might be legend, Sherman was sanctified through water in the Ewing home by a Dominican cleric, who named him William for the holy person's day: perhaps June 25, the dining experience day of Saint William of Montevergine. The story is challenged, nonetheless. Sherman wrote in his "Journals" that his dad named him William Tecumseh; Sherman was immersed by a Presbyterian serve as a baby and given the name William around then.
