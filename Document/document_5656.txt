In the content that was sent to planned on-screen characters and chiefs, Lester and Angela engaged in sexual relations; when of shooting, Ball had modified the scene to the last form. Ball at first rebuked guidance from others that he change the content, feeling they were being strict; the last impulse to adjust the scene originated from DreamWorks' then-president Walter Parkes. He persuaded Ball by demonstrating that in Greek folklore, the saint "has a snapshot of revelation beforeÃÂ [...] catastrophe happens". Ball later said his displeasure when composing the main draft had blinded him to the possibility that Lester expected to deny sex with Angela to finish his enthusiastic adventureÃ¢ÂÂto accomplish reclamation. Jinks and Cohen asked Ball not to adjust the scene immediately, as they felt it is improper to make changes to the content before a chief had been contracted. Early drafts likewise incorporated a flashback to Col. Fitts' administration in the Marines, a succession that unequivocally settled his gay leanings. In affection with another Marine, Col. Fitts sees the man kick the bucket and comes to trust that he is being rebuffed for the "wrongdoing" of being gay. Ball expelled the succession since it didn't fit the structure of the remainder of the filmÃ¢ÂÂCol. Fitts was the main character to have a flashbackÃ¢ÂÂand in light of the fact that it expelled the component of shock from Col. Fitts' later go at Lester. Ball said he needed to compose it for his very own advantage to comprehend the end result for Col. Fitts, however all that stayed in later drafts was subtext.
