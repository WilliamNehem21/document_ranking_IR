Mary Gnaedinger was the proofreader of "Acclaimed Fantastic Mysteries" for each of the 81 issues. The magazine was propelled as an every other month in September 1939, and was changed over to month to month from the second issue, in November 1939. The May 1940 issue was trailed by August 1940, which started an every other month arrangement that endured until June 1942, which started another month to month succession that went through the finish of 1942. The following issue, March 1943, was trailed by a September issue that initiated a quarterly grouping that kept running until December 1945, which started another every other month run. This kept going until the last issue in June 1953 with just two inconsistencies: October 1950 was trailed by January 1951, and July 1951 was trailed by October 1951. "Well known Fantastic Mysteries" was distributed by the Munsey Corporation until the finish of 1942, and by Popular Publications, from that point. The magazine was at first 128 pages in length. This was sliced to 112 pages with the October 1940 issue, and after that came back to 128 pages for the June 1941 issue. From June 1942 to March 1944 the page tally was 144; it was sliced to 132 in June 1944 and again to 112 in January 1951, where it stayed until the finish of the run. The cost was 15 pennies all through, aside from the period from October 1940 to April 1941 amid which it was 10 pennies. "Well known Fantastic Mysteries" started as a mash, and stayed in that position all through its keep running aside from a short trial in 1951 in which it was decreased to extensive summary size.
