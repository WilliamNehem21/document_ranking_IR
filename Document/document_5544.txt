The premaxilla of "Paranthodon" is inadequate, however the front procedure is crooked and bends ventrally. This is like in "Miragaia", "Huayangosaurus", the ankylosaur "Silvisaurus", and "Heterodontosaurus", yet dissimilar to in "Chungkingosaurus", "Stegosaurus", "Edmontonia" and "Lesothosaurus". The premaxilla additionally comes up short on any teeth, as in each stegosaur aside from "Huayangosaurus" where the premaxilla is safeguarded. Like in "Huayangosaurus" yet not "Stegosaurus" or "Hesperosaurus", the nasal fenestra faces anterolaterally, being obvious from the front and sides. The naris is longer than wide like in different stegosaurs, and furthermore has a smooth interior surface, so it was undoubtedly a basic entry. The maxilla is generally triangular, as in most different thyreophorans. The tooth push is level in horizontal view, and in ventral view it is crooked. "Stegosaurus" and "Huayangosaurus" have a straight tooth push in ventral view, in spite of the fact that "Scelidosaurus" and "Jiangjunosaurus" don't. The maxilla of "Paranthodon" jam the tooth line, and demonstrates that there is next to zero shade. This contrasts from ankylosaurians, where there is a lot of shade of the maxilla. Like in "Stegosaurus" and "Silvisaurus" there is a diastema (hole in the tooth push) on the maxilla before the tooth push. The back maxilla is deficient so there is no data thought about the jugal or lacrimal contact. "Paranthodon" has an extend, dorsally arched nasal, as in most different stegosaurs. There are thickened edges at the edges of the nasals. The protected segment of the nasal does not contact the premaxilla or maxilla.
