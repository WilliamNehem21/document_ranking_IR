The importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife. However, the notion of a "cruel" Susanâas promoted by her romantic rivalâhas been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close. Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In "The Emily Dickinson Journal" Lena Koski wrote, "Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings." She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, "Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss meÂ ... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have youâthat the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fastÂ ... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language." The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film "Wild Nights with Emily".
