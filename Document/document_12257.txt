Quinn was "Odd Tales"' most productive writer, with a long-running arrangement of tales about a criminologist, Jules de Grandin, who examined extraordinary occasions, and for some time he was the most prevalent author in the magazine. Other normal supporters included Paul Ernst, David H. Keller, Greye La Spina, Hugh B. Cavern, and Frank Owen, who composed dreams set in a fanciful form of the Far East. C.L. Moore's story "Shambleau", her first deal, showed up in "Strange Tales" in November 1933; Price visited the "Unusual Tales" workplaces not long after Wright read the composition for it, and reviews that Wright was so eager about the story that he shut the workplace, proclaiming it "C.L. Moore day". The story was very generally welcomed by perusers, and Moore's work, including her tales about Jirel of Joiry and Northwest Smith, showed up only in "Unusual Tales" throughout the following three years.As well as fiction, Wright printed a generous measure of verse, with no less than one ballad incorporated into generally issues. Initially this frequently included reprints of lyrics, for example, Edgar Allan Poe's "El Dorado", however soon the greater part of the verse was unique, with commitments originating from Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith, among numerous others. Lovecraft's commitments included ten of his "Parasites from Yuggoth" lyrics, a progression of pieces on unusual subjects that he wrote in 1930.
