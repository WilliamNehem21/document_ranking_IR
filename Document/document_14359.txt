"Enraged" stacked 55 flying machine, for the most part crated Hawker Hurricane warriors of No. 73 Squadron RAF, in Liverpool on 7 November 1940 cruising for Takoradi, Gold Coast on 15 November 1940 where they were taken off or off-stacked on 27 November with a definitive goal of Egypt. Amid this time she held just six Skuas of 801 Squadron for her own insurance. "Irate" was back in Liverpool by 15 December where she set out 40 additional Hurricanes for Takoradi. She cruised on 21 December 1940 uniting with Convoy WS5A and the little transporter "Argus". The experienced the caravan on 25 December 1940, yet little harm was caused by "Chief naval officer Hipper" before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser in light of the fact that the Swordfish were set out in "Argus" with bombs that they couldn't convey and their torpedoes were on board "Angry". After "Furious"s Skuas had taken off to look for "Cooler", space was made to arrive the Swordfish to stack the torpedoes, however the Skuas couldn't find "Chief naval officer Hipper" as a result of the poor perceivability. "Enraged" came to Takoradi on 10 January 1941 touching base back in Britain on 5 February 1940 where she was given a concise refit. She made another ship excursion to Takoradi on 4 March, conveying 12 Fairey Fulmars of 807 Squadron and six Swordfish of 825 Squadron for self-protection.
