He had just been compelled to acquire cash utilizing future profits and sovereignties as security, leaving his family with some trouble in thinking of assets to keep up his home. Haynes' domain was left to his significant other who kept on living in the family manor until her own demise from a stroke in August 1933. The family resources were circulated among Bernice and March who independently managed their segment of the family's advantages. Walk acquired the family manor, yet sold it in 1957 to Martin J. Caserio, General Manager of the Delco Electronics Division of the General Motors Company who lived there until he was moved to Detroit in 1964.
