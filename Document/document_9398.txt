Being a cimolodont, "Catopsbaatar" did not have I1 incisors. The I2 upper-front incisors of "Catopsbaatar" were strong and had a forcefully restricted band of polish. The two incisors met marginally towards the center, contacting one another. The littler I3 incisor behind was cone-formed. The alveolus (tooth attachment) of "Catopsbaatar's" I3 incisor was shaped by the premaxilla, instead of the premaxilla and maxilla (not at all like in "Tombaatar"). The front upper premolars P1 and P3 were just present in adolescents (deciduous), vanishing (with their alveoli) in more seasoned people. P1 seems to have had two cusps, was single-established, and had a cone-like, obtuse crown. P3 was single-established and littler than P1. The cusp recipe of the P4 premolar was 5Ã¢ÂÂ4:1, the focal cusp being the biggest. The P4 of "Catopsbaatar" was practically trapezoidal fit as a fiddle (not at all like in "Djadochtatherium" and "Kryptobaatar", where it is sickle formed), littler, and lacking edges. "Catopsbaatar" additionally contrasted by just having three upper premolars, without the P2 (a component imparted to "Tombaatar"). Different warm blooded animals for the most part develop the loss of teeth toward the start or end of a tooth push, not in the center (as in multituberculates). The cusp recipe of the M1 molar was 5Ã¢ÂÂ6:5Ã¢ÂÂ6:4, with the internal edge stretching out around 75 percent of the tooth's length. The cusps of M1 were sharp and unworn in adolescents, however worn and sunken in more seasoned creatures. The cusp recipe of the M2 molar was 2:2Ã¢ÂÂ3:2Ã¢ÂÂ3.
