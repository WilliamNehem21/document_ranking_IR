A mix of hieroglyphic writings from Tikal, CopÃÂ¡n and QuiriguÃÂ¡, together with engineering styles and synthetic trial of the bones of the originator of the CopÃÂ¡n line all recommend that QuiriguÃÂ¡ and CopÃÂ¡n were established by world class settlers from the incredible city of Tikal as a piece of its venture into the southeastern outskirt territory of the Maya district. The written history of QuiriguÃÂ¡ begins in 426, in the Early Classic ("c".ÃÂ 200ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "c".ÃÂ 600); as indicated by hieroglyphic engravings at different destinations, on 5ÃÂ September of that year K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was enthroned as ruler of CopÃÂ¡n. Only three days after the fact he introduced "Tok Casper", the primary known ruler of QuiriguÃÂ¡, upon the position of royalty. From this it is apparent that directly from the earliest starting point of its written history QuiriguÃÂ¡ was subservient to its southern neighbor, and was established to bring the rewarding exchange course of the Motagua River under the control of CopÃÂ¡n and, in a roundabout way, of Tikal. Amid the following couple of hundreds of years, about which little is known, the stylized engineering at QuiriguÃÂ¡ was constrained to the peak Group An and a wide earthen stage on the valley floor. It is recorded that a stela, up 'til now unfamiliar, was raised in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K'inich, the second lord of QuiriguÃÂ¡. An early landmark records the supervision of a custom in 480 by the then overlord from CopÃÂ¡n, exhibiting QuiriguÃÂ¡'s proceeded with status as a vassal of that city. A hieroglyphic content dating to 493 notices two further rulers of QuiriguÃÂ¡, however intrusions in the content make the perusing and decipherment of their names especially troublesome.
