The discoverer of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, Fray TomÃ¡s de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, wrote in 1535 of "such big tortoises that each could carry a man on top of himself." Naturalist Charles Darwin remarked after his trip three centuries later in 1835, "These animals grow to an immense sizeÂ ... several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from the ground". The largest recorded individuals have reached weights of over and lengths of . Size overlap is extensive with the Aldabra giant tortoise, however taken as a species, the GalÃ¡pagos tortoise seems to average slightly larger, with weights in excess of being slightly more commonplace. Weights in the larger bodied species range from in mature males and from in adult females. However, the size is variable across the islands and species; those from PinzÃ³n Island are relatively small with a maximum known weight of and carapace length of approximately compared to range in tortoises from Santa Cruz Island. The tortoises' gigantism was probably a trait useful on continents that was fortuitously helpful for successful colonisation of these remote oceanic islands rather than an example of evolved insular gigantism. Large tortoises would have a greater chance of surviving the journey over water from the mainland as they can hold their heads a greater height above the water level and have a smaller surface area/volume ratio, which reduces osmotic water loss. Their significant water and fat reserves would allow the tortoises to survive long ocean crossings without food or fresh water, and to endure the drought-prone climate of the islands. A larger size allowed them to better tolerate extremes of temperature due to gigantothermy. Fossil giant tortoises from mainland South America have been described that support this hypothesis of gigantism that pre-existed the colonization of islands.
