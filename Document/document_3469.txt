Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Kaiser expelled Admiral von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Chief naval officer Hugo von Pohl supplanted him as authority of the armada. Chief naval officer von Pohl led a progression of armada propels in 1915 in which "KÃÂ¶nig Albert" partook; in the first on 29Ã¢ÂÂ 30 March, the armada steamed out toward the north of Terschelling and returned without occurrence. Another pursued on 17Ã¢ÂÂ 18 April, where "KÃÂ¶nig Albert" and the remainder of the armada secured a mining task by the II Scouting Group. After three days, on 21Ã¢ÂÂ 22 April, the High Seas Fleet progressed toward the Dogger Bank, however again neglected to meet any British powers. On 15 May, a bushing came free in the ship's starboard turbine, which constrained the group to kill the motor and decouple it. The inside and port side shafts were as yet fit for pushing the ship at , be that as it may. On 29Ã¢ÂÂ 30 May, the armada endeavored to lead a range in the North Sea, yet harsh climate constrained Pohl to drop the task some off Schiermonnikoog. The armada stayed in port until 10 August, when it sortied to Helgoland to cover the arrival of the helper cruiser . After a month, on 11Ã¢ÂÂ 12 September, the armada secured another mine-laying activity off the Swarte Bank. The last activity of the year, led on 23Ã¢ÂÂ 24 October, was a development toward Horns Reef which finished up without result.
