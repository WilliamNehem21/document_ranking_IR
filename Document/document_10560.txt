No further subspecies or assortments of "B.ÃÂ prionotes" have been portrayed, and it has no ordered equivalent words. Its just nomenclatural equivalent word is "Sirmuellera prionotes" , which emerged from Otto Kuntze's fruitless 1891 endeavor to exchange "Banksia" into the new name "Sirmuellera". At the point when Carl Meissner distributed his infrageneric game plan of "Banksia" in 1856, he put "B.ÃÂ prionotes" in segment "Eubanksia" in light of the fact that its inflorescence is a spike instead of a domed head, and in arrangement "Salicinae", a substantial arrangement that is presently considered very heterogeneous. This arrangement was disposed of in the 1870 course of action of George Bentham; rather, "B.ÃÂ prionotes" was put in segment "Orthostylis", which Bentham characterized as comprising of those "Banksia" species with level leaves with serrated edges, and unbending, erect styles that "give the cones after the blossoms have opened an alternate perspective". In 1981, Alex George distributed a changed course of action that put "B.ÃÂ prionotes" in the subgenus "Banksia" in view of its bloom spike, area "Banksia" since its styles are straight as opposed to snared, and the arrangement "Crocinae", another arrangement of four firmly related species, all with splendid orange perianths and pistils.
