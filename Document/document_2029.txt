Matters reached a crucial stage in London in May in what wound up known as the "Victoria Station episode". Touching base in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the group in a motion that some affirmed was a Nazi salute, which was caught on camera and distributed in "NME". Bowie said the picture taker got him in mid-wave. He later accused his star one party rule remarks and his conduct amid the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. "I was crazy, completely crazed. The primary concern I was working on was mythologyÃÂ ... that entire thing about Hitler and RightismÃÂ ... I'd found King Arthur". As per writer Alan Franks, composing later in "The Times", "he was without a doubt 'unhinged'. He had some exceptionally terrible encounters with hard medications." Bowie's cocaine compulsion, which had roused these discussions, had a lot to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which distanced him. Talking about his teases with autocracy in a 1980 meeting with "NME", Bowie clarified that Los Angeles was "the place it had all occurred. The screwing spot ought to be completely destroyed. To be anything to do with shake and roll and proceed to live in Los Angeles is, I think, simply setting out toward debacle. It truly is."
