Starting in "Assemble", parenthood and family issues are imperative topics all through Angelou's personal histories. The book depicts the change and the significance of Rita's association with her own mom, the lady who had surrendered her and her sibling as kids, exhibited by Rita's arrival to her mom toward the finish of the book, "after she understands how near the edge she has come, as a lady and as a mother". Vivian Baxter thinks about Rita's young child as Rita endeavors to bring home the bacon. Pundit Mary Jane Lupton states that "one gets a solid sense all through "Assemble" of [Rita's] reliance on her mom". Faultfinder Lyman B. Hagen comments that Angelou's association with her mom turns out to be progressively essential in "Assemble", and that Vivian is presently increasingly powerful in the improvement of Angelou's frames of mind. Lupton considers Clyde's seizing an "amazing grouping of mother-misfortune" and associates it to the hijacking of Clyde's child during the 1980s. Angelou has contrasted the generation of this book with conceiving an offspring, an adept allegory given the introduction of her child toward the finish of "Confined Bird". In the same way as other writers, Angelou sees the experimental writing procedure and its outcomes as her kids.
