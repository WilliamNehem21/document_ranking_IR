The commotion in the mint piece gathering network brought about terrible attention for the city of Hudson. In spite of the fact that the points of interest of how the mint pieces became so rapidly sold out were not quickly known, authorities intuited a trap, particularly when coins demonstrated ample available at somewhere in the range of $5 and $7 each. A considerable lot of these sold, helping set off a dedicatory coin blast that would proceed with later in 1935 when low-mintage assortments of the Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar went ahead the market after a comparative quick sellout. However, gatherers composed furious letters to numismatic social orders and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future American Numismatic Association president L. W. Hoffecker grumbled going to Congress when he affirmed in March 1936. By 1940, the cost on the auxiliary market had dropped back to $5.50, however from that point climbed consistently and came to $1,700 amid the dedicatory coin blast of 1980. The 2017 release of R. S. Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins" records the coin for somewhere in the range of $700 and $1,500, contingent upon condition. A close immaculate example sold at sale in 2014 for $15,275.
