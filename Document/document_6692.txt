One of Godwin's "real scholarly obligations" is to Gilbert's "De Magnete", in which Gilbert contended that the Earth was attractive, however he may have utilized a subsidiary record by Mark Ridley or a geological reading material by Nathanael Carpenter. It is impossible that Godwin could have accumulated direct proof utilized in portraying the occasions in his book, (for example, the subtleties of Gonsales' voyage once again from the East, particularly a depiction of Saint Helena and its significance as a resting place for debilitated sailors), and almost certain that he depended on movement undertakings and different books. He utilized Trigault's "De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas" (1615), in light of an original copy by Matteo Ricci, the organizer of the Jesuit mission in Beijing in 1601, for data about that mission. Subtleties relating to the ocean voyage and Saint Helena likely originated from Thomas Cavendish's record of his first circumnavigation of the world, accessible in Richard Hakluyt's "Foremost Navigations" (1599Ã¢ÂÂ 1600) and in "Purchas His Pilgrimage", first distributed in 1613. Data on the Dutch Revolt, the recorded setting for the early piece of Gonsales' vocation, likely originated from the chronicles of Emanuel van Meteren, a Dutch student of history working in London.
