Johnston's arrangement was to assault Grant's left, separate the Union armed force from its gunboat backing and road of retreat on the Tennessee River, and drive it west into the bogs of Snake and Owl Creeks, where it could be pulverized. The assault on Grant was initially gotten ready for April 4, however it was deferred forty-eight hours because of an overwhelming precipitation storm that transformed streets into oceans of mud, making a few units lose all sense of direction in the forested areas and others to come to a standstill looked with substantial congested driving conditions. It wound up taking Johnston 3 days to move his military only 23 miles. This was a critical difficulty for the Confederate Army, as the initially booked assault would have initiated when Buell's Army of the Ohio was excessively far away to be of any guide to Grant. Rather, it would occur on the sixth with Buell's military close nearby and ready to fortify Grant on the second day. Besides, the defer left the Confederate Army frantically shy of proportions. They had issued their troops 5 days of apportions just before leaving Corinth, however inability to legitimately save their sustenance consumption and the 2-day defer left most troops totally out of proportions when the fight initiated.
