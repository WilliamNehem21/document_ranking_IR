"Bharatadesa Vaibhava" is an adaptation of the prior "Poorvapurana" by Jinasenacharya and mirrors an alternate point of view than the "Adipurana" composed by Adikavi Pampa c.ÃÂ 941. Fixated on the glorification of the illuminated Bharata, the child of the principal Jain "tirthankar" Adinatha, Ratnakaravarni astutely centers around those angles that the first by Pampa overlooked. Ratnakaravarni really expounds on ruler Bharata who, as indicated by the creator, fills in as the perfect harmony between separation ("yoga") and connection ("bhoga"). In spite of the fact that wedded to "96,000 ladies", Bharata is portrayed as one who on the double could isolate himself from common joys. Dissimilar to Pampa, who concentrated on the contention between the siblings Bahubali and Bharata, finishing with Bahubali's parsimony and Bharata's mortification, Ratnakaravarni's tribute of Bharata leaves room just for Bahubali's advancement towards sainthood. In the end, Bharata achieves "moksha" (freedom from the cycle of death and resurrection) by consuming himself in austere flame. The writer showers encomium on Bharata in his different jobs as ruler, spouse, child, companion and lover, an uncommon depiction of a "flawless individual" among Jain compositions. Since subtleties of the early existence of Bharata as a youthful ruler did not exist in past works or in convention, a lot of Ratnakaravarni's striking portrayal of that period was a result of his creative energy. This work discovers its pride of spot in Kannada's epic verse as the longest ballad in the people "sangatya" meter.
