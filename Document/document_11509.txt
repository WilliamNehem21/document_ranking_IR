Krueger did not wish to compose a life account, which he felt was "perpetually well-suited to be an apologia", however was happy to review a record of the Sixth Army's endeavors. He initiated work in 1947, yet the task continued gradually. The outcome was "From Down Under to Nippon: The Story of the sixth Army In World War II", which was distributed in 1953. History specialists were disillusioned with the book, as it related what was known from the Sixth Army's reports, however given little knowledge into the reasons why activities were directed the manner in which they were. Krueger stayed in touch with his wartime associates. He was pleased with the ensuing achievements of individuals from his wartime staff, and made a trip to New York every year to observe MacArthur's birthday with MacArthur and other previous senior administrators of the Southwest Pacific Area. He addressed at Army Schools and city associations, offering conclusions on subjects, for example, the benefit of preparing, the advantage of all inclusive military administration, and the requirement for a brought together resistance foundation.
