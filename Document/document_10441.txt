One explanation behind the difference in procedure towards Scotland was a developing worry for the connection among England and France. For whatever length of time that Scotland and France were in a partnership, the English were looked with the possibility of battling a war on two fronts. The French completed assaults on English waterfront towns, prompting gossipy tidbits in England of a full-scale French attack. In 1337, Philip VI appropriated the English ruler's Duchy of Aquitaine and the region of Ponthieu. Rather than looking for a quiet goals to the contention by paying reverence to the French ruler, as his dad had done, Edward reacted by making a case for the French crown as the grandson of Philip IV. The French rejected this dependent on the points of reference for agnatic progression set in 1316 and 1322. Rather, they maintained the privileges of PhilipÃÂ IV's nephew, King Philip VI (an agnatic relative of the House of France), in this manner setting the phase for the Hundred Years' War (see family tree underneath). In the beginning periods of the war, Edward's technique was to assemble partnerships with other Continental sovereigns. In 1338, LouisÃÂ IV named Edward vicar-general of the Holy Roman Empire and guaranteed his help. As late as 1373, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 set up an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. These measures delivered few outcomes; the main significant military triumph in this period of the war was the English maritime triumph at Sluys on 24 June 1340, which verified English control of the Channel.
