After the Continental triumph at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina in January 1781, Washington requested Lafayette to re-structure his power in Philadelphia and go south to Virginia to interface up with troops instructed by Baron von Steuben. The joined power was to attempt to trap British powers directed by Benedict Arnold, with French boats keeping his departure via ocean. On the off chance that Lafayette was fruitful, Arnold was to be summarily hanged. English order of the oceans kept the arrangement, however Lafayette and a little piece of his power (the rest deserted in Annapolis) had the capacity to reach von Steuben in Yorktown, Virginia. Von Steuben sent an arrangement to Washington, proposing to utilize land powers and French boats to trap the principle British power under Lord Cornwallis. When he got no new requests from Washington, Lafayette started to push his troops north toward Philadelphia, just to be requested to Virginia to expect military direction there. An insulted Lafayette accepted he was being relinquished in a backwater while definitive fights occurred somewhere else, and protested his requests futile. He likewise sent letters to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, French minister in Philadelphia, depicting how badly provided his troops were. As Lafayette trusted, la Luzerne sent his letter on to France with a proposal of huge French guide, which, in the wake of being affirmed by the ruler, would have a pivotal influence in the fights to come. Washington, dreading a letter may be caught by the British, couldn't disclose to Lafayette that he wanted to trap Cornwallis in an unequivocal battle.
