While he saw the Muslim Mughals as authoritarian and the Marathas as ruthless, Tod saw the Rajput social frameworks as being like the primitive arrangement of medieval Europe, and their conventions of describing history through the ages as like the group artists of the Scottish Highlanders. There was, he felt, an arrangement of governing rules between the decision rulers and their vassal masters, a propensity for fights and different competitions, and regularly a serf-like working class. The Rajputs were, as he would like to think, on the equivalent formative direction that countries, for example, Britain had pursued. His keen utilization of these perspectives later empowered him to advance in his books the idea that there was a mutual encounter between the general population of Britain and this network in a far off, moderately unexplored territory of the domain. He estimated that there was a typical predecessor shared by the Rajputs and Europeans some place somewhere down in ancient times and this may be demonstrated by correlation of the shared trait in their history of thoughts, for example, fantasy and legend. In this he shared a contemporary desire to demonstrate that all networks over the world had a typical starting point. There was another intrigue inalienable in a primitive framework, and it was not one of a kind to Tod: the student of history Thomas R. Metcalf has said that Above all, the chivalric perfect saw character as more deserving of deference than riches or astuteness, and this spoke to the old landed classes at home just as to numerous who worked for the Indian Civil Service.
