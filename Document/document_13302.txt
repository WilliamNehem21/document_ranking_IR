The skeleton was gathered on a homestead named "Pocho Sastre" close Bajada Moreno in the Telsen Department of Chubut Province, Argentina. Since it was installed in a vast hematite solidification, a hard sort of shake, readiness was entangled and advanced gradually. In 1985, Bonaparte distributed a note exhibiting "Carnotaurus sastrei" as another sort and species and quickly portraying the skull and lower jaw. The nonexclusive name (Latin "carno" [carnis] Ã¢ÂÂ "substance" and "taurus" Ã¢ÂÂ "bull") alludes to the bull-like horns, while the particular name "sastrei" respects Angel Sastre, the proprietor of the farm where the skeleton was found. An extensive portrayal of the entire skeleton followed in 1990. After "Abelisaurus", "Carnotaurus" was the second individual from the family Abelisauridae that was found. For quite a long time, it was by a wide margin the best-comprehended individual from its family, and furthermore the best-comprehended theropod from the Southern Hemisphere. It was not until the 21st century that comparable very much protected abelisaurids were depicted, including "Aucasaurus", "Majungasaurus" and "Skorpiovenator", enabling researchers to rethink certain parts of the life systems of "Carnotaurus". The holotype skeleton is shown in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, Bernardino Rivadavia; reproductions can be found in this and different galleries around the globe. Stone workers Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas made an actual existence measured figure of "Carnotaurus" that was already in plain view at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This model, requested by the exhibition hall amid the mid-1980s, is likely the principal life rebuilding of a theropod demonstrating exact skin.
