On 25 March 1931, "Courbet" had a breakdown in one of her turbines and needed to come back to the shipyard for fixes. In the wake of running her ocean preliminaries on 9Ã¢ÂÂ 12 June, she was doled out to the Training Division as a feature of the gunnery school. The ship led a few gunnery practices from 4 February to 27 May 1932 preceding she came back to the shipyard to have her condensers retubed and her two inward propellers supplanted. In 1933 and 1934, "Courbet" and her sister "Paris", both appointed to the Training Division, infrequently left port. "Courbet" had her drive hardware redesignd in 1937Ã¢ÂÂ 1938 and the naval force accepted the open door to expel her torpedo tubes and strengthen her enemy of air ship weapon with the expansion of a couple Hotchkiss hostile to flying machine assault rifles. The Training Squadron was disbanded on 10 June 1939 and the sisters were relegated to the third Battle Division of the fifth Squadron. The boats started a voyage on 14 June amid which they visited Mers-el-Kebir and Casablanca, French Morocco, before touching base in Brest on 11 July where the division was allocated to the second Maritime Region which was headquartered there, holding their job as gunnery preparing ships.
