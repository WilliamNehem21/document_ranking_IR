On January 28, 1970, a third and last Band of Gypsys appearance occurred; they performed amid a music celebration at Madison Square Garden profiting the counter Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was behind the stage before the show; he reviewed: "[Hendrix] came in with his head down, sat on the lounge chair alone, and put his head in his handsÃÂ ... He didn't move until it was the ideal opportunity for the show." Minutes in the wake of making that big appearance he snapped an indecent reaction at a lady who had yelled a solicitation for "Charming Lady". He at that point started playing "Earth Blues" before telling the gathering of people: "That is the thing that happens when earth fucks with space". Minutes after the fact, he quickly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. The two Miles and Redding later expressed that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the execution. Miles trusted that Jeffery gave Hendrix the medications with an end goal to attack the present band and achieve the arrival of the first Experience lineup. Jeffery terminated Miles after the show and Cox quit, finishing the Band of Gypsys.
