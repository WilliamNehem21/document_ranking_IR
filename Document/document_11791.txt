McNicoll was enthusiastic for a RAN commitment to the Vietnam War and, in July 1966, suggested that the four Australian minesweepers working out of Singapore be sent to Vietnamese waters since "Konfrontasi" was at an end and the vessels were never again fundamental around there. The thought was dismissed by Fairhall, be that as it may, who was aware of an up and coming race and was determined that nothing be chosen until a short time later. The likelihood of a maritime commitment to Vietnam was brought again up in December, and it was chosen that the guided rocket destroyer and a leeway jumping group of six work force be conveyed as the Royal Australian Navy Force Vietnam. Per an understanding among McNicoll and Admiral Roy L. Johnson, Commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, HMAS "Hobart" was to be joined to the United States Seventh Fleet and direct shore siege activities. The organization of an Australian destroyer to Vietnam wound up lasting, with the boats working on a six-month revolution. Agreeable to McNicoll, the RAN commitment to the performance center was additionally reinforced in 1967 with the development of the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam and the dispatch of maritime pilots to serve in an Army bolster job with No. 9 Squadron RAAF.
