At the point when skipper GarcÃÂ­a de Paredes surprisingly came back to Campeche toward the beginning of May 1695, representative MartÃÂ­n de UrsÃÂºa was at that point getting ready fortifications for his endeavor. With GarcÃÂ­a's entry, he was promptly allotted the additional troopers. On 11 May UrsÃÂºa requested GarcÃÂ­a to start a second undertaking southwards and was assigned 100 salaried Maya to go with him. These laborers were to be paid three pesos for every month and got a suspension of their commitments to supply "encomienda" work and tribute. GarcÃÂ­a paid for extra Spanish officers from his very own assets, as did JosÃÂ© FernÃÂ¡ndez de Estenos, a Campeche occupant who was to fill in as second-in-order. The last power numbered 115 Spanish fighters and 150 Maya musketeers, in addition to Maya workers and muleteers; the last count was in excess of 400 individuals, which was viewed as an impressive armed force in the devastated YucatÃÂ¡n region. UrsÃÂºa additionally requested two organizations of Maya musketeers from TekÃÂ¼ax and OxkÃÂ¼utzkabÃÂ¼ to join the campaign at BÃÂ¼olonchÃÂ¼en Kawich, some southeast of the city of Campeche. Bonifacio Us was chief of the TekÃÂ¼ax organization; Diego Uk was that of the OxkÃÂ¼utzkabÃÂ¼ organization. Marcos Pot was by and large "cacique chief" of these two Maya organizations; every one of the three officers were Maya. A Maya organization from SajkabÃÂ¼chen filled in as tip top musketeers accused of gathering together backwoods Maya into the "reducciones"; this organization was pardoned from overwhelming work obligations. Non-Maya troopers were a blend of Spanish, mestizos (blended race Spanish and local) and mulattos (blended race Spanish and dark).
