On 15 July the writer William Connor, under his nom de plume Cassandra, communicate a postscript to the news program railing against Wodehouse. As per "The Times", the communicate "incited a tempest of complaintÃÂ ... from audience members everywhere throughout the nation". Wodehouse's biographer, Joseph Connolly, thinks the communicate "erroneous, resentful and hostile"; Phelps calls it "presumably the most vituperative assault on an individual at any point heard on British radio". The communicate was made at the immediate guidance of Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information, who overruled solid dissents made by the BBC against the choice to air the program. Various letters showed up in the British press, both supporting and reprimanding Wodehouse. The letters page of "The Daily Telegraph" turned into a concentration for rebuking Wodehouse, including one from Wodehouse's companion, A. A. Milne; an answer from their individual creator Compton Mackenzie with regards to Wodehouse was not distributed on the grounds that the editorial manager asserted an absence of room. The vast majority of those protecting Wodehouse against allegations of unfaithfulness, including Sax Rohmer, Dorothy L. Sayers and Gilbert Frankau, yielded that he had acted moronically. A few individuals from the open kept in touch with the papers to state that the full certainties were not yet known and a reasonable judgment couldn't be made until they were. The administration of the BBC, who considered Wodehouse's activities no more terrible than "stupid", indicated out Cooper that there was no proof by then whether Wodehouse had acted deliberately or under impulse.
