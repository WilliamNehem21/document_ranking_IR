"Dakotan" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Although the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes, "Dakotan" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful manner over the next twenty years. One incident of note occurred on 20 August 1923 when "Dakotan" issued distress calls after she ran aground at Cabo San LÃ¡zaro on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The Navy transport ship and the Standard Oil tanker "Charles Pratt" responded to "Dakotan"s calls. "Charles Pratt" successfully freed "Dakotan", which had suffered damage to her rudder post in the accident. The American-Hawaiian ship "Nevadan" arrived and towed "Dakotan" to Los Angeles for repairs.
In 1933, two members of "Dakotan"s crew had medical emergencies that received news coverage. The first, in February, involved a seaman with an abdominal disorder. He was transferred from the eastbound "Dakotan" to the Dollar Line ocean liner which carried him to Los Angeles to receive medical attention. The second occurred in July when "Dakotan"s quartermaster came down with appendicitis near Balboa. Radio calls for assistance brought the U.S. Navy's Destroyer Division 7 to "Dakotan"s aid. The destroyer unit's medical officer boarded "Dakotan" and performed an appendectomy on the man, who was too ill to be moved off the ship.
