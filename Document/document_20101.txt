Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to the north of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest remaining fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woodsÂ â the Wilderness and part of Ryott's PlantationÂ â which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder ("Alnus glutinosa"); though ash ("Fraxinus excelsior") is abundant in places and there is occasional oak ("Quercus robur") and wych elm ("Ulmus glabra"). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes "Radula complanata", "Zygodon viridissimus" and "Orthotrichum affine". Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury ("Mercurialis perennis"), with abundant herb paris ("Paris quadrifolia"), toothwort ("Lathraea squamaria"), Solomon's seal ("Polygonatum multiflorum"), twayblade and early purple orchids ("Listera ovata") and "Orchis mascula" and, locally, wild daffodil ("Narcissus pseudonarcissus").
