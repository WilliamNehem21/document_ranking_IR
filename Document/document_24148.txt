From its unveiling, "Candaules" was condemned by the press as a cynical combination of a pornographic picture and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and there was near-unanimous consensus that the picture was inappropriate for public exhibition. The "Literary Gazette" condemned the work as "against decency and good taste", and Etty as tending in "Candaules" towards the type of "debasing sensuality" one would expect from a foreigner, not the "purer" British school of painting. The reviewer also criticised the theme of the painting, saying that "as an academic study, the central figure of this group might be admissible; but, in with the disgraceful story, it deserves to be warmly reprehended". "La Belle AssemblÃ©e", one of Britain's most influential women's magazines, praised Etty's other exhibits at the Summer Exhibition but refused to review "Candaules" altogether, saying that "to us the subject is so offensive that we pass it over". Even Alexander Gilchrist, generally one of Etty's strongest supporters, in his 1855 biography of Etty described "Candaules" as "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote in 2011 that "it is perhaps hard to see the painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise".
