The family "Carcharocles" as of now contains four species: "C. auriculatus", "C. angustidens", "C. chubutensis", and "C. megalodon". The advancement of this heredity is described by the expansion of serrations, the augmenting of the crown, the improvement of an increasingly triangular shape, and the vanishing of the parallel cusps. The advancement in tooth morphology mirrors a move in predation strategies from a tearing-getting a handle on nibble to a cutting chomp, likely mirroring a move in prey decision from fish to cetaceans. Parallel cusplets were at last lost in a progressive procedure that took about 12 million years amid the change between "C. chubutensis" and "C. megalodon". The class was proposed by D. S. Jordan and H. Hannibal in 1923 to contain "C. auriculatus". During the 1980s, megalodon was alloted to "Carcharocles". Prior to this, in 1960, the variety "Procarcharodon" was raised by French ichthyologist Edgard Casier, which incorporated those four sharks and was viewed as discrete from the incredible white shark. It is presently viewed as a lesser equivalent word of "Carcharocles". The sort "Palaeocarcharodon" was raised nearby "Procarcharodon" to speak to the start of the ancestry, and, in the model wherein megalodon and the extraordinary white shark are firmly related, their last basic progenitor. It is accepted to be a transformative impasse and irrelevant to the "Carcharocles" sharks by creators who dismiss that display.
