Repairs were finally completed by September 1915. On 21 September, "Prinz Adalbert" joined a sortie to the Gulf of Finland with the battleships , , , , and and the light cruiser . They encountered no Russian forces and returned to port on the 23rd. Another operation followed on 5 October; this was in company with "Prinz Heinrich" and "Bremen", and was to cover a minelayer as it laid a field to the northwest of Ãstergarn. The ships completed their mission the next day and returned to port without incident. On 19 October, Hopman transferred his flag to "Roon" and ordered "Prinz Adalbert" to take up a patrol between FÃ¥rÃ¶ and Dagerort. The ship was steaming some 20 miles west of Libau, en route to her patrol area, in company with a pair of destroyers on 23 October when she was intercepted by the submarine . "E8" fired a spread of torpedoes at a range of approximately 1,200Â m (1,300Â yd), detonating the ship's ammunition magazine. The massive explosion destroyed the ship, which sank immediately with the loss of 672 crew. There were only three survivors. The sinking was the greatest single loss of life for the German Baltic forces during the war.
