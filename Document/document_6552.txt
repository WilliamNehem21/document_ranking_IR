The next day, in Jackson, Mississippi, Agnew told a Republican supper, "for a really long time the South has been simply the punching pack for the individuals who portray themselves as liberal intellectualsÃÂ ... their course is a course that will at last debilitate and dissolve the very fiber of America." Agnew, however he denied Republicans had a Southern Strategy, focused on that the organization and Southern whites shared much for all intents and purpose, including the objection to the elites. Toll contended that such comments were intended to draw in Southern whites to the Republican Party to help secure the re-appointment of Nixon and Agnew in 1972, and that Agnew's talk "could have filled in as the diagram for the way of life wars of the following twenty-to-thirty years, including the case that Democrats were delicate on wrongdoing, unpatriotic, and favored banner consuming instead of banner waving". The participants at the addresses were energetic, however different Republicans, particularly from the urban communities, griped to the Republican National Committee that Agnew's assaults were overbroad.
