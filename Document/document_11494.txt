Her first screen job came in 1985, in a scene of the cleanser musical drama "The Edge of Night". Her break came the next year, when she joined the cast of "As the World Turns".

Before leaving "As the World Turns", she had a job in the 1987 CBS miniseries "I'll Take Manhattan".

The performing artist returned discontinuously to TV throughout the following three years, showing up in the TV motion pictures "Cash, Power, Murder" (1989), "The Last to Go" (1991), and "Cast a Deadly Spell" (1991).
