Harrison was associated with philanthropic and political activism for a mind-blowing duration. During the 1960s, the Beatles upheld the social equality development and challenged the Vietnam War. In mid 1971, Ravi Shankar counseled Harrison about how to give help to the general population of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola twister and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison quickly composed and recorded the tune "Bangla Desh", which turned out to be popular music's first philanthropy single when issued by Apple Records in late July. He additionally pushed Apple to discharge Shankar's "Joi Bangla" EP with an end goal to raise further mindfulness for the cause.<ref name="Dooley/Gibson"></ref> Shankar requested Harrison's recommendation about arranging a little philanthropy occasion in the US. Harrison reacted by sorting out the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000. Around $13.5 million was created through the collection and film discharges, albeit the greater part of the assets were solidified in an Internal Revenue Service review for a long time, because of Klein's inability to enlist the occasion as a UNICEF advantage in advance. In June 1972, UNICEF regarded Harrison and Shankar, and Klein, with the "Tyke Is the Father of Man" grant at a yearly function in acknowledgment of their raising support endeavors for Bangladesh.
