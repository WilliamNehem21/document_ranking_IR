A stone commemoration to Simpson, with the words "Olympic medallist, best on the planet, British brandishing minister", remains on the spot where he crumbled and kicked the bucket on Ventoux, one kilometer east of the summit. "Cycling" started a store for a landmark seven days after Simpson's passing, raising about ÃÂ£1,500. The remembrance was uncovered in 1968. It has turned into a site of journey for cyclists, who much of the time leave cycling-related items, for example, water containers and tops, in tribute. In adjacent BÃÂ©doin, a plaque was introduced in the town square by writers following the 1967 Tour. The Harworth and Bircotes Sports and Social Club has a little historical center devoted to Simpson, opened by Belgian cyclist Lucien Van Impe in August 2001. In 1997, to celebrate the 30th commemoration of his demise, a little plaque was added to the Mont Ventoux dedication, with the words "There is no mountain excessively high. Your little girls Jane and Joanne, July 13, 1997", and a copy of the commemoration was raised outside the gallery. In his embraced main residence of Ghent, there is a failure of Simpson at the passageway to the Kuipke velodrome. Consistently since his passing, the Tom Simpson Memorial Race has occurred in Harworth.
