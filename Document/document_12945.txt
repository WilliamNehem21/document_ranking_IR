It was assigned for a Youth Jury Award at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, shortlisted for an Amnesty International 2008 UK Media Award in the classification for Television Documentary and Docudramas, and the European Independent Film Festival named it the Best News and Current Affairs film. It was named for the Readers' Award in the "Radio Times", and in May 2008 it won the Premiere Prize at the Sandford St. Martin Trust Awards, which recognizes perfection in religious telecom.
