The fact that Berger was able to expand the SS combat troops so quickly was a tribute to his improvisational skills. On 1 December 1939, Himmler promoted Berger to chief of the SS-HA. To a significant extent, Berger was the "father" of the "Waffen"-SS (or Armed SS), a term he coined in an agreement dated 2 March 1940. He used the new term to smooth over friction between the SS-VT and SS-TV, as they were combined in new formations. Berger's new-found authority for SS recruiting matters irritated the chiefs of the "Allgemeine-SS" districts, who had previously been responsible for this function. This came to a head when the chief of "SS-Oberabschnitt SÃ¼dwest", "SS-GruppenfÃ¼hrer" Kurt Kaul refused to recognise Berger's delegate in his district, referring to Berger as a "low-ranking empire builder". Kaul's series of letters to Berlin came to nothing, as the power and influence of the "Allgemeine-SS" had waned with the outbreak of war and the conscription of many of its members into the Wehrmacht, "Waffen-SS" and police. Ultimately, when Kaul threatened to arrest Berger's delegate in "SS-Oberabschnitt SÃ¼dwest", Himmler intervened personally in February 1940, stating that "the most unpleasant consequences" would befall Kaul if he did not throw his support behind Berger and his recruiting organisation. Kaul acquiesced, and Berger's supremacy as SS recruiting supremo was firmly established.
