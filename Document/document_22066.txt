Brudvig praised the campaign for avoiding the "repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots" of past "Halo" titles. GameSpot's Chris Watters and others felt the artificial intelligence of friendly non-player characters was less advanced than that of enemies, especially while driving. Steve Boxer wrote for "The Guardian" that "Reach"s story made previous entries feel "amateurish"; Nguyen felt that whereas previous "Halo" titles had become mired in inconsistencies and "Star Trek"-like technobabble, "Reach" told a broader and more accessible story. Despite this, he contended, the game suffered from archetypal characters with which players spent little time: "I almost forgot that Noble Four (Emile) even existed for a big chunk of the campaign, as I rarely saw him." "Wired"s Gus Mastrapa unfavorably compared Noble Team to the marines of "Aliens", writing that most of the characters were unmemorable and one-dimensional. Nguyen also faulted the game for occasional lapses in exposition, but summed these up as "minor quibbles" compared to the improvements. In contrast, GamesRadar's Charlie Baratt opined that "Reach"s campaign was better than "ODST"s, but lacked the "franchise-changing potential" it promised. Lynch judged that while Bungie still had not learned to create a perfect story, "["Reach"] does expertly set up bombastic scene after scene".
