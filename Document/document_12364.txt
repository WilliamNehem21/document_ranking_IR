At the marabout's "zawiya", Eberhardt was debilitated by fever. She came back to AÃÂ¯n SÃÂ©fra, and was treated at the military medical clinic. She left the emergency clinic against medicinal exhortation and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been isolated for a while, to join her. Rejoined on 20October 1904, they leased a little mud house. The next day, a blaze flood struck the zone. When the waters died down, Lyautey propelled a look for her. Ehnni was found very quickly, saying that Eberhardt had been cleared away by the water. In light of this data, Lyautey and his men hunt the encompassing region down a few days before choosing to investigate the remains of the house where the couple had remained. Her body was pounded under one of the house's supporting pillars. The precise conditions of her passing were never found. While a few biographers have raised doubts with respect to Ehnni, most trust it almost certain that Eberhardt, who had dependably trusted she would bite the dust youthful, rather acknowledged her destiny. Mackworth theorized that after at first endeavoring to keep running from the floodwaters, Eberhardt rather swung back to confront them. Whiten contended that because of Eberhardt's history of self-destructive propensities, she presumably would have still remained in the zone regardless of whether she had realized the flood was coming. Lyautey covered Eberhardt in AÃÂ¯n Sefra and had a marble gravestone, engraved with her received name in Arabic and her original name in French, put on her grave.
