For a long time Nagle attempted to end the Jockey Club's restriction on authorizing ladies as race horse mentors, which she saw as a bad form: in the long run, disappointed by the Jockey Club's steady refusal to concede preparing licenses to ladies, Nagle looked for lawful change. It has been recommended that the club utilized its significant impact inside the Establishment to have her case blocked twice. Her battle at long last achieved the Court of Appeal in 1966. Following her third appearance in court, Nagle developed triumphant. The decision of the three managing judges, Lord Denning, Lord Justice Dankwerts and Lord Justice Salmon, was, in the expressions of Lord Denning, that "In the event that she is to carry on her exchange without stooping to subterfuge she must have a permit." Lord Denning proceeded to portray the refusal to concede Nagle a preparation permit as "subjective and whimsical", and Lord Justice Danckwerts called it "prohibitive and outlandish". Of the Jockey Club itself, Lord Justice Danckwerts proceeded to articulate that "The courts reserve the option to ensure the privilege of an individual to work when it is being forestalled by the tyrannical forces of a body which holds an imposing business model." All three judges likewise alluded to the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919. Looked with the court's dooming and humiliating choice, the Jockey Club ceded, and on 3 August 1966 Florence Nagle and Norah Wilmot turned into the main ladies in Britain to get licenses to prepare racehorses.
