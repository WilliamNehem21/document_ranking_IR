Britain were in the end out for 441 on the last day, leaving Australia an objective of 98. Bradman's men advanced rapidly toward the beginning of the pursuit. Barnes took 13 keeps running from the opening over by Bedser, including three limits, though Morris again needed familiarity. Be that as it may, Barnes kept on scoring rapidly, and 24 runs originated from the initial four overs. The travelers continued relentlessly to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris succumbed to nine. Bradman went to the wrinkle and fell for a duck following 12 minutes in the center. This left Australia at 2/48; foreboding shadows started to surround the ground, and downpour gave off an impression of being a conceivable guardian angel for England. In any case, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes and they took the voyagers to the objective moving along without any more misfortune following 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an open door for an arrival get, however the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a cleared limit and kept running off the field with a trinket stump, trusting the match was finished. He hurled his gift over into the playing field and came back to the field in the wake of seeing the response of the delighted group and understanding his error; Hassett continued to hit the triumphant run. Barnes finished unbeaten on 64 with 11 limits; he scored productively with his square cut. The following morning, he examined the majority of the papers, hoping to be vigorously reproached by experts for foolhardy batting on the last day, yet they rather centered around his skipper's inability to score.
