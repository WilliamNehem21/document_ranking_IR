Scholastics and biographers exploring the play have likewise communicated blended sentiments. Theater researcher Gerald Bordman pronounced it "an unexceptional court dramatization" made well known by the jury component, in spite of the fact that he noted commendation for the acting of Breese and Pidgeon. History specialist James Baker depicted Rand's introduction of court conduct as farfetched, yet said groups of onlookers excuse this in light of the fact that the play's emotional minutes are "so much fun". He said the play was "extraordinary stimulation" that is "held together by a massively appealing lady and a contrivance", however "it isn't reasoning" and neglects to pass on the subjects Rand had at the top of the priority list. Jennifer Burns communicated a comparable view, expressing that the play's endeavors to depict independence had "questionable resultsÃÂ ... Rand expected Bjorn Faulkner to exemplify courageous independence, yet in the play he puts on a show of being minimal in excess of a corrupt businessperson with a preference for unpleasant sex". Writing researcher Mimi Reisel Gladstein portrayed the play as "noteworthy for emotional creativity and topical substance". Rand biographer Anne Heller thought of it as "drawing in, if stilted", while Ronald Merrill portrayed it as "a skillfully developed show" undermined by "Rand's particular failure to compose a viable secret plot without leaving openings". Riddle commentator Marvin Lachman noticed the curiosity of the utilization of a jury yet called the play implausible with "stilted discourse" and "clichÃÂ© characters".
