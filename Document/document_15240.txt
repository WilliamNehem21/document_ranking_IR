Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. "ThÃ¼ringen" and her three sisters, along with the four "Nassau"-class battleships, were permitted to remain in Germany during the peace negotiations. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and in their absence Reuter ordered the crews to scuttle the ten battleships and five battlecruisers interned at Scapa Flow. "ThÃ¼ringen" was decommissioned on 16 December 1918 and used as a barracks ship while she remained in Germany. She was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919 and placed out of commission. The fate of the eight remaining German battleships was determined in the Treaty of Versailles, which stated that the ships were to be disarmed and surrendered to the governments of the principal Allied powers. "ThÃ¼ringen" was surrendered to the French Navy on 29 April 1920 under the name ""L"". A skeleton crew took the ship to Cherbourg for the official transfer. "ThÃ¼ringen" was briefly used as a target ship by the French Navy before sinking off Gavres. The ship was partially broken up "in situ" in 1923â1933, though significant portions of the ship remain off the French coast.
