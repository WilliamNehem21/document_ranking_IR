The RadhaÃ¢ÂÂ Birju relationship is portrayed to have "Oedipal components" by numerous creators; Virdi has contended that in her purity, Radha channels her sexual wants into maternal love for her children who adequately become "substitute sensual subjects". Mishra opines that the devastating of the arms of Radha's better half and the smoothness of the more seasoned child symbolize mutilation, which is interestingly with the resistance of Birju, related to sexual intensity. Birju's fixation on his mom's wrist trinkets is a declaration of his oedipal longings, as indicated by Chakravarty. Rachel Dwyer, Professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema at SOAS, depicts how "suspiciously easily" the Oedipal components fit into the film and the off-screen sentiment among Nargis and Dutt, playing mother and child in the film. Radha's activities toward the finish of the film in shooting her own child was a breaking of customary motherÃ¢ÂÂ child relationship to defend profound quality, as per creator William Van der Heide. Virdi brings up this conveyed uncertainty to the mother figure who goes about as a giving up supplier and furthermore as a destroyer, demolishing her very own child, something uncommon in Hindi film. She deciphers Birju's lewd gestures on a town young lady (which is interbreeding in north Indian town culture) similar to a substitute in the plot for the depraved motherÃ¢ÂÂ child relationship and his passing toward the end as a discipline for infringement of the forbidden.
