Practically all of Millennium Park was shut for multi day for corporate occasions in 2005 and 2006. Shutting an open park somewhat paid for with citizen cash was disputable, just like the prohibition of suburbanites who stroll through the recreation center and visitors tricked by its attractions. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to lease all stop settings from 6ÃÂ a.m. to 11ÃÂ p.m, aside from Wrigley Square, the Lurie Garden, the McDonald's Cycle Center and the "Crown Fountain". The city said the cash was utilized to finance everyday activities, and with the expectation of complimentary occasions in the recreation center, including the Lurie Garden Festival, a Steppenwolf Theater creation, melodic entertainers along the Chase Promenade throughout the entire summer, a jazz arrangement, and youngsters' shows. The name of Toyota, one of the backers, was incorporated on Millennium Park handouts, site, and promoting signage. The conclusion gave an advertising chance to General Motors, which carried 1,500ÃÂ tourists from the recreation center to see other Chicago attractions. Toyota said it considered $300,000 a rental cost and $500,000 a supporting gift. On August 7, 2006, Allstate, which paid $200,000 as a rental cost and $500,000 as a supporting gift, obtained the appearance rights to an alternate arrangement of park highlights (counting Lurie Garden), and just had restrictive access to specific highlights after 4ÃÂ p.m.
