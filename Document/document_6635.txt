The diplosegments of millipedes have advanced related to their tunneling propensities, and about all millipedes receive a for the most part underground way of life. They utilize three principle techniques for tunneling; bulldozing, wedging and exhausting. Individuals from the requests Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, bring down their heads and jump their way into the substrate, the collum being the part of their exoskeleton that drives the way. Level supported millipedes in the request Polydesmida will in general supplement their front end, similar to a wedge, into a flat hole, and after that augment the break by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this case establishing the fundamental lifting surface. Exhausting is utilized by individuals from the request Polyzoniida. These have littler fragments at the front and progressively expansive ones further back; they push themselves forward into a break with their legs, the wedge-formed body broadening the hole as they go. A few millipedes have embraced an over the ground way of life and lost the tunneling propensity. This might be on the grounds that they are too little to even think about having enough influence to tunnel, or on the grounds that they are too vast to even think about making the exertion advantageous, or at times since they move generally quick (for a millipede) and are dynamic predators.
