There are just four other known survivals, common or religious, of "basse taille" lacquer on gold, one the little Salting Reliquary, likewise in the British Museum, and none as fine as the container. The "Ruler John Cup" in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-plated with straightforward veneer, is the best case of "basse-taille" work likely made in England; the metalwork master Herbert Maryon portrays this and the Royal Gold Cup as the "two instances of remarkable legitimacy, superb in any gathering." However it is hazy if the vast majority of the polish at King's Lynn is unique. The nearest correlation with the Royal Gold Cup is maybe the silver-plated MÃÂ©rode Cup of around 1400, which is the main enduring medieval case of "plique ÃÂ¡ jour" polish, a troublesome system which makes a transparent impact like recolored glass. A silver-plated glass in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam of before 1376 has no polishes or jewels, and an alternate shape, however offers a fascinating examination as it has a tripod remain with winged grotesques as legs, a short stem, and the spread has both a detailed finial and a raised enlivened strip around the edge, so all the adjusted parts of the Royal Gold Cup are available.
