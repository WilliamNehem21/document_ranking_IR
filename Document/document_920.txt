Now in the battle, the Austrian order staff was in full disarray. Ferdinand started to straightforwardly restrict Mack's direction style and choices, charging that the last gone through his days composing opposing requests that left the Austrian armed force walking forward and backward. On 13 October Mack sent two segments out of Ulm in anticipation of a breakout toward the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to verify the extension there and the other under Franz von Werneck ran north with the vast majority of the substantial big guns. Ney rushed his corps forward to restore contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney drove Loison's division toward the south of Elchingen on the correct bank of the Danube to start the assault. Malher's division crossed the stream more distant east and pushed west toward Riesch's position. The field was an incompletely lush flood plain, rising steeply to the slope town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets from an extension, at that point a regiment strikingly assaulted and caught the convent at the highest point of the slope at knife point. Amid the Battle of Elchingen, the Austrian mounted force was likewise crushed and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title "Duke of Elchingen" for his amazing triumph.
