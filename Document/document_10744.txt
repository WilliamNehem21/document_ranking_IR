One proposition to resuscitate the three-penny piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Bread cook of Cleveland sent a joint remembrance to Congress encouraging its arrival. The next year, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a conference on bills to approve a copper-nickel three-penny piece and to change the organization of the penny to copper-nickel. Mint Director George E. Roberts affirmed and demonstrated he had no complaint to a three-penny piece, as there was in any event restricted interest for a coin bigger than the penny and littler than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-penny nickel was among different coin enactment considered by the Senate Banking Committee. In 1942, Congress conceded the Treasury Secretary the brief specialist to change the sythesis of the nickel in light of wartime metal deficiencies, and if open interest for the five-penny piece required it, the Mint could strike three-penny pieces. Nothing happened to any of the proposition. The three-penny piece was affirmed as completely legitimate delicate by the Coinage Act of 1965, which broadcasted all coin and money of the United States great to any sum for installment of open and private obligation. By at that point, that coin had since a long time ago go from the scene.
