"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" has been described as one of the classic episodes of "South Park". Chris Vognar of "The Dallas Morning News" described Mr. Hankey himself as "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of "The Florida Times-Union" said the episode was "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensiveâalso extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, "If you're the sort of person who didn't care for that scene in "Trainspotting" where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and "Rolling Stone" contributor, said, "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?" Diane Werts of "Newsday" said of the episode, "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." Werts particularly praised the song "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of "Taking South Park Seriously", said, "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.
