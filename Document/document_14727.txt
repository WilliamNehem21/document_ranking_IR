Actually, Stewart did not make the most of King's certainty. In spite of the fact that he got him into his bureau 1921 to a limited extent at the asking of Progressive pioneer Thomas Crerar, King observed Stewart to be an insufficient defender of western interestsÃ¢ÂÂparticularly in his backing of levy decrease, which King found drearyÃ¢ÂÂand did not confide in his political guidance on the west. By 1925 he was thinking about naming Stewart to the Senate, to expel him from dynamic political association, yet was crippled by the nonappearance of some other Alberta portrayal in his bureau. In 1926 Stewart filled in as an emissary from King to enlist Saskatchewan Premier Charles Avery Dunning to the government bureau; the mission satisfied, King kept Stewart in bureau yet wrote in his journal that all issues relating to Alberta were to be "left to Dunning to do as he might suspect best". By 1927, King grumbled that Stewart had "no hold" on the territory of which he had once been Premier, and in 1930 he expressed "Association in Alberta is awful. Stewart is more awful than futile, resembles an elderly person, with no genuine control of circumstance." In the 1930 government decision Dunning and Crerar were both crushed; King grumbled that it was "superbly horrible to have Stewart alone speaking to the West." When Stewart also went down to overcome in 1935, King was satisfied "not to need to think about him" in gathering his new bureau, and selected rather to leave Alberta unrepresented to rebuff it for neglecting to choose any Liberals.
