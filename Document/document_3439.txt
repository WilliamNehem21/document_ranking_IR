"Heavens Lost" was adjusted into a musical drama by the musical show program of the University of Illinois. The musical drama was made by Stephen A. Taylor; the lyrics has been ascribed both to Kate Gale, and to Marcia Johnson. Adjusted in 2005, the musical drama debuted in 2012. Le Guin portrayed the exertion as a "delightful musical show" in a meeting, and communicated trusts that it would be gotten by different makers. She likewise said she was better satisfied with stage adjustments, including "Heavens Lost", than screen adjustments of her work till date. A paper composed for the Poetry Foundation expressed that the musical drama was "so free from historyÃ¢ÂÂand even from EarthÃ¢ÂÂas to have its very own imperatives". The survey depicted the musical drama as occurring in a peaceful setting, dissimilar to the "swashbuckling environment" of most musical dramas, and that accordingly it depended more on air and language to look after pressure. An audit of an act that included passages of the musical show in Portland, Oregon, expressed that Taylor had given the music "cadenced drive and brilliant sound, with two sopranos, woodwind, celesta, metallophone and a lot of pizzicato, that were appropriate to the subject of divine travel." The survey proceeded to state that the vocal songs soon "took on a feeling of similarity that undercut the story's sensational pressure."
