Jackson uncovered to Richie that he needed to sing the melody, yet to take an interest in its composition too. In the first place, "We Are the World" was to be composed by Jackson, Richie, and Wonder. As Wonder had constrained time to chip away at the task, Jackson and Richie continued to state "We Are simply the World." They started making the melody at Hayvenhurst, the Jackson family home in Encino. For seven days, the two went through consistently taking a shot at verses and songs in Jackson's room. They realized that they needed a melody that would be anything but difficult to sing and paramount. The pair needed to make a song of devotion. Jackson's more established sister La Toya viewed the two work on the tune, and later battled that Richie just composed a couple of lines for the track. She expressed that her more youthful sibling composed 99 percent of the verses, "yet he's never felt it important to state that". La Toya further remarked on the melody's creation in a meeting with the American big name news magazine "Individuals". "I'd go into the room while they were composing and it would be exceptionally tranquil, which is odd, since Michael's normally lively when he works. It was extremely enthusiastic for them."
