Talbot nicknamed Windle "the greyhound" as a result of his slight and precise form. Because of Windle's little form, he took somewhere in the range of 45 and 47 strokes to finish a lap, yet individual separation swimmer Murray Rose required just 35 to 37 strokes. Talbot said that Windle was the most daintily assembled tip top swimmer that he had prepared, and had extraordinary inconvenience in attempting to build Windle's casing. Talbot spurred Windle and ingrained him with a more prominent dimension of self conviction. As far as it matters for him, Windle reacted by expanding his outstanding task at hand, and was viewed as Talbot's most tireless understudy. Windle prepared with an assurance that regularly observed him swim through other people who were in his preparation path. These impacts prompted objections by recreational swimmers that Windle was excessively forceful. He regularly did twice as much pre-season preparing as different swimmers in Talbot's squad. As indicated by Talbot, Windle's shortcoming was that he was just fit for swimming in two different ways, level out or in all respects gradually. Windle experienced difficulty in pacing himself to monitor vitality for later occasions. Talbot mourned to "never [being] sufficiently adroit to understand that he [Windle] didn't have the nuances of pace that would have added to his combat hardware as a swimmer".
