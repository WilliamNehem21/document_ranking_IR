Mackintosh further vexed Joyce by choosing to lead this warehouse laying party himself, unaffected by Joyce's case to have autonomous expert over this territory. The gathering was isolated into two groups, and the voyage started on 24 January, in an air of obfuscate. Introductory endeavors at going on the Barrier were frustrated by the state of the surface, and Mackintosh's group got lost on the ocean ice between Cape Evans and Hut Point. Joyce secretly boasted over this proof of the commander's freshness. The groups in the long run achieved the 79ÃÂ° imprint, and laid the "Feign stop" there (Minna Bluff was a noticeable obvious milestone at this scope) on 9 February. It appeared that Joyce's gathering had appreciated the simpler adventure. Mackintosh's arrangement to take the pooches on to the 80ÃÂ° imprint prompted more words among him and Joyce, who contended that few puppies had as of now kicked the bucket and that the rest of to be kept for future voyages, yet again he was over-ruled. On 20 February the gathering achieved the 80ÃÂ° scope and laid their station there. The result of this adventure was of arrangements and fuel at 80ÃÂ°S and at 79ÃÂ°S. In any case, a further , expected for the stops, had been dumped on the voyage, to spare weight.
