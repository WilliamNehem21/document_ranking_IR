McConnel begin improving Bryn Eglwys to expand its yield. He concentrated on giving rail transport to the disconnected quarry, and in April 1864 he achieved concurrence with neighborhood landowners to buy the land important to manufacture a railroad towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Development was well in progress by July 1864. The standard measure Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was extending quickly from its base at Machynlleth, be that as it may, and in 1863 had come to Tywyn, so McConnel chose to assemble his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the closest point where slate could be exchanged to the standard check railroad. This was in spite of the line's underlying seclusion from the remainder of the framework as a result of challenges in crossing over the estuary of the Afon Dyfi toward the south. An Act of Parliament (28 and 29ÃÂ Vict, top cccxv) enabling the organization to work traveler prepares as an open railroad was given Royal Assent on 5 July 1865, and the organization named James Swinton Spooner as architect for the development. He spread out designs for a generally straight line climbing consistently from Tywyn to the quarry and work rapidly got in progress. By September 1866 development had progressed to the point where the Board of Trade auditor Captain Henry Tyler could make an underlying review and report.
