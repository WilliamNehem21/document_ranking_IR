By and large, the fossa shares highlights for all intents and purpose with three distinctive carnivoran families, driving scientists to put it and different individuals from Eupleridae then again in Herpestidae, Viverridae, and Felidae. Felid highlights are essentially those related with eating and processing, including tooth shape and facial bits of the skull, the tongue, and the stomach related tract, commonplace of its only predatory eating routine. The rest of the skull most intently looks like skulls of class "Viverra", while the general body structure is most like that of different individuals from Herpestidae. The lasting dentition is (three incisors, one canine, three or four premolars, and one molar on each side of both the upper and lower jaws), with the deciduous recipe being comparable however deficient with regards to the fourth premolar and the molar. The fossa has an expansive, conspicuous rhinarium like that of viverrids, however has nearly bigger, round ears, nearly as extensive as those of a comparatively measured felid. Its facial vibrissae (hairs) are long, with the longest being longer than its head. Like some mongoose genera, especially "Galidia" (which is currently in the fossa's very own family, Eupleridae) and "Herpestes" (of Herpestidae), it has carpal vibrissae also. Its paws are retractile, yet dissimilar to those of Felidae species, they are not covered up in skin sheaths. It has three sets of areolas (one inguinal, one ventral, and one pectoral).
