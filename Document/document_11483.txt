As the first Brigade pushed into Ramadi, it started forcefully pursuing the neighborhood clans for police initiates. This was basic in light of the fact that, as per Colonel MacFarland, "without their assistance, we would not have the capacity to enlist enough police to reclaim the whole city." After the Americans guaranteed the inborn pioneers in Ramadi that their men would not be sent outside of the city, the clans started sending men into the police constrain. The quantity of Iraqis joining the police went from 30 per month before June 2006 to 300 per month by July. AQI endeavored to dull police enlistment by assaulting one of the new Ramadi police headquarters with a vehicle bomb on 21 August, executing three Iraqi police. They all the while killed the Sunni sheik of the Abu Ali Jassim clan, who had energized a considerable lot of his tribesmen to join the Iraqi Police. The AQI contenders shrouded the body as opposed to abandoning it for the clan, abusing Islam's burial service customs and irritated the clan. This was one of the impetuses for what turned into an inborn rebel against AQI. As per David Kilcullen, who might later fill in as Senior Counterinsurgency Adviser to General Petraeus, the revolt started after AQI slaughtered a sheik over his refusal to give his little girls to them in marriage.
