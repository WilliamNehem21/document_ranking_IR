Promptly at night, "Voyager" had no troubles keeping up her situation amid the moves the two boats performed. Following a progression of swings expected to switch the courses of the two boats starting at 8:40ÃÂ pm, "Voyager" wound up to starboard of "Melbourne". At 8:52ÃÂ pm, "Voyager" was requested to continue the plane gatekeeper station. The method to achieve this expected "Voyager" to get some distance from "Melbourne" in a huge hover, cross behind the transporter, at that point take position off "Melbourne"s port side. Rather, "Voyager" first swung to starboard, far from "Melbourne", at that point swung to port abruptly. It was at first accepted by "Melbourne"s connect group that "Voyager" was leading a progression of tight swings to lose speed before swinging behind "Melbourne", however "Voyager" did not change course once more. At 8:55ÃÂ pm, with "Voyager" drawing nearer, "Melbourne"s pilot requested the transporter's motors to half toward the back speed, with Robertson requesting an expansion to full toward the back a couple of moments later. In the meantime, Stevens, having quite recently turned out to be mindful of the circumstance, gave the request "Full ahead the two motors. Hard-a starboard.", before training the destroyer's Quartermaster to declare that a crash was fast approaching. The two boats' measures were past the point where it is possible to maintain a strategic distance from an impact; "Melbourne" hit "Voyager" at 8:56ÃÂ pm.
