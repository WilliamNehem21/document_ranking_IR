Many locales in the Keweenaw Peninsula are frequently praised for their beauty and pristine appearances and Brockway Mountain Drive is no exception. The road has been recognized in numerous publications, dating back to the 1950s. The "Milwaukee Sentinel" profiled the "famous Brockway Mountain Drive" in 1956 in an article about a tourism boom to the region. More attention was focused on the roadway when Milwaukee's other newspaper, the "Milwaukee Journal", spotlighted the region in 1961 stating, "the road along the Brockway Mountain fault follows the Keweenaw Peninsula above Lake Superior, past ghost copper mines [toward] restored Fort Wilkins". "The New York Times" had similar praise in 1962, saying "a side trip that should not be missed is the Brockway Mountain DriveÂ ... for a panoramic view of the forest and the blue waters of Lake Superior." The "Chicago Tribune" called the overlook "breathtaking" in 1986, and the "Chicago Sun-Times" said that views from Brockway "rival[ed] any in New England" in 1990. The "Pioneer Press" of St. Paul profiled the area in 2005 saying that the tourists "cruise along Brockway Mountain Drive, renowned for fall color." The staff of "MLive", the online news presence of Booth Newspapers in Michigan, highlighted the height of the roadway, the view to Isle Royale, and the birdwatching opportunities in a profile of the area in 2007.
