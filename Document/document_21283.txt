"Resident Evil 5"s 2007 E3 trailer was criticized for depicting a white protagonist killing black enemies in a small African village. According to "Newsweek" editor N'Gai Croal, "There was a lot of imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic racist imagery", although he acknowledged that only the preview had been released. Takeuchi said the game's producers were completely surprised by the complaints. The second trailer for the game, released on May 31, 2008, revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the African BSAA agent Sheva, who assists the protagonist. Critics felt that Sheva's character was added to address the issue of racism, though Karen Dyer said the character had been in development before the first trailer was released. Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of "Resident Evil 5". He acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer, though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once the game was released and people were "able to play the game and see what it is for themselves". In a "Computer and Video Games" interview, producer Masachika Kawata also addressed the issue: "We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment businessâwe're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way."
