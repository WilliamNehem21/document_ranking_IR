In his book, "The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond", Ed Morales wrote that Miguel's collaboration with Manzanero "brought light to an overlooked master of [bolero]" and "was a significant update of the genre". "Romance" enhanced Silvetti's reputation as an arranger and producer; according to Leila Cobo of "Billboard", the album "categorically redefined the interpretations of traditional boleros" and "sparked a torrent of work for Silvetti, including records with Vic Damone and Engelbert Humperdinck". His arrangements became known as the "Silvetti Sound", which Cobo described as "anchored in sweeping melodies, lush string arrangements, acoustic instrumentation, and above all, unabashed romanticism". "Romance"s success encouraged Linda Ronstadt, JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez and PlÃ¡cido Domingo to record modern versions of traditional boleros. According to Miguel's former manager Mauricio Abaroa, although boleros were still recorded by traditional musicians at the time, "what made Luis Miguel so successful was that it was a young man singing them and that he sang them like modern ballads". During the "Billboard" Hot Latin Songs Chart's 25th anniversary in 2011, Miguel was number one on the Hot Latin Songs Top Artists chart. Manzanero reflected on their partnership, saying that he "put in the mouths of his generation all of the great romantic songs that had a 30-year history". In 2015, "Billboard" listed "Romance" as one of the Essential Latin Albums of Past 50 Years, an editor writes: "Whatâs become so formulaic in Latin music these days -- the tribute album by a contemporary artist honoring a genius of another era -- started with "Romance"".
