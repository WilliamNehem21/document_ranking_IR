Boyd's forerunner Arthur G. Hansen's "strong and dubious" answer for the two elements' issues was to totally incorporate the station into Georgia Tech's scholarly units. On paper, this would significantly build Georgia Tech's expressed research subsidizing (as every last bit of it would be performed through the scholarly units), and it would expand choices and money related guide for alumni understudies. Another, less exposed, reason was that Georgia Tech would access the agreement association's save subsidize, which was said to be over $1 million (equal to $ million in ). Thomas E. Stelson, Dean of the College of Engineering at Georgia Tech, was named to "redesign" the station. Openly, Stelson's errand was essentially to prescribe an arrangement for revamping, however the organization obviously expected for Georgia Tech and the Engineering Experiment Station to be firmly incorporated. Maurice W. Long, who was chief of the station at the time, saw the move as an infringement of the EES's sanction as administratively settled by the Georgia General Assembly in 1919, and attested that Georgia Tech did not have the specialist to blend the two foundations. EES representatives and business officials required with the station spoke to the Georgia Board of Regents and to Governor of Georgia (and future United States President) Jimmy Carter (himself a Georgia Tech former student); the debate got inclusion in both "The Technique" and the "Atlanta Constitution".
