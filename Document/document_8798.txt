The main normal names for this species were exacting interpretations of the logical names. At the point when distributed as "Josephia sessilis" in 1809, it was given the basic name "sessile Josephia". Darker did not offer a typical name when he distributed "Dryandra floribunda" in 1810, yet soon thereafter the "Hortus Kewensis" deciphered it as "many blossomed dryandra". This name was likewise utilized when the plant was highlighted in "Curtis' Botanical Magazine" in 1813. In Australia, the names "thorny banksia" and "shaving-brush blossom" were presented by Emily Pelloe in 1921, the last since "when in bud the bloom particularly looks like a shaving-brush". "Shaving-brush bloom" was still being used as late as the 1950s. The name "holly-leaved dryandra" was utilized when the plant was highlighted as a component of a progression of articles in the "Western Mail" of 1933Ã¢ÂÂ 34, and this was taken up by William Blackall in 1954, was still being used as late as 1970. In the mean time, Gardner utilized the name "parrot shrubbery" in 1959, a name got from the perception that the blossoms draw in parrots., by which the species was at that point "understood to honey bee attendants". This name was broadly embraced, and since 1970 has been in practically select utilization.
