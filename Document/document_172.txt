On the flying creature's temple was a stripped and pale blue frontal shield. This was encompassed by short, smooth dark plumes that reached out from the base of the bill to the zone just underneath and before the eye, while the zone beneath the eye was a pinkish wash. The fledgling's jaw and throat were scantily secured with dark, smooth plumes, while the neck was a slaty-blue that changed into a caramel dim bosom. The midriff and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-dim. The wing was slaty with a trace of darker at its base and turned into a warm, dim dark colored by the wingtips; the underwing was dark colored. The back was dim and progressed into a browner posterior, while the uppertail-coverts were a dull dirty dark with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and adjusted, was an exceptionally dim indigo that had a marginally purple glowing sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was powdery blue with a dark tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the adolescent is obscure. The winged creature's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the impact point, while the iris was a dim dark colored.
