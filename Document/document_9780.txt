Despite the fact that Henry Lumley's English mounted force had figured out how to cross the boggy ground around the Petite Gheete, it was soon apparent to Marlborough that adequate rangers backing would not be practicable and that the fight couldn't be won on the Allied right. The Duke, thusly, canceled the assault against Offus and Autre-Eglise. To ensure that Orkney complied with his request to pull back, Marlborough sent his Quartermaster-General face to face with the order. Notwithstanding Orkney's protestations, Cadogan demanded consistence and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their unique positions on the edge of the level of Jandrenouille. It is as yet not clear how far Orkney's development was arranged just as a bluff; as indicated by student of history David Chandler it is presumably progressively exact to deduce that Marlborough propelled Orkney in a genuine test with the end goal of sounding out the conceivable outcomes of the segment. By the by, the assault had filled its need. Villeroi had given his own thoughtfulness regarding that wing and fortified it with substantial collections of pony and foot that should have been partaking in the definitive battle south of Ramillies.
