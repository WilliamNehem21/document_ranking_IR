The way that Berger had the capacity to grow the SS battle troops so rapidly was a tribute to his improvisational abilities. On 1 December 1939, Himmler elevated Berger to head of the SS-HA. To a huge degree, Berger was the "father" of the "Waffen"- SS (or Armed SS), a term he begat in an understanding dated 2 March 1940. He utilized the new term to cover up contact between the SS-VT and SS-TV, as they were consolidated in new arrangements. Berger's freshly discovered specialist for SS selecting matters disturbed the head of the "Allgemeine-SS" regions, who had recently been in charge of this capacity. This reached a crucial stage when the head of "SS-Oberabschnitt SÃÂ¼dwest", "SS-GruppenfÃÂ¼hrer" Kurt Kaul would not perceive Berger's agent in his area, alluding to Berger as a "low-positioning domain manufacturer". Kaul's arrangement of letters to Berlin came to nothing, as the power and impact of the "Allgemeine-SS" had melted away with the episode of war and the induction of a significant number of its individuals into the Wehrmacht, "Waffen-SS" and police. Eventually, when Kaul took steps to capture Berger's representative in "SS-Oberabschnitt SÃÂ¼dwest", Himmler interceded actually in February 1940, expressing that "the most unsavory results" would occur for Kaul on the off chance that he didn't advocate Berger and his selecting association. Kaul assented, and Berger's matchless quality as SS enrolling supremo was immovably settled.
