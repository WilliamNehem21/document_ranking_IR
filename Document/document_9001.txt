Special raised area 12 is cut in the early Maya style and archeologists believe it to be a particularly early precedent dating to the initial segment of the Late Preclassic. Due to the carvings on the upper substance of the special raised area, it is assumed that the landmark was initially raised as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a flat special stepped area in the Classic. Right now 16 pictographs were cut around the external edge of the special stepped area. The cutting on the upper substance of the raised area speaks to a standing human figure depicted in profile, confronting left. The figure is flanked by two vertical arrangement of four glyphs. A littler profile figure is portrayed confronting the principal figure, isolated from it by one of the arrangement of glyphs. The focal figure is portrayed remaining upon a flat band speaking to the earth, the band is flanked by two earth beasts. Over the figure is a divine band with part of the leader of a sacrosanct feathered creature noticeable in the inside. The 16 glyphs on the edge of the landmark are framed by human figures blended with different components.
