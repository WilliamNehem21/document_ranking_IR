Burke and Hare's next unfortunate casualty was a well-known figure in the lanes of Edinburgh, James Wilson, a 18-year-elderly person with a limp brought about by disfigured feet. He was rationally handicapped and, as per Alanna Knight in her history of the homicides, was harmless; he was referred to locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived in the city and bolstered himself by asking. In November Hare attracted Wilson to his lodgings with the guarantee of whisky, and sent his significant other to get Burke. The two killers drove Wilson into a room, the entryway of which Margaret Hare bolted before driving the key back under the entryway. As Wilson disliked overabundance whiskyÃ¢ÂÂhe favored snuffÃ¢ÂÂhe was not as smashed as a large portion of the team's unfortunate casualties; he was additionally solid, and battled back against the two assailants, yet was overwhelmed and slaughtered in the ordinary way. His body was stripped and his couple of assets stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. At the point when the body was inspected the next day by Knox and his understudies, a few of them remembered it to be Wilson, yet Knox denied it could be anybody the understudies knew. At the point when word began coursing that Wilson was missing, Knox analyzed the body in front of the others that were being held away; the head and feet were evacuated before the primary dismemberment.
