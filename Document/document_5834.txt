"GodEatGod" is the primary tune on the record. It opens with the sound of a mechanical screen in moderate movement catching shots ringing out of sight while spectators shout and after that pursues Adam as he contemplates in the desert. The melody is driven by consoles, synthesizers and a synth bass. "The Love Song" was portrayed by Manson as about "America's sentiment with firearms", and its title started from his perception that "Adoration Song" is a standout amongst the most well-known titles in music. The verses are formed around an intricate representation about weapons. Manson clarified: "I was proposing with the verses that the dad is the hand, the mother is the weapon, and the youngsters are the projectiles. Where you shoot them is your duty as guardians." The tune is an expository interpretation of a mainstream American guard sticker: "Do you cherish your God, firearm, government?" "Kerrang!" portrayed "The Fight Song" as a "play area punk hymn", and Manson uncovered that its topic is Adam's longing to be a piece of Holy Wood, saying that it is around "an individual who's adult for his entire life suspecting that the grass is greener on the opposite side, yet when he at last [gets there], he understands that it's more terrible than where he originated from." "Expendable Teens" is a "signature Marilyn Manson melody" with a skipping guitar riff made out of staccato verbalization. Its verses compare the disappointment of contemporary millenial youth with the progressive optimism of their child of post war America guardians' age. The Beatles' impact is apparent in this tune; the tune echoes the dissatisfaction of the "White Album" "Insurgency 1".
