Things reached a crucial stage in pre-winter 1246, when Kaliman of Bulgaria kicked the bucket, leaving the nation in the hands of a rule for his more youthful sibling Michael Asen (). Vatatzes immediately assaulted Bulgaria, and inside three months caught the vast majority of Thrace and all of eastern and northern Macedonia, while Michael II of Epirus likewise exploited the chance to venture into Albania and northwestern Macedonia. At the end of this battle in November, as Vatatzes was settled at Melnik, he was educated of a scheme to oust Demetrios and convey Thessalonica to him in return for a chrysobull ensuring the conventional rights and benefits of the city. Vatatzes promptly conceded this, and sent emissaries to Demetrios calling for him to show up face to face at his camp. Demetrios, suspicious of Vatatzes' goals, cannot, and the Nicaeans walked on Thessalonica. Following a couple of days, the plotters paved the way for the Nicaean armed force, and the city was immediately caught. Demetrios was caught and banished to Lentiana in Bithynia, while Thessalonica and all of Macedonia were set under the administration of the Grand Domestic Andronikos Palaiologos. Theodore himself, disconnected and without power in his shelter at Vodena, evidently stayed uninvolved in these occasions.
