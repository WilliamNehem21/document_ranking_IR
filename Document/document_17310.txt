Ãthelwulf was the son of Egbert, King of Wessex from 802 to 839. His mother's name is unknown, and he had no recorded siblings. He is known to have had two wives in succession, and so far as is known, Osburh, the senior of the two, was the mother of all his children. She was the daughter of Oslac, described by Asser, biographer of their son Alfred the Great, as "King Ãthelwulf's famous butler", a man who was descended from Jutes who had ruled the Isle of Wight. Ãthelwulf had six known children. His eldest son, Ãthelstan, was old enough to be appointed King of Kent in 839, so he must have been born by the early 820s, and he died in the early 850s. The second son, Ãthelbald, is first recorded as a charter witness in 841, and if, like Alfred, he began to attest when he was around six, he would have been born around 835; he was King of Wessex from 858 to 860. Ãthelwulf's third son, Ãthelberht, was probably born around 839 and was king from 860 to 865. The only daughter, Ãthelswith, married Burgred, King of Mercia, in 853. The other two sons were much younger: Ãthelred was born around 848 and was king from 865 to 871, and Alfred was born around 849 and was king from 871 to 899. In 856 Ãthelwulf married Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, King of West Francia and future Holy Roman Emperor, and his wife Ermentrude. Osburh had probably died, although it is possible that she had been repudiated. There were no children from Ãthelwulf's marriage to Judith, and after his death she married his eldest surviving son and successor, Ãthelbald.
