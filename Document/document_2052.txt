In 1962, Arsenal made the intense at the end of the day fruitless advance of naming previous England and Wolves commander Billy Wright as supervisor, regardless of his absence of administrative experience and the reality he had no related knowledge with the club. Like his two quick antecedents, Wright was not fruitful, despite the fact that it was under his authority that the club made their presentation in European challenge, in the 1963Ã¢ÂÂ 64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the wake of completing seventh in 1962Ã¢ÂÂ 63. In his last season, Arsenal completed fourteenth, their most reduced position in 36 years, and recorded the least participation at Highbury Ã¢ÂÂ 4,554 of every a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966. The main Arsenal player to figure in England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning squad was George Eastham, who did not play at all amid the competition. Wright was expelled by the Arsenal board in the mid year of 1966, and was supplanted by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee. Despite the fact that the club's chiefs did not know it at the time, Mee would pivot the club and lead them to progress both in Europe and at home inside the following five years.
