Roger of Hoveden composed two essential works: the "Gesta Henrici II" ("Deeds of Henry II", then again titled "Gesta Henrici et Ricardi", "Deeds of Henry and Richard") and the "Chronica", the last a re-worked and enhanced rendition of the previous. These works are the most critical and profitable hotspots for Scottish history in the late twelfth century. The "Gesta Henrici II" covers the period from 1169 to April 1192, and the "Chronica" covers occasions until 1201. Roger of Hoveden is especially essential in connection to what is presently south-western Scotland, the place that is known for the Gall-Gaidhil. He filled in as an emissary in the district in 1174 for the benefit of the English ruler, and in this way his record of, for instance, the methodology of Donnchadh's dad Gille-Brighde towards the English lord originates from an observer. History specialists depend on Roger's compositions for various vital insights regarding Donnchadh's life: that Gille-Brighde gave Donnchadh over as a prisoner to Henry II under the consideration of Hugh de Morwic, Sheriff of Cumberland; that Donnchcadh wedded the little girl of Alan fitz Walter under dissent from the Scottish lord; and that Donnchadh battled a fight in Ireland in 1197 helping John de Courcy, Prince of Ulster.
