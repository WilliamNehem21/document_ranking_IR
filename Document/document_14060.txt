As the quadraphonic blend of the collection was not then total, the band (except for Wright) boycotted the press gathering held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The visitors were, rather, given a group of four of life-sized cardboard patterns of the band, and the stereo blend of the collection was displayed through a low quality open location framework. For the most part, in any case, the press were energetic; "Tune Maker"s Roy Hollingworth depicted side one as "so completely mistook for itself it was hard to pursue", however commended side two, stating: "The tunes, the sounds, the rhythms were strong and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band shook and rolled, and after that spouted and stumbled away into the night." Steve Peacock of "Sounds" expressed: "I couldn't care less in the event that you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd wholeheartedly prescribe everybody to "The Dark Side of the Moon"". In his 1973 survey for "Moving Stone" magazine, Loyd Grossman announced "Clouded Side" "a fine collection with a textural and theoretical extravagance that welcomes, yet requests association". In "" (1981), Robert Christgau discovered its expressive thoughts unoriginal and its music pompous, however considered it a "kitsch perfect work of art" that can be enchanting with features, for example, taped discourse sections, Parry's saxophone, and studio impacts which improve Gilmour's guitar performances.
