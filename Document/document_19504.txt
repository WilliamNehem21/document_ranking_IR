In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-SaÃ«ns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-SaÃ«ns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the AbbÃ© Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-SaÃ«ns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale de Musique, with its motto, ""Ars Gallica"", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-SaÃ«ns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, FaurÃ©, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members.
As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-SaÃ«ns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first "poÃ¨me symphonique" was "Le Rouet d'Omphale" (1871), premiered at a concert of the SociÃ©te Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-SaÃ«ns finally had one of his operas staged. "La princesse jaune" ("The Yellow Princess"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the OpÃ©ra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.
