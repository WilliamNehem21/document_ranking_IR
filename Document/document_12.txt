Byrne and Powell arranged three represents the execution of social credit: the "Credit of Alberta Regulation Act", the "Bank Employees Civil Rights Act", and the "Judicature Act Amendment Act". The main required all investors to get a permit from the Social Credit Commission and made a directorate for the control of each bank, most individuals from which would be named by the Social Credit Board. The second anticipated unlicensed banks and their representatives from starting common activities. The third kept any individual from testing the lawfulness of Alberta's laws in court without accepting the endorsement of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Each of the three demonstrations were immediately passed. New Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, requested to give imperial consent, called Aberhart and Attorney-General Hugill to his office. He inquired as to whether, as a legal advisor, he trusted that the proposed laws were sacred; Hugill answered that he didn't. Aberhart said that he would assume liability for the bills, which Bowen then marked. As they left the gathering, Aberhart approached Hugill for his acquiescence, which he got. Not long after, the national government denied each of the three demonstrations. Powell was not debilitated, expressing that the demonstrations "had been attracted up chiefly to demonstrate the general population of Alberta who were their "genuine" adversaries, and in that regard they succeeded splendidly."
