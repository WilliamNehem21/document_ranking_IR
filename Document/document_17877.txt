The leaders of the English Benedictine reform were Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury (959â988), Ãthelwold, Bishop of Winchester (963â984), and Oswald, Archbishop of York (971â992). Dunstan and Ãthelwold reached maturity in Ãthelstan's cosmopolitan, intellectual court in the 930s, where they met monks from the European reformed houses which provided the inspiration for the English movement. In the early 940s Dunstan was appointed Abbot of Glastonbury, where he was joined by Ãthelwold, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform. The Rule of Saint Benedict was translated into Old English at this time, probably by Ãthelwold, and it is the only surviving prose translation of the Rule into a European vernacular in the early Middle Ages. In about 954 Ãthelwold wished to go to the Continent to study reforms there at first hand, but King Eadred (946â955) refused him permission and appointed him Abbot of Abingdon, which became the second centre. Dunstan was exiled by King Eadwig (955â959) between 956 and 958, and he spent this time observing Benedictine practices at St Peter's Abbey in Ghent. Ãthelwold on the other hand appears to have been on good terms with Eadwig, an early indication that the reformers were not united politically. Oswald was a nephew of Oda, Archbishop of Canterbury from 941 to 958. Oda, a supporter of reform, introduced Oswald to Fleury, where he was ordained and spent a large part of the 950s.
