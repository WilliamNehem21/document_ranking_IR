"Drosera regia" plants are genuinely substantial herbs that produce even woody rhizomes and a crown of extensive, straight surrenders over to long and wide. The leaves have stalked organs (limbs) on the upper surface of the lamina along almost the whole length of the leaf. The leaves need petioles and stipules, rising by circinate vernation (uncurling) and decreasing to a filiform point. The limbs and the leaf itself are fit for reacting to prey by bowing toward creepy crawlies caught in the sticky adhesive delivered by the organs. Leaves are even fit for collapsing over themselves a few times. Each leaf can have a huge number of limbs, which can help in the maintenance of bigger prey when joined with the leaf wrapping firmly around caught creepy crawlies. In its local territory, "D.ÃÂ regia" has been known to catch substantial creepy crawlies, moths and butterflies. Plants go lethargic amid the colder season and structure a torpid bud, comprising of a tight group of short, juvenile leaves. Plants start to break lethargy in mid-July with a commonplace developing season enduring from October to April, however this is variable and plants can keep developing all year without torpidity. Singular leaves kick the bucket back yet stay joined to the short stem, dress the base bit of the plant in the darkened dead leaves of previous years.
