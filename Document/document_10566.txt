"Inocybe saliceticola" was first portrayed in 2009 by Jukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen in the diary "Karstenia", in light of around 20 examples from Finland, most of which were gathered by the creators. The holotype was gathered from the shore of lake Pahakala, close Nurmes. The particular name "saliceticola" is in reference to the way that the species develops among willow ("Salix"). Inside the sort "Inocybe", "I.ÃÂ saliceticola" has a place with the area "Marginatae", as characterized by Rolf Singer. The segment has been characterized in a few different ways. It was built up in 1933 by Robert KÃÂ¼hner, who distinguished two key attributes: a stem which does not include a cortina (a delicate, spider web like fractional cloak) however is altogether secured by cystidia, and the nearness of a marginate "knob" at the base of the stem. Vocalist improved the area in 1986 to consider that a knob isn't constantly present. A somewhat extraordinary infrageneric scientific classification was offered by Thom Kuyper in 1986. He, similar to Singer, gathered "Marginatae" under "Inocybe" subg. "Inocybe", yet he marked it a "supersection". In any case, phylogenetic investigations have shown that neither one of the singers' segment "Marginatae" nor Kuyper's "supersection" "Marginatae" genuinely structure monophyletic gatherings, however that Singer's area comes nearer to doing as such. Species inside "Marginatae" like "I.ÃÂ saliceticola" incorporate "I.ÃÂ obtusiuscula", "I.ÃÂ dunensis", "I.ÃÂ salicis-herbaceae", "I.ÃÂ substellata", "I.ÃÂ praetervisa", "I.ÃÂ salicis" and "I.ÃÂ mixtilis". These species are altogether known to connect with willow, and all have naturally visible similitudes.
