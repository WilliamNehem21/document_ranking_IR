Huskisson's pine box was set on a trestle table in the Town Hall, hung with dark velvet and secured with feathered tufts. Somewhere in the range of 9.00 and 10.00ÃÂ am a flood of grievers were guided to the box by a gathering of truncheon men. At 10.00 two quiets guided the grievers out of the town lobby and mounted steeds; the downpour and hail had at this point facilitated. The quiets drove the parade, trailed by the grievers from the town lobby and around 1,100 different grievers who had held up outside. These grievers walked six side by side, and were trailed by the burial service council, 28 neighborhood ministers and two additional quiets. Behind this gathering walked Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages conveying the pall-bearers, a gathering of neighborhood dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, trailed by two additional quiets. Behind this pair of quiets was a funeral car conveying the casket, trailed by Huskisson's partners and his enduring siblings Thomas and Samuel. These thus were trailed by around 900 local people in grieving dress who had chosen to join the parade, bringing the cortÃÂ¨ge to around a large portion of a mile (0.8ÃÂ km) long. The Duke of Wellington, arguing an earlier duty to go to a supper in Birmingham, did not visit.
