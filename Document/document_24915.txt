The scenes in which Chef, and later the lead turkey, don blue and white war paint and speak inspirational words to their armies are a parody of "Braveheart", the 1995 Mel Gibson-directed film about Scottish historical hero William Wallace. Parker said it was the first of many times a film was spoofed in a "South Park" episode, even though both said they enjoyed "Braveheart". During class, Mr. Garrison incorrectly tells the children the internationally known English pop singer Engelbert Humperdinck was the first man to walk on the moon. Also in the classroom, when it is suggested some poor people would rather die than go to a poorhouse, Cartman says, "Well then perhaps they should â and decrease the surplus population!" The line is lifted word-for-word from the Charles Dickens novella "A Christmas Carol", prompting Mr. Garrison to respond, "Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day." Kyle incorrectly tells Stan that Sally Struthers appeared on "Full House", an American sitcom that ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s; she actually starred in the 1970s series "All in the Family". When Dr. Mephisto asks Chef to look into his microscope, Chef says he sees "an extreme close-up of Vanessa Redgrave's private parts", a reference to the Academy Award-winning English actress. At the end of the episode, Stan said it is important to remember the images of starving children on television are "just as real as you or I". Kyle says by that logic, MacGyver is a real person too, a reference to the secret agent protagonist from the 1980s television series of the same name.
