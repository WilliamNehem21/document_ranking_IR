On 9 April, the Germans continued their advance, and all elements of both divisions of LI Infantry Corps had finally unloaded in Graz. In view of German success, the Italian 2nd Army in north-eastern Italy accelerated its preparations and issued orders for its V and XI Corps to conduct preliminary operations aimed at improving their starting positions for the planned attack on Yugoslavia. In the meantime, the 7th Army continued rapidly withdrawing its right wing, while withdrawing its centre and keeping the Mountain Detachment "RiÅ¡najaski" in place on its left flank. The 38th Infantry Division "Dravska" continued to withdraw south from Ptuj through Krapina towards Zagreb, while the 32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski" and Mountain Detachment "Triglavski" fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river. Units of LI Infantry Corps crossed the Drava along the line MariborâPtuj and further east, and continued to expand their bridgehead south of Maribor. Elements of XXXXIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the Karawanks railway tunnel near Jesenice and expanded their bridgehead at Dravograd. Italian units made several weak attacks on the sector of the 32nd Infantry Division "Triglavski" and against Mountain Detachment "RiÅ¡najaski", and Detachment "Lika" took up positions on the coast. On the same day, the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group airfield at Cerklje was again attacked by German aircraft.
