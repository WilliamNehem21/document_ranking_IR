Stone declined a role in the action comedy film "21 Jump Street" after signing on to Marc Webb's 2012 film "The Amazing Spider-Man", a reboot of Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" series. She portrayed Gwen Stacy, the love interest of the title character (played by Andrew Garfield). Stone returned to a blond hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously. She told "The Vancouver Sun" that she felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man and admitted that she had not read the comics: "My experience was with the Sam Raimi moviesÂ ... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love", adding that she was only familiar with Stacy's character from Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in "Spider-Man 3". "The Amazing Spider-Man" was a commercial success and was the seventh highest-grossing film of 2012 with global revenues of $757.9 million. "Entertainment Weekly" Lisa Schwarzbaum found Stone "irresistible", and Ian Freer of "Empire" magazine was particularly impressed with Stone's and Garfield's performances. At the annual People's Choice Awards ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress. Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game, "Sleeping Dogs", which earned her a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female nomination.
