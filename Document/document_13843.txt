On the morning of 31 July, third Battalion continued east on the Mt. Tenjo street towards the island capital of Agana, which it freed that day after token opposition. By 1045, 15ÃÂ minutes after its units entered the city, third Battalion had achieved the focal court and halted at the northern edges by early afternoon. Continuing the hostile at 1545, third Battalion pushed forward 1,500ÃÂ yards to catch key street intersections that prompted the towns of Finegayan and Barrigada. For the staying ten days of the crusade, the force walked upper east up the coast, experiencing incidental Japanese obstruction, until the island was proclaimed secure on 10 August. Be that as it may, the Japanese were not completely crushed. On 7 August, as third Battalion drove the regimental development towards Road Junction 460, Japanese mounted guns shells started arriving among the propelling Marines. After Marines found the wellspring of flame, a 75mm gunnery piece, the Japanese fled. The last activity by third Battalion amid the crusade was on 9 August when a close-by regiment went under overwhelming Japanese tank and infantry assault. Pioneering a trail through the wilderness, third Battalion surged towards the activity yet the Japanese tanks evaporated before the brigade could arrive. Setbacks for the third Battalion were twice that of Bougainville, with 300 injured and 97 murdered.
