More often than not, a scene of "The X-Files" expected editors to make between 8001200 film cuts, yet "X-Cops" just required 45. Amid after generation, a minor contention broke out between Vince Gilligan and the system. Initially, Gilligan did not need the "X-Files" logo to show up whenever amid the scene. He focused on that he needed "X-Cops" to feel like a "scene of "Cops" that happened to include Mulder and Scully." The system, expecting that individuals would not comprehend that "X-Cops" was really a scene of "The X-Files", vetoed this thought. A trade off was in the long run achieved: the scene would open with the "Cops" signature tune, yet "The X-Files" credits would likewise show up after the opening scene. Likewise, the business guards would highlight red and blue lights moving quickly over "The X-Files" logo while discourse is heard out of sight, along these lines to the "Cops" logo. The scene additionally includes a disclaimer toward the starting educating watchers that the scene is an extraordinary portion of "The X-Files" to keep watchers from feeling that the show "has been acquired for this present week by "Cops"".
