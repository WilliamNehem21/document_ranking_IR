When rebel forces entered the palace, the NgÃ´ brothers were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon. The brothers had kept in communication with the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing that they were still in the palace. The NgÃ´ brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at TÃ¢n SÆ¡n Nhá»©t Air Base. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the NgÃ´ brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain Nguyá»n VÄn Nhung, and on Major DÆ°Æ¡ng Hiáº¿u NghÄ©a, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the NgÃ´s' corpses surfaced in the media.
