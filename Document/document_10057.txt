An osteological examination of the bones by Jo Appleby indicated them to be in commonly great condition and to a great extent total with the exception of the missing feet, which may have been decimated by Victorian structure work. It was quickly evident that the body had endured significant wounds, and additional proof of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull hints at two deadly wounds; the base of the back of the skull had been totally removed by a bladed weapon, which would have uncovered the mind, and another bladed weapon had been pushed through the correct side of the skull, striking within the left side through the cerebrum. Somewhere else on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had infiltrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had cut the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without entering it. Different gaps in the skull and lower jaw were observed to be reliable with knife wounds to the jaw and cheek. The various injuries on the ruler's skull showed that he was not wearing his head protector, which he may have either expelled or lost when he was by walking after his pony had turned out to be stuck in the swamp. One of his correct ribs had been cut by a sharp actualize, as had the pelvis. There was no proof of the wilted arm that harrowed the character in William Shakespeare's play "Richard III".
