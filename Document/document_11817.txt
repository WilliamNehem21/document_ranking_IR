Gardner was determined to have introverted identity issue. In June 1985, Gardner conceded to the homicide of Otterstrom and got a sentence of life detainment without the likelihood of parole. At a certain point, Gardner took steps to disturb resulting court hearings since he was annoyed with being required to wear a leg support that would bolt on the off chance that he endeavored to escape once more. He was prompted by watchmen that it would be to his advantage to carry on before imminent legal hearers. Region Judge Jay E. Banks trained the jury, on October 22, 1985, that they had the choice of a decision for the lesser offense of murder on the off chance that they observed Gardner to be under mental or passionate pressure when he shot Burdell. The members of the jury thought under three hours and discovered Gardner liable of capital homicide. At last condemned to death, Gardner chose execution by terminating squad over deadly infusion. Officials in Utah wiped out the terminating squad as a technique for execution in 2004, yet convicts who were condemned before that date, for example, Gardner, could in any case select that alternative. Since 1976, just two other individuals have been executed by terminating squad in the United States, both in Utah: Gary Gilmore and John Albert Taylor. As opposed to Taylor, who said he picked the terminating squad to humiliate the express, Gardner's lawyer said that his customer did not have any desire to draw in consideration and essentially liked to bite the dust along these lines.
