After the war finished in 1815 the "Old Republicans" in Congress, with their Jeffersonian belief system for economy in the government, tried to decrease the activities and funds of the War Department. Calhoun's political contention with William H. Crawford, the Secretary of the Treasury, over the quest for the administration in the 1824 race, convoluted Calhoun's residency as War Secretary. The general absence of military activity following the war implied that a substantial armed force, for example, that favored by Calhoun, was never again thought to be vital. The "Radicals", a gathering of solid states' rights supporters who for the most part supported Crawford for president in the coming race, were naturally suspicious of expansive armed forces. Some purportedly likewise needed to impede Calhoun's own presidential desires for that race. Subsequently, on March 2, 1821, Congress passed the Reduction Act, which decreased the quantity of enrolled men of the military significantly, from 11,709 to 5,586, and the quantity of the officer corps by a fifth, from 680 to 540. Calhoun, however concerned, offered little challenge. Afterward, to furnish the military with a progressively composed direction structure, which had been seriously missing amid the War of 1812, he designated Major General Jacob Brown to a position that would later end up known as "Instructing General of the United States Army".
