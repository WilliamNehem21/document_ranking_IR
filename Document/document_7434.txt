The Bull Run River starts at Bull Run Lake, a characteristic waterway adjusted somewhat by the Portland Water Bureau, close Hiyo Mountain in the Mount Hood Wilderness. Beginning in Clackamas County north of Forest Road 18 (Lolo Pass Road), its anonymous headwater tributaries enter the lake. Streaming northwest from the lake, the waterway promptly enters Multnomah County and proceeds with commonly northwest for about . Along this stretch, the waterway streams by a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream measure at stream mile (RM)ÃÂ 20.9 or waterway kilometer (RK)ÃÂ 30.6, goes under Forest Road 1025 and Forest Road 10 and gets Blazed Alder Creek from the left and Log Creek and Falls Creek, both from the right. At that point the waterway turns southwest and passes another stream measure just before entering Bull Run River ReservoirÃÂ 1 at RMÃÂ 15 (RKÃÂ 24). Likewise entering the supply are Fir Creek from the left, North Fork Bull Run River from the right, at that point Deer, Cougar, and Bear rivers, all from the right. The Bull Run River leaves the repository by means of a spillway from the waterway mouth. Woodland Road 10 runs generally parallel to the correct bank of the waterway from close to the headwaters to Southwest Bull Run Road, close to the mouth.
