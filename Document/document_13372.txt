Amid the main decade of the twentieth century, Shaw verified a firm notoriety as a dramatist. In 1904 J. E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker set up an organization at the Royal Court Theater in Sloane Square, Chelsea to exhibit present day show. Throughout the following five years they arranged fourteen of Shaw's plays. The principal, "John Bull's Other Island", a satire around an Englishman in Ireland, pulled in driving government officials and was seen by Edward VII, who snickered so much that he broke his seat. The play was retained from Dublin's Abbey Theater, because of a paranoid fear of the attack it may incite, in spite of the fact that it was appeared at the city's Royal Theater in November 1907. Shaw later composed that William Butler Yeats, who had mentioned the play, "got preferably increasingly over he expected... It was uncongenial to the entire soul of the neo-Gaelic development, which is set on making another Ireland after its own optimal, though my play is a firm presentment of the genuine old Ireland." Nonetheless, Shaw and Yeats were dear companions; Yeats and Lady Gregory attempted fruitlessly to convince Shaw to take up the empty co-directorship of the Abbey Theater after J. M. Synge's demise in 1909. Shaw appreciated different figures in the Irish Literary Revival, including George Russell and James Joyce, and was a dear companion of SeÃÂ¡n O'Casey, who was enlivened to turn into a dramatist in the wake of perusing "John Bull's Other Island".
