While the honey bee orchid indicated adjustment for self-treatment, its system additionally empowered periodic cross-preparation, making the natural decent variety that Darwin felt was required for overwhelming survival, which couldn't be given independent from anyone else treatment. For instance of "how wonderfully everything is created", Darwin depicted how he had discovered that in "Spiranthes" blooms the dust is prepared for gathering before access is open for the female organ to get dust. At Torquay he had watched honey bees visiting towers of these blossoms, beginning at the base of the tower and stirring their way up to the highest blooms. He estimated that if honey bees moved from top to top of the towers, the dust bunches they gathered from the most as of late opened blossoms would be squandered as the highest blooms on the following spike would not be prepared to get dust. A honey bee beginning at the least blossoms on the principal tower it visited would proceed up until it achieved blooms that still had their dust masses to join to the honey bee, at that point would travel to the develop lower blossoms on another plant, and treat them. By this co-ordinated process, the honey bee would include "to her store of nectar" while propagating the blossoms "which will yield nectar to future ages of honey bees".
