Wodehouse expected to pursue Armine to the University of Oxford, however the family's accounts got ugly at the urgent minute. Ernest Wodehouse had resigned in 1895, and his annuity was paid in rupees; variance against the pound decreased its incentive in Britain. Wodehouse reviewed, "The wolf was not really crying at the entryway and there was dependably a touch of something in the kitty for the butcher and the food merchant, however the funds would not rushed to anything in the idea of a sprinkle". Rather than a college profession, in September 1900 Wodehouse was occupied with a lesser position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and discovered the work confounding and uncongenial. He later composed a diverting record of his encounters at the bank, however at the time he ached for the finish of each working day, when he could come back to his leased lodgings in Chelsea and compose. At first he focused, with some achievement, on genuine articles about school sports for "Government funded School Magazine". In November 1900 his first comic piece, "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings", was acknowledged by "Tit-Bits". Another magazine for young men, "The Captain", gave further generously compensated chances, and amid his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces distributed in a sum of nine magazines.
