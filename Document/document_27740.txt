Vast crowds of locals began flocking to pay homage to Long, vowing to contribute labour and finance in an effort to expel the French from Vietnam and install Long as the independent monarch. By this time, Long was claiming to have received a letter from Cuong De, which supposedly confirmed his royal descent. Long's followers spared no expense in decorating Long with royal accoutrements. They made a medallion inscribed "Phan XÃ­ch Long HÃ²ang Äáº¿" (Emperor Phan XÃ­ch Long) and a royal seal with a dragon's head with the words "Äáº¡i Minh Quá»c, Phan XÃ­ch Long HÃ²ang Äáº¿, ThiÃªn tá»­" ("Greater Ming State, Emperor Phan XÃ­ch Long, Son of Heaven"). The words "Äáº¡i Minh" were interpreted as either having arbitrarily been copied from local Chinese Vietnamese secret society slogans, or as a strategic ploy to invoke the names of the Ming Dynasty to appeal to the Chinese who had emigrated to Vietnam after the fall of the Ming. Long's supporters produced a sword with the inscription "TiÃªn Äáº£ hÃ´n quÃ¢n, háº­u Äáº£ loáº¡n tháº§n" ("First strike the debauched king, next the traitorous officials") and a ring inscribed "DÃ¢n CÃ´ng" ("Popular Tribute"). From then on, Long presented himself as the emperor and signed documents under the royal title.
