The Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) was a dark structure long, wide, and high. There was one control room and one exchange space for each pair of racks, with the exception of the last one, which had its very own control and exchange spaces for preparing purposes. Four siphons drew for every moment of cooling water from the Clinch River. Steam siphons were uncommonly structured by Pacific Pumps Inc. The plant was intended to utilize the whole yield of the K-25 powerhouse, yet as K-25 phases came online there was rivalry for this. It was chosen to assemble another kettle plant. Twelve surplus boilers initially expected for destroyer escorts were obtained from the naval force. The lower hot divider temperature because of the decreased steam weight ( rather than the of the pilot plant) was made up for by the simplicity of activity. Since they were oil-terminated, an oil tank ranch was included, with adequate capacity to work the plant for 60 days. Notwithstanding the Thermal Diffusion Process Building (F01) and the new steam plant (F06) structures, structures in the S-50 territory incorporated the siphoning station (F02), research facilities, a cafeteria, machine shop (F10), distribution centers, a corner store, and a water treatment plant (F03).
