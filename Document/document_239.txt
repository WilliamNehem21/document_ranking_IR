Following the arrival of "The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking", Waters freely demanded that Pink Floyd would not rejoin. He reached O'Rourke to examine settling future eminence installments. O'Rourke felt obliged to illuminate Mason and Gilmour, which maddened Waters, who needed to expel him as the band's administrator. He fired his administration contract with O'Rourke and utilized Peter Rudge to deal with his undertakings. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia reporting he had left the band, and requested that they discharge him from his authoritative commitments. Gilmour trusted that Waters left to rush the downfall of Pink Floyd. Waters later expressed that, by not making new collections, Pink Floyd would be in rupture of agreementÃ¢ÂÂwhich would recommend that eminence installments would be suspendedÃ¢ÂÂand that the other band individuals had constrained him from the gathering by taking steps to sue him. He at that point went to the High Court with an end goal to break up the band and keep the utilization of the Pink Floyd name, proclaiming Pink Floyd "a spent power inventively." When his legal counselors found that the organization had never been formally affirmed, Waters came back to the High Court trying to acquire a veto over further utilization of the band's name. Gilmour reacted by issuing a deliberately worded public statement avowing that Pink Floyd would keep on existing. He later told "The Sunday Times": "Roger is a canine in the trough and I'm going to battle him." In 2013, Waters said he had neglected to value that the Pink Floyd name had business esteem free of the band individuals, and wasn't right to have endeavored to stop the others utilizing it.
