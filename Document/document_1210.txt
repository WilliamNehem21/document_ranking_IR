Toward the start of Edward's rule, his mom Ealhswith established the nunnery of St Mary for nuns, known as the Nunnaminster, in Winchester. Edward's girl Eadburh turned into a cloister adherent there, and she was worshiped as a holy person and the subject of a hagiography by Osbert of Clare in the twelfth century. In 901, Edward began building a noteworthy religious network for men, conceivably as per his dad's desires. The religious community was alongside Winchester Cathedral, which wound up known as the Old Minster while Edward's establishment was known as the New Minster. It was a lot bigger than the Old Minster, and was likely expected as an illustrious tomb. It obtained relics of the Breton Saint Judoc, which likely landed in England from Ponthieu in 901, and the assortment of one of Alfred's nearest counselors, Grimbald, who kicked the bucket around the same time and who was before long loved as a holy person. Edward's mom kicked the bucket in 902, and he covered her and Alfred there, moving his dad's body from the Old Minster. Entombments in the mid 920s included Edward himself, his sibling ÃÂthelweard, and his child ÃÂlfweard. Then again, when ÃÂthelstan progressed toward becoming ruler in 924, he didn't demonstrate any support to his dad's establishment, most likely in light of the fact that Winchester sided against him when the position of royalty was questioned after Edward's demise. The main other ruler covered at the New Minster was Eadwig in 959.
