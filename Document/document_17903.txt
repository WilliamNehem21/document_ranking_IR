"Single Ladies" appeared at number six on the "Eye Weekly"s critics' list of the Best Singles of 2008, and at number six on About.com's Mark Edward Nero's list of the Best R&B Songs of 2008. On "The Village Voice"s year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, "Single Ladies" was ranked at numbers three and forty one in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Additionally, the Maurice Joshua Club Mix of the song was ranked at number 443 on the 2008 list. "Single Ladies" was named the best song of the 2000s decade by Black Entertainment Television (BET). Sarah Rodman, writing for "The Boston Globe", named "Single Ladies" the fourth most irresistible song of the decade, and stated, "[BeyoncÃ©] combined leotards with crass engagement-bling baiting into one delicious sexy-yet-antiquated package. The video had the whole world dancing and waving along via YouTube." VH1 ranked "Single Ladies" at number sixteen on its list of The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. In his book "Eating the Dinosaur" (2009), Chuck Klosterman wrote that "Single Ladies" is "arguably the first song overtly marketed toward urban bachelorette parties". Jody Rosen of "The New Yorker" credited the melodies that float and dart over the thump for creating a new sound in music that didn't exist in the world before BeyoncÃ©. He further wrote, "If they sound 'normal' now, it's because BeyoncÃ©, and her many followers, have retrained our ears."
