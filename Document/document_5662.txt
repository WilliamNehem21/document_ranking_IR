Brett Love of TV Squad, then again, "[stopped] shy of calling [it] a great finale". While the arrangement's result was "fabulous"Ã¢ÂÂ he was astonished by Dean's passing, and anticipated its suggestions for the fourth seasonÃ¢ÂÂLove was somewhat baffled with Lilith. McCormick "awed" him as Lilith, yet he didn't discover her as "threatening and alarming" as Fredric Lehne's Azazel. The scalawag's storyline of threatening a family would have made an "extraordinary ordinary scene", however was not epic enough for a finale. Diana Steenbergen of IGN felt the scenes of Lilith's shore leave quickly "[dragged] the scene down" in light of the fact that the watchers "comprehended the circumstance rapidly enough". She generally enjoyed the scene, and gave it a score of 8.9 out of 10. Steenbergen appreciated the "top notch charitable scenes", and was cheerful that the arrangement finished its guarantee of sending Dean to Hell, remarking that the related hellhound assault was "one of the scariest things the show has done yet". Like Charles, she commended the acting, taking note of that "we feel [Dean's] dread as the due date approaches". She proceeded to compose that Padalecki's "best minutes are in the scarcely contained anger at his powerlessness to spare his sibling, and in his pain at losing Dean", while "Lilith and her daughter idiosyncrasies in Ruby's body were undeniably all the more chilling, and intriguing, than Ruby's extreme chick persona ever has been".
