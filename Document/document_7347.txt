Smith said that he trusted that he would be neglectful in his obligation on the off chance that he enabled Rhodesia to proceed to "float in its present deadening condition of vulnerability", and that following Britain's relinquishment of the Federation his legislature was resolved that "a similar will never be permitted to occur here". He guaranteed that UDI did not stamp "a reduction in the open doors which our African individuals need to progress and flourish in Rhodesia", depicted "racial agreement in Africa" as a feature of his motivation and denounced dark Rhodesian exercises as endeavors to "coerce the British government intoÃÂ ... giving the nation over to unreliable guideline". He at that point endeavored to soothe fears that financial assents may devastate the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: "The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shouldersÃÂ ... In the lives of most countries there comes a minute when a stand must be made for standards, whatever the results. This minute has come to RhodesiaÃÂ ... the principal Western country over the most recent two decades to state 'up until this point and no further'." He finished up with an attestation that the affirmation of autonomy was "a blow for the conservation of equity, civilisation and Christianity".
