In 1973, simultaneously with the club's change to the orange unit, another identification was presented highlighting the new hues. The new symbol portrayed a stylised orange football, bearing the letters "Lt", encompassed by the club's name in naval force blue content. In 1987, the club changed back to a subordinate of the town token, with the shield segment of the heraldic peak turning into the group's identification; the main comparability with the past plan was the incorporation of the club name around the shield in naval force blue. The "rainbow" identification, presented in 1994, highlighted the town peak beneath an orange and blue bow which bended around to meet two footballs, situated on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath. This identification was utilized until 2005, when a substitution fundamentally the same as the 1987 adaptation was embraced, including dark content as opposed to blue and a straw boater instead of the outstretched arm delineated in the more established plan. The club's establishing year, 1885, was included 2008. The identification was modified yet again amid the 2009Ã¢ÂÂ 10 pre-season, with the red of the town peak being supplanted with orange to all the more likely mirror the club hues.
