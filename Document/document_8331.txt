Despite the fact that Etty painted numerous private pictures of his companions and colleagues, he delivered not very many openly displayed representations, less than 30 of which were appeared amid his lifetime. Likeness was viewed as a profane and by and large useless type of painting all through a significant part of the nineteenth century, and representation painters kept on being trashed as an avaricious and dull gathering who made due by encouraging the vanity of the developing white collar class. Other than "Getting ready for a Fancy Dress Ball", commentators by and large loathed his pictures, leaning toward his history compositions disregarding reservations over his portrayals of bareness. "Getting ready for a Fancy Dress Ball" did, in any case, fill in as a sign that Etty could effectively paint functions as commissions for the English tip top, boosting his status and prompting further commissions. Etty kicked the bucket in November 1849 and before long tumbled from style; by the late nineteenth century the expense of every one of his artistic creations had fallen underneath their unique costs. Charlotte Williams-Wynn turned into a prominent letter essayist and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn wedded Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary passed on in April 1869.
