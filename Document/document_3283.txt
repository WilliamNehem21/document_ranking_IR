Commentators felt that the documented amusement substance and engineer interviews were among "Uncommon Replay" best highlights. Some were baffled that the highlights were secured behind tedious diversion challenges. Sam Machkovech ("Ars Technica") wound up stuck not in any case part of the way through the stamp card advance in the wake of completing the most straightforward accomplishments. This made the unreleased diversion film especially difficult to get to. Stephen Totilo ("Kotaku") comparably wound up uninterested in completing the stamp gathering. He considered the stamps the bundle's "most debilitated joke" in light of Rare's notoriety for collectible-substantial amusements. A few commentators found the designer content more essential than individual amusements. "Polygon" analyst called the arrangement "a fundamental bit of gaming history", while "Kotaku" pundit noticed that the highlights did not have a direct history of the organization and concealed Rare's huge, previous ties with Nintendo. Whitehead ("Eurogamer") asked why "Soil Mare" and other early diversions were disregarded in the reward content. Machkovech ("Ars Technica") found "Uncommon Replay" to be as much a "commemoration" as a collection since Rare had turned into "a sad remnant of its previous self". He noticed how the accumulation's last recreations agree with the Stamper siblings' exit from the organization. Analysts felt that the Stampers, Rare's authors, were a prominent nonattendance from the gathering and Jaz Rignall assumed that the accumulation's stamps highlight was a reference to the siblings.
