Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, a few terns and darker pelicans all participate in dive jumping, taking quick moving prey by plunging into the water from flight. Dive plunging enables winged creatures to utilize the vitality from the force of the jump to battle normal lightness (brought about via air caught in plumage), and along these lines utilizes less vitality than the committed interest jumpers, enabling them to use all the more generally dispersed sustenance assets, for instance, in ruined tropical oceans. By and large, this is the most particular technique for chasing utilized via seabirds; other non-authorities, (for example, gulls and skuas) may utilize it yet do as such with less expertise and from lower statures. In dark colored pelicans the abilities of dive jumping take quite a long while to completely growÃ¢ÂÂwhen develop, they can plunge from 20ÃÂ m (70ÃÂ ft) over the water's surface, moving the body before effect to maintain a strategic distance from damage. It has been recommended that dive jumpers are limited in their chasing grounds to clear waters that manage the cost of a perspective on their prey from the air, and keeping in mind that they are the predominant organization in the tropics, the connection between dive plunging and water lucidity is uncertain. Some dive jumpers (just as some surface feeders) are reliant on dolphins and fish to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.
