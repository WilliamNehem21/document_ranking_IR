Holy person SaÃÂ«ns was the main significant French author to compose piano concertos. His First, in D (1858), in customary three-development structure, isn't notable, yet the Second, in G minor (1868) is a standout amongst his most famous works. The arranger tried different things with structure in this piece, supplanting the standard sonata structure first development with an increasingly rambling structure, opening with a serious cadenza. The scherzo second development and "presto" finale are in such stand out from the opening that the piano player Zygmunt Stojowski remarked that the work "starts like Bach and finishes like Offenbach". The Third Piano Concerto, in E (1869) has another brave finale, yet the prior developments are increasingly traditional, the surface clear, with elegant melodic lines. The Fourth, in C minor (1875) is presumably the writer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two developments, each including two recognizable sub-areas, and keeps up a topical solidarity not found in the author's other piano concertos. As indicated by certain sources it was this piece so awed Gounod that he named Saint-SaÃÂ«ns "the Beethoven of France" (different sources base that refinement on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, over twenty years after its ancestor. The work is known as the "Egyptian" concerto; it was composed while the author was wintering in Luxor, and consolidates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.
