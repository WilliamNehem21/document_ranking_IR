Lloyd Clark expressed: "On the front line, Epsom finished, rather despicably, in a kind of draw" and that making a decision about the impacts of Operation Epsom is hampered by difference about Montgomery's plan. In composed requests Montgomery required a development over the Orne River and the catch of high ground south of Caen, which was not accomplished. Clark composed that there were understood goals with vital ramifications, more vital than the catch of ground. In 1971, Ambrose composed of Epsom veering off kilter from the arrangement and D'Este composed that Epsom was "an activity of tremendous expectations which were not achieved", considering it a "terrible disappointment". In 2004, Trew and Badsey composed of the British "disappointment" that it "... took the greater part of six Panzer Divisions to stop Epsom shy of its last objectives..." and Reynolds in 2002, composed that without the dedication of these six divisions, all things considered, the British hostile would have accomplished its objectives. Daglish in 2007 composed that while the first idea of Epsom had fizzled, the hostile was a vital achievement. By pulling back the eleventh Armored Division over the Odon and afterward into hold, the 21st Army Group had re-made the danger of a hostile close Caen. Before the finish of June, all German reinforced powers in Normandy were focused on the Second Army front.
