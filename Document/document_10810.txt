At the season of distribution, the creator, Stephen Lewis, matured 67 and living in Toronto, filled in as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, a position he held since 2001. Beforehand he filled in as the Deputy Director of United Nations Children's Fund (1994Ã¢ÂÂ 99), as the Canadian envoy to the UN (1984Ã¢ÂÂ 88), and as pioneer of the Ontario New Democratic Party (1970Ã¢ÂÂ 79). After Lewis hopefully acknowledged the Special Envoy position he turned out to be progressively distressed by the demolition he saw. As of now a gifted speaker, he turned out to be progressively vocal on the subject. He established the Stephen Lewis Foundation, facilitated Oprah Winfrey as she visited Africa, and was the subject of two honor winning documentaries by "The Nature of Things", entitled "Race Against Time" and "The Value of Life". Then he was contributed as a Companion of the Order of Canada, granted the Pearson Medal of Peace, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by "MacLean's" magazine. In 2005, he was welcome to convey the yearly arrangement of Massey Lectures from which the book, "Race Against Time", was adjusted. He composed the content in right on time to mid-2005 and conveyed the address arrangement in October when the book was discharged. Lewis composed the book, not as a worker of the UN, however as a native worried about the world's reaction to the AIDS challenge in Africa.
