"Nothomyrmecia" is a medium-sized subterranean insect estimating long. Laborers are monomorphic, implying that there is minimal morphological separation among each other. The mandibles, clypeus (one of the sclerites that make up the "face" of an arthropod or creepy crawly), radio wires and legs are light yellow. The hairs on the body are yellow, erect and long and rich, yet on the radio wires and legs they are shorter and suberect (standing nearly in an erect position). It indicates comparable qualities to "Myrmecia", and to some degree takes after "Oecophylla", usually known as weaver ants. Laborers are carefully nighttime (dynamic for the most part during the evening) however explore by vision, depending on extensive compound eyes. The mandibles are shorter than the head. They have 10 to 15 intermeshing teeth and are less specific than those of "Myrmecia" and "Prionomyrmex", being extend and triangular. The head is longer than it is wide and more extensive towards the back. The sides of the head are raised around the eyes. The long antennal scapes (the base of the reception apparatus) reach out past the occipital fringe, and the second section of the funiculus (a progression of fragments between the base and club) is marginally longer than the primary, third and fourth portion. The hub, pronotum, epinotum and thorax are longer than wide, and the mesonotum is similarly as long as it is wide. The principal section of the gaster (the bulbous back part of the metasoma) is more extensive than long by a third and more extensive at the back than the front with emphatically raised sides.
