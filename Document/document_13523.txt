Over its Central Asian dispersion, the saxaul sparrow happens in six presumably disjunct regions, and is isolated into no less than three subspecies. The choose subspecies "Passer ammodendri" occupies three of these territories, one in the Syr Darya bowl of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another toward the south of Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is just regular in the valley of the Ili River. In a third zone, now and then perceived as a subspecies "korejewi", "ammodendri" winged creatures breed sporadically in parts of focal Turkmenistan, Iran, and conceivably Afghanistan, relocating toward the south amid the winter. The subspecies "stoliczkae" was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from examples Stoliczka gathered in Yarkand. This subspecies is isolated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found over an expansive swath of China from Kashgar east to the furthest west of Inner Mongolia, through the territories around the Taklamakan Desert (however presumably not in the unfriendly desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the edges of southern Mongolia. In the extraordinary west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct populace isolated from the other "stoliczkae" winged animals by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains happens, which is at times isolated as a subspecies "timidus". The subspecies "nigricans", depicted by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.
