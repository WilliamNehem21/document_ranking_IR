The report was first distributed in Geneva on 17 May 1944, in German, by Abraham Silberschein of the World Jewish Congress as "Tatsachenbericht ÃÂ¼ber Auschwitz und Birkenau". Florian Manoliu of the Romanian Legation in Bern took the report to Switzerland and offered it to George Mantello, a Jewish specialist from Transylvania, who was filling in as the principal secretary of the El Salvador office in Geneva. It was on account of Mantello that the report got, in the Swiss press, its first wide inclusion. As indicated by David Kranzler, Mantello asked the Swiss-Hungarian Students' League to make 50 mimeographed duplicates of the VrbaÃ¢ÂÂ Wetzler report and two shorter Auschwitz reports (mutually known as the Auschwitz Protocols), which by 23 June 1944 he had appropriated to the Swiss government and Jewish gatherings. The understudies made a large number of duplicates, which were passed to different understudies and MPs. No less than 383 articles about Auschwitz showed up in the Swiss press between 23 June and 11 July 1944. As indicated by Michael Fleming, "[t]his figure surpasses the quantity of articles distributed about the Holocaust amid the whole war in "The Times", the "Day by day Telegraph", the "Manchester Guardian" and the entire of the British prevalent press."
