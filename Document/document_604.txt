Existing in a waterfront plain, the St. Johns River goes through a zone that was at one time obstruction islands, waterfront rises, and estuary swamps. The Florida Peninsula was made fundamentally by powers and minerals from the sea. It lies so low that minor variances in ocean levels can dramatically affect its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the noticeable shake arrangements is a storm cellar of molten stone and volcanic piece under a sedimentary layer shaped amid the Paleozoic period 542 to 251 million years back. Amid the Cretaceous time frame (145 to 66 million years back), the storm cellar and its sedimentary overlay were additionally secured by calcium carbonate and arrangements left by the dissipation of water called evaporites. What covers the landmass is the consequence of concurrent procedures of stores of sands, shells, and coral, and disintegration from water and climate. As sea water has withdrawn and advanced, the landmass has been secured with ocean water somewhere around multiple times. Waves packed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into limestone; at the sea's edge, shoreline edges were made by this depositional shaping. North-south pivot streams, for example, the St. Johns, were made by past shoreline edges which were frequently separated by swales. As sea water withdrew, tidal ponds framed in the swales, which were additionally disintegrated by acidic water. Boundary islands, moreover, framed along the Atlantic Coast, encompassing the tidal pond with land and shaping a freshwater stream.
