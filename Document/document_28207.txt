While visiting Looking Glass to cover "Flight Unlimited III"s development, journalist Dan Linton was impressed by the team management of Tom Sperry, producer Sandra Smith, and vice president of marketing Michael Malizola. He wrote that they employed "suggestion and encouragement" instead of "demands", and he believed that their work was in large part responsible for the game "setting a new standard in the industry". Peter James later accused the wider company's management of being lukewarm toward "Flight Unlimited III" during development, since their biggest sellers were action-oriented games like "". He claimed that their lack of interest turned the optimistic team into a "grumbling group of depressed and sometimes angry [people]". Although he, Smith, and Perry petitioned the company's managers to plan future add-ons and third-party development for the game, James felt that they were ignored. James developed concepts for a sequel in his spare time, but his ideas were shelved to wait for "Flight Unlimited III"s sales figures, which had to surpass those of "Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000" for "Flight Unlimited IV" to be greenlit. James believed that this was "foolish", particularly because he felt that Electronic Arts undermarketed the game. He wrote that "Flight Unlimited III"'s marketing manager had "great plans" but that his "hands seem[ed] tied".
