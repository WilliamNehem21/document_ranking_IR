The King was held up in the town and York, with the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, digs in toward the south. Exchanges initiated right away. York requested that Somerset be discharged into his guardianship, and the King supplanted Somerset as Lord High Constable with Buckingham, making Somerset subordinate. In that limit, Buckingham turned into the King's own moderatorÃ¢ÂÂArmstrong recommends on the grounds that he was outstanding to have the capacity to "surrender yet not abdicate"Ã¢ÂÂ and got and reacted to the Yorkists' envoys. His system was to play for time, both to set up the town's safeguards and to anticipate the landing of supporter diocesans, who could be relied on to present the ethical specialist of the congregation as a powerful influence for the Yorkists. Buckingham got somewhere around three Yorkist international safe havens, however the KingÃ¢ÂÂor BuckinghamÃ¢ÂÂwould not yield to the principle Yorkist request, that Somerset be surrendered to them. Buckingham may have trusted that rehashed dealings would exhaust the Yorkists' pizzazz for the fight to come, and defer sufficiently long for fortifications to arrive. Buckingham made what John Gillingham depicted as a "treacherously enticing recommendation" that the Yorkists think about the King's reactions in Hatfield or Barnet medium-term. Bukingham's trust in how sensible the Yorkists would be was lost.
