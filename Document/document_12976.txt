Carmen herself, says Dean, is another sort of operatic courageous woman speaking to another sort of affection, not the guiltless kind related with the "flawless soprano" school, however something through and through progressively fundamental and perilous. Her impulse, boldness and love of opportunity are for the most part musically spoke to: "She is reclaimed from any doubt of obscenity by her characteristics of fearlessness and capitulation to the inevitable so clearly acknowledged in the music". Curtiss proposes that Carmen's character, profoundly and musically, might be an acknowledgment of the author's very own oblivious yearning for an opportunity denied to him by his smothering marriage. Harold C. Schonberg compares Carmen to "a female Don Giovanni. She would prefer to pass on than be false to herself". The emotional identity of the character, and the scope of mind-sets she is required to express, call for uncommon acting and singing gifts. This has hindered a portion of musical drama's most recognized examples; Maria Callas, however she recorded the part, never performed it in front of an audience. The musicologist Hugh Macdonald sees that "French musical drama never created another femme as fatale as Carmen", however she may have impacted a portion of Massenet's courageous women. Macdonald proposes that outside the French collection, Richard Strauss' Salome and Alban Berg's Lulu "might be viewed as inaccessible ruffian relatives of Bizet's flirt".
