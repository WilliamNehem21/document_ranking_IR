In spite of the fact that proposition to remake Homestead Air Force Base were at first rejected, the United States Department of Defense in the long run used over $100ÃÂ million to start fixes. Unsalvageable structures were wrecked. Recreation at that point started on a Florida Air National Guard tower, airport regulation pinnacle, and support sheds. Next, the reconstructing of interchanges, therapeutic, security office, vehicle upkeep, and wing central command structures started. On March 5, 1994, the base revived as Homestead Air Reserve Base. Preceding Andrew, the base utilized around 6,500ÃÂ military work force and 1,000ÃÂ civilians and yearly added about $450ÃÂ million to the nearby economy. After its reviving, Major Bobby D'Angelo anticipated that the base should yearly contribute not exactly 50% of that Ã¢ÂÂ somewhere in the range of $180ÃÂ million and $200ÃÂ million. The city of Homestead spent about $6ÃÂ million on remaking the Homestead Sports Complex. In spite of this, the Cleveland Indians, dreading the migration of their increasingly prosperous fans, moved their spring preparing area to Chain of Lakes Park in Winter Haven. As homes were being reconstructed, FEMA gave free impermanent manufactured houses to 3,501ÃÂ families and money related help to more than 40,000ÃÂ other families for remaining in lodgings, paying rent, and fixing homes.
