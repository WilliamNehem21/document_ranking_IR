Towards the finish of the seventeenth century Spanish needs changed, and the disappointment of the serene endeavors of the Dominicans to change over the ChÃÂ¼ol joined with the expanding British nearness in the Caribbean drove the frontier specialists to end the Dominican imposing business model and enable the Franciscans and different requests to enter the locale; military choices were likewise seen all the more positively. Somewhere in the range of 1685 and 1689, the QÃÂ¼eqchiÃÂ¼ of CobÃÂ¡n and CahabÃÂ³n were compelled to help the Spanish in their furnished campaigns against the Manche ChÃÂ¼ol and in persuasively migrating them to Verapaz. These activities eradicated the southern PetÃÂ©n and prompted the breakdown of the exchange courses connecting provincial Guatemala with the autonomous Maya of PetÃÂ©n. From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan ministers Antonio Margil and Melchor LÃÂ³pez were dynamic among the Manche and Lakandon ChÃÂ¼ol. They were in the end ousted by the ChÃÂ¼ol; upon their arrival to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three intrusion courses into southern PetÃÂ©n and neighboring Chiapas. All through the seventeenth century, Spanish teachers experienced impressive hesitance among the Manche, until the Spanish at long last chose to move them to a territory where they could be all the more effectively controlled. At the season of contact there were maybe 10,000 Manche; these were crushed by war and sickness, with the survivors migrated to Rabinal in the cutting edge branch of Baja Verapaz. After 1700 the Manche ChÃÂ¼ol stopped to have any influence in the historical backdrop of PetÃÂ©n.
