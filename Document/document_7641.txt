In gifted hands, the net was a helpful weapon. The "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s essential target with it was to catch his rival. An ewer found at Rheinzabern exhibits the tossing strategy: the "retiarius" held the net collapsed up in his correct hand and cast it shrewd. He held his trident and knife in his left hand, cautious to keep the trident's prongs directed descending toward abstain from catching it in the work. On the off chance that the hurl missed, the "retiarius" utilized the drawrope fixing to his wrist to bring the net back close by. On a fruitful cast, the combatant fixed the drawcord around the net's edge and attempted to unbalance or topple his opponent. A fruitful cast of the net could win the fight for the "retiarius" straightaway. This was not sure, in any case, as a mosaic at the National Archeological Museum in Madrid appears: in the main board, the "retiarius" Kalendio has gotten his rival, a "secutor" named Astyanax, in his net. In the later picture, be that as it may, Kalendio lies on the ground, injured, and raises his knife to surrender. The engraving above Kalendio gives the hint for "invalid", suggesting that the match coordinators requested him slaughtered.
