As in "Myst" and "Riven", the designers utilized no frills arrangements rather than PC created performing artists and props; Irish expressed that utilizing PC illustrations would have reminded players they were in a diversion, "which would wreck the submersion that is so basic to the "Myst" amusements". Live on-screen characters were recorded on a blue screen and after that put in the advanced situations utilizing chroma key innovation. Before any shooting could start, every one of the sets were built and loaded up with props the performing artists could utilize, ensembles for every one of the characters were formed, and every scene was plotted out by storyboard. Rand Miller came back to play Atrus, a job he had filled since the first "Myst" amusement. Brad Dourif, an expert performing artist best known for the "No problem" films, consented to play Saavedro on the grounds that he was an immense "Myst" fan. Dourif noticed that representing a diversion was significantly more troublesome than taking a shot at motion picture sets, as he couldn't see the player or communicate with the amusement condition. Different performers included Maria Galante as Atrus' better half Catherine, and Greg Uhler's little girl Audrey in an appearance as Atrus' girl Yeesha. Arrangement for the video shoots took four months; recording the scenes took only seven days. Uhler noticed that the video was one part of "Myst" that Presto "fouled up"; in light of the fact that superior quality camcorders were not utilized, the subsequent video was not as fresh as engineers had trusted.
