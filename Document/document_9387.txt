"One Tree Hill" keeps running for 5 minutes, 23 seconds. It is played in like manner time at a rhythm of 120 beats for each moment. The melody starts with a highlife-impacted riff by the Edge on guitar, which rehashes out of sight all through the tune. Percussion from drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. enters following two seconds. At 0:07, a second guitar enters. At 0:15, Clayton's bass and Mullen's drums enter, and at 0:31, the stanza harmony movement of CÃ¢ÂÂ FÃ¢ÂÂ BÃ¢ÂÂ FÃ¢ÂÂ C is presented. The main stanza starts at 0:47. At 1:32, the tune moves to the ensemble, changing to a CÃ¢ÂÂ BÃ¢ÂÂ FÃ¢ÂÂ C harmony movement. The second stanza at that point starts at 1:49, and after the second ensemble, a short melodic break starts at 2:36, in which the Edge's guitar is supplanted by the Raad strings. The third stanza starts at 3:07, and the Edge's guitar resumes at 3:38 in the chorale. A guitar solo starts at 4:16 and is played until the instrumentation finds some conclusion at 4:36. Following two seconds of quietness, the Raad strings blur in and Bono continues to sing the coda. The last verse and strings become dull over the last six seconds.
