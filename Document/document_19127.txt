In "Vasool Raja MBBS" (2004), the character Vasool Raja (Haasan), while attending a class asks whether being a doctor is equivalent to being God, and in doing so says "Anbe Venkatachalam", to which one of his classmates gently asks him, "isn't it Anbe Sivam?". Haasan retorts: "Let it be. Let's try something different for a change." The street theatre sequence featuring Kamal's character, Nallasivam, and his friends performing to make people aware of the atrocities committed by Nassar's character, Kanadasamy Padayatchi, was re-created at Tiruchirappalli in 2008 by Pralayan and his troupe from "Chennai Kalai Kuzhu" under the title "Nammal Mudiyum". In contrast, Pralayan's play explored gender inequality and domestic violence instead of unemployment. Kannada actor Vishnuvardhan noted in 2010 that fellow actor Sudeep's film "Just Maath Maathalli" (2010) bears resemblance to "Anbe Sivam". Hari Narayan, writing for "The Hindu" in 2014, mentions in his article on the Indian rationalist and author Narendra Dabholkar that Umesh Shukla's "OMGÂ â Oh My God!" (2012) was "a toned down version of "Anbe Sivam" where rationality propels humans to find God in themselves, with flaws, which extols the virtue of becoming as much as that of being". In 2015 Uthiran of "The Hindu" in Tamil, mentions in his review of "Orange Mittai" (2015) that the film's plot "might remind viewers of "Anbe Sivam"". In 2017, Ashok, who directed the comedy film "Peechankai", mentions he was inspired by "Anbe Sivam" to become a director.
