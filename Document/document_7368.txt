The next day, April 22, 1920, the House announced its section of the Maine bill to the Senate. The bill was alluded to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean announced it back with a proposal that it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin charges (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate quickly, expecting that however they were on the Senate's plan for that day, they probably won't be come to, and accepting dire activity was required. Utah Senator Reed Smoot questioned: Smoot's endeavor to raise an enemy of dumping exchange bill out of turn had quite recently been protested by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, in any case, expressed if the coin bills had not been come to by about 2:00 pm, there would presumably not be any complaint. At the point when McLean attempted again to propel the coin charges, Kansas' Charles Curtis inquired as to whether there was any direness. McLean answered that as the three coin bills were to check progressing commemorations, there was a need them approved and kick the creation procedure off. Each of the three bills passed the Senate without restriction and the Maine bill was authorized with the mark of President Woodrow Wilson on May 10, 1920.
