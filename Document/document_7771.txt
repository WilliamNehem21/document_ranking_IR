A few of the tracks that show up on "Blessed Wood" go back to 1995, preceding the arrival of "Antichrist Superstar", albeit a lot of this material comprised of "dissipated thoughts". Manson, the band's vocalist, formed this material into progressively considerable arrangements amid his three-month time of withdrawal. Following this, the full band labored for a year on re-composing and building up the material. The record is the gathering's most community oriented exertion to date; all individuals added to the songwriting procedure. The vast majority of the compositional work was finished by Manson close by guitarists Twiggy Ramirez and John 5. The vocalist differentiated his songwriting sessions between the two, calling sessions with the last "extremely engaged", saying that the greater part of their arrangements would be finished before being taken to the remainder of the band for thought. Conversely, his sessions with Ramirez were less requesting, and the pair much of the time explored different avenues regarding absinthe. Drummer Ginger Fish worked continually on new material, and is credited with performing consoles and programming, while keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy gave contribution on "President Dead" and "Cruci-Fiction in Space". Out and out, the band composed 100 melodic pieces, of which somewhere in the range of 25 and 30 progressed toward becoming tunes.
