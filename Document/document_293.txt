After opening in 2001, PNC Park was applauded by fans and media alike. ESPN.com essayist Jim Caple positioned PNC Park as the best arena in Major League Baseball, with a score of 95 out of 100. Caple contrasted the recreation center with Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, calling the arena itself "flawless", and refering to high ticket costs as the main negative part of visiting the recreation center. Jay Ahjua, creator of "Fields of Dreams: A Guide to Visiting and Enjoying All 30 Major League Ballparks", called PNC Park one of the "main ten spots to watch the amusement". Eric Enders, creator of "Ballparks Then and Now" and co-creator of "Major League Ballparks: The Complete Illustrated History", said it was "everything a baseball arena could would like to be" and "a prompt contender for the title of best baseball park at any point assembled". In 2008, "Men's Fitness" named the recreation center one of "10 major group parks worth seeing this late spring". A 2010 unranked rundown of "America's 7 Best Ballparks" distributed by ABC News noticed that PNC Park "consolidates the best highlights of yesterday's ballparksÃ¢ÂÂmusical entrances, steel trusswork and a characteristic grass playing fieldÃ¢ÂÂwith the most recent in fan and player luxuries and solace".
