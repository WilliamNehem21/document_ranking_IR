Shooting started on 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks shot for the most part on area in Rome. Kim Newman portrayed the Rome of "Tenebrae" as not at all like the one more often than not appeared on TV and in movies, with none of the typical recorded tourist spots. Newman and Alan Jones concurred this was an intentional decision made by Argento, as a portion of his past movies had used such an extensive amount conspicuous Italy. Argento himself said he had needed to demonstrate Italy was not only a historical center piece; Newman said it was Argento's method for saying, "Rome is a lively city. It is current." Most of "Tenebrae"s area shooting was completed in Rome's EUR business and private locale. The primary flashback scene was recorded at the Capocotta shoreline, south of the city close Ostia. The shoplifting scene close to the start of "Tenebrae" was recorded on area at retail establishment La Rinascente, off Piazza Fiume. Bullmer's demise in an open square was shot at a shopping area called ""Le Terrazze"" in Rome's Casal Palocco private neighborhood. The scene in which Neal's proprietor's little girl is murdered was taped outside the home of designer Ã¢ÂÂ and companion of Argento Ã¢ÂÂ Sandro Petti, changing to studio shots for her underlying passage into the house and back to Petti's home for the showdown with the executioner. The scene toward the start of the film where Neal gets onto his trip to Rome was shot at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
