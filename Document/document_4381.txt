Soon thereafter, GÃÂ³recki educated of an engraving scribbled on the mass of a cell in a German Gestapo jail in the town of Zakopane, which lies at the foot of the Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old , a good country lady detained on 25 September 1944. It read "O Mamo, nie pÃÂacz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta KrÃÂ³lowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie" (Oh Mamma don't cry, no. Perfect Queen of Heaven, you bolster me generally). The author reviewed, "I need to concede that I have dependably been chafed by amazing words, by calls for vengeance. Maybe even with death I would yell out along these lines. However, the sentence I found is extraordinary, just about a conciliatory sentiment or clarification for having got herself into such inconvenience; she is looking for solace and backing in straightforward, short yet significant words". He later clarified, "In jail, the entire divider was secured with engravings shouting for all to hear: 'I'm guiltless', 'Killers', 'Killers', 'Free me', 'You need to spare me'Ã¢ÂÂ it was all so uproarious, so dull. Grown-ups were composing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old young lady, very nearly a kid. Furthermore, she is so unique. She doesn't lose hope, does not cry, does not shout for vengeance. She doesn't consider herself; regardless of whether she merits her destiny or not. Rather, she just contemplates her mom: since it is her mom who will encounter genuine gloom. This engraving was something remarkable. Furthermore, it truly interested me."
