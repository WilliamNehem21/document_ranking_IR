Another armada advance pursued on 18Ã¢ÂÂ 20ÃÂ October, however it finished without experiencing any British units. After two weeks, on 4ÃÂ November, "Prinzregent Luitpold" participated in a campaign toward the western shoreline of Denmark to help two U-vesselsÃ¢ÂÂand Ã¢ÂÂ that had turned out to be stranded there. The armada was rearranged on 1ÃÂ December; the four "KÃÂ¶nig"- class war vessels stayed in IIIÃÂ Squadron, alongside the recently dispatched , while the five "Kaiser"- class ships, including "Prinzregent Luitpold", were exchanged to IVÃÂ Squadron. "Prinzregent Luitpold" turned into the lead of the new squadron. In the Wilhelmshaven Roads on 20ÃÂ January 1917, the ship struck a steel hawser that ended up ensnared in the ship's starboard propeller. In March, "Friedrich der Grosse" was supplanted as the armada leader by the recently authorized war vessel . "Friedrich der Grosse" thus supplanted "Prinzregent Luitpold" as the leader of IVÃÂ Squadron. Relentlessly diminishing assurance and discontent with proportions incited a progression of little revolts in the armada. On 6ÃÂ June and 19ÃÂ July, stokers challenged the low nature of the nourishment they were given, and on 2ÃÂ August, some 800ÃÂ men went on an appetite strike. The ship's officers yielded and consented to shape a "Menagekommission", a gathering that gave the enrolled men a voice in their apportion determination and readiness. One of the instigators of the challenges, be that as it may, was captured and executed on 5ÃÂ September.
