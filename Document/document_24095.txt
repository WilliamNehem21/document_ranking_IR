The building on Fayette and Holliday Streets had been in a state of decline for twoÂ decades. It was not until 1873, when a fire spread from the famous playhouse since the 1790s next door to the north, the Holliday Street Theater to the "Assembly Rooms", that the City Council dedicated the resources to erect a new building especially for the City College. A lot was acquired on North Howard Street opposite West Centre Street and the Council allocated $150,000 for the construction of the new building designed by Baltimore architect Edmund G. Lind and municipal architect George C. Frederick, who among his many city projects was completing construction of the massive new domed Baltimore City Hall, then rising in the block across Holliday Street from old burnt City College / Central High and its Assembly Rooms structure. The new English Gothic revival-styled building faced east on Howard Street and was adjacent to the magnificent Academy of Music (a Victorian decorative styled music hall and auditorium also constructed at the same time to the south - site of presidential inaugural festivities for the newly opened Johns Hopkins University in 1876, also used for the opening of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in 1882 / 1886). The new Baltimore City College, now finally in a home especially built for its educational mission after 36 years, was dedicated on February 1, 1875. The school moved in the following week.
