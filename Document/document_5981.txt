Like all "Tylopilus" species, "T.ÃÂ felleus" is mycorrhizal. It is found in deciduous and coniferous forest, frequently under beech and oak in very much depleted corrosive soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. Whenever experienced on calcareous (pasty) soil, it will be in wet zones that have turned out to be waterlogged and have plentiful leaf litter. Natural product bodies develop independently or in little gatherings, and once in a while in little groups with a few joined at the base of the stem. Organic product bodies have likewise been developing in the depressions of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on covered spoiled wood. The growth acquires the majority of its nitrogen prerequisites from amino acids got from the breakdown of proteins, in spite of the fact that a lesser sum is gotten from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown result of chitin, a noteworthy part of parasitic cell dividers). The mycorrhizal plant accomplice profits by the growth's capacity to utilize these types of nitrogen, which are frequently plenteous in the backwoods floor. Natural product bodies show up over summer and harvest time, whenever from June to October or much November, in a large number of the northern calm zones. Expansive numbers may show up in certain years, and none in others, by and large corresponding to the measure of precipitation. Assortment "uliginosus", known from Michigan, develops among lichens and greeneries under pines.
