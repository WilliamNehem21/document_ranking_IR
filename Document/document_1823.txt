In 1972, France had the capacity to pick up an agreement with Saudi Arabia over the buy of 190 AMX-30S', intended for the desert condition of the Middle Eastern country. Named the Palmier Contract, Saudi Arabia's tanks were conveyed somewhere in the range of 1973 and 1979, while 59 AMX-30Ds were sent out somewhere in the range of 1975 and 1979, 12 AMX-30Ps somewhere in the range of 1977 and 1979, lastly 51 self-impelled howitzers, conveyed somewhere in the range of 1979 and 1980. Somewhere in the range of 1979 and 1981, Saudi Arabia additionally got 52 AMX-30SAs and later 50 AMX-30C1 "Shanine-2"s conveyed in two bunches, somewhere in the range of 1980 and 1989. By the 21st century, half of Saudi Arabia's AMX-30 armada were away, given that the AMX-30 came up short on the abilities to manage increasingly present day dangers, for example, against Iraqi T-62s and T-72s, and Israeli Merkava tanks. These were to a great extent dislodged by a request for 315 M1A2 Abrams tanks in 1989, and the procurement of 450 M60A3 Patton tanks. Albeit Saudi Arabia wanted to acquire more M1 tanks, it was unfit to do as such for money related reasons and the AMX-30 has still not been resigned.
