The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) started in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Center, gone to by 228 representatives from 19 ideological groups. In spite of the fact that Cyril Ramaphosa drove the ANC's assignment, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk utilized the end discourse to censure the ANC's viciousness, he made that big appearance to criticize de Klerk as the "leader of an ill-conceived, undermined minority routine". Overwhelmed by the National Party and ANC, little arrangement was accomplished. CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk demanded that post-politically-sanctioned racial segregation South Africa must utilize a government framework with a pivoting administration to guarantee the security of ethnic minorities; Mandela contradicted this, requesting a unitary framework represented by larger part rule. Following the Boipatong slaughter of ANC activists by government-helped Inkatha aggressors, Mandela canceled the arrangements, before going to a gathering of the Organization of African Unity in Senegal, at which he required an exceptional session of the UN Security Council and recommended that an UN peacekeeping power be positioned in South Africa to anticipate "state psychological warfare". Calling for local mass activity, in August the ANC sorted out the biggest ever strike in South African history, and supporters walked on Pretoria.
