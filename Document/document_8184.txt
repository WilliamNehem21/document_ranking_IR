The show is set in the anecdotal "Place where there is Ooo", in a dystopian future around a thousand years after an atomic holocaust called the "Incomparable Mushroom War". As per Ward, the show happens "after the bombs have fallen and enchantment has returned into the world". Before the arrangement was completely created, Ward planned the Land of Ooo to just be "mystical". After the creation of the scene "Business Time", in which an ice shelf containing restored businesspeople buoys to the outside of a lake, the show turned out to be expressly dystopian; Ward said the generation team "just kept running with it". Ward later portrayed the setting as "candyland superficially and dull underneath", taking note of he had never planned the Mushroom War and the dystopian components to be "hit over the head in the show". He restricted it to "vehicles covered underground out of sight [and different components that do not] raise any eyebrows". Ward has said the arrangement's dystopian components were impacted by the 1979 film "Distraught Max". Kenny considered the manner in which the components are worked into the plot "very fill-in-the-spaces", and DiMaggio stated, "it's been evident the Land of Ooo has a few issues".
