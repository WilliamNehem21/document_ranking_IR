The Soviet shipbuilding and related ventures turned out to be unequipped for supporting the development of such a significant number of huge ships in the meantime. The biggest warships worked in the Soviet Union before 1938 were the s, and even they had experienced various generation issues, however the Soviet authority seemed to overlook the challenges experienced in the development of the "Kirov" class when requesting 14 substantially more driven boats. Development of two additional boats made arrangements for Leningrad and Nikolayev needed to move to the fresh out of the plastic new Shipyard Nr. 402 in Molotovsk in light of the fact that the current shipyards couldn't be extended to deal with such huge numbers of expansive boats. Segments for these two boats must be made at Leningrad and dispatched by means of the White Sea Ã¢ÂÂ Baltic Canal to Molotovsk. Additionally, the turret shop at Nikolaev ended up being excessively ineffectively prepared to collect the 406ÃÂ mm mountings and the propeller shafts must be requested in 1940 from Germany and the Netherlands as the local plants were at that point overburdened with requests. Shipbuilding steel ended up being hard to find in 1940, and various clumps were rejected in light of the fact that they didn't meet determinations. Defensive layer plate creation was considerably progressively dangerous as just of the foreseen were conveyed in 1939, and the greater part of that was rejected. Moreover, the protective layer plants turned out to be unequipped for making established plates over 230ÃÂ mm, and second rate face-solidified plates needed to substitute for all thicknesses over 200ÃÂ mm.
