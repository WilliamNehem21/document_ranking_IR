In the mid 850s ÃÂthelwulf went on journey to Rome. As per Abels: "ÃÂthelwulf was at the tallness of his capacity and distinction. It was a favorable time for the West Saxon lord to guarantee a position of respect among the rulers and rulers of the Christian world." His oldest enduring children ÃÂthelbald and ÃÂthelberht were then grown-ups, while ÃÂthelred and Alfred were as yet youthful youngsters. In 853 ÃÂthelwulf sent his more youthful children to Rome, maybe going with emissaries regarding his own anticipated visit. Alfred, and perhaps ÃÂthelred also, were contributed with the "belt of consulship". ÃÂthelred's part in the adventure is just known from a contemporary record in the "liber vitae" of San Salvatore, Brescia, as later records, for example, the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" were just keen on account the respect paid to Alfred. Abels sees the international safe haven as making ready for ÃÂthelwulf's journey, and the nearness of Alfred, his most youthful and accordingly most nonessential child, as a motion of generosity to the papacy; affirmation by Pope Leo IV made Alfred his otherworldly child, and therefore made a profound connection between the two "fathers". Kirby contends that the adventure may demonstrate that Alfred was planned for the congregation, while Nelson actually observes ÃÂthelwulf's motivation as avowing his more youthful children's throneworthiness, along these lines ensuring them against being tonsured by their senior siblings, which would have rendered them ineligible for sovereignty.
