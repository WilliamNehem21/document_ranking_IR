A few frogs ensure their posterity inside their very own bodies. Both male and female pouched frogs ("Assa darlingtoni") monitor their eggs, which are laid on the ground. At the point when the eggs incubate, the male greases up his body with the jam encompassing them and submerges himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pockets on his side, where they form until they transform into adolescent frogs. The female gastric-agonizing frog ("Rheobatrachus" sp.) from Australia, presently most likely wiped out, swallows her prepared eggs, which at that point create inside her stomach. She stops to nourish and quits discharging stomach corrosive. The tadpoles depend on the yolks of the eggs for sustenance. Following six or seven weeks, they are prepared for transformation. The mother disgorges the small frogs, which jump far from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog ("Rhinoderma darwinii") from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are monitored by the male. At the point when the tadpoles are going to bring forth, they are immersed by the male, which bears them inside his much-extended vocal sac. Here they are drenched in a foamy, thick fluid that contains some sustenance to enhance what they acquire from the yolks of the eggs. They stay in the sac for seven to ten weeks before experiencing transformation, after which they move into the male's mouth and develop.
