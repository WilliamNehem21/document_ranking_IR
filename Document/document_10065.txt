Under German occupation, the callings of Polish columnists and essayists were practically wiped out, as they had little chance to distribute their work. The Underground State's Department of Culture supported different activities and people, empowering them to proceed with their work and helping in their distribution. Books and treasurys were distributed by underground presses; more than 1,000 worksÃÂ were distributed underground throughout the war. Artistic exchanges were held, and unmistakable scholars of the period working in Poland included, among others, Krzysztof Kamil BaczyÃÂski, Leslaw Bartelski, Tadeusz Borowski, Tadeusz Boy-ÃÂ»eleÃÂski, Maria DÃÂbrowska, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, JarosÃÂaw Iwaszkiewicz, future Nobel Prize champ CzesÃÂaw MiÃÂosz, Zofia NaÃÂkowska, Jan Parandowski, Leopold Staff, Kazimierz Wyka, and Jerzy Zawieyski. Scholars expounded on the troublesome conditions in the wartime captive camps (Konstanty Ildefons GaÃÂczyÃÂski, Stefan Flukowski, Leon Kruczkowski, Andrzej Nowicki and Marian PiechaÃÂa), the ghettos, and even from inside the death camps (Jan Maria Gisges, Halina GoÃÂczowa, Zofia GÃÂ³rska (Romanowiczowa), Tadeusz HoÃÂuj, Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski and Marian Kubicki). Numerous authors did not endure the war, among them Krzysztof Kamil BaczyÃÂski, WacÃÂaw Berent, Tadeusz Boy-ÃÂ»eleÃÂski, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, Stefan KiedrzyÃÂski, Janusz Korczak, Halina Krahelska, Tadeusz Hollender, Witold Hulewicz, Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski, WÃÂodzimierz Pietrzak, Leon Pomirowski, Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer and Bruno Schulz.
