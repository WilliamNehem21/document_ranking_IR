Development of "South Park: The Stick of Truth" took four years, beginning in 2009 when "South Park" co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone contacted Obsidian Entertainment to discuss their desire to make a "South Park" game. Parker, a fan of Obsidian games, including "" (2010), wanted to create a role-playing game, a genre which he and Stone had enjoyed since their childhoods. Parker and Stone insisted that the game must replicate the show's visual style. Parker's original concept was for a "South Park" version of the 2011 role-playing fantasy game "", and he estimated the first script he produced to be 500 pages long. The South Park Digital Studios team animated a concept of the game's opening scene to show what they wanted to accomplish with Obsidian in terms of appearance and gameplay mechanics. While the series had inspired several licensed games, such as "South Park" (1998) and "South Park Rally" (1999), Parker and Stone were not involved in these games' development and later criticized the titles' quality. Negative reaction to those games made the pair protective of their property and led to their greater involvement on "The Stick of Truth"; they refused several requests to license the series for new ventures.
