Winnipeg and Hamilton met again in 1962, the 50th Gray Cup, deified as the "Mist Bowl". The amusement was held at Toronto's Exhibition Stadium, and started on Saturday, December 1, 1962. The mist came in right off the bat in the second quarter and turned out to be progressively thick as the diversion advanced. By the final quarter, the players were unfit to see the sideline markers and the fans unfit to see the play. The players were unfit to see the ball noticeable all around Ã¢ÂÂ kick returners tuned in for the sound of the ball hitting the ground Ã¢ÂÂ and the activity was to a great extent undetectable to the TV crowd. With nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds staying in the amusement and Winnipeg clutching a 28Ã¢ÂÂ 27 lead, authorities settled on the exceptional choice to suspend play until the following day. In spite of the fact that the class expected that proceeding with haze on the morning of December 2 would power the total relinquishment of the diversion, it lifted in time for the challenge to continue. Around 15,000 of the first 32,655 observers watched Winnipeg win the Gray Cup moving along without any more scoring by either group. It was the main title amusement finished on a Sunday; the Gray Cup moved from its customary Saturday begin to Sunday in 1969; in any case, the diversion was played on a Saturday once and for all in 1970.
