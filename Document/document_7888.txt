"Oxalaia" is one of three spinosaurids found in Brazil, the other two being "Irritator" and its conceivable equivalent word "Angaturama", the two of which were additionally at first known from incomplete skulls. They were found in the Romualdo Formation of the Santana Group, some portion of the Araripe Basin. Microfossils date this arrangement to the Albian, around nine to six million years before "Oxalaia". The fossil record of spinosaurids is poor contrasted with those of other theropod gatherings; not many body fossils are known and most genera have been raised from confined components, for example, vertebra or teeth. The holotype example of "Oxalaia quilombensis", assigned MN 6117-V, was found "in situ" (at its unique spot of testimony) with part of the left side implanted in the stone lattice; it comprises of the intertwined praemaxillae (frontmost nose bones) from a vast person. A disconnected and deficient left (principle upper jaw bone) part (MNÃÂ 6119-V) was alluded to "Oxalaia" on the grounds that it demonstrated a similar general attributes happening in spinosaurids, the maxilla was found on the stone surface, having potentially moved from its unique area after disintegration. Both bone sections were found on Cajual Island, MaranhÃÂ£o, in the Northeast Region of Brazil, and were housed at the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro. In 2018, a flame immersed the royal residence lodging the exhibition hall, potentially annihilating "Oxalaia"s examples, alongside different fossils found in Brazil. Other than the fractional skull bones, various spinosaurid teeth had before been accounted for from the Laje do Coringa site.
