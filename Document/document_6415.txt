In 1959 Terry-Thomas distributed his first collection of memoirs, "Filling the Gap", named after his spot in "Clear as day"; he clarified that "everything that has been printed about me is lies. I'm not proposing the scholars were lying, I was". Amid the year he additionally showed up in two further portions of the Boultings siblings' arrangement of institutional parodies, having showed up in the past three. The first, in which he was joined again by Sellers, was "Carlton-Browne of the F.O.", in which he played Cadogan de Vere Carlton-Browne, a character he depicted as being "rubble from the nostrils up", "a particular sort of Englishman, the Englishman who peruses "The Times" and no other paper. A brolly bearer. A squash player. A bowler cap wearer. Office, firm, obviously". Film essayist Andrew Spicer believed that Terry-Thomas' job "was the quintessential privileged 'senseless ass', a tragic relic of an evaporated world". The film was at first picked as Britain's entrance for the 1959 Moscow International Film Festival until the Foreign Office appealed to the British Film Producers' Association for it to be pulled back on the premise that the Russians should seriously mull over the film to precisely depict British discretionary conduct.
