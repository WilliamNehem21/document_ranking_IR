Starting in mid-December 1904, "Mecklenburg" went into Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance, which lasted until the beginning of March 1905. After emerging from drydock, "Mecklenburg" joined her sister ship on a cruise through the Skagerrak to Kiel. While steaming through the Great Belt on 3 March, "Mecklenburg" struck the Hatter Reef off SamsÃ¸, Denmark, and became stuck. Another sister ship, , and the light cruiser were sent to assist "Wittelsbach" in pulling "Mecklenburg" free of the reef. "Mecklenburg" then steamed under her own power to Kiel, where dockyard workers discovered a large dent in her bottom. Repair work was completed at the "Kaiserliche Werft" in Wilhelmshaven by 20 April, allowing her to participate in the normal routine of training cruises and maneuvers with the fleet for the remainder of the year. During this period, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet while it was moored in SwinemÃ¼nde. From mid-February to the end of March 1906, "Mecklenburg" was in the "Kaiserliche Werft" in Wilhelmshaven for her annual overhaul. The training routine continued without incident through 1907 but, in early April 1908, a major accident in one of "Mecklenburg"s broadside torpedo rooms nearly sank her. Water began to flood the ship and could only be stopped by sealing the torpedo tubes from the outside; repairs lasted until May.
