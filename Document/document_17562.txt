Earlier in Bede's "Ecclesiastical History of the English People" chronicle, he lists seven kings who governed the southern provinces of the English, with reigns dating from the late fifth to the late seventh century. Subsequently, the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"âanother important source for the periodâdescribes these seven as or , a title translated as "Britain-ruler" or "Wide-ruler". The "Chronicle" adds just one king to the list: Egbert of Wessex, who reigned in the ninth century. The resulting list of eight omits several strong Mercian kings. It is possible that the chronicler was merely adding Egbert's name to Bede's original list of seven, rather than claiming that no other kings achieved similar powers in England. The chronicler was almost certainly a West Saxon, and since neither Ãthelbald nor Offa were kings of Wessex it is possible the chronicler does not mention them out of regional pride. The meaning of the term "bretwalda", and the nature of the power that these eight kings wielded, has had much academic scrutiny. One suggested interpretation is that since Bede was writing during Ãthelbald's reign, the original seven he listed were essentially those kings who could be seen as prototypes of Ãthelbald in their domination of England south of the Humber.
