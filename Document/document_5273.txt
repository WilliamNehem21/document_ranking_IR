After MalcolmÃÂ X's demise in 1965, ClarenceÃÂ 13X grieved his misfortune yet did not go to his burial service. In May 1965, while visiting the site of Mosque No.ÃÂ 7, at that point shut, ClarenceÃÂ 13X and a few of his allies were advised to leave by a cop. They left, started to vandalize close-by structures, and obstructed the road close to the previous base camp of Muslim Mosque, Inc. More police arrived and quelled ClarenceÃÂ 13X after a squabble, carrying him into authority with a few of his adherents. Subsequent to being captured, he would not recognize himself and was accused of ambush and medication ownership. Around 60 of his devotees went to his arraignment, yet were expelled from the court in the wake of yelling "Harmony". ClarenceÃÂ 13X declared his guiltlessness and reported his aim to protect himself in court. He told the judge that he was Allah, and that the city would confront grave judgment on the off chance that he were not discharged. The judge ignored his visualization and set his safeguard at $9,500. At a court date in June, about 50ÃÂ Five Percenters dissented outside the court; a while later, a few were captured on charges of making Molotov mixed drinks. In July, the court sent ClarenceÃÂ 13X to Bellevue Hospital Center for a mental examination. While in the medical clinic, he made a couple of supporters and spoke with certain adherents through an emergency clinic window. Under his directions, Five Percenters opposed future NOI pioneer Louis Farrakhan's endeavors to change over them.
