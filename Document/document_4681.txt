Amid the Second World War Pierrepoint hanged 15 German government operatives, just as US servicemen found liable by courts military of carrying out violations in England. In December 1941, he executed the German government agent Karel Richter at Wandsworth jail. At the point when Pierrepoint entered the censured man's cell for the hanging, Richter stood up, tossed aside one of the watchmen and charged recklessly at the stone divider. Dazed quickly, he rose and shook his head. After Richter battled with the watchmen, Pierrepoint figured out how to get the calfskin lash around Richter's wrists. He burst the calfskin tie from eye-opening to eye-gap and was free once more. After another battle, the tie was wrapped firmly around his wrists. He was conveyed to the platform where a lash was folded over his lower legs, trailed by a top and noose. Similarly as Pierrepoint pushed the switch, Richter hopped up with bound feet. As Richter plunged through the trapdoor, Pierrepoint could see that the noose had slipped, however it progressed toward becoming stuck without Richter even noticing. Regardless of the bizarre position of the noose, the jail therapeutic officer verified that it was an immediate, clean demise. Expounding on the execution in his journals, Pierrepoint called it "my hardest session on the framework amid all my profession as a killer". The broken lash was given to Pierrepoint as a trinket; he utilized it at times for what he thought were important executions.
