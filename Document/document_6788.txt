Despite the fact that Cope portrayed and figured the pectoral and pelvic supports of "Elasmosaurus" in 1869 and 1875, these components were noted as absent from the gathering by the American scientist Samuel Wendell Williston in 1906. Adapt had credited these components to the English stone worker Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins to help set them up out of their encompassing solidifications. At the time, Hawkins was taking a shot at a "Paleozoic Museum" in New York's Central Park, where a reproduction of "Elasmosaurus" was to show up, an American identical to his life-sized Crystal Palace Dinosaurs in London. In May 1871 a great part of the display material in Hawkins' workshop was annihilated by vandals (working for the New York government official William M. "Supervisor" Tweed) and their parts covered; it is conceivable that the support components of "Elasmosaurus" were at the workshop and were similarly pulverized. Nothing was in this way referenced about their misfortune by Hawkins or Cope. In 2018, Davidson and Everhart recorded the occasions paving the way to the vanishing of these fossils, and proposed that a photograph and drawing of Waterhouse's workshop from 1869 seem to demonstrate solidifications on the floor that may have been the ill-equipped supports of "Elasmosaurus". They additionally noticed that calculated portrayals of the Palaeozoic Museum demonstrate that the model "Elasmosaurus" was initially imagined with a long "tail", however later refreshed with a long neck. Davidson and Everhart presumed that the support fossils were in all likelihood devastated in Hawkins' workshop.
