Touching base at Petrograd's Finland Station, Lenin gave a discourse to Bolshevik supporters denouncing the Provisional Government and again requiring a landmass wide European common upset. Over the next days, he talked at Bolshevik gatherings, bludgeoning the individuals who needed compromise with the Mensheviks and uncovering his "April Theses", a framework of his arrangements for the Bolsheviks, which he had composed on the voyage from Switzerland. He freely censured both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries Ã¢ÂÂ who ruled the powerful Petrograd Soviet Ã¢ÂÂ for supporting the Provisional Government, impugning them as backstabbers to communism. Believing the legislature to be similarly as radical as the Tsarist routine, he supported quick harmony with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by soviets, the nationalization of industry and banks, and the state confiscation of land, all with the goal of building up a low class government and pushing toward a communist society. On the other hand, the Mensheviks trusted that Russia was deficiently created to progress to communism and blamed Lenin for attempting to dive the new Republic into common war. Over the coming months, he crusaded for his strategies, going to the gatherings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, productively composing for the Bolshevik paper "Pravda", and giving open addresses in Petrograd went for changing over laborers, officers, mariners, and workers to his motivation.
