Despite the fact that extraordinary, the youngsters' accounts share comparative structures. The story achieves its peak as a stairway shows up at the Dream Gate and Helen and Nights rise, just to be caught by Wizeman and maneuvered into haziness. Will arrives past the point of no return and makes a plunge after them, touching base in the night skies above Bellbridge, where he finds that he can fly without Nights or their Ideya. He safeguards Helen, and the two endeavor to spare Nights, who has been detained at the highest point of Bellbridge's clock tower. Reala touches base to stop their endeavors and acknowledges Nights' test to fight. Subsequent to crushing Reala, the trio get ready to confront Wizeman. Both Will and Helen rout Wizeman, who is therefore pulverized. Since Wizeman kept the majority of his manifestations alive, Nights evaporates in a white light, bowing as though it were the finish of an act, and the kids wake up and cry. That night, Helen plays her violin for her mom in a jam-packed corridor, while Will celebrates with his dad subsequent to winning a football match-up. He at that point loses the ball and follows it, just to happen upon Helen playing her violin. The lights endure an impermanent power outage, and when they walk out on, Helen sees Will stretching out an amicable hand to her. Perceiving each other from their experiences in Nightopia, the two reach for one another as it snows. The last scene is of either kid dozing in their rooms at home as the camera pulls back towards Bellbridge's clock tower, on which Nights apparently is alive and gently looking out for the city.
