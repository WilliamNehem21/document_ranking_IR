Rykener said that he was acquainted with sexual contact with men by Elizabeth Brouderer, a London embroideress who dressed him as a lady and may have gone about as his procurer. As indicated by his record, he had intercourse with the two people, including clerics and nuns. Rykener spent piece of summer 1394 in Oxford, working both as a whore and as an embroideress. He later referenced that in Beaconsfield he had a sexual association with a lady. Rykener came back to London by means of Burford in Oxfordshire, where he functioned as a barmaid and proceeded with sex work. On his arrival to London, he had paid experiences close to the Tower of London, simply outside the City. Rykener was captured with Britby one Sunday evening in ladies' garments, which he was all the while wearing amid his cross examination on 11 December. It was there that he portrayed his experiencesÃ¢ÂÂand his sexual historyÃ¢ÂÂin incredible detail. In any case, it gives the idea that no charges were ever brought against him; or possibly, no records have been found proposing so. Nothing unmistakable is known about Rykener after his cross examination; he has been likely distinguished as a John Rykener detained by and getting away from the Bishop of London in 1399.
