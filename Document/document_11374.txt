Weighing between , "Babakotia radofilai" was a medium-sized lemur and detectably littler than the huge sloth lemurs ("Archaeoindris" and "Palaeopropithecus"), however bigger than the little sloth lemurs ("Mesopropithecus"). From multiple points of view, it had a middle of the road dimension of adjustments for suspensory conduct between the extensive sloth lemurs and the little sloth lemurs. This incorporates its exceptionally portable hip and lower leg joints, just as different specializations in the vertebral segment, pelvis, and appendages. Its forelimbs were 20% longer than its rear appendages, giving it a higher intermembral file (~119) than "Mesopropithecus" (~97 to 113), proposing that it was concurrently like arboreal sloths. It had a diminished bone structure and bended, lengthened digits, adjusted for getting a handle on and proposing suspensory conduct. Its rear feet were decreased, making it very much adjusted for climbing and hanging (like in different palaeopropithecids), yet not jumping (like in indriids). Wrist bones found in 1999 further exhibited that this species was a vertical climber. Also, examination of its crescent channels, lumbar vertebrae and its spinous procedures demonstrate moderate development and climbing (antipronograde) adjustments, however not really sloth-like hanging, vertical sticking, or jumping. In this manner, it was likely a moderate climber like a loris and furthermore shown some suspensory conduct like a sloth.
