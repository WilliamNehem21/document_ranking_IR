Previous flight educator Peter James, who had taken a shot at "Flight Unlimited II", accepted the job of lead creator. He was generally in charge of "Flight Unlimited III's" exercises, planes, and recreated flight instruments. James trusted that other pilot training programs had openings as to authenticity, and he would have liked to make an increasingly precise encounter. Photos were caught of each plane's genuine partner, and development of the 3D plane models was driven by craftsman Duncan Hsu, a previous vehicle modeler at Papyrus Design Group. The flight material science were coded by Kevin Wasserman and include constant figurings of power vectors, for example, those acting against a plane's yaw, pitch, and roll. This framework was further developed than that of "Flight Unlimited II", which was additionally founded on power counts. The material science code was educated by "genuine air ship information" and the individual experience of pilots, and every one of the planes was flown as research for the amusement. Since the plane cockpits of past "Flight Unlimited" diversions had been condemned by pilots, the group endeavored to make "Flight Unlimited III"s cockpits incredibly bona fide. Kemal Amarasingham recorded the planes' audio effects, which he said included "taking a chance with his life" by remaining close stream motors and underwings.
