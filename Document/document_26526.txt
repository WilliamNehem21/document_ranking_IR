According to Volk, "The basic tenet of what we might call Manilius' natural philosophy is the idea that the universe is divine". She writes that Manilius is inconsistent about the location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims the perfectly regular movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars is proof that the universe is the product of a god; he also says the universe itself is a god ("mundum ... ipsum esse deum"). Later in the same book, Manilius again says the universe is the "work of a great divinity" ("magni ... numinis ordo"). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes; "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universeÂ ... Is the world simply ruled by a "diuinum numen" (cf. 1.484) or is it a "deus" (cf 1.485) itself?" Volk answers that in the cosmology of the "Astronomica", "God can be understood as the soul or breathÂ ... present within the world [and] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god". According to Volk, this interpretation of the universe, which states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly way, thus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect affecting everything within the cosmos and that fate rules all.
