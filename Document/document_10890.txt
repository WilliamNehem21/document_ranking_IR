Potts dedicates a few pages to a genuinely itemized analysis of the proof introduced in Grace Sowerbutts' announcement, giving a knowledge into the errors that existed amid the mid seventeenth century between the Protestant foundation's perspective on black magic and the convictions of the average folks, who may have been affected by the more mainland perspectives on Catholic ministers, for example, Christopher Southworth. In contrast to their European partners, the English Protestant first class trusted that witches kept familiars, or sidekick creatures, thus it was not viewed as dependable that the Samlesbury witches had none. Effortlessness' account of the sabbat, as well, was new to the English around then, in spite of the fact that faith in such mystery get-togethers of witches was boundless in Europe. Most demonologists of the period, including King James, held that no one but God could perform supernatural occurrences, and that he had not enabled to conflict with the laws of nature to those allied with the Devil. Henceforth Potts rejects Sowerbutts' case that Jennet Bierley changed herself into a dark pooch with the remark "I would know by what implies any Priest can maintaine this purpose of Evidence". He similarly daintily expels Grace's record of the sabbat she professed to have visited, where she met with "foure dark thingsÃÂ ... dislike men in the face", with the remark that "The Seminarie [priest] botches the face for the feete: For Chattox [one of the Pendle witches] and all her individual witches concur, the Devill is cloven-footed: however Fancie [Chattox's familiar] had an extremely decent face, and was a legitimate man."
