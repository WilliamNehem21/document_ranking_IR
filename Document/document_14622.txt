In 1918, after the flare-up of the Russian Revolution and the annihilation of the Central Powers in World War I, Pilecki came back to Wilno (presently part of the recently autonomous Polish Second Republic) and joined a ZHP Scout segment of the Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defense Militia, a paramilitary arrangement lined up with the White development under General WÃÂadysÃÂaw Wejtko. The volunteer army incapacitated the withdrawing German troops and took up positions to guard the city from an approaching assault by the Soviet Red Army. Be that as it may, Wilno tumbled to Bolshevik powers on 5 January 1919, and Pilecki and his unit depended on fanatic fighting behind Soviet lines. He and his companions at that point withdrew to BiaÃÂystok where Pilecki enrolled as a "szeregowy" (private) in Poland's recently settled volunteer armed force. He participated in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919Ã¢ÂÂ 1921, serving under Captain Jerzy DÃÂbrowski. He battled in the Kiev Offensive (1920) and as a feature of a rangers unit safeguarding the city of Grodno. On 5 August 1920, Pilecki joined the 211th Uhlan Regiment and battled in the vital Battle of Warsaw and in the Rudniki Forest ("Puszcza Rudnicka"). Pilecki later participated in the freedom of Wilno and quickly served in the progressing Polish-Lithuanian War as an individual from the October 1920 ÃÂ»eligowski insubordination. He was twice granted the KrzyÃÂ¼ Walecznych (Cross of Valor) for courage.
