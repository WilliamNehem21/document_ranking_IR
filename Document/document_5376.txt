Albeit, after Keats' passing, acknowledgment of the benefits of his verse came gradually, by mid century, notwithstanding across the board Victorian objection to the affirmed "shortcoming" of his character and the view frequently propelled "that Keats' work spoke to insignificant arousing quality without substance", a portion of his sonnets started to locate a grateful group of onlookers, including "To Autumn". In a 1844 exposition on Keats' verse in the "Dumfries Herald", George Gilfillian set "To Autumn" among "the best of Keats' littler pieces". In a 1851 address, David Macbeth Moir acclaimed "four dazzling tributes,Ã¢ÂÂ 'To a Nightingale,' 'To a Grecian Urn,' 'To Melancholy,' and 'To Autumn,'Ã¢ÂÂ all so pregnant with profound idea, so beautiful in their limning, thus suggestive." In 1865, Matthew Arnold singled out the "indefinable delicacy, appeal, and flawlessness of [...] Keats' [touch] in his Autumn". John Dennis, in a 1883 work about extraordinary artists, composed that "the 'Tribute to Autumn', ready with the wonder of the period it portraysÃ¢ÂÂshould ever have a spot among the most valuable jewels of melodious verse." The 1888 Britannica proclaimed, "Of these [odes] maybe the two closest to outright flawlessness, to the triumphant accomplishment and achievement of the extremely most extreme magnificence conceivable to human words, might be that to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn".
