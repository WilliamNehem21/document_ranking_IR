On 6 February Momolo Mortara gave a record of the case that negated the inquisitor's at pretty much every turn; in Rome, he stated, Edgardo had been "terrified, and threatened by the minister's essence, [but] he straightforwardly proclaimed his craving to return home with us". Carboni then went to San Giovanni in Persiceto to examine Morisi, who gave her age as 23 as opposed to the genuine 26. Morisi said that Edgardo had fallen wiped out in the winter of 1851Ã¢ÂÂ 52, when he was around four months old. She related having seen the Mortaras sitting tragically by Edgardo's den and "perusing from a book in Hebrew that the Jews read when one of them is going to bite the dust". She rehashed her record of giving Edgardo a crisis sanctification at the incitement of the food merchant Lepori and later recounting to the story to a neighbor's hireling called Regina, including that she had likewise disclosed to her sisters about the absolution. As previously, Lepori denied any job in the issue at all, surely saying he couldn't much recollect Morisi. The "Regina" in Morisi's story was recognized as Regina Bussolari; however Morisi affirmed to have revealed to her the entire story, Bussolari proclaimed to remain unaware of the case. She said that she had just spoken with Morisi "on more than one occasion, when she was going up to the extra space to get something", and never about anything to do with the Mortaras' kids.
