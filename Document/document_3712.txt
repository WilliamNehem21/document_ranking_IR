Mucho Macho Man started his second year of dashing by completing fourth behind victor Dialed in the Grade III Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park, and indeed completed behind Gourmet Dinner, who was third. Mucho Macho Man was then sent to New Orleans for the Risen Star Stakes at the Fair Grounds Race Course. Ridden by Rajiv Maragh, he recorded his originally evaluated stakes win, winning by one and a half lengths over Santiva. Ritvo removed the signals for an exercise preceding the race and kept them off, expressing that the yearling had developed and was more quiet without them. At the Risen Star, he previously went to the notice of one of his future racers, Gary Stevens, at that point a games examiner, who noticed the foal's quiet air, depicting him as "a relaxed client... extremely loose". The following race was the Louisiana Derby, a noteworthy preliminary race for the Kentucky Derby. In that race, he lost his correct front horseshoe toward the begin when he "snatched a quarter"Ã¢ÂÂ removing the shoe and a touch of his foot when he ventured on the impact point of his front foot with one of his back feet. He completed third behind Pants on Fire and Nehro.
