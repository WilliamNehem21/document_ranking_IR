Steed burglary turned into a capital offense in 1545, deserving of death. Amid the seventeenth and 18thÃÂ centuries, wrongdoings disregarding property rights were the absolute most seriously rebuffed; the greater part of the 200ÃÂ capital rules were property offenses. Theft joined with viciousness was "the kind of offense, second just to planned homicide (a moderately unprecedented wrongdoing), well on the way to be indicted and rebuffed to [the law's] most extreme thoroughness". Turpin had stolen a few steeds while working under the alias Palmer. In July 1737 he stole a pony from Pinchbeck in Lincolnshire, and took it to visit his dad at Hempstead. At the point when Turpin came back to Brough (taking three ponies en route) he left the gelding with his dad. The character of John Turpin's child was notable, and the steed's personality was before long found. On 12ÃÂ September 1738 in this manner, John Turpin was resolved to gaol in Essex on charges of pony burglary, yet following his assistance in keeping a gaolbreak, the charges were dropped on 5ÃÂ March 1739. About a month after "Palmer" had been moved to York Castle, Thomas Creasy, the proprietor of the three ponies stolen by Turpin, figured out how to follow them down and recoup them, and it was for these burglaries that he was in the end attempted.
