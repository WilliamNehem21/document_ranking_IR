Various huge structures were added to the fortress from 1893 to 1899 including a 10-bed medical clinic, quarters for emergency clinic work force (Bldg 14), and an expansive roughage shed (Bldg 20) which were built in zones behind officers' line in 1894. Of these structures, just the emergency clinic quarters building remains and is presently utilized as a private home. The most huge structure built in 1895 was the U.S. Magistrate's office, which incorporated a prison and living arrangement for the U.S. Marshal (Bldg 49). The principal chief was Judge John W. Meldrum who served the military and National Park Service until 1935 from this structure. Found well west of the remainder of the stronghold, this was the main stone structure inside the post. It was a one-and-a-half-story shake confronted sandstone harping with peak on-hip rooftop, through-the-cornice dormers and a full-width patio. The ground floor of the house contained the correctional facility, office, and living quarters while rooms were arranged on the second floor. The structure is utilized today as a private living arrangement. The structure was subsidized with the entry of the Lacey Act of 1894. Supported by U.S. Delegate John F. Lacey, the Lacey Act was ""An Act To ensure the winged creatures and creatures in Yellowstone National Park, and to rebuff violations in said park, and for different purposes.""
