Behind "Volage" and "DanaÃÂ©", the Venetian "Crown" had connected with "Cerberus" in a short proximity duel, amid which "Cerberus" took overwhelming harm however incurred comparative wounds on the Italian ship. This trade proceeded until the entry of "Dynamic" caused the "DanaÃÂ©", "Crown" and "Carolina" to sheer off and withdraw toward the east. To the back, "Amphion" prevailing with regards to shutting with and raking "Flore", and caused such harm that inside five minutes the French ship's officers tossed the French hues over the edge in surrender. Skipper PÃÂ©ridier had been genuinely injured in the move, and took no part in "Flore's" later developments. "Amphion" at that point assaulted "Bellona" and in a commitment that kept going until 12:00, constrained the Italian ship's surrender. Amid this battle, the little ship "Principessa Augusta" discharged on "Amphion" from a separation, until the frigate had the capacity to turn a firearm on them and drive them off. Hoste sent a punt to claim "Bellona" however because of the harm endured was unfit to dispatch a watercraft to seize "Flore". Acknowledging "Amphion's" trouble, the officers of "Flore", who had made hurried fixes amid the contention among "Amphion" and "Bellona", quickly set sail for the French harbor on Lesina (Hvar), regardless of having just surrendered.
