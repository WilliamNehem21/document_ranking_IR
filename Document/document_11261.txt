In the Fall 1996 issue of "Raritan Quarterly Review", Stephen D. Cox, unreservedly admitting to never having perused the book, in any case called Terhune a "hack essayist" who needed "narrating ability" and reviled "Fellow: A Dog" as non-writing with "sentences [that] are deplorably stilted and hammy" and "tend to stray on long frolics with his own fixations." Terming it a "socially fascinating" work, he surrenders that the novel has kept up "exceptional and enduring" enthusiasm from perusers because of its effectively playing on their feelings and "want to have a collie hound." He cites Irving Litvag, writer of Terhune's life story "The Master of Sunnybank", expressing that Lad "turned into the canine we constantly needed to have and never did. Perhaps more than thatÃ¢ÂÂpossibly he turned into the companion we generally hung tight to discover, or even the sibling, or the dad." In "You're Only Young Twice: Children's Literature and Film", Timothy Morris felt the novel had "dated severely" because of changes in American culture, and keeping in mind that he expressed that he delighted in the work, in contrasting it with Anna Sewell's "Dark Beauty" he blames "Chap: A Dog" for coming up short on a "self-portraying outline" and for leaving perusers speculating about what's going on.
