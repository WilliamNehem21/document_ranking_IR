"Super Mario 64" starts with a letter from Princess Peach welcoming Mario to go to her palace for a cake she has prepared for him. When he arrives, Mario finds that Bowser has attacked the palace and detained the princess and her hirelings inside it utilizing the intensity of the manor's 120 Power Stars. A considerable lot of the manor's canvases are entrances to different universes, in which Bowser's cronies keep watch over the stars. Mario investigates the palace for these entryways to enter the universes and recuperate the stars. He accesses more rooms as he recoups more Power Stars, and in the end navigates three diverse impediment courses, each prompting its very own fight with Bowser.
