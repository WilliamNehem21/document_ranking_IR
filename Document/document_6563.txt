Amid generation, Callaway envisioned the arrangement as a "friend piece" to "", with the expectation that it would have a common viewership. Despite the fact that components of "Songbird One" were kept, Callaway said that "[he] truly begun once again and reconceived it totally as an arrangement starting from the earliest stage". Preceding the arrangement being formally green-lit, Callaway teamed up with author David Simkins to set up an introduction of a "low-planned 30 minute" pilot. Simkins did not chip away at the arrangement after his pilot, yet his commitments earned him a credit as one of its co-makers. John de Lancie, who was noted for going about as Q in "", had attempted the job of DeMilla, and Steve Johnson planned the non-humanoid outsiders. The pilot introduction was shot in Los Angeles, yet the sets were totally revamped for the arrangement's scenes. Three non-humanoid characters, including ANI and Batung, were added to the show following this introduction. UPN administrators reacted emphatically to the introduction, and requested thirteen scenes of the arrangement, which was considered an "a large portion of season's value". "Kindness Point" was one of four shows delivered by Mandalay Television that showed up in the 1998Ã¢ÂÂ 99 United States TV plan, nearby "Cupid", "Reality check", and "Goodness Baby". The show's generation was a piece of a three-million-dollar manage Columbia TriStar Television to deliver 200 hours of material; a larger part of the substance made from this understanding was financially fruitless.
