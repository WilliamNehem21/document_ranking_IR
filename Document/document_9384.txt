The film's Yosemite scenes were altogether shot on area. Long shots of Kirk scaling the mountain were recorded with trick duplicates, while Shatner's nearer shots had him on a fiberglass set situated before the camera, with the genuine mountains noticeable out of sight. Helped by two coaches, Shatner had invested a long time at the Paramount part, figuring out how to climb a wooden copy.

In checking on the dailies of the initial two days of shooting, the creation understood that a pine tree in the edge amid Kirk and Spock's mountain exchange demolished the deception of tallness, while a dose of Shatner sticking to the substance of El Capitan seemed sloppy because of mists darkening the sun and destroying the profundity of field. The scenes must be reshot later.
