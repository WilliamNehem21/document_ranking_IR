The principal Australian stage appearance by Edwards was with George Selth Coppin's organization at the Queen's Theater in Melbourne. Afterward, he joined Gustavus Vaughan Brooke's showy gathering. The piece of Petruchio, the male lead in Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew", was filled by Edwards at the Princess' Theater in Sydney in November 1859, playing inverse tragedian Avonia Jones as Katharine. In December that year Brooke resigned from the board, yielding the reins of his organization to the group of Edwards and George Fawcett Rowe, English performer and writer. Brooke kept on acting under Edwards and Rowe: his featuring execution in April 1860 as Louis XI in Dion Boucicault's play of a similar name was a blending depiction that Edwards, playing Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, reviewed clearly for a mind-blowing remainder. Sharing the stage again in August, Brooke and Edwards were generally welcomed in their depiction of twin siblings in a creation of Shakespeare's "The Comedy of Errors" in Melbourne, the primary Australian mounting of that work. As a turn to arouse open intrigue, Edwards and Brooke traded jobs following two weeks' run. Be that as it may, not the majority of Edwards' exhibitions were fruitful: his turn at Angelo in Shakespeare's "Measure for Measure" was designated "invertebrate" by dramatization faultfinder William John Lawrence; in Lawrence's estimation, Edwards and his kindred on-screen characters withered against the incredible execution of Avonia Jones as Isabella.
