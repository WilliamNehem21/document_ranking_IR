In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, travelled to their Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, "Casino Royale", which had been published in April 1953, and "Live and Let Die", whose publication was imminent. He began writing "Moonraker" on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for "Books and Bookmen" magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: "I write for about three hours in the morningÂ ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have writtenÂ ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he "had to more or less graft the first half of the book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".
