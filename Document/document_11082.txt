Going through time, Kirk and group experience what creator Jody Duncan Shay named an "illusory state". The content's solitary bearing for the impact was "now [they] experience time"; Nimoy and McQuarrie imagined Kirk's fantasy as a montage of unusual pictures. The movie producers chose at an opportune time that piece of the fantasy succession would utilize PC created liveliness to give it an incredible quality separated from the remainder of the film. ILM worked from McQuarrie's storyboards and made an unpleasant counterfeit up or animatic to indicate Nimoy and sharpen the bearing of the grouping. For the earliest reference point of the fantasy, within the Bird-of-Prey connect was painted unmistakable white. Some portion of the last arrangement included transforming the leaders of the "Undertaking" group into each other; ILM digitized the cast individuals' heads utilizing a 3-D filtering innovation created by Cyberware and utilized the subsequent information for the PC models. Since each head show had a similar number of key perspectives, changing one character into another was basic; increasingly troublesome, the illustrators reviewed, was guaranteeing that the change looked "satisfying" and not "abnormal". The subsequent thirty seconds of film took a long time to render; the office utilized each extra PC they could discover to help in the preparing errands. ILM's stage, optical, and matte divisions teamed up to finish different shots for the fantasy grouping. The shot of a man's tumble to Earth was made by taping a little manikin on bluescreen. Shots of fluid nitrogen composited behind the manikin gave the impression of smoke. The foundation plate of the planet was a vast matte that enabled the camera to zoom in extremely close. The last shot of mucky territory was useful and required no impacts.
