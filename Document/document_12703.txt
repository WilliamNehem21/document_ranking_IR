In 1997, the American scientist Kenneth Carpenter called attention to that the dorsal vertebrae from the back of the pachycephalosaur "Homalocephale" demonstrate that the back bended downwards just before the neck (which was not protected), and except if the neck bended upwards, the head would point to the ground. He consequently deduced that the necks of "Stegoceras" and different pachycephalosaurs were held in a bended stance (just like the standard in dinosaurs), and that they would hence not have had the capacity to adjust their head, neck, and body on a level plane straight, which would be expected to transmit pressure. Their necks would need to be held underneath the dimension of the back, which would have gambled harming the spinal string on effect. Present day bighorn sheep and buffalo defeat this issue by having solid tendons from the neck to the tall neural spines over the shoulders (which assimilate the power of effect), yet such highlights are not known in pachycephalosaurs. These creatures likewise assimilate the power of effect through sinus chambers at the base of their horns, and their temples and horns structure an expansive contact surface, in contrast to the tight surface of pachycephalosaur arches. Since the arch of "Stegoceras" was adjusted, it would have given an exceptionally little territory for potential effect, and the vaults would have looked off one another (except if the effect was impeccably focused). Battling pachycephalosaurs would have experienced issues seeing one another while their heads were brought down, because of the hard edges over the eyes.
