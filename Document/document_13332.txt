Expressively, the tune is about a down and out man who proceeds onward from quite a while ago. A "Moving Stone" analyst considered the tune a "separation aria". As indicated by Caroline Sullivan of "The Guardian", "Cry Me a River" emerges for its "moderate structure feeling of dramatization", which features Timberlake at his "imposing best". The tune starts with the expression "You were my sun, you were my earth", which as per Timbaland was Timberlake's motivation to compose the tune. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News saw that Timberlake was wronged and said this is exhibited by the verses: "You don't need to state whatcha did/I definitely know, I discovered from him/Now there's simply no possibility." The chorale contains the lines: "Revealed to me you cherished me, for what reason did you disregard me all/Now you disclose to me you need me when you call me on the telephone." "Inclination Magazine's" Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single "What Goes Around... Comes Around" an apparent continuation of "Cry Me a River" both melodiously and musically. Jason Lipshutz of "Board" expressed that beside the nearness of Timbaland's "fabulously jumbled creation", the distinction between "Cry Me a River" and Timberlake's 2013 single "Mirrors" is clear: "10 years back, Timberlake was broken, and now he is entirety".
