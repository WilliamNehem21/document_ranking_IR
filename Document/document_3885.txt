"Los Angeles Times" editorial manager Ernesto Lecnher gave the collection one-and-a-half out of four stars and asserted that "Sentiments" "sinks under its very own weight, conveying for the most part enlarged renditions of ageless material". Individual "Los Angeles Times" donor Ed Morales couldn't help contradicting his audit: "Lechner needs to go into his music room, turn down the lights, cuddle up with his loved one and truly tune in to 'Sentiments.' I give his survey * and 'Sentiments' ****" . Anne Valdespino of the "Los Angeles Daily News" adulated the determination of tunes and Miguel's execution, considering the entertainer an "exemplary character". "The San Diego Union-Tribune" music pundit Ernesto Portillo Jr. evaluated "Sentiments" three-out-of four stars and asserted that Miguel's "translations are top notch and the music, with generation assistance from renowned arranger Armando Manzanero, is executed with perfect exactness". In any case, he scrutinized the requirement for a third in the "Sentiment" arrangement as he felt it "reduces the exceptionalness" of "Sentiment" and "Segundo Romance" noticed that not all tracks in the collection are "genuine boleros". "El Nuevo Herald" manager Eliseo Cardona composed a for the most part positive audit of the collection. He complimented Miguel's vocals and the creations however expressed that Migule's elucidation of "La Gloria Eres Tu" "pales" contrasted with Lucho Gatica and JosÃÂ©'s front of the melody. Ramiro Burr of the "San Antonio Express-News" said "Sentiments" "shines with the delight of visiting great companions" and commended its "ageless music, lovely organization" and complimented Silvetti's courses of action. Burr remarked while "we've heard every one of these works of art previously, and apparently a million times" Miguel "does it so well, it barely appears to issue."
