"Collingwood" received a brief refit at Rosyth in early September before rejoining the Grand Fleet. On 29 October Sturdee came aboard to present the ship with her battle honour, "Jutland 1916". Captain Wilmot Nicholson briefly assumed command on 1 December before transferring to the new battlecruiser upon his relief by Captain Cole Fowler on 26 March 1917. Together with the rest of the 4th Battle Squadron, "Collingwood" put to sea for tactical exercises for a few days in February 1917. The ship was present at Scapa Flow when her sister ship s magazines exploded on 9 July and her crew recovered the bodies of three men killed in the explosion. In January 1918, "Collingwood" and other of the older dreadnoughts cruised off the coast of Norway for several days, possibly to provide distant cover for a convoy to Norway. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, she sortied on the afternoon of 23 April after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired. By early November, "Collingwood" was at Invergordon to receive a brief refit in the floating dock based there, and missed the surrender of the High Seas Fleet on the 21st. She was slightly damaged on 23 November while attempting to come alongside the oiler RFA "Ebonol".
