With the real towns and the railroads under British control, the traditional period of the war finished; Kruger wired Steyn contemplating surrender, yet the Free State President demanded they battle "in any case". Kruger found new quality in Steyn and telegrammed all Transvaal officers precluding the setting down of arms. "Bittereinders" ("severe enders") under Botha, Christiaan de Wet and Koos de la Rey took to the veld and pursued a guerrilla battle. The British under Lord Kitchener connected seared earth strategy accordingly, consuming the ranches of Boers still in the field; non-soldiers (for the most part ladies and kids) were put into what the British Army named death camps. Kruger moved to Waterval Onder, where his little house turned into the "Krugerhof", in late June. After Roberts reported the extension of the South African Republic to the British Empire on 1 September 1900Ã¢ÂÂthe Free State had been attached on 24 MayÃ¢ÂÂKruger broadcasted on 3 September this was "not perceived" and "pronounced invalid and void". It was chosen in the next days that to keep his catch Kruger would leave for LourenÃÂ§o Marques and there load up ship for Europe. Formally he was to visit the mainland, and maybe America as well, to raise support for the Boer cause.
