Right off the bat in 1943 a strategy change was mooted to expel female officers from the specialized musterings they had so far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these jobs. In restricting this, Stevenson circumvented the new Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore Frank Lukis, and composed straightforwardly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore John McCauley. She told McCauley, "I battle that it is a misuse of cash and preparing to take ladies figure officers, ladies from Signals (S4) and casualtyÃÂ ... when they have took in their work and substitute these ladies by men who need to become familiar with the activity", and suggested that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to guarantee that female officers kept on being utilized in specialized positions, and not just for organization and welfare. McCauley concurred with Stevenson however Lukis spoke to Air Vice Marshal George Jones, the Chief of the Air Staff. Jones supported Lukis' power, and the last sent what Joyce Thomson depicted as a "stinging reproach" to Stevenson, who was compelled to apologize. In any occasion, ladies officers kept on being utilized in specialized positions as the WAAAF extended throughout the following two years, cresting in quality at 18,667 individuals in October 1944. Starting at July that year, ladies contained thirty-one percent of Air Force ground staff and filled sixty-one exchanges, all recently involved by men. Before the finish of the war around 27,000 ladies had served in the WAAAF.
