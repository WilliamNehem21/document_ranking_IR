"Slay Tracks" found unexpected attention after the Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered "Box Elder" on their own 1990 EP, "Brassneck". The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to "Slay Tracks" by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover is different from the original in that the line "that I had to get the fuck out of this town" was changed to "that I had to get right out of this town". The "Box Elder" cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that."
