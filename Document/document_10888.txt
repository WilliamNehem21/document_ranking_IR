Postponed by challenges over their privateering payments and an absence of positive breezes, the campaign left Plymouth on 13 February 1719. The boats wound up isolated and cruised autonomously after that; Shelvocke's direct in doing as such was in this manner the reason for suit. On 4 June, at Cape Frio, in Brazil, the "Speedwell" experienced a Portuguese ship. Notwithstanding the way that the Portuguese were partners of Britain, Shelvocke sent Hatley crosswise over with a furnished team. They left with gold and different resources. At that point, the ship tied down at the present-day site of Florianopolis, Brazil on 20 June, and would not at long last leave until mid-August. Amid that time, the group fixed the vessel and assembled supplies in anticipation of the Cape Horn section. Toward the finish of July, Shelvocke recorded, the group requested new terms for division of the undertaking's loot, expressing that Rogers' team had never gotten the full proportion of what was expected them. Shelvocke accused Hatley for this scene, however whether it was a rebellion or finished with the pioneer's conspiracy is questionable, as the outcome left Shelvocke responsible for how rewards would be separated and with a more prominent offer of the fortune. Hatley additionally got into issue with local people, offending one of their pioneers, and Shelvocke, in his diary, blamed Hatley for mishandling the ladies.
