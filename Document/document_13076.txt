For the first of the evening show's two sets, the band played out the sytheses "Tatu", "Agharta Prelude", and "Maiysha" (from "Get Up with It"), making up "Agharta"s first circle of music. The second-set exhibitions of "Directly Off" (from Davis' 1971 "Jack Johnson" collection), "Ife" (from "Enormous Fun"), and "Wili (= For Dave)" traversed the second circle; between the "Directly Off" and "Ife" sections, the band ad libbed an entry dependent on "So What" (from the 1959 collection "Sort of Blue") for 41 seconds after Henderson began to play its ostinato. The pieces were performed in varieties, which were given nonexclusive track titles on "Agharta, for example, "Prelude" and "Intermission". Similarly as with his other live discharges during the 1970s, Davis wouldn't have singular sytheses determined in the track posting since he felt commentators and different audience members regularly disregarded the music's inherent significance by enjoying conceptual melodic investigation. "I'm not doing anything, it needn't bother with a clarification", he later disclosed to Leonard Feather. Music researchers had the capacity to recognize the pieces through an examination of what Davis scientist Enrico Merlin called "coded phrases", which Davis played on trumpet or organ to imply the finish of one fragment and direct the band toward the following area. He previously utilized such signals and adjustments when recording "Flamenco Sketches" in 1959, Merlin said.
