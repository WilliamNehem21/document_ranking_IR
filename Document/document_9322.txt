Francis Mackey, an accomplished harbor pilot, had boarded "Mont-Blanc" on the night of 5 December 1917; he had gotten some information about "exceptional assurances, for example, a watchman dispatch, given the "Mont-Blanc's" freight, yet no insurances were set up. "Mont-Blanc" began moving at 7:30ÃÂ am on 6 December and was the second ship to enter the harbor as the counter submarine net between Georges Island and Pier 21 opened through the first part of the day. "Mont-Blanc" headed towards Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth side of the harbor. Mackey watched out for the ship traffic among Halifax and Dartmouth and other little water crafts in the region. He initially spotted "Imo" when she was about away and ended up worried as her way gave off an impression of being going towards his ship's starboard side, as though to cut him off his very own course. Mackey gave a short impact of his ship's flag whistle to demonstrate that he had the option to proceed yet was met with two short impacts from "Imo", showing that the moving toward vessel would not yield its position. The chief arranged "Mont-Blanc" to end her motors and point marginally to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single impact of his whistle, trusting the other vessel would moreover move to starboard however was again met with a twofold impact in invalidation.
