The 1499 Madonna board is a free adaption, in that the craftsman has changed and repositioned various components. Nonetheless, craftsmanship history specialists generally concur that they are to the disadvantage of the parity and effect of the structure. The board credited to Gossaert indicates considerably increasingly noteworthy, however maybe progressively effective, modifications, including moving the focal point of equalization by adding a segment to one side hand side, dressing the Virgin altogether in dull blue and changing her facial highlights. The two duplicates preclude the two pools of splendid light on the floor opposite her, therefore evacuating the magical component of van Eyck's unique, maybe in light of the fact that its importance was not gotten a handle on by the later craftsmen. That Gossaert pursued different parts of the first so intently, be that as it may, is proof of the high respect he held for van Eyck's specialized and tasteful capacity, and his adaptation has been seen by some as a tribute. The Master of 1499's deference for van Eyck can be found in his left-hand board, which contains numerous highlights reminiscent of van Eyck's "Arnolfini Portrait", including the rendering of the roof shafts and the shading and surface of the red textures.
