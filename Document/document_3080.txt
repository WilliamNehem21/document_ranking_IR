As indicated by Volk, "The fundamental precept of what we may call Manilius' common logic is the possibility that the universe is divine". She composes that Manilius is conflicting about the area of this eternality. For example, in his first book, Manilius claims the consummately standard development of the sun, moon, planets, and stars is evidence that the universe is the result of a divine being; he additionally says the universe itself is a divine being ("mundum ... ipsum esse deum"). Later in a similar book, Manilius again says the universe is the "work of an extraordinary heavenliness" ("magni ... numinis ordo"). Concerning this instability, Volk expresses; "Unmistakably there is a sure versatility to Manilius' idea of the godlikeness of the universeÃÂ ... Is the world essentially administered by a "diuinum numen" (cf. 1.484) or is it a "deus" (cf 1.485) itself?" Volk answers that in the cosmology of the "Astronomica", "God can be comprehended as the spirit or breathÃÂ ... present inside the world [and] since this celestial substance totally overruns the universe, it bodes well to consider the universe itself a divine being". As indicated by Volk, this understanding of the universe, which expresses that it has a feeling of keenness and that it works in an organized way, in this way permits Manilius to battle both that there is a solid chain of circumstances and logical results influencing everything inside the universe and that destiny leads all.
