In the mid year of 1841 Charles and Emma Darwin moved from the strife of London to the wide open, to Down House, a calm previous parsonage in the town of Downe. He expressed, "The blooms are here extremely excellent". Darwin pursued the suggestion of his companion, the main botanist Robert Brown, and read "Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen" ("The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilization of Flowers Discovered"). The little known book, distributed in 1793 by Christian Konrad Sprengel yet never converted into English, presented the possibility that roses were made by God to satisfy a teleological reason: creepy crawlies would go about as "living brushes" to cross-prepare plants in a cooperative relationship. This useful view was rejected and for the most part overlooked, as it repudiated the basic conviction that blooms had been made for excellence, and were commonly self-preparing. For Darwin, the idea of development shined a different light on Sprengel's investigation into the components for cross-preparation. He respected its help for his supposition that cross-treatment in blooming plants would in general enable their posterity to stay away from conceivable burdens coming about because of self-preparation, and by 1845 he had checked a large number of Sprengel's perceptions.
