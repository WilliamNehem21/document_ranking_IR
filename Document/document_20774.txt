The relativistic jet of matter emerging from the core extends at least from the nucleus and consists of matter ejected from a supermassive black hole. The jet is highly collimated, appearing constrained to an angle of 60Â° within of the core, to about 16Â° at , and to 6â7Â° at . Its base has the diameter of Schwarzschild radii, and is probably powered by a prograde accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole. The German-American astronomer Walter Baade found that light from the jet was plane polarized, which suggests that the energy is generated by the acceleration of electrons moving at relativistic velocities in a magnetic field. The total energy of these electrons is estimated at 5.1 Ã 10 ergs (5.1 Ã 10 joules or 3.2 Ã 10 eV). This is roughly 10 times the energy produced by the Milky Way in one second, which is estimated at 5 Ã 10 joules. The jet is surrounded by a lower-velocity non-relativistic component. There is evidence of a counter jet, but it remains unseen from the Earth due to relativistic beaming. The jet is precessing, causing the outflow to form a helical pattern out to . Lobes of expelled matter extend out to .
