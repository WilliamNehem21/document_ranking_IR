In the wake of tumbling from seventh to tenth in the Drivers' Championship at the past race (at Charlotte Motor Speedway), Gordon said he would attempt and win races to come back to dispute for the title. Jeff Burton called the Subway 500 "another unpredictable race in the Chase", and figured it would essentially affect the pursuit contenders. In spite of the fact that Kenseth felt that the race would be the hardest for his group, he trusted that a decent completion would place him in a superior position for the title in view of his great outcomes at the tracks following the Martinsville race. After a decent completion at Charlotte, Earnhardt felt he was "healthy": "Jeff has been at this quite a while, yet I don't take a gander at him as indestructible. On the off chance that he has a misstep or even a few awful runs, it will totally shake up the focuses." After winning the Busch Series title, Harvick concentrated on the Nextel Cup title: "We're amped up for it, pleased with what we've done for the current year, and, ideally, we can do what we have to do on the Cup side in the following five weeks. I have never had a season this way." Hamlin figured he would perform well at Martinsville, where he felt agreeable, and he and his group did not lead themselves out of conflict for the title.
