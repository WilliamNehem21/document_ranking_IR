In spite of the fact that the most noticeably bad of the tempest struck close low tide, the blend of an expansive tempest flood and high waves caused across the board harm along the coast. Tempest flood esteems came to in Townsville Harbor; the Ross River encountered a water level ascent that submerged avenues in the city. Delivery interests in the waterway endured widely when a flatboat broke free of its moorings and slammed into various littler vessels. An expected pinnacle storm flood of happened at Toolakea. Notwithstanding the flood, wave activity was profoundly ruinous. Seawalls and seaside roadways were pulverized by the beating surf in spots, for example, the Strand and Cape Pallarenda. The rough inland stream produced extreme shoreline disintegration from Townsville to Toolakea, while north of the tempest's middle, in the Greater Palm gathering of islands, significant disintegration came about because of southwesterly breezes. Shorelines retreated by as much as among Pallarenda and Rowes Bay, and by up to at Balgal Beach close to the typhoon's landfall point. Tempest flood esteems decreased strongly toward the north of the tempest focus, however stayed high well toward the south, with better than average water levels stretching out as far south as Mackay.
