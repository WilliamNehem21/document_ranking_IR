While he was ending up progressively vocal and noticeable in governmental issues, Havelock's insightful work was advancing toward the worries that would involve him for the greater part of his vocation. The principal interrogates he raised regarding the connection among proficiency and orality in Greece concerned the idea of the recorded Socrates, which was a since quite a while ago discussed issue. Havelock's position, drawn from investigations of Xenophon and Aristophanes just as Plato himself, was that Plato's introduction of his educator was generally a fiction, and expected to be a straightforward one, whose reason for existing was to speak to in a roundabout way Plato's very own thoughts. He contended vociferously against the thought related with John Burnet, which still had cash at the time, that the fundamental model for the hypothesis of structures began with Socrates. Havelock's contention drew on proof for a chronicled change in Greek theory; Plato, he contended, was on a very basic level expounding on the thoughts of his present, not of the past. Most prior work in the field had expected that, since Plato utilizes Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns probably been like those bantered in the Athens of his childhood, when Socrates was his instructor. Havelock's conflict that Socrates and Plato had a place with various philosophical periods was the main case of one that would end up vital to his work: that an essential move in the sorts of thoughts being talked about by scholarly people, and the strategies for examining them, occurred eventually between the finish of the fifth century BC and the center of the fourth.
