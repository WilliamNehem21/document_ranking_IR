In 1888 Lansbury consented to go about as race operator for Jane Cobden, who was challenging the principal decisions for the recently framed London County Council (LCC) as Liberal possibility for the Bow and Bromley division. Cobden, an early supporter of ladies' suffrage, was the fourth offspring of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. The Society for Promoting Women as County Councilors (SPWCC), another ladies' rights gathering, had proposed Cobden as the possibility for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst for Brixton. Lansbury guided Cobden in the issues of most noteworthy worry toward the East End electorate: lodging for poor people, completion of perspired work, privileges of open gathering, and control of the police. Explicit inquiries of ladies' rights were to a great extent abstained from amid the battle. On 19 January 1889 the two ladies were chosen; these triumphs were, be that as it may, fleeting. Sandhurst's capability to fill in as a province councilor was effectively tested in the courts by her Conservative Party adversaries on the grounds of her sex, and her ensuing intrigue was expelled. Cobden was not quickly tested, yet in April 1891, after a progression of lawful activities, she was viably fixed as a councilor by being kept from casting a ballot on agony of extreme money related punishments. Lansbury encouraged her, amid the hearings, to "go to jail and give the Council back you up by declining to a chance to pronounce your seat empty". Cobden did not pursue this way. A Bill presented in the House of Commons in May 1891 allowing ladies to fill in as region councilors discovered little help among MPs of any gathering; ladies were not conceded this privilege until 1907.
