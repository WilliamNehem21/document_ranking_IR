Jassin composes that Amir's ballads were likewise affected by his adoration for at least one ladies, in "Buah Rindu" alluded to as "Tedja" and "Sendari-Dewi"; he opines that the lady or ladies are never named as Amir's affection for them is the key. Husny composes that something like nine of the works in "Buah Rindu" were enlivened by his aching for Aja Bun, depicting a feeling of dissatisfaction after their commitment was canceled. With respect to book's three-section devotion, "to the sad Greater Indonesia/to the fiery debris of the Mother-Queen/and to the feet of the Sendari-Goddess", Mihardja composes that Sundari was promptly unmistakable to any of Amir's cohorts; he thinks of her as the writer's motivation as "Laura to Petrarch, Mathilde to Jacques Perk". The faultfinder Zuber Usman discovers Sundari's impact on "Nyanyi Sunyi" too, proposing his separating from her drove Amir closer to God, a feeling Dini echoes. The interpreter Burton Raffel interfaces a couplet toward the finish of the book, perusing "" ("A blossom coasting in a free bunch of hair/Gave birth to my sad lyrics") as a shout to an illegal love. Dini credits Amir's adoration for Sundari for his continuous utilization of Javanese terms in his composition.
