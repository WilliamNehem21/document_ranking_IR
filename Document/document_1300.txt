Whenever Willow and Tara initially met in the fourth season, the essayists did not expect the relationship to be sentimental but rather the on-screen characters had such science that, two scenes later, Whedon and the composition group took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to educate them where it would go. For the remainder of the period, the sexual connection among Willow and Tara was spoken to figuratively by black magic, and none of the WB officials acknowledged it. At last, Whedon adulated the manner in which the WB took care of the showcase of fondness in "The Body", saying "They raised an eyebrow, yet they've been extraordinary. I give the WB props when it went to the [characters' first] kiss. What I need to demonstrate is genuine friendship, and 'The Body' ended up being the ideal spot to place it in. To the system's credit, they circulated it, yet they didn't publicize it. I imagined that was truly tasteful." Stephen Tropiano in "Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV" composes that this methodology was "genuinely pivotal"; no long discourse, no tremendous revelation: "Like Willow, we're made to feel as though her affection for Tara is the most normal thing on the planet". Tropiano calls it "A straightforward kiss. A peaceful, straightforward minute. Two darlings kissing. Much the same as darlings do."
