In 1933 he joined Bracken and Anderson in challenging to Bennett that nothing more should be possible: in Brownlee's view, the territory's ruined individuals couldn't settle increasingly regulatory expenses, but desires for commonplace governments were continually developing. Left to their very own gadgets, the premiers stated, they would need to either definitely cut help installments or default on obligation installments.

Bennett answered by berating the premiers for not doing what's needed to "work into a place of independence" and declared that government backing would be cut off except if spending shortages were constrained to $1 million. In a different letter to Brownlee, he lauded him for doing "superior to anything any of the Western Provinces" yet said that, in light of a legitimate concern for balance, he was forcing indistinguishable conditions on Alberta from on the others.
