Catherine herself had been taught in crystal gazing and space science. In spite of the fact that these were generally viewed as good subjects, Catherine's biographer Leonie Frieda trusts that it was her interest with these subjects that has earned her the notoriety history and her friends agreed her. Surely, it has been recommended that Catherine instructed her child, Henry III, in obscurity expressions, and that "the two committed themselves to divinations that were outrages of the age". Thus, a few (increasingly extraordinary) writers trust Catherine to be the maker of the Black Mass, a Satanic reversal of the conventional Catholic Mass, in spite of the fact that there is little to demonstrate this beside Jean Bodin's record in his book "De la dÃÂ©monomanie des sorciers". By the by, Catherine was never formally denounced or indicted in spite of the way that her rule encountered the best number of arraignments for Witchcraft in Italy. This loans some weight to the proposal that individuals were marked 'witches' just in light of the fact that they didn't act the manner in which a lady should (modest and appreciative), or basically to suit individual plans. This might be especially valid for Catherine as an Italian lady governing in France; a few antiquarians contend that she was disdained by her French subjects, who marked her "the Italian lady". In any occasion, the bits of gossip have made a blemish on Catherine's notoriety after some time, and there are presently numerous dramaticised works about her association in the mysterious.
