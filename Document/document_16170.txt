Albert Payson Terhune was an established newspaperman and author of several books in various genresâincluding histories and thrillersâwhen he penned his first canine short story, "His Mate". Ray Long, then editor for "Red Book Magazine", had jokingly suggested he write a story about Lad one afternoon, when the reticent dog put his head on Long's knee after having snubbed the familiar visitor for the last year. Having already tried to market the idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years, Terhune readily agreed. The first story featured three Rough Collies, Lad, Lady and Knave, and used a similar formula to his previous works: an average male (Lad) protects a beautiful female (Lady) from a larger villain (Knave). Long purchased the work for "Red Book" for $200 and it was published in the January 1916 issue. Four magazines requested similar stories, and Terhune complied, finding them easy to write and sell. Additional stories, all featuring Lad and titled "Lad Stories", were published in the "Saturday Evening Post", "Ladies' Home Journal", "Hartford Courant", and the "Atlantic Monthly", though "Red Book" remained his most consistent publisher. By 1918, the stories had grown in popularity and Terhune was paid an average of $1,000 each for the tales, with some selling for as much as $2,500. Though marketed as fiction, even people who were acquainted with the Terhunes and Lad reportedly believed that the stories were real.
