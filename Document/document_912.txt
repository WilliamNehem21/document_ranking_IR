At this point, the ninth Division was about East of Lae, while the seventh Division was away and "it showed up a chances on wager that the ninth would reach Lae first". The seventh Division continued its development at sunrise on 16 September. The last ten Japanese troops confronting the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion were executed and the 2/25th Infantry Battalion went through its position and set out toward Lae. As they moved down the Markham Valley Road, they at times experienced wiped out Japanese warriors who held the section quickly. Brigadier Eather came up in his jeep and began asking the diggers to hustle just a bit. They were neutral. Eather, furnished with a gun, at that point went about as driving scout, with his troops following in a segment of course behind him. The section entered Lae unopposed by the Japanese yet air ship of the Fifth Air Force strafed the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion and dropped parachute fracture bombs, injuring two men. Whitehead before long got a message sent free from Vasey that read: "Just the Fifth Air Force aircraft are keeping me from entering Lae." By early evening, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion achieved the Lae runway where it murdered 15 Japanese officers and caught one. The 25th Infantry Brigade at that point experienced harsh criticism from the ninth Division's 25-pounders, injuring one trooper. Vasey and Eather attempted each accessible way to educate Wootten of the circumstance. A message inevitably contacted him through RAAF channels at 14:25 and the big guns was quieted.
