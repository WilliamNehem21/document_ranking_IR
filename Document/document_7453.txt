The scene was hard to execute, taking ILM five months to wrap up. Jaeger contrived an apparatus that would bring down the on-screen character on the set, and connected a prosthetic spine over a blue suit so that ILM could evacuate Krige's lower body. This system empowered the movie producers to fuse however many real to life components as could reasonably be expected without turning to encourage advanced impacts. To influence the prosthetics to show up at the correct point when her lower body was evacuated, Krige expanded her neck forward so it showed up in accordance with the spine. Glade did not need it to appear that the Queen was on a hard, mechanical apparatus; "we needed her to have the fitting 'glide'," he clarified. Utilizing separate movement control passes on the set, Knoll shot the lower of the upper middle and the optional grouping with Krige's whole body. An advanced variant of the Borg body suit was utilized for the bringing down succession, so, all things considered the picture was transformed back to the genuine shot of Krige's body. The energized paws of the suit were made carefully too utilizing a nitty gritty model. As reference to the artists, the shot required Krige to reasonably depict "the unusual torment or fulfillment of being reconnected to her body".
