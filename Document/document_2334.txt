Isabella spent the most recent long stretches of 1326 in the West Country, and keeping in mind that in Bristol saw the hanging of Despenser's dad, the Earl of Winchester on 27 October. Despenser himself was caught in Hereford and executed there inside the month. In Bristol Isabella, Mortimer and the going with masters talked about procedure. Not yet having the Great Seal, on 26 October they broadcasted the youthful Edward watchman of the domain, proclaiming that "by the consent of the entire network of the said kingdom present there, they collectively picked [Edward III] as attendant of the said kingdom".
