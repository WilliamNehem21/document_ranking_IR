Kinkaid now confronted the possibility of choice to raise chief naval officer. He realized that skippers regularly required a specific measure of seagoing direction experience to be considered, but since his voyage through obligation on "Indianapolis" had been sliced short so as to take up the post in Rome, he didn't have enough months, and it was improbable that a billet as chief of a war vessel or cruiser would come up in adequate time before the following round of choices. He examined the issue with leader of the Officers' Detail Section at the Bureau of Navigation, Captain Arthur S. Carpender, an Annapolis schoolmate who had himself as of late been chosen for banner position. Carpender thought of an answer: he suggested Kinkaid for direction of a destroyer squadron. This was a seagoing direction, in spite of the fact that Kinkaid was to some degree senior for it. Great wellness reports as authority of Destroyer Squadron 8, situated in Philadelphia, brought about Kinkaid's advancement to raise chief naval officer in August 1941, in spite of having close to two years of complete order understanding. He turned into the remainder of his class to be elevated to signal position before the United States entered the war. Nobody positioning lower in the class was elevated to hail rank before retirement.
