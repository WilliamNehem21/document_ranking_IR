Whatever the genuine course of occasions, Theodore's sudden triumph resounded all through the Greek world, and significantly improved his standing; even the normally unfriendly Akropolites was compelled to concede in his history that this accomplishment was "of extraordinary help to the Romans". Then again it daunted Pope Honorius, who sent letters to the Latin rulers of Greece just as the Doge of Venice and Peter of Courtenay's child in-law King Andrew II of Hungary (), asking them to draw in themselves to verify the arrival of Peter and Colonna. He even kept in touch with Andrew and the French religious administrators to require a campaign against Theodore, with which he likewise compromised Theodore in a letter. With the primary contingents for the campaign collecting at Ancona in late 1217, and the Venetians anxious to benefit from the campaign to recoup Dyrrhachium, the weight proved to be fruitful: in March 1218, Colonna was discharged, with Theodore offering his expressions of remorse and affirmations of dependability to the Pope. Honorius then changed his strategy to the point of disallowing the Doge of Venice to hurt Theodore in the smallest, trusting accordingly to verify the arrival of more detainees. Albeit a portion of the lesser aristocrats were liberated, Peter and a significant number of the most senior masters stayed in imprisonment until their demise. It is obscure when Peter of Courtenay passed on, however this was most likely before September 1219.
