Why the Swedish armada strayed from the first arrangement of drawing in the unified power in home waters north of ÃÂland has never been agreeably clarified. As per Rosenberg and Gyllenspak on "Kronan", Creutz made a turn on the grounds that Uggla had flagged that he was going about. Rosenberg additionally trusted that BÃÂ¤r on "Nyckeln", chief of naval operations of the principal squadron, was first to make a turn, and that Uggla thought of it as important to pursue this spontaneous move to keep the armada together. Officers Anders Homman and Olof Norman, who both endure "SvÃÂ¤rdet", asserted that just Creutz as armada authority could have settled on such a choice and, that Uggla was just after "Kronan"s lead. Witnesses who affirmed before the commission guaranteed that contention between the officers was the reason that essential precautionary measures were not taken before "Kronan" happened. Rosenberg affirmed that Lieutenant Admiral Arvid BjÃÂ¶rnram and Major Klas AnkarfjÃÂ¤ll had transparently differ on how much sail ought to be set and how near land the ship should cruise. As per Gyllenspak, senior armada pilot Per Gabrielsson had voiced his worries against turning in the unpleasant climate, yet nobody had paid attention to his recommendation.
