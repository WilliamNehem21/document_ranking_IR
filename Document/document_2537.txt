She played Roslyn, an as of late separated from lady who moves toward becoming companions with three maturing cowpokes, played by Clark Gable, Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift. The shooting in the Nevada desert among July and November 1960 was again troublesome. The four-year marriage of Monroe and Miller was viably finished, and he started another association with set picture taker Inge Morath. Monroe despised that he had put together her job halfway with respect to her life, and figured it substandard compared to the male jobs; she likewise battled with Miller's propensity for re-composing scenes the prior night taping. Her wellbeing was likewise coming up short: she was in agony from gallstones, and her chronic drug use was severe to the point that her make-up for the most part must be connected while she was still snoozing affected by barbiturates. In August, recording was stopped for her to go through seven days detoxing in a Los Angeles emergency clinic. In spite of her issues, Huston expressed that when Monroe was playing Roslyn, she "was not professing to a feeling. It was the genuine article. She would dive deep down inside herself and discover it and bring it up into cognizance."
