At the point when the American performer who had been contracted to play Anne dropped out just before the beginning of essential photography, Argento persuaded Nicolodi to take on this bigger job. Nicolodi discovered Anne to have an unexpected identity in comparison to her own, and very much wanted the characters she had played for Argento already, who she said had significantly more identity than Anne. She said the job required little vitality or creative energy, however loved the curiosity of playing neither executioner nor unfortunate casualty. Newman and Alan Jones concurred that Nicolodi had almost no character to play, as composed. Newman included that this absence of character extended to every one of the Italians in the film, and that just the American characters had perceptible identities. Nicolodi later asserted that in spite of the fact that recording started all around ok, Argento wound up furious when she and Franciosa reinforced over writer Tennessee Williams and their involvement in theater, driving the executive to ensure their common scenes "were a difficulty to persevere". The accused climate finished of Argento purportedly telling Franciosa, "disregard my lady!" Nicolodi said she diverted her dissatisfactions with the circumstance into her character's last scene in the film, where Anne remains in the downpour and shouts more than once, proceeding over the film's end credits. She had been coordinated to shout just a little, yet realizing it was the latest day of taping and her last scene to finish, Nicolodi shouted noisily and for quite a while, a lot to Argento's and the team's shock. Nicolodi said the scene was her "cathartic discharge from the entire bad dream".
