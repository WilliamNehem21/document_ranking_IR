From the get-go in 1069, Edgar the ÃÂtheling ascended in rebellion and assaulted York. In spite of the fact that William came back to York and constructed another stronghold, Edgar stayed free, and in the pre-winter he collaborated with King Sweyn of Denmark. The Danish lord had conveyed an expansive armada to England and assaulted York as well as Exeter and Shrewsbury. York was caught by the joined powers of Edgar and Sweyn. Edgar was broadcasted ruler by his supporters, however William reacted quickly, disregarding a mainland revolt in Maine. William emblematically wore his crown in the remnants of York on Christmas Day 1069, and after that continued to pay off the Danes. He walked to the River Tees, attacking the wide open as he went. Edgar, having lost quite a bit of his help, fled to Scotland, where King Malcolm III was hitched to Edgar's sister Margaret. Waltheof, who had joined the revolt, submitted, alongside Gospatric, and both were permitted to hold their properties. Be that as it may, William was not completed; he walked over the Pennines amid the winter and crushed the rest of the dissidents at Shrewsbury before structure mansions at Chester and Stafford. This crusade, which incorporated the consuming and devastation of part of the wide open that the illustrious powers walked through, is normally known as the "Harrying of the North"; it was over by April 1070, when William wore his crown ritualistically for Easter at Winchester.
