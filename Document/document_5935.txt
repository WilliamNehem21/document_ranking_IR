When all is said in done, the universe of these early volumes is a "[dark] and ... isolated spot." In these early titles, the young men are pessimistic about human instinct, a frame of mind evidently legitimized when the police, whom they have over and over helped, toss them into prison on thin proof in "The Great Airport Mystery" (1930). The police and expert figures by and large fallen off inadequately in these books, to such an extent that at one point Edward Stratemeyer composed McFarlane to criticize him for "deplorable absence of regard for officers of the law." The Hardys are less well-off than prior Stratemeyer characters; they enthusiastically acknowledge money compensates to a great extent to back school instructions, and, with their folks, endeavor to satisfy their Aunt Gertrude, in light of the fact that she has a little fortune. The rich are depicted as eager and narrow minded. This perspective on the world mirrors McFarlane's relative "need [of] compassion for the American power structure." In his life account, McFarlane portrayed his justification for composing the books along these lines, expressing: "I had my very own considerations about instructing adolescents that dutifulness to power is some way or another hallowed... Would human advancement disintegrate if kids got the idea that the general population who ran the world were once in a while idiotic, every so often wrong and even degenerate on occasion?"
