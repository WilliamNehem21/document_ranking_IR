In the late 1940s, the state government directed a practicality think about for a second coasting extension crosswise over Lake Washington, because of expanded traffic on the scaffold. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature endorsed the development of a second coasting scaffold, utilizing past and future tolls to finance its development. The west end of the gliding span was to interface with the EverettÃ¢ÂÂ Seattle tollway (later I-5) at Roanoke Street, south of the arranged Ship Canal Bridge, just as the proposed Empire Way Expressway (later the R.H. Thompson Expressway) at Montlake. The east end was to interface with the arranged northÃ¢ÂÂ south expressway sidestep of the Seattle zone (later I-405), with a discretionary association with the Stevens Pass Highway. Two arrangements for the skimming span were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand PointÃ¢ÂÂ Kirkland, supported by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, supported by the state government and the U.S. Naval force, which worked Naval Air Station Sand Point. The state government at first picked the MontlakeÃ¢ÂÂ Evergreen Point arrangement in 1954, aiming to start development in 1955, however the arrangement debate deferred a ultimate conclusion until December 1956. Native gatherings from the Montlake territory challenged the choice, yet were to a great extent disregarded by the task's native advisory group.
