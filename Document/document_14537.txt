Hawley started her examinations with Hewett in 1929, concentrating essentially on dendrochronology and earthenware dating. She burned through two summers exhuming Chetro Ketl's deny hill, and showed that charcoal found in it could be utilized for tree-ring dating. Her 1933 doctoral thesis demonstrated that the hill's layers speak to a turn around stratigraphy. Material from more established deny hills was regularly moved and put over contemporary flotsam and jetsam. It was then secured by layers of every day squander before still progressively more seasoned trash was heaped on top. This brought about more current material collecting at the base of the heap, and more established material accumulating close to the top. Resulting unearthings showed that the hill was likely made by more than average family squander; various layers of it are made out of decline from substantial scale eats that incorporated the formal crushing of ceramics. Hawley worked at the site through 1933, and as Fagan would like to think her examination dating of stone work dividers and potsherds fundamentally upgraded the investigation of Chacoan culture. He acknowledges her for helping the foundation of a standout amongst archaic exploration's most precise orders. In 1983, as the main enduring individual from Hewett's 1929Ã¢ÂÂ 33 gathering of scientists, Hawley noticed the troubles of uncovering Chaco Canyon amid the Great Depression: "The youthful archeologists and dendrochronologists of today, attempting to remake Chetro Ketl from the notes, maps, and too insufficient productions and inadequate accumulations of the past, know little of the exigencies which have made their assignment troublesome."
