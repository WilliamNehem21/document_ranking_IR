In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, "The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. Following the praise for "Cleopatra", Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings, most notably "A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)" in 1822, and the controversial "Pandora Crowned by the Seasons" in 1824. Etty had travelled extensively in Italy in 1823, and painted "Pandora" hastily on his return as a "testimonial of recent progress" he had made while studying paintings in Italian collections. Critical opinion of "Pandora" was highly divided, with some critics greatly praising it as a technical accomplishment, while others saw it as a rushed pastiche of Titian and Rubens. "Pandora Crowned by the Seasons" sold for 300Â guineas (about Â£ in 2019 terms), and secured Etty the position of Associate at the Royal Academy of Arts.
While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.
