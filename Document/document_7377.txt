Presently expanded by fortifications from the UK, the Mediterranean Fleet separated "Renowned", four cruisers, and four destroyers to a point south-east of Taranto. The primary flood of twelve flying machine, all that the ship could dispatch at one time, took off by 20:40 and the second rush of nine by 21:34. Six airplane in each airstrike were equipped with torpedoes and the rest of bombs or flares or both to enhance the three-quarter moon. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had situated a Short Sunderland flying pontoon off the harbor to look for any development to or from the port and this was recognized at 17:55 by acoustic locators and again at 20:40, cautioning the protectors. The commotion of the on-starting things out airstrike was heard at 22:25 and the counter flying machine weapons guarding the port opened shoot without further ado a short time later, as did those on the boats in the harbor. The torpedo-conveying air ship of the main wave scored one hit on the ship and two on the as of late finished ship while the two flare droppers shelled the oil stockpiling warehouse with little impact. The four airplane stacked with bombs set one storage in the seaplane base ablaze and hit the destroyer with one bomb that neglected to explode. The destroyer , or "Conte di Cavour", shot down the air ship that put a torpedo into the last ship, however the rest of the flying machine came back to "Distinguished".
