With Task Force 61, "Cushing" took part in the bitterly contested Battle of Santa Cruz in October 1942. Outnumbered, the force stalled the Japanese from their advance toward Guadalcanal. At the Battle of Guadalcanal, "Cushing" was perhaps the first US ship to strike the enemy on that November day in 1942. In the fighting that followed, she sustained several hits amidships and slowly began to lose power, but was able to fire six torpedoes by local control at the . In his book, "Destroyer Operations in World War II" (1953), Theodore Roscoe said, â Three of the âfishâ seemed to hit the bulls-eye; if they did, it was with tack-hammer thumps. They may have exploded prematurely. But "Hiei"s lookouts must have seen them coming, for the big ship swung her bow to the left and lumbered westward, disappearing into the smoke-haze.â
By this time, "Cushing" was dead in the water, an easy target for repeated enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up. "Cushing" received three battle stars for her World War II service.
