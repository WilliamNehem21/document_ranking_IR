On January 30, 1925, Kvale went to a gathering of the Coinage Committee, at which the suggestion that would turn into the Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar was considered. Treasury authorities were available in restriction, recommending an award be issued rather, and Kvale made a few inquiries about the Mint's issuance of decorations. On February 3, Kvale and his child Paul met with Treasury authorities, bringing a draft bill approving the Bureau of the Mint to strike memorial awards for the "Restauration" commemoration. Acting Mint Director Mary M. O'Reilly and Treasury Undersecretary Garrard Winston were questionable about striking silver decorations that would be between the quarter and half dollar in size. To balance this worry, Paul Kvale recommended making the decoration octagonal or hexagonal. O'Reilly and Winston favored the thought, and after Congressman Kvale met with legitimate guidance to the Treasury and different authorities, he was guaranteed of the office's full help. Kvale additionally effectively campaigned the Post Office Department for the issuance of memorial stamps; he revealed to Third Assistant Postmaster General Warren I. Glover that, in a more extensive sense, the decoration perceived the North American investigations of the Vikings around the year 1000. Kvale proclaimed that in looking for the keepsake decoration and stamps, he was adding to the "development of the Norwegian legacy by having it 'safeguarded in metal' just as 'paper time cases'."
