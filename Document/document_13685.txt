In 2010, Moore told "Wired" that DC offered him the rights to "Gatekeepers" back in the event that he would consent to prequel and continuation ventures. Moore said that "on the off chance that they said that 10 years prior, when I approached them for that, at that point no doubt it may have worked [...] But nowadays I don't need "Guardians" back. Unquestionably, I don't need it back under those sorts of terms." DC Comics co-distributers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee reacted: "DC Comics would possibly return to these notorious characters if the imaginative vision of any proposed new stories coordinated the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons almost 25 years prior, and our first discourse on any of this would normally be with the makers themselves." Following a very long time of gossipy tidbits about a potential "Guards" follow-up task, in February 2012 DC reported it was distributing seven prequel arrangement under the "Before Watchmen" pennant. Among the makers included are journalists J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and craftsmen Lee Bermejo, J. G. Jones, Adam Hughes, Andy Kubert, Joe Kubert, and Amanda Conner. Despite the fact that Moore has no association, Gibbons gave the venture his approval.
