Practices started at Broadway's Belasco Theater on February 2, 1949. There was no formal ensemble; every one of the attendants and Seabees was given a name, and, on account of the men, $50 to furnish themselves with what garments they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. Wear Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to buy a non-guideline baseball top and dark lower leg boots. Martin and Pinza had not known one another, however they before long shaped a solid fellowship. Of the inclination behind the stage, "everybody concurred: all through the practices Logan was searing, requesting, and splendidly innovative." He executed lap changes (spearheaded by Rodgers and Hammerstein in "Allegro"), whereby the performing artists going ahead next would as of now be on an obscured piece of the phase as one scene closed. This enabled the melodic to proceed without interference by scene changes, making the activity practically consistent. He before long had the Seabees pacing forward and backward like confined creatures amid "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", an arranging so viable it was never showed signs of change amid the keep running of the show. One Logan advancement that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly acknowledged was to have Cable take off his shirt amid the power outage after he and Liat energetically grasp on first gathering, his incomplete exposure symbolizing their lovemaking. As initially arranged, Martin should close "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" with a rich cartwheel over the stage. This was wiped out after she vaulted into the symphony pit, thumping out Rittman.
