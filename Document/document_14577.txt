"Blossom" was created as an otherworldly successor to "Stream", a 2006 Flash diversion made by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were understudies at the University of Southern California. "Stream" was later formed into a PlayStation 3 diversion by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable amusement by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. "Blossom" was Thatgamecompany's "first amusement outside the security net of the scholarly community". It was first declared at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was discharged on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. "Blossom" was proposed essentially to incite positive feelings in the player, and to go about as "an enthusiastic sanctuary". Six to nine individuals were included at different phases of improvement. Chen, who helped to establish Thatgamecompany with diversion maker Kellee Santiago, was the imaginative chief accountable for the amusement, while Clark was the lead architect. Chen depicted the diversion as "an intelligent sonnet investigating the strain among urban and nature". He settled on the "nature" topic from the get-go in the advancement procedure, saying that he "had this idea that each PlayStation resembles an entryway in your family room, it drives you to elsewhere. I thought; wouldn't it be decent in the event that it was a gateway that would enable you to be grasped ordinarily".
