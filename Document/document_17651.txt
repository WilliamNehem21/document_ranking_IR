The following day, after much delay, Gambier ordered a battle squadron to reinforce Cochrane in the Basque Roads. The British ships anchored, with springs, in a crescent around some of the stranded French ships, and exchanged fire. "Emerald" took up position ahead of "Indefatigable" and behind "Aigle" and "Unicorn", and directed her fire mainly towards the French ships of the line, "Varsovie" and "Aquilon", both of which struck at around 17:30. 
At 20:00, "Emerald", along with the other British frigates and brigs, weighed and anchored with the 74-gun in the Maumusson passage to the south of OlÃ©ron while a second fireship attack was under preparation. Although the fireships were ready in the early hours on the 13th, contrary winds prevented their deployment. The British instead set "Varsovie" and "Aquilon" alight just after 03:00, on the orders of Captain John Bligh, after removing their crews. "Emerald", and the other vessels moored with her, were recalled at 05:00 but owing to the lack of water, only the brigs were able to pass further up the river. "Emerald" therefore took no further part in the attack, which continued until 29 April when the last French ship was able to free herself from the mud and escape up the river to Rochefort.
