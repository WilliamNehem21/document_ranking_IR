The dedication was made at Nine Elms Stone Masonry Works in Battersea, south London. It was uncovered by the regiment's privileged colonel, Edward, Prince of Wales (wearing the uniform of Welsh Guards colonel) and committed by the Reverend E. H. Beattie, the first Battalion's minister, at a service on 27 January 1924. Music was given by the regimental band and the choir from the close-by St Clement Danes church. The Last Post and the Reveille were sounded and the group sung the national song of devotion, God Save the King. Among others present was the Suffragan Bishop of Willesden, William Perrin, just as a few senior armed force officers, previous individuals from the regiment, their families, and relatives of expired individuals. When of the function, post-war redesigns had diminished the Civil Service Rifles in size to two organizations and amalgamated it with the Queen's Westminster Rifles to frame the sixteenth Battalion, the London Regiment (Queen's Westminster and Civil Service Rifles), however veterans were resolved to keep up the conventions of the old regiment. Individuals from the Civil Service organizations of the successor regiment framed a gatekeeper of respect amid the function. Preceding the commemoration's uncovering, HM Treasury approved the Office of Works to assume liability for its support.
