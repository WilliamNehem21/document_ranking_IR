Fontaneda clarified in his 1571 journal that Carlos controlled fifty towns situated on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee (which they called "Mayaimi") and on the Florida Keys (which they called "Martires"). Littler clans of Ais and Jaega who lived toward the east of Lake Okeechobee, paid customary tributes to Carlos. The Spanish associated the Calusa with gathering treasures from wrecks and dispersing the gold and silver between the Ais and Jaega, with Carlos accepting the lion's share. The primary town of the Calusa, and home of Carlos, circumscribed Estero Bay at present-day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda portrayed human penance as a typical practice: when the offspring of a "cacique" passed on, every inhabitant surrendered a tyke to be yielded, and when the "cacique" kicked the bucket, his hirelings were relinquished to go along with him. Every year a Christian was required to be yielded to conciliate a Calusa symbol. The structure of shell hills of changing sizes and shapes was additionally of profound hugeness to the Calusa. In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing unearthed a huge shell hill on Key Marco that was made out of a few developed patios many yards long. Cushing uncovered over a thousand Calusa antiques. Among them he discovered apparatuses made of bone and shell, earthenware, human bones, covers, and creature carvings made of wood.
