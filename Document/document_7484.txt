In the fall of 1914, Sledd surrendered the administration of Southern University and came back to Emory College, by then renamed Emory University and moved to its new fundamental grounds in upper east Atlanta, as the primary Professor of Greek and New Testament Literature at the Candler School of Theology, the recently settled theological college of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Sledd turned out to be outstanding as an educator of Greek, Latin and New Testament learns at Candler, and was the writer of a few insightful books on New Testament subjects, including "Holy person Mark's Life of Jesus" (1927), "The Bibles of the Churches" (1930) and "His Witnesses: A Study of the Book of Acts" (1935). He was chosen to be an individual from the American Standard Bible Committee, which was setting up an amendment of the American Standard Version of the Bible. He kept on upholding inner Methodist change and a conclusion to racial savagery, and his showing roused an age of his Candler religious philosophy understudies to go about as change specialists inside the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. A considerable lot of his previous understudies wound up Methodist priests who came back to their assemblies and yearly gatherings to work for better treatment of African-Americans, helping the Southern Methodist church to develop from a backbone of philosophical and racial uncompromising nature to a specialist for social change and doctrinal change.
