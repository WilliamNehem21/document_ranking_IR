In 2012, "Moving Stone" called her "the most capable youthful on-screen character in America." Her "Craving Games" co-star Donald Sutherland has positively contrasted her art with that of Laurence Olivier and thinks of her as an "impeccable and splendid performer". David O. Russell (who guided her in "Silver Linings Playbook", "American Hustle" and "Happiness") has applauded her easy acting that makes her exhibitions look simple. Amid her vocation, Lawrence has assumed jobs in both prominent, standard creations and low-spending free movies, and has showed up in a scope of film kinds. She didn't examine acting and has not been associated with expert theater. She rather puts together her acting methodology with respect to her perceptions of individuals around her. The performer told "The Globe and Mail" in June 2010 that she doesn't "contribute any of my genuine feelings" or bring home any agonies of her characters. Lawrence proceeded to state that "I don't take it to make benefits" and has never shared their encounters, depending rather on her creative ability, taking note of "I can't circumvent searching for jobs that are actually similar to my life." She expressed that "On the off chance that it at any point came down to the point where, to improve a section, I needed to lose a smidgen of my mental soundness, I wouldn't do it. I would simply do comedies."
