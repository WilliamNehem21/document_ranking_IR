The play was barely talked about at all amid the eighteenth century, and the nineteenth century generally pursued a similar pattern. A part on the play is incorporated into Frederick Lawrence's "Life of Fielding" (1855), and it is referenced by Leslie Stephen and Austin Dobson, who center around what the play says about Grub Street and Fielding. Most later faultfinders concur with Dobson's judgment that the play principally gives an editorial on occasions throughout Fielding's life, and imprints his progress from more established types of parody to the new parody of his counterparts. Charles Woods, writing in 1966, contends that "The Author's Farce" was a necessary piece of Fielding's profession, and rejects a political perusing of the work. A few years sooner, in 1918, Wilbur Lucius Cross had held that the play uncovered Fielding's ability for composing shams and vaudevilles. Writing in 1993, Martin and Ruthe Battestin keep up that the play "was [Fielding's] first investigation in the sporadic comic modesÃÂ ... where his actual virtuoso as a dramatist finally discovered degree". They further attest that Fielding was the first to offer groups of onlookers "a sort of pointed, innovative shenanigans", and that his ability for "scorn and energetic discourse" and for conceiving "ludicrous yet expressionistic plots" was unmatched even in twentieth century theater. Prior, Frederick Homes Dudden, had depicted the manikin appear in the third go about as "a very unique parody on the showy and semi dramatic beguilements of the day." F. W. Bateson incorporated the play in his 1963 rundown of "ironical spectacles".
