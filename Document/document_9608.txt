Beecham had kicked the bucket in 1961, and Fenby composes that it "appeared to numerous then that nothing could spare Delius' music from termination", such was the conductor's one of a kind authority over the music. In any case, different conductors have kept on pushing Delius, and since the centennial year, the Delius Society has sought after the point of "develop[ing] a more noteworthy information of the life and works of Delius". The music has never turned out to be chic, a reality regularly recognized by advertisers and commentators. To recommendations that Delius' music is a "gained taste", Fenby answers: "The music of Delius isn't a procured taste. One either loves it the minute one initially hears it, or its sound is once and for ever tacky to one. It is a craftsmanship which will never appreciate an intrigue to the many, yet one which will dependably be cherished, and beyond all doubt adored, by the few." Writing in 2004 on the 70th commemoration of Delius' passing, the "Watchman" columnist Martin Kettle reviews Cardus contending in 1934 that Delius as an arranger was one of a kind, both in his strategy and in his emotionalism. In spite of the fact that he shunned established formalism, it wasn't right, Cardus accepted, to view Delius only as "a tone-painter, an impressionist or a producer of program music". His music's withstanding highlight is, Cardus composed, that it "recalls feeling in tranquillityÃÂ ... Delius is continually advising us that magnificence is conceived by thought after the occasion".
