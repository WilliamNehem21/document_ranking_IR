On March 1, 1776, the Continental Congress casted a ballot to give Moore a commission as a brigadier general in the Continental Army, and put him in order of the majority of the normal armed force powers in North Carolina. Moore was one of just five North Carolinians to accomplish the position of brigadier general or higher in the Continental Army. As a brigadier, he served under General Charles Lee, officer of the military's Southern Department, and was entrusted with guarding Wilmington from assaults by British boats prowling in the Cape Fear territory after the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge. In that limit, Moore on the other hand irritated and watched the British and their Loyalist assistants while at the same time improving Wilmington's resistances by raising two new waterfront batteries, and by sinking ships in the fundamental channel of the Cape Fear River south of the city to bar section by bigger vessels. In April and May 1776, some British units from the roughly 7,000-in number power of General Henry Clinton landed close Wilmington, and took steps to defy Moore's battalion of 1,847 men. Clinton before long chosen that North Carolina was not a perfect goal, and most of the British armada and armed force advanced south to Charleston on May 30, 1776.
