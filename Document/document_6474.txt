On 1 May, Anthony Eden, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, sent the Australian Government a link recommending that both caravans be occupied to the UK. Eden legitimized his proposition on the grounds of the nuisance of sending escorts past Italian maritime bases in the Red Sea because of the danger of assault, and its likelihood getting to be hard to send supplies from the UK to prepare units in the Middle East. Accordingly, the Australian Government coordinated that Convoy US 2 be held at Colombo and US 3 at Fremantle until it got exhortation on the war circumstance from the British and Australian Chiefs of Staff. The legislature had a solid inclination for the AIF to be gathered in a solitary area, so it could battle under Australian direction. The Australian Chiefs of Staff at first upheld the proposition to send both guards to the UK in light of the fact that it would result in the detachments being conveyed to the principle battlefield, would facilitate the issues related with preparing these units and would support volunteers for another AIF division which was being framed at the time. In any case, on 4 May the British Chiefs of Staff prescribed that both guards continue to the Middle East. The Australian Chiefs of Staff along these lines supported this position. Accordingly, on 8 May the Australian Government coordinated the guards to proceed to the Middle East. Guard US 2 touched base in Egypt on 18 May.
