Each activity requires a particular number of spaces on the ATB bar, which consistently refills to a set most extreme number of openings. The ATB bar progressively increments in size all through the amusement from two openings to six. The player may choose not exactly the most extreme number of conceivable activities, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and execute the greatest number of activities as should be possible with the current ATB sum.

Activities can't be performed outside of fight, and the characters' wellbeing is completely reestablished after each fight.
