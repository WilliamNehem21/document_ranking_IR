In 1984, Steiger featured as an investigator allocated to explore the homicide of a Chicago psychoanalyst (Roger Moore), a man whom he despises from a past case, in Bryan Forbes' "The Naked Face". Richard Christiansen of the "Chicago Tribune" alluded to it as a "weak tension motion picture shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [that] doesn't do much useful for the city or for anybody associated with it", and considered Steiger to be "acting in his high panic gear", who "growls and whimpers and exaggerates". Steiger enjoyed a reprieve from film in the mid-1980s, amid which he showed up in the Yorkshire Television little arrangement "The Glory Boys" (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and "Hollywood Wives" (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads amid the creation of "The Glory Boys". Perkins despised the way that Steiger demanded a greater trailer and felt that Steiger was attempting to take scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins "so unsteady and cursed by the synthetic compounds he was taking" that he felt frustrated about him and trusted that he was imperiling the achievement of the film. Steiger likewise performed on Joni Mitchell's 1985 collection "Vicious", where he gave the voice of an evangelist in the tune "Tax Exempt".
