Khan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential people in India. He has regularly featured among the top ten on "The Times of India"s list of the 50 most desirable men in India, and in a 2007 poll by the magazine "Eastern Eye" he was named the sexiest man in Asia. Khan is often referred to as "Brand SRK" by media organisations because of his many brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. He is one of the highest paid Bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television advertisement market. Khan has endorsed brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer. Books have been published about him, and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary "The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan" (2005), and the Discovery Travel & Living channel's ten-part miniseries "Living with a SuperstarShah Rukh Khan" (2010). In 2007, Khan became the third Indian actor to have his wax statue installed at London's Madame Tussauds museum, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan. Additional versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds' museums in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and Washington.
