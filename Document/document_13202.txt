Prior to spring preparing in 1950, the Yankees had spearheaded the possibility of an instructional school for new kids on the block and other youthful players. This was the brainchild of Stengel and Weiss. Objections from different groups that the Yankees were disregarding time confines on spring preparing and were utilizing their cash for upper hand prompted alterations, however the idea endure and was inevitably comprehensively received. Among those welcome to the 1951 early camp was 19-year-old Mickey Mantle, whose speed and ability awed Stengel, and who had spent the earlier year in the small time. Stengel moved Mantle from shortstop to the outfield, thinking that Rizzuto, the shortstop, was probably going to play a few additional years. Both Mantle and the Yankees began the 1951 season gradually, and on July 14, Mantle was sent to Kansas City to recover his certainty at the plate. He was before long reviewed to the Yankees; in spite of the fact that he hit .267 for the season, this was four points superior to DiMaggio, in his last season. A great part of the weight of winning a third back to back flag fell on Berra, who set up together a MVP season. The White Sox and afterward the Indians drove the class for a significant part of the mid year, yet the Yankees, never a long ways behind, set up together a torrid last month of the period to win the flag by five recreations.
