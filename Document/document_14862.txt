In 218 SE (95/94 BC), Antiochus X, the child of Antiochus IX, broadcasted himself lord in Arados, and wedded Cleopatra Selene. The Seleucid line had a point of reference of a child wedding his stepmother: Antiochus I had hitched his stepmother Stratonice, and this may have made it simpler for Cleopatra Selene. However, the marriage was shameful. Appian composed an account concerning the appellation of Antiochus X, ""Eusebes"" ("the devout"): the Syrians offered it to him to deride his show of reliability to his dad by bedding his widow. The method of reasoning for the marriage may have been sober minded: Antiochus X looked to be best, however had little assets and required a ruler. Cleopatra Selene was in her forties and couldn't just wed an outside ruler. Antiochus X drove Seleucus VI out of Antioch in 94 BC and ruled northern Syria and Cilicia, while Seleucus VI's siblings Philip I and Demetrius III ruled Beroea and Damascus separately. The last proof for the rule of Antiochus X is dated to 92 BC; he is commonly expected to have kicked the bucket at around this date. In any case, antiquated sources contain opposing records and dates, and the numismatist Oliver D. Hoover proposed the date of 224 SE (89/88 BC) for Antiochus X's end. Antioch was taken by Demetrius III then Philip I.
