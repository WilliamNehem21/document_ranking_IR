Malley was reviewed to Australia in July 1940, withdrawing China with a note of thanks from May-Ling for his "steadfast administration" before rejoining the RAAF on dynamic administration as a squadron chief in October. He turned into the Air Force delegate at the Combined Operational Intelligence Center (COIC), Melbourne, a tri-administration association in charge of insight accumulation, investigation and spread. Drawing on his insight into Japanese assaults on Chinese landing strips during the 1930s, Malley visited a few RAAF stations in northern Australia to exhort on defensive measures; it ended up apparent in the wake of the assault on Darwin in February 1942 that none of his suggestions had been executed. COIC essentially dealt with maritime knowledge, so Army and Air Force support was low maintenance at first. By April 1941, Malley had been appointed a full-time job, and the RAAF was keeping up a nonstop nearness. He was elevated to privileged wing leader in October 1941, and after two months succeeded Commander Rupert Long as Director of COIC. Malley was raised to acting gathering commander on 1ÃÂ July 1942, however sick wellbeing constrained him to give up his post on 3ÃÂ October. He was released from the Air Force as restoratively unfit on 9ÃÂ June 1943. General Douglas MacArthur commended Malley for his "premonition, arranging, and hierarchical capacity". The previous pilot proceeded to fill in as officer responsible for the Chinese area at the Commonwealth Security Service in Canberra from January 1944 to March 1947 as a privileged gathering chief.
