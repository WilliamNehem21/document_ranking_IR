After lunch, Australia scored gradually as Loxton battled. Yardley took the new ball trying to inconvenience the batsmen with livelier bowling, yet rather, Loxton started to settle in. He hurled Pollard to the leg side, nearly for six, and after that hit three limits off another over. Harvey quickened also, and 80 minutes into the center session, achieved his century to an uproarious gathering as Australia passed 250. Harvey's thump had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours. Loxton then commanded the scoring and raised his 50 with a six. The association yielded 105 in just 95 minutes. Harvey was in the end out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted clear. His shot determination provoked Bradman to toss his head back in disillusionment. All things considered, it was an innings noted for incredible driving on the two sides of the wicket and the high rate of scoring swung the match once more from England's firm control. Harvey fell at 5/294, and Australia drooped to 8/355 preceding a counterattack by Ray Lindwall saw them to 458, confining England's lead to 38. O'Reilly said that Harvey's innings was one of "no hindrances" and that it was "totally pristine by any biased arrangement to dispense with a specific shot". He included that it was "the very reflection of truth in the batting craftsmanship", "magnificently unencumbered by the scourage of solid counsel or some other debilitating impact", and that Harvey's innings was the most satisfying he had seen since Stan McCabe's 232 at Trent Bridge in 1938.
