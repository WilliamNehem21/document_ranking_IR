The New Orleans Mint worked persistently from 1838 until January 26, 1861, when Louisiana withdrew from the United States. On January 29, the Secession Convention reconvened at New Orleans (it had prior met in Baton Rouge) and passed a statute that enabled Federal representatives to stay in their posts, yet as workers of the province of Louisiana. On February 5, 1861, amid the procedures of the Convention of the State of Louisiana in New Orleans, the advisory group delegated by the Convention to take a stock on February 1, 1861, of open property in the hands of the officers of 'the late' Federal government detailed that the Sub-Treasurer's vault at the mint contained $483,983 in gold and silver coins. The National Archives records in Rockville, Maryland, demonstrate the $483,983 comprised of $308,771 in gold coins and $175,212.08 in silver coins. The main gold coin created in January, 1861 was the $20 gold twofold falcon. This implies 15,438 $20 gold coins were printed by the New Orleans Mint amid January, 1861. Mint coinage records for the $20 1861-O gold twofold bird show just 5,000 $20 gold pieces were stamped by the Federal Government in January, 1861. This disparity is clarified in a Numismatist Journal article.
