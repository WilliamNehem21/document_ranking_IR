After the war finished in 1865, McKinley settled on a profession in the law and started concentrating in the workplace of a lawyer in Poland, Ohio. The next year, he proceeded with his examinations by going to Albany Law School in New York. In the wake of contemplating there for not exactly a year, McKinley returned home and was admitted to the bar in Warren, Ohio, in March 1867. That equivalent year, he moved to Canton, the region seat of Stark County, and set up a little office. He before long shaped an organization with George W. Belden, an accomplished legal advisor and previous judge. His training was sufficiently fruitful for him to purchase a square of structures on Main Street in Canton, which gave him a little yet predictable rental pay for a considerable length of time to come. At the point when his Army companion Rutherford B. Hayes was designated for representative in 1867, McKinley made discourses for his benefit in Stark County, his first attack into legislative issues. The district was firmly separated among Democrats and Republicans, however Hayes conveyed it that year in his statewide triumph. In 1869, McKinley kept running for the workplace of arraigning lawyer of Stark County, an office generally then held by Democrats, and was surprisingly chosen. At the point when McKinley kept running for re-appointment in 1871, the Democrats assigned William A. Lynch, an unmistakable neighborhood legal counselor, and McKinley was vanquished by 143 votes.
