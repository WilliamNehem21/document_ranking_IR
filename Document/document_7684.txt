"P. lujiatunensis", named in 2006 by Chinese scientist Zhou Chang-Fu and three Chinese partners, is one of the most established known species, in view of four skulls from the lower beds of Yixian Formation, close to the town of Lujiatun. While this bed has been dated contrastingly by various creators, from 128ÃÂ Ma in the Barremian arrange, to 125ÃÂ Ma in the most punctual Aptian, changed dating strategies have appeared at be around 123 million years of age. "P. lujiatunensis" was contemporaneous with another psittacosaurid species, "Hongshanosaurus houi", which was found in similar beds. It is conceivably synonymous with "H. houi"; Sereno (2010), who recommended that "Hongshanosaurus" is an equivalent word of "Psittacosaurus", picked to leave "P. lujiatunensis" and "H. houi" separate species because of the deficiencies of the last's sort example. One about total skeleton of "P. lujiatunensis" from a similar lower beds of the Yixian Formation had recently been characterized in its own species, "Psittacosaurus major", named for the substantial size of its skull by Sereno, Zhao and two partners in 2007. You and associates depicted an extra example and agreed that it was particular from "P. lujiatunensis". "P. major" was initially portrayed by a proportionately huge skull, which was 39% of the length of its middle, contrasted with 30% in "P. mongoliensis", and different highlights. In any case, a recent report using morphometric investigation demonstrated that the alleged contrasts between "P. lujiatunensis" and "P. major" were because of contrasts in protection and pounding. The examination inferred that both spoke to a solitary animal categories.
