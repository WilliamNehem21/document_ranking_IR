In 1999, the Mint struck various Sacagawea dollars in .9167 fine (22-karat) gold. Amid the underlying creation of the coins, they were designated at five dollars so as to enable the general population to recognize them from their circling partners. The arrangement was to pitch gold renditions of the mint pieces to authorities. On March 20, this arrangement was ended when some Congressmen scrutinized the expert of Mint authorities to strike the coins in a structure unique in relation to what had just been approved. Full-scale coin generation never occurred despite the fact that the Mint kept up that it had expert to do as such, as the coins would be considered numismatic things and not customary issue coins. Comparative gold coins were additionally struck, this time bearing the division of one dollar and a "W" mint imprint, implying that the coins were struck at the West Point Mint. Altogether, 39 such coins were struck, twelve of which were observed to be of satisfactory quality, while the rest were in the end wrecked. Not at all like those named at five dollars, the one dollar pieces were "struck to celebrate the noteworthy trip of the Space Shuttle "Columbia" in July 1999", as indicated by Former Mint Director Ed Moy. The twelve enduring gold dollars were sent into space on board "Columbia" on mission STS-93 in July 1999. Following the arrival of the van, the coins were put away at Fort Knox, where they stayed until 2007, when they were shown at the American Numismatic Association World's Fair of Money in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the occasion, the coins were come back to Fort Knox; be that as it may, the Mint is as of now wanting to credit the coins to different exhibition halls all through the nation.
