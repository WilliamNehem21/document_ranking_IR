In June 1964 the Natural Resources Council asked Stephen H. Spurr, senior member of the Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an expert on ranger service and backwoods nature, to frame a gathering to assess the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report verified that the situations offered as avocation for the task were excessively hopeful regarding Alaska's anticipated long haul populace development, its per capita utilization of power, and the anticipated rate of passage of electroprocess enterprises like the aluminum business (which had considerable power necessities) into Alaska. Besides, the proposed dam would have extraordinarily diminished the catch of five types of Pacific salmon, particularly the chinook (ruler), mate (puppy) and coho (silver) salmon. It would likewise take out immense quantities of transient waterfowl, including an expected 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that moved every year from the Yukon pads. There would likewise have been a sharp decrease in both extensive warm blooded creatures - the moose, dark and mountain bear, and caribou - and littler well evolved creatures: muskrats, mink, beavers, and stream otters in oceanic environments, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe rabbits, red fox and red squirrels in earthbound or upland natural surroundings. Spurr's report noted: "[It]is a clichÃÂ© of untamed life nature that uprooting of a populace from the zone where it regularly lives is equivalent to disposing of it totally. Abutting environments normally are conveying all the natural life that the nearby assets will bolster. To put it plainly, loss of environment is synonymous with loss of the creature populace bolstered by the immersed natural surroundings."
