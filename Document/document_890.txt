On the morning of 21 April, "Australia" and her sister ships cruised again for the Skagerrak, this opportunity to help endeavors to upset the vehicle of Swedish metal to Germany. The arranged destroyer compass of the Kattegat was dropped when word came that the High Seas Fleet was activating for their very own task (later figured out how to be coordinated to agree with the Irish Easter Rising), and the British boats were requested to a meeting point amidst the North Sea, while the remainder of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. On the evening of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was watching toward the north-west of Horn Reefs when overwhelming mist descended. The boats were crisscrossing to stay away from submarine assault, which, joined with the climate conditions, caused "Australia" to crash into sister transport twice in three minutes. Procedural mistakes were observed to be the reason for the crashes, which saw "Australia" (the more intensely harmed of the two boats) docked for about a month and a half of fixes among April and June 1916. Beginning examinations of the harm were made in a drifting dock on the River Tyne, yet the idea of the harm required a preoccupation to Devonport, Devon for the real fix work. The fixes were finished more rapidly than anticipated, and "Australia" rejoined the second BCS Squadron at Rosyth on 9 June, having missed the Battle of Jutland.
