In May 1908, the armada went on a noteworthy journey into the Atlantic rather than its ordinary voyage in the North Sea. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" ceased in Horta in the Azores. The armada came back to Kiel on 13 August to get ready for the harvest time moves, which kept going from 27 August to 7 September. Division practices in the Baltic quickly pursued from 7 to 13 September. At the finish of these moves, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was removed from administration. In 1909Ã¢ÂÂ 1910, she experienced a noteworthy reproduction in Wilhelmshaven. The superstructure amidships was chopped down to decrease top-greatness, new round channels were introduced, and the conning tower was extended. The battling tops from the poles were expelled, and the optional battery was altogether modified. Four of the 15ÃÂ cm firearms were expelled and two 8.8ÃÂ cm weapons were included; the majority of the 8.8ÃÂ cm weapons were moved from the upper decks into casemates in the fundamental deck. On 14 October 1910, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was recommissioned for administration in the Baltic save division. She experienced short ocean preliminaries from 21 to 23 October before continuing to Kiel, where she was based with her four sister ships.
