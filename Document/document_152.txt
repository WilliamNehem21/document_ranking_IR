Despite the fact that Kagame's essential purpose behind the two wars in the Congo was Rwanda's security, he was claimed to increase financial advantage by misusing the mineral abundance of the eastern Congo. The 2001 United Nations "Report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo" asserted that Kagame, alongside Ugandan President Museveni, were "very nearly turning into the adoptive parents of the illicit misuse of regular assets and the continuation of the contention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo". The report likewise guaranteed that the Rwandan Ministry of Defense contained a "Congo Desk" committed to gathering charges from organizations authorized to mine minerals around Kisangani, and that considerable amounts of coltan and precious stones went through Kigali before being exchanged on the global market by staff on the Congo Desk. Worldwide NGO Global Witness likewise directed field considers in mid 2013. It presumed that minerals from North and South Kivu are sent out wrongfully to Rwanda and after that showcased as Rwandan. Kagame rejected these charges as unverified and politically roused; in a 2002 meeting with bulletin "Africa Confidential," Kagame said that if strong proof against Rwandan officers was displayed, it would be managed all around genuinely. In 2010, the United Nations discharged a report blaming the Rwandan armed force for perpetrating wide scale human rights infringement and violations against mankind in the Democratic Republic of the Congo amid the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.
