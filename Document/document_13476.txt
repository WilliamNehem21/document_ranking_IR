"The Man Trap" showed up in Gene Roddenberry's unique pitch for "Star Trek" as the title of a show with an alternate plot: the group face a few nebulous visions that are "wish-satisfaction traps which become as genuine as fragile living creature and blood"; the snares increment in nuance until the team battle to separate among ghost and reality. Lee Erwin, who had recently dealt with "The Lieutenant" with Roddenberry, was authorized to create a treatment; a blueprint highlighting a salt-eating up vampire was turned in on April 8, 1966. Then, George Clayton Johnson had been doled out a storyline, likely titled "Chicago II", in which the team of the "Undertaking" visit a planet where the way of life was that of 1920s crowd time Chicago. Johnson was procured after story proofreader John D. F. Dark prescribed him to the makers. Johnson chose to utilize the 1953 sci-fi novel "The Syndic" by Cyril M. Kornbluth as the reason for the story. Roddenberry felt that Johnson's treatment did not coordinate his vision for "Star Trek", yet did not have any desire to lose him altogether, and requested that he state "The Man Trap". Erwin was forked over the required funds for his variant, and given a different "murder charge" since it would not be utilized.
