In spite of the fact that the first Brabham BT20, the conclusive 1966 vehicle, had been accessible at Reims, Brabham proceeded with the BT19 and utilized it to win the following three title races. Ferrari, focused in every one of the three title races to that point, were absent for the British Grand Prix. The race was hung on the tight and winding Brands Hatch circuit, the track made elusive by oil spilling from different autos and by shower. Brabham set shaft and drove the whole race. At the following title round, the Dutch Grand Prix, Brabham announced the low speed Zandvoort circuit to be "much more slick and slippery than Brands." Brabham won the race after Jim Clark's less amazing 2ÃÂ litre Lotus 33-Climax, which had passed Brabham for the lead mid-race, was deferred by overheating issues. The German Grand Prix was held at the NÃÂ¼rburgring Nordschleife, which Brabham portrayed as "Brands Hatch on steroids". On the opening lap Brabham led the pack from Surtees, presently driving a Cooper-Maserati. Brabham won after a race-long battle with the Englishman in the downpour. With four successes and a greater number of completions than any of his title rivals, Brabham had a noteworthy lead in the drivers title and must be gotten in the title by Surtees or Stewart on the off chance that one of them won every one of the three of the rest of the races.
