The conditions encompassing the development to control in 1269 of the following ruler, Traidenis, are not clear. From the beginning his associations with GaliciaÃ¢ÂÂ Volhynia were tense and in the long run brought about the 1274Ã¢ÂÂ 1276 war. Traidenis was effective in fight, and his authority over Black Ruthenia was fortified. Traidenis, known for his solid enemy of German frame of mind, was likewise effective in battling with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the Battle of Karuse, battled on ice close Saaremaa. Be that as it may, in 1272 the Order countered, assaulting Semigalia and building DÃÂ¼naburg (Daugavpils) Castle in 1273 on grounds ostensibly constrained by Traidenis. Quite a while later, in 1281, Traidenis vanquished Jersika Castle in the present-day PreiÃÂ¼i District, and had the capacity to trade it for the DÃÂ¼naburg Castle. DÃÂ¼naburg remained a Lithuanian station until 1313. In 1279 the Order assaulted Lithuanian terrains, coming to the extent KernavÃÂ, yet on their way back they endured a noteworthy annihilation in the Battle of Aizkraukle. The Order's lord, Ernst von Rassburg, kicked the bucket in the fight, and the vanquished Semigallians revolted. The Semigallians were currently eager to recognize Lithuania's prevalence and approached Traidenis for help. Be that as it may, Traidenis kicked the bucket soon a short time later, and the insubordination was not effective.
