With an absolute grown-up length of anyplace from , the smooth toadfish has an extend body with an adjusted back and leveled tummy. The body limits posteriorly to the thin tail, and its blades are altogether extend and adjusted. The dorsal balance has 9 to 11ÃÂ rays. The pectoral blade has 15 to 18ÃÂ rays, the first is short. It emerges well underneath the dimension of the eye. The butt-centric blade has 7Ã¢ÂÂ 9ÃÂ rays and caudal balance has 11. The smooth toadfish has a little mouth with slender lips at its peak and a small jawline. The round eyes are adnate (unfit to pivot), their upper fringe is level with the profile of the back and the lower outskirt is well over the mouth. In a marginally discouraged region just before the eyes are two little areola molded structures (papillae) that are the nasal organs. The openings face to the back of the fish and are shut by folds appended to the dividers nearest to the fish's midline. The first pharyngobranchial gill curve is extended and tight with numerous minor teeth. The smooth toadfish has modest spines that are completely inside the skin layer; these keep running along its once again from the nasal organs nearly to the dorsal balance, and along its sides from the eye to the pectoral fine, and along its underparts from behind its mouth to its vent. The skin is smooth notwithstanding when the fish is completely expanded. It swallows water or air by means of a fold in its throat to swell itself up.
