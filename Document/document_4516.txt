Later perspectives present the topic of obligation as more nuanced and complex Ã¢ÂÂ proposing that Creutz can't be singled out as exclusively in charge of the debacle. Students of history Ingvar SjÃÂ¶blom and Lars Ericson Wolke have brought up that Creutz's situation as naval commander was equivalent to that of a central priest. He would have principally been a head without the requirement for personal information of useful subtleties; turning a ship in unpleasant climate would have been the obligation of his subordinates. SjÃÂ¶blom has focused on that the contradiction between Major AnkarfjÃÂ¤ll and Lieutenant Admiral BjÃÂ¶rnram on how much sail was required squandered valuable time in a circumstance where snappy choices were essential. Creutz was likewise one of a kind as a preeminent authority of the naval force since he had no understanding of military issues. The Swedish maritime officer corps in the late seventeenth century came up short on the distinction of armed force leaders, and prepared officers and even naval commanders could be outranked by unpracticed regular people or armed force authorities with almost no maritime foundation. Sea prehistorian Lars Einarsson has proposed that Creutz's "irritable and headstrong demeanor" most likely had an influence, however that it could similarly be accused on an untrained and unpracticed group and the open disunity among the officers. As indicated by SjÃÂ¶blom it is as yet hazy to students of history whether there was an assigned ship authority on "Kronan" with by and large duty.
