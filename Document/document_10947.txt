The selectors, following a six-hour meeting, picked the group to visit South Africa on 27 August 1968. The official records of the gathering are inadequate and of those present, nobody left a record of what occurred. Oborne trusts that somewhere around ten men were availableÃ¢ÂÂthe four selectors, Insole, Peter May, Don Kenyon and Alec Bedser; the England skipper Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and Donald Carr for the MCC; and perhaps Maurice Allom, another MCC part. Oborne proposes that one of those present may have been representing the South African government, as Vorster was all around educated about what occurred at the gathering and pursued occasions intently. He additionally sees that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what might occur if D'Oliveira were chosen; he contends that they may have passed the data on to different selectors. Shy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may likewise have made the South African position obvious at the gathering. As indicated by Oborne, "Everybody in the room, with the conceivable special case of the Worcestershire captain Don Kenyon, would have known that the choice of D'Oliveira could, best case scenario cause challenges and at the very least reason the visit to be dropped." Fraser-Sampson goes further, recommending that Insole, and perhaps at the same time May, knew the entire story from a beginning period.
