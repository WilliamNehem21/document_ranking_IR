In his investigation of the social and artistic heritage of Brussels, AndrÃÂ© De Vries commented that "Tintin in the Land of the Soviets" was "unrefined by HergÃÂ©'s later norms, in each feeling of the word". Simon Kuper of the "Money related Times" censured both "Place that is known for the Soviets" and "Tintin in the Congo" as the "most noticeably bad" of the "Experiences", being "inadequately drawn" and "to a great extent sans plot". Humanist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute contended that HergÃÂ© had no enthusiasm for giving authentic data about the Soviet Union, yet just needed to instill his perusers against Marxism, consequently portraying the Bolsheviks fixing races, murdering adversaries and taking the grain from the general population. As per artistic faultfinder Jean-Marie ApostolidÃÂ¨s of Stanford University, HergÃÂ© give the Bolsheviks a role as "total insidiousness" however was unfit to see how they had ascended to control, or what their political perspectives were. This implied Tintin did not know this either, in this way watching the Soviet "universe of hopelessness" and battling Bolsheviks without having the capacity to incite a compelling counter-upset. Abstract faultfinder Tom McCarthy portrayed the plot as "genuinely clear" and censured the delineation of Bolsheviks as "emulate patterns".
