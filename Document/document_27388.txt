The game's sound team was composed of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and audio director Eric Brosius. According to Brosius, each member of the audio department did "everything", without clear demarcations between roles. Like "Thief", "Thief II" features a sound engine that simulates propagation in real-time. To achieve this effect, each level's geometry was input both to the level editor and to a "separate [sound] database", which mapped how sound would realistically propagate based on "the physical room characteristics [... and] how all the different rooms and areas are connected together". For example, noise travels freely through an open door but is blocked when the door is closed. The team used the new "occlusion" feature in EAX 2.0 to make "Thief II"s sound environment more realistic and to allow the player to listen through doors. The game features more sound effects, music and speech than the original "Thief". "Thief II"s score, as with that of its predecessor, was designed to "blur ambient [sound] and music" together. However, Brosius later stated that, while "Thief"s soundtrack is composed of "simple and hypnotic" loops only a few seconds in length, "Thief II" features longer and "more thoughtfully" constructed pieces. He believed that this method had positive aspects, but that it resulted in a less immersive audio environment.
