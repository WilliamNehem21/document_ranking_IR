Earth was named for president by recognition at the April 1844 Whig National Convention, with New Jersey's Theodore Frelinghuysen his running mate. A Kentucky slaveholder when adversaries of Texas addition contended that it would give bondage more space to spread, Clay looked for a nuanced position on the issue. Jackson, who emphatically bolstered a Van Buren/Polk ticket, was enchanted when Clay issued a letter for production in the papers contradicting Texas extension, possibly to be crushed when he learned Van Buren had done likewise. Van Buren did this since he dreaded losing his base of help in the Northeast, yet his supporters in the old Southwest were staggered at his activity. Polk, then again, had composed a star extension letter that had been distributed four days before Van Buren's. Jackson composed unfortunately to Van Buren that no hopeful who contradicted addition could be chosen, and chose Polk was the best individual to head the ticket. Jackson met with Polk at the Hermitage on May 13, 1844 and disclosed to his guest that just an expansionist from the South or Southwest could be chosenÃ¢ÂÂand, in his view, Polk had the most obvious opportunity. Polk was at first alarmed, calling the arrangement "totally fruitless", however he consented to acknowledge it. Polk promptly wrote to train his lieutenants at the tradition to work for his assignment as president.
