Pick was satisfied with the outcomes and at a DIA supper in 1926 announced "that another style of structural enhancement will emerge" prompting an "Advanced London Ã¢ÂÂ current not jumbled exemplary or Renaissance." Amongst Pick's next payments for Holden were the upgrade of Piccadilly Circus station (1925Ã¢ÂÂ 28), where a wide underground concourse and ticket lobby were worked underneath the street intersection, and the Underground Group's new central station working at 55 Broadway, St James' (1925Ã¢ÂÂ 1929). The new base camp structure was on an unadroitly molded site, halfway over the stages and tracks of St. James' Park station. In spite of the fact that Holden's training had not structured such an expansive place of business, it had involvement of substantial emergency clinic plan, which Pick saw as integral to the structure of a cutting edge place of business. Whenever finished, the twelve-story, high cruciform structure was the tallest in London and the pinnacle overwhelmed the horizon. The structure was generally welcomed by design commentators and won Holden the RIBA's London Architecture Medal for 1929. Two models authorized for the structure were less generally welcomed, creating extensive debate in the media. The bareness and crude cutting of by Jacob Epstein prompted calls for them to be expelled from the structure and the leading body of the Underground Group thought about supplanting them with new figures by another craftsman. Despite the fact that he secretly conceded later that the figures were not to his taste, Pick openly upheld Holden's determination of Epstein as stone carver and offered to leave over the issue. The emergency was turned away when Epstein was convinced to decrease the length of the penis of one of the figures and the models stayed set up.
