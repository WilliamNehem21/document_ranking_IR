In the account studios Solti's vocation took off after 1956, when John Culshaw was placed responsible for Decca's established chronicle program. Culshaw trusted Solti to be "the incomparable Wagner conductor within recent memory", and was resolved to record the four musical dramas of "Der Ring des Nibelungen" with Solti and the best Wagner artists accessible. The cast Culshaw gathered for the cycle included Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, Birgit Nilsson and Wolfgang Windgassen. Aside from "Arabella" in 1957, in which he substituted when Karl BÃÂ¶hm pulled back, Solti had made no total account of a musical show until the sessions for "Das Rheingold", the first of the "Ring" quadruplicate, in September and October 1958. In their individual journals Culshaw and Solti told how Walter Legge of Decca's adversary EMI anticipated that "Das Rheingold" would be a business catastrophe ("'Very decent,' he stated, 'fascinating. Obviously you won't "sell" any.'") The achievement of the chronicle overwhelmed the record business. It included for quite a long time in the "Bulletin" diagrams, the sole established collection nearby blockbusters by Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, and conveyed Solti's name to universal conspicuousness. He showed up with driving ensembles in New York, Vienna and Los Angeles, and at Covent Garden he led "Der Rosenkavalier" and Britten's "A Midsummer Night's Dream".
