The various texts of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" give different versions of the revolt. Hart states: "The oldest and more authoritative is preserved in the 'B' text of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" (supported in its essentials by the Latin East Anglian "Chronicle"); the official version in the 'A' text is clearly a late revision, intended to justify King Edward's position and to reinforce his authority." 'B' describes Ãthelwold as an Ã¦theling, indicating the legitimacy of his claim for the kingship, a description omitted in 'A'. 'A' says that he took possession of Wimborne and Twinham without the permission of the king and his councillors', 'B' against their will. 'B' says that Ãthelwold "rode away by night" from Wimborne; 'A' reads "stole away". According to 'B', the Northumbrian Danes accepted Ãthelwold as their king, and gave allegiance to him, but this is omitted in 'A'. However, none of the texts describe him as an Ã¦theling after his flight to Northumbria, showing that his actions were no longer thought to have a claim to legitimacy. In the view of Scott Thompson Smith, the dispute was over property as well as kingship, and the "Chronicle" presents Edward as the successful protector of family property against outside interests.
