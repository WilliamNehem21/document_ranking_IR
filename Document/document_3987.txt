After 326 exhibitions, Leigh completed her run, and she was before long doled out to repeat her job as Blanche DuBois in the film rendition of the play. Her flippant and regularly off color comical inclination enabled her to set up an affinity with Brando, however she had an underlying trouble in working with chief Elia Kazan, who was disappointed with the bearing that Olivier had taken in molding the character of Blanche. Kazan had favored Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, yet realized she had been a triumph on the London organize as Blanche. He later remarked that he didn't hold her in high see as a performing artist, trusting that "she had a little ability." As work advanced, be that as it may, he turned out to be "loaded with profound respect" for "the best assurance to exceed expectations of any on-screen character I've known. She'd have slithered over broken glass in the event that she figured it would support her execution." Leigh found the job exhausting and remarked to the "Los Angeles Times", "I had nine months in the performance center of Blanche DuBois. Presently she's in order of me." Olivier went with her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's "Carrie" (1952).
