In 1930, Meyszner became a right-wing deputy in the Styrian provincial parliament () representing the "Heimatblock", the political wing of the "Heimatschutz", and because of the Styrian system of proportional representation he also became a minister of the provincial government. His governmental responsibilities meant that he was unable to take an active part in the abortive coup d'Ã©tat led by Pfrimer in 1931 but while claiming he knew nothing of the "putsch" beforehand, he openly stated in the "Landtag" that he approved of it. Pfrimer and his co-conspirator Konstantin Kammerhofer went into hiding, and in the short term, Meyszner was the leader of the Home Guard. Meyszner continued his Home Guard activities and together with Rauter he began to forge closer links with the Austrian Nazi Party, holding several meetings with Hitler's delegate in Austria, Theodor Habicht. In late 1933 the negotiations would culminate in the so-called Venice agreement, by which Home Guard was transferred into the Nazi Party. The fact that Meyszner had completely adopted Nazi ideology was demonstrated by his anti-Jewish diatribe in the "Landestag" in April 1933. From March 1933, the authoritarian Fatherland Front government of Engelbert Dollfuss prorogued parliamentary government and in June they banned the Austrian Nazi Party and the Home Guard. A few days before this, public servants who were members of the Austrian Nazi Party were classified as subversive. Based on these decrees, Meyszner was also denied his seat in parliament and forcibly retired from the gendarmerie in September 1933 at the age of 47.
