Gibbons' first after war novel was "Westwood" (1946). The book fuses a comic portrayal of the writer Charles Morgan, whose novel "The Fountain" Gibbons had audited before the war and discovered "hostile just as wearisome". In "Westwood", Morgan shows up in the pretense of the author "Gerald Challis", a self important, humorless bore. Oliver believes this characterisation to be a standout amongst Gibbons' "most charming and awful" sarcastic pictures. In first experience with the book's 2011 reproduce, Lynne Truss depicts it as "a rich, develop novel, sentimental and insightful, loaded with adjusted characters and fabulous exchange" that merited more business accomplishment than it got. The open's desires were as yet partial by "Limited consolidation Farm", which by 1949 had sold 28,000 duplicates in hardback and 315,000 in soft cover. Foreseeing that a continuation would be prominent, that year Gibbons delivered "Meeting at Cold Comfort Farm", her briefest novel, in which the ranch has turned into a gathering focus and vacation destination. There is much joke of contemporary and without a doubt future creative and scholarly patterns, before the male Starkadders come back from abroad, wreck the inside and reestablish the homestead to its unique crude state. The book was respectably effective in any case, Oliver comments, does not contrast and the first.
