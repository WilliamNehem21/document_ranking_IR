In the early long stretches of February 23, occupants started escaping BÃÂ©xar, dreading the Mexican armed force's approaching landing. Albeit unconvinced by the reports, Travis positioned a trooper in the San Fernando church chime tower, the most astounding area around the local area, to look for indications of a moving toward power. A few hours after the fact, Texian scouts revealed seeing Mexican troops outside the town. Scarcely any courses of action had been made for a potential attack. One gathering of Texians mixed to crowd dairy cattle into the Alamo, while others rummaged for nourishment in the as of late relinquished houses. A few individuals from the army who had been living around the local area carried their families with them when they answered to the Alamo. Among these were Almaron Dickinson, who brought his better half Susanna and their baby little girl Angelina; Bowie, who was joined by his perished spouse's cousins, Gertrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, and Alsbury's young child; and Gregorio Esparza, whose family move through the window of the Alamo house of prayer after the Mexican armed force arrived. Different individuals from the army neglected to report for obligation; a large portion of the men working outside BÃÂ©xar did not attempt to sneak past Mexican lines.
