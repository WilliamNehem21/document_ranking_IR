"The Battle for Middle-earth II" presents three new groups with one of a kind units and saints: Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves. Rohan and Gondor are joined into one group called Men of the West. Alongside Mordor and Isengard from , there are six playable groups. The troops of Gondor furnish a strong offense and safeguard with standard infantry and bowmen, and the Rohirrim of Rohan go about as tip top rangers. The Elven bowmen are compelling at incurring harm from a separation, and their help units, the Ents, can play out a mix of skirmish and attack assaults, they are regularly viewed as the most grounded protective group because of their solid rocket units and amazing 'silverthorn bolts'. Albeit moderate and costly, Dwarven infantry, pikemen, and hatchet hurlers are extremely incredible and very much reinforced enabling them to win in even the longest conflicts with adversary troops. A gathering of wild animals and monsters of Middle-earth make up the Goblin group, this incorporates trolls, trolls, bugs, and mythical beasts, which are compelling in vast numbers. Their solitary favorable position is that the troll bowman and officer units are modest to make at just 75 assets and assemble quicker than other fundamental infantry. Isengard troops are profoundly prepared Uruk-hai under Saruman's direction. Berserkers are utilized by Isengard as limited armed forces that move amazingly quick and arrangement huge harm (especially to foe structures and legends). Furthermore, Isengard is the main Evil group that can assemble dividers. Mordor powers are a blend of Orcs, Men, Trolls, Mumakil, and Sauron's lieutenants. Mordor Orcs have extreme covering, making them valuable for retaining adversary harm while more grounded units assault foes. Trolls contribute extraordinarily to the Mordor offensives, having solid skirmish assaults and the capacity to toss stones or employ trees like swords.
