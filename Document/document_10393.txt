Fighting was common in the Maya world. Military crusades were propelled for an assortment of reasons, including the control of exchange courses and tribute, assaults to take hostages, scaling up to the total devastation of an adversary state. Little is thought about Maya military association, coordinations, or preparing. Fighting is delineated in Maya workmanship from the Classic time frame, and wars and triumphs are referenced in hieroglyphic engravings. Lamentably, the engravings don't give data upon the reasons for war, or the structure it took. In the 8thÃ¢ÂÂ ninth hundreds of years, serious fighting brought about the breakdown of the kingdoms of the PetexbatÃÂºn area of western PetÃÂ©n. The fast deserting of Aguateca by its occupants has given an uncommon chance to analyze the remaining parts of Maya weaponry "in situ". Aguateca was raged by obscure adversaries around 810 AD, who conquered its imposing barriers and consumed the illustrious castle. The first class occupants of the city either fled or were caught, and stayed away forever to gather their relinquished property. The occupants of the outskirts surrendered the site before long. This is a case of concentrated fighting did by a foe so as to totally wipe out a Maya state, instead of enslave it. Research at Aguateca showed that Classic period warriors were essentially individuals from the tip top.
