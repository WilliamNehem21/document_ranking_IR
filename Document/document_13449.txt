On December 27, 1999, the state granted a $85.7ÃÂ million contract (identical to $ in ) for the substitution of the S-Curve on USÃÂ 131. Stores of gypsum under the roadway were dissolving and making it settle. A disintegrating span additionally constrained the reproduction of the turnpike through the zone. Development started on January 15, 2000, redirecting the generally 115,000ÃÂ vehicles every day that utilized the stretch of street to alternate routes through the downtown zone. As a feature of the undertaking, a $1.2ÃÂ million (proportionate to $ in ) de-icing framework was introduced. The framework is intended to shower a de-icing liquid on the roadway that would be conveyed via vehicle tires up to a mile (1.6ÃÂ km) along the street surface. This liquid is required to liquefy ice at temperatures beneath the at which salt quits working. In contrast to salt, the non-destructive de-icer does not hurt the extension, however it is all the more expensive. The framework is intended to be initiated physically, or consequently through sensors along the street. In any case, furrowing would even now be required on the roadway. The thought behind the de-icing framework is to keep the asphalt wet and keep the arrangement of ice.
