The court suspended for lunch after Edward's examination, and after the break Clarke called his last observer, Williams. Under Clarke's scrutinizing Williams affirmed that he had seen no activities by Gordon-Cumming that he considered as out of line. After Clarke completed the process of addressing Williams, Asquith questioned the fighter for the rest of the session; after a concise reconsideration by Clarke, the dayÃ¢ÂÂand the case for the offended partyÃ¢ÂÂarrived at an end. The third day started with the opening discourse for the litigants, after which Stanley Wilson stood up for the rest of the day, and on into the fourth day. Inspected by Asquith, Stanley related seeing Gordon-Cumming unlawfully add counters to his stake twice on the primary night and no less than twice on the second night, in spite of the fact that he couldn't recall the full subtleties. At the point when interrogated by Clarke he was not intimidated by the legal advisor's inquiries, despite the fact that Clarke influenced him to seem "reckless, proud and puerile". Stanley was supplanted in the observer box by Levett; "The Morning Advertiser" thought about that Levett "felt to some degree awkward" showing up against Gordon-Cumming, and announced that he had "depicted his situation as an 'unbalanced' one". In spite of his distress, Levett affirmed that on the main night he had seen Gordon-Cumming include counters after the hand had completed however before the stake had been paid. He was uncertain of different subtleties of the night's play, and had not seen anything on the second night.
