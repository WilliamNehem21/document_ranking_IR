For the melody "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was initially written for one of Jam and Lewis' very own records, the verses were revamped to pass on Jackson's sentiments about her ongoing dissolution from James DeBarge. The melody was picked as the lead single for "Control", as Jam and Lewis felt it best spoken to Jackson's point of view. "Dreadful", which as Jackson would like to think was the most inventive melody on the collection, was motivated by her involvement with road provocation in Minneapolis by a gathering of men outside the inn she lived at amid the chronicle of "Control". She reviewed, "They were candidly oppressive. Explicitly undermining. Rather than hurrying to Jimmy or Terry for security, I stood firm. I upheld them down. That is the way tunes like 'Dreadful' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were conceived, out of a feeling of self-protection." Jimmy Jam composed and played the console course of action, with Jackson playing the backup. Foundation vocals were sung by Jackson, Jam and Lewis. The unmistakable triplet swing beat of the tune was created by Jam on an Ensoniq Mirage console. "How about we Wait Awhile" was fixated on safe sex and forbearance, a subject of critical social discourse at the time. Jam remarked that usually practice for musicians to utilize recent developments as a methods for motivation for verses and that the AIDS pandemic had brought issues to light about explicitly transmitted ailments. He remarked, "The topic of the melody ('Let's Wait Awhile') was Janet's thought. She's not a long winded individual. She's not advising individuals how to experience their lives. All she's doing is putting forth an assessment."
