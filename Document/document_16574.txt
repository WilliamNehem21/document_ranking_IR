The priory was the second religious house to be founded in the Earldom of Chester; the first was the Benedictine StÂ Werburgh's Abbey at Chester, founded in 1093 by Hugh Lupus, the first Earl of Chester. The priory at Runcorn had a double dedication, to Saint Bertelin and to Saint Mary. The authors of the "Victoria County History" suggest that the dedication to StÂ Bertelin was taken from a Saxon church already existing on the site. In 1134 William fitzÂ William, the third Baron of Halton, moved the priory to a site in Norton, a village to the east of Runcorn. The reasons for the move are uncertain. It may have been that fitzÂ William wanted greater control of the strategic crossing of the Mersey at Runcorn Gap, or it may have been because the canons wanted a more secluded site. Nothing remains of the site of the original priory in Runcorn.
The site for the new priory was in damp, scrubby woodland. There is no evidence that it was agricultural land, or that it contained any earlier buildings. The first priority was to clear and drain the land. There were freshwater springs near the site, and these would have provided fresh running water for latrines and domestic purposes. They would also have been used to create watercourses and moated enclosures, some of which might have been used for orchards and herb gardens. Sandstone for building the priory was available at an outcrop nearby, sand for mortar could be obtained from the shores of the River Mersey, and boulder clay on the site provided material for floor and roof tiles.
