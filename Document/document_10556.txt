Nearly from the beginning of its stewardship, the Park Service tried to move the ringer from Independence Hall to a structure where it is simpler to think about the chime and suit guests. The principal such proposition was pulled back in 1958, after impressive open dissent. The Park Service attempted again as a feature of the getting ready for the 1976 United States Bicentennial. The Independence National Historical Park Advisory Committee proposed in 1969 that the chime be moved out of Independence Hall, as the structure couldn't oblige the millions expected to visit Philadelphia for the Bicentennial. In 1972, the Park Service declared designs to fabricate a substantial glass tower for the ringer at the new guests focus at South Third Street and Chestnut Street, two squares east of Independence Hall, at an expense of $5ÃÂ million, yet natives again challenged the move. Rather, in 1973, the Park Service proposed to construct a littler glass structure for the chime at the north end of Independence Mall, among Arch and Race Streets. Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo concurred with the structure thought, yet recommended that the structure be worked crosswise over Chestnut Street from Independence Hall, which the state dreaded would crush the perspective on the notable structure from the shopping center zone. Rizzo's view won, and the chime was moved to a glass-and-steel Liberty Bell Pavilion, about from its old home at Independence Hall, as the Bicentennial year started.
