On October 31, 2016, a $2 billion, two million square foot worldwide terminal for U.S. cross outskirt and global flights opened at Calgary International Airport, the biggest center of WestJet Encore and its subsidiary WestJet. In spite of interview with the carriers, the terminal structure demonstrated risky. The Calgary Airport Authority CEO portrayed the new terminal as being "long on feel and short on usefulness." There is decreased air ship proficiency because of the need to tow flying machine to another concourse if an airplane is utilized for both residential and either U.S. cross fringe or universal flights just as the need to procure extra staff since they can't be conveyed to more than one concourse because of long strolling separations. The things arrangement of the new terminal is inoperable with the remainder of the air terminal from 2016 to 2019. Traveler issues incorporate WestJet trans-outskirt and universal entryways being as much as a two-kilometer stroll to the local WestJet doors just as absence of enough seating at the entryway so travelers sit on the floor. These issues are viewed as a danger to traveler traffic, which may be headed to other associating airplane terminals, for example, Seattle or Vancouver, urban areas that WestJet Encore has less or no flights serving.
