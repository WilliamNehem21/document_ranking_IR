Impressions from the Nemegt Formation were obscure until 2003, when a few models had been portrayed from the Nemegt region by Currie and partners. A large portion of these impressions had a place with hadrosaurids (most likely "Saurolophus"), while two have been left by a substantial theropod (presumably "Tarbosaurus") but then another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were allocated to "Opisthocoelicaudia", which, as per these creators, demonstrated a coordinating rear foot morphology and was most likely the main known sauropod (and, in this way, the main potential trackmaker species) from the Nemegt Formation when "Nemegtosaurus" is respected an equivalent word. The tracks were left in the delicate and wet mud of shallow or newly evaporated focuses along a waterway and accordingly topped off with sand. Today just the sand infill stays, with the encasing mudstone having been dissolved away. The best-saved impression measures over, so it was likely made by an individual bigger than the sort example. In spite of the fact that the outside of the underside is difficult to get, the vertical surfaces are great safeguarded, making this track a standout amongst the best saved sauropod tracks known. Four computerized impressions can be recognized, with a few indicating paw impressions. The toes were practically opposite. Indeed, even a skin impression has been saved over the impression of the principal toe, which demonstrates the non-covering scales, each with a normal measurement of . The foot of the track maker was presumably somewhat longer than wide. The second track is much shallower than the first, however demonstrates all around protected digit impressions with a high level of detail, including no less than two profound paw impressions that are pivoted outwards, and an all around saved impression of a plump toe cushion behind the center hook.
