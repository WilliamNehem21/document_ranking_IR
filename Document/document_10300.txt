Why Molyneux left England for Holland is misty. The "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" proposes it was to have the capacity to by and by disperse his globes to European sovereigns, since Amsterdam was then rapidly setting up itself as the focal point of globe-and guide making. Be that as it may, this couldn't have been his expectation on the off chance that he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is conceivable that he had chosen to focus on assembling weapons. On 26 January 1598, the States-General, the parliament of the United Provinces, indicated enthusiasm for Molyneux's gun and allowed him a 12-year benefit on a creation. On 6 June he stopped a second application, however he kicked the bucket in Amsterdam very quickly a short time later. His better half was allowed organization of his bequest in England soon thereafter. It appears that Molyneux kicked the bucket in neediness, since Anne was conceded a Dutch humane benefits of 50 florins on 9 April 1599. Molyneux clearly had no other enduring family, and the English globe-production industry passed on with him. No different globes seem to have been produced in England until the appearance during the 1670s of globes by Robert Morden and William Berry, and by Joseph Moxon. In any case, over 40ÃÂ years after Molyneux's passing, William Sanderson the more youthful composed that his globes were "yet in being, incredible and little ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and past Seas)".
