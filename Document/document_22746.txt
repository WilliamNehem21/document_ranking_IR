The studio decided to increase the episode's budget, which at that time was estimated by "Daily Variety" as $1.2 million per episode. This gave the production departments more leeway. One reason for the increase was that "Yesterday's Enterprise" would air during February sweeps, an important time for the studio to attract solid ratings. As "The Next Generation" was syndicated directly by the studio, the episode's performance would affect advertising revenue for the future.
The script called for the creation of the "Enterprise"-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert â who had designed the "Enterprise"-D â was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's "Enterprise" to "The Next Generation"s much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the "Enterprise"-B was an "Excelsior"-class vessel and reasoned that the "C" would share design elements with its "Excelsior"-class predecessor and its "Galaxy"-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of "Enterprise"-C, but he left at the end of the season and his absence meant that no one knew what the drawing was intended to be.
