Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus authored the binomial name "Columba macroura" for both the grieving bird and the traveler pigeon in the 1758 version of his work "Systema Naturae" (the beginning stage of organic terminology), wherein he seems to have considered the two indistinguishable. This composite portrayal refered to records of these winged creatures in two pre-Linnean books. One of these was Mark Catesby's portrayal of the traveler pigeon, which was distributed in his 1731 to 1743 work "Characteristic History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands", which alluded to this flying creature as "Palumbus migratorius", and was joined by the most punctual distributed delineation of the species. Catesby's depiction was joined with the 1743 portrayal of the grieving pigeon by George Edwards, who utilized the name "C.ÃÂ macroura" for that flying creature. There is nothing to propose Linnaeus at any point saw examples of these feathered creatures himself, and his portrayal is believed to be completely subordinate of these prior records and their representations. In his 1766 release of "Systema Naturae", Linnaeus dropped the name "C.ÃÂ macroura", and rather utilized the name "C.ÃÂ migratoria" for the traveler pigeon, and "C.ÃÂ carolinensis" for the grieving bird. In a similar version, Linnaeus additionally named "C.ÃÂ canadensis", in view of "Turtur canadensis", as utilized by Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. Brisson's depiction was later appeared to have been founded on a female traveler pigeon.
