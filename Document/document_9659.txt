Local guinea pigs commonly live in pens, albeit a few proprietors of expansive quantities of guinea pigs commit whole rooms to their pets. Confines with strong or wire work floors are utilized, despite the fact that wire work floors can cause damage and might be related with a disease regularly known as bumblefoot (ulcerative pododermatitis). "3D squares and Coroplast" (C&C) style confines are presently a typical decision. Confines are frequently fixed with wood shavings or a comparable material. Bedding produced using red cedar (Eastern or Western) and pine, the two softwoods, were ordinarily utilized before, yet these materials are currently accepted to contain hurtful phenols (fragrant hydrocarbons) and oils. More secure sheet material materials produced using hardwoods, (for example, aspen), paper items, and corn cob materials are different choices. Guinea pigs will in general be muddled inside their enclosures; they frequently hop into their nourishment bowls or kick bedding and excrement into them, and their pee once in a while solidifies on pen surfaces, making it hard to expel. After its enclosure has been cleaned, a guinea pig normally pees and hauls its lower body over the floor of the pen to stamp its region. Male guinea pigs may likewise stamp their region along these lines when they are removed from their pens.
