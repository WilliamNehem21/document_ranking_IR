In a letter to "The Times" distributed on 29 October 1860, MÃÂ¼ller disagreed with Williams. To the case that it is unmerited to show history, theory, and different subjects as Boden educator, he cited from one of Wilson's open addresses in which he had said that it had dependably been his expectation to offer "a general perspective on the establishments and social condition, the writing, and religion of the Hindus." He noticed that he had distributed in every one of the three zones into which Williams separated Sanskrit writing, and debated Williams' perspectives on the overall significance of Vedic writing with reference to a survey of one of his productions by Wilson. Williams, he stated, "remains up 'til now alone" in declaring that the gallant sonnets and the plays, not the Vedas, were the genuine sacred texts. He wouldn't acknowledge Williams' gauge of the work associated with the version of the "Apparatus Veda", and said that to contrast his little exertion and that completed on the Bible was "practically disrespectful." He closed by endeavoring to disprove the case that Boden would not have needed the Vedic sacred texts to be bolstered. He noticed that the Bishop of Calcutta (George Cotton) had composed that it was of "the best significance" for evangelists to consider Sanskrit and its sacred writings "to have the capacity to meet the Pundits all alone ground", and that the religious administrator's view was that nothing could be progressively important in this work MÃÂ¼ller's release, and Wilson's interpretation, of the "Apparatus Veda"."
