Beta Aurigae (Menkalinan, Menkarlina) is a brilliant A2IV class star (A-type subgiant). Its Arabic name originates from the expression "mankib dhu al-'inan", signifying "shoulder of the charioteer" and is a reference to Beta Aurigae's area in the group of stars. Menkalinan is 81 light-years away and has a size of 1.90. Like Epsilon Aurigae, it is an overshadowing double star that fluctuates in greatness by 0.1. The two parts are blue-white stars that have a time of 3.96 days. Its twofold nature was uncovered spectroscopically in 1890 by Antonia Maury, making it the second spectroscopic paired found, and its variable nature was found photometrically 20 years after the fact by Joel Stebbins. Menkalinan has a flat out size of 0.6 and a glow of . The segment of its movement toward Earth is every second. Beta Aurigae might be related with a flood of around 70 stars including Delta Leonis and Alpha Ophiuchi; the correct movement of this gathering is practically identical to that of the Ursa Major Moving Group, however the association is just guessed. Other than its nearby obscuring buddy, Menkalinan has two different stars related with it. One is a random optical friend, found in 1783 by William Herschel; it has an extent of 10.5 and has a partition of 184 arcseconds. The other is likely related gravitationally with the essential, as controlled by their normal appropriate movement. This fourteenth size star was found in 1901 by Edward Emerson Barnard. It has a partition of 12.6 arcseconds, and is around 350 galactic units from the essential.
