Pregame media inclusion of the amusement concentrated on the way that the 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series diversion in school history. For Virginia Tech, inclusion concentrated on the Hokies' winless history in BCS amusements since 1995, as Tech had lost each of the four of its appearances in a BCS diversion since a steamed success over Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl. Likewise referenced was the way that the two groups had confronted each other in the 1947 Sun Bowl, which had been each school's first bowl amusement. The low win rate of ACC groups by and large was another focal point. Groups from the gathering had won only one of their ten appearances in a BCS bowl before the Orange Bowl. Prior to the Orange Bowl matchup, the two groups last played in 2006, when the Hokies crushed the Bearcats, 29Ã¢ÂÂ 13, at Virginia Tech's home field, Lane Stadium. For the Orange Bowl, spread bettors supported an inversion of that 2006 last, as Cincinnati was at first supported by one point. This extended to 1.5 focuses by December 9. The pattern toward Cincinnati proceeded, and on December 27, wagering associations gave Cincinnati the edge by two or over two points.
