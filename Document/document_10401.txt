"LIBERTY" on twofold birds somewhere in the range of 1850 and 1858 was initially spelled "LLBERTY" by Longacre, who changed over the second L into an I; this is unmistakable under amplification. In 1860, Assistant Engraver Anthony C. Paquet finished a correction of the invert, with taller, smaller letters. After generation had started in mid 1861 at Philadelphia and San Francisco, it was seen that the structure did not have an edge sufficiently high to shield the plan from scraped area, and the Mint returned to the old turn around. Just a bunch of the Philadelphia examples were not softened, however when word came to San Francisco to stop generation, the western mint had issued 20,000 pieces. A Philadelphia example sold at closeout for $1,610,000 in August 2006, setting a record for the Liberty Head twofold bird arrangement. In February 2013, a 1866-S twofold falcon with no witticism was found in the Saddle Ridge Hoard in the Gold Country on the western slant of the Sierra Nevada in California. Just few proof currencies in the Liberty Head twofold bird arrangement were struck available to be purchased to general society, starting in 1858, at Philadelphia; Breen noted, "couple of gatherers could bear the cost of them and still, at the end of the day".
