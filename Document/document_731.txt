On 4 June another duke and skipper were chosen for Thessalonica, Paolo Contarini and Andrea Donato, after the initial three sets picked all declined the post, regardless of the fine appended to refusal; a reasonable sign of the reluctance of the Venetian nobles to attempt this unrewarding and hazardous undertaking.
