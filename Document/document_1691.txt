Johnston to direction of the Army of Northern Virginia, the primary Confederate armed force in the Eastern Theater. That December Davis made a voyage through Confederate militaries in the west of the nation. He had an exceptionally little hover of military counselors. He to a great extent settled on the fundamental key choices all alone, however he had exceptional regard for Lee's perspectives. Given the Confederacy's constrained assets contrasted and the Union, Davis chose that the Confederacy would need to battle for the most part on the vital protective. He kept up this viewpoint all through the war, giving exceptional consideration to the resistance of his national capital at Richmond. He endorsed Lee's vital offensives when he felt that military achievement would both shake Northern self-assurance and fortify the harmony developments there. In any case, the few crusades attacking the North were met with annihilation. A ridiculous fight at Antietam in Maryland just as the ride into Kentucky, the Confederate Heartland Offensive (both in 1862) depleted vital men and capable officers. A last offense prompted the three-day phlebotomy at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania (1863), devastating the South even more. The status of systems and weapons made the guarded side significantly more prone to suffer: a costly exercise vindicating Davis' underlying conviction.
