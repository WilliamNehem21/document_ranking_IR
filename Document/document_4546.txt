In 1796, Klenau instructed the development gatekeeper of Peter Quasdanovich's correct section in northern Italy. As the segment slid from the Alps at the city of Brescia, observation found the nearby French battalion ill-equipped. At midnight, Klenau drove two squadrons of the eighth Hussar Regiment "Wurmser" (named for its Colonel-Proprietor Dagobert von Wurmser), a force of the 37th Infantry Regiment "De Vins", and one organization of the Mahony JÃÂ¤ger. With their methodology conceal by haze and murkiness, the little power shocked the Brescia battalion on the morning of 30 July, catching not just the 600Ã¢ÂÂ 700 French troopers positioned there, yet in addition three authorities of the French Directory: Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, and FranÃÂ§ois ÃÂtienne de Kellermann. In any case, inside two days, Klenau's power needed to confront Napoleon Bonaparte and 12,000 Frenchmen; his little development protect was immediately pushed out of Brescia on 1 August. At the ensuing Battle of Lonato of 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3 August 1796, the French constrained Quasdanovich's section to pull back into the mountains. This confined Quasdanovich's power from Wurmser's primary armed force by Lake Garda, and liberated the French to focus on the principle drive at Castiglione delle Stiviere, further south; Bonaparte's triumph at the Battle of Castiglione constrained Wurmser over the Mincio River, and enabled the French to come back to the attack of Mantua.
