In 1644, the Italian Jesuit Daniello Bartoli announced seeing two darker fixes on Mars. Amid the restrictions of 1651, 1653 and 1655, when the planet made its nearest ways to deal with the Earth, the Italian stargazer Giovanni Battista Riccioli and his understudy Francesco Maria Grimaldi noted patches of varying reflectivity on Mars. The main individual to draw a guide of Mars that showed landscape highlights was the Dutch stargazer Christiaan Huygens. On November 28, 1659 he made a representation of Mars that demonstrated the unmistakable dull district presently known as Syrtis Major Planum, and perhaps one of the polar ice tops. That year, he prevailing with regards to estimating the pivot time of the planet, giving it as around 24 hours. He made a harsh gauge of the width of Mars, speculating that it is about 60% of the measure of the Earth, which contrasts well and the advanced estimation of 53%. Maybe the primary authoritative notice of Mars' southern polar ice top was by the Italian stargazer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, in 1666. That equivalent year, he utilized perceptions of the surface markings on Mars to decide a revolution time of 24 40. This varies from the as of now acknowledged an incentive by under three minutes. In 1672, Huygens saw a fluffy white top at the north shaft.
