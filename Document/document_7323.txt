Worked in 1900 for the German Far East mail courses, SS "Kiautschou" went among Hamburg and Far East ports for the greater part of her Hamburg America Line profession. In 1904, she was exchanged to contender North German Lloyd for five tankers, and renamed SS "Princess Alice". She cruised both transoceanic and Far East mail courses until the flare-up of World War I, when she was interned in the impartial port of Cebu in the Philippines. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the recently renamed USS "Princess Matoika" extended 50,000ÃÂ U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Naval force administration from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport from that point onward, she kept on returning troops and repatriated the remaining parts of Americans slaughtered abroad in the war. In July 1920, she was a very late substitute to convey a huge bit of the United States group to the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. From the point of view of the Olympic group, the outing was deplorable and a dominant part of the colleagues distributed a rundown of complaints and requests of the American Olympic Committee in an activity referred to today as the Mutiny of the "Matoika".
