With preparing in progress, and the tanks rapidly put into battle, the initial 50 vehicles were composed into the Popular Army's first tank regiment. The brigade was outfitted with three tank organizations (each organization containing ten tanks) and a central station organization; each organization had three units, with three tanks a piece, and an order tank. By mid-November a second contingent was sorted out. Soon thereafter, Krivoshein and his appointee (Major Greisser) were reviewed to the Soviet Union and supplanted by General Dmitry Pavlov. In December 1936, General Pavlov composed new Soviet heavily clad vehicles into a protected detachment, made up of four tank units and an observation organization. This detachment, known as "Brigada de Carros de Combate" (Tank Brigade), was made out of 56 tanks and 68 other defensively covered vehicles, and quickly observed battle around Madrid, incorporating into the clashes of Jarama and Guadalajara. Be that as it may, the unit was utilized to help Republican infantry powers and not as a versatile defensively covered gathering, and thus its vital job amid the war was restricted by its abuse. In July 1937, the detachment partook in the Battle of Brunete, the biggest tank fight to that date in the war, with exactly 150 Republican tanks participating. The fight was likewise one of only a handful couple of models amid the Spanish Civil War of the utilization of tanks to abuse an infiltration along the front. In any case, the fight cost the Popular Army around 159 protected battling vehicles.
