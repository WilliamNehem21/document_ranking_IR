The VrbaÃ¢ÂÂ Wetzler report was not circulated broadly until JuneÃ¢ÂÂ July 1944, weeks after the men's departure in April. This was a wellspring of incredible misery to Vrba for a mind-blowing remainder. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews were ousted to Auschwitz, most executed on landing. In the epilog of his book "I Cannot Forgive" (1963), he solicits: "For what reason did several thousands stroll without protection from the gas chambers"? In his view, the deportees boarded the trains "wanting to arrive in a type of Jewish 'reservation' or ghetto where they would have a rest from the amazingly severe fear incurred upon them by the Horthy routine's Hungarian Gendarmerie." Arguing that they would have run or battled had they realized they were being sent to their demises, or if nothing else that frenzy would have impeded the vehicles, Vrba affirmed that Rudolf Kastner of the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee (who had a duplicate of the VrbaÃ¢ÂÂ Wetzler report by 3 May 1944 at the most recent) had kept down the report to abstain from imperiling complex, and generally worthless, dealings with Adolf Eichmann, Dieter Wisliceny and different SS officers (counting the "blood for products" bargain) to trade Jews for cash and merchandise. Vrba contended that, in participating in these dealings, the SS was essentially mollifying the Jewish administration to dodge insubordination inside the network.
