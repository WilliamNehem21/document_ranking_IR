In mid-1910 Barrymore met socialite Katherine Corri Harris, and the couple married in September that year. Harris' father objected to the relationship and refused to attend the wedding. Shortly after the ceremony, "The Dictator" went on tour, and Harris was given a small role in the play. According to Peters, Barrymore "began to think of his marriage as a 'bus accident. Film critic Hollis Alpert wrote that, within a week of the wedding, Katherine was complaining that she saw her new husband too infrequently. Barrymore's increasing dependence on alcohol was also a cause of marital problems, and he explained that "unhappiness increased the drink, and drink increased the unhappiness".
Barrymore's next two playsÂ â "Uncle Sam" and "Princess Zim-Zim", both from 1911Â â were critically and commercially weak, but the second work introduced him to playwright Edward Sheldon, who would "reshapeÂ ... [Barrymore's] entire career". In January 1912, Barrymore appeared together with his sister in "A Slice of Life" at the Empire Theatre on Broadway, which ran for 48 performances. Charles Darnton, a critic for "The Evening World", observed that "Barrymore takes delight in 'kidding' his part not only to the limit, but perhaps beyond". A review in "The Washington Times" stated that "Barrymore inimitably imitates his uncle John Drew".
