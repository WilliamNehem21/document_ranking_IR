Following her return from the world cruise, "Connecticut" continued to serve as flagship of the Atlantic Fleet, interrupted only by a March 1909 overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. After rejoining the fleet, she cruised the East Coast from her base at Norfolk, Virginia. For the rest of 1909, the battleship conducted training and participated in ceremonial observances, such as the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. In early January 1910, "Connecticut" left for Cuban waters and stayed there until late March when she returned to New York for a refit. After several months conducting maneuvers and battle practice off the New England coast, she left for Europe on 2 November to go on a midshipman training cruise. She arrived in Portland, England on 15 November and was present during the 1 December birthday celebration of Queen Alexandra, the queen mother. "Connecticut" next visited Cherbourg, France, where she welcomed visitors from the town and also hosted commander-in-chief of the French Navy "Vice-Amiral" Laurent Marin-Darbel, and a delegation of his officers. While there, a boat crew from "Connecticut" engaged a crew from the French battleship in a rowing race; "Connecticut"s crew won by twelve lengths. "Connecticut" departed French waters for GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, on 30 December, and stayed there until 17 March, when she departed for Hampton Roads.
