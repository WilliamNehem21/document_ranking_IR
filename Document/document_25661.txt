Many consider the "Astronomica" to be a work of erudition, elegance, and passion. Scaliger and Bentley praised Manilius's handling of numbers in verse, and the Harvard University Press later echoed this commendation, writing that Manilius "exhibit[s] great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form", and that the poet "writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars". Housman, however, calls Manilius "facile and frivolous" but also describes him as "the one Latin poet who excelled even Ovid in verbal point and smartness". The poem, while metrically correct, has been noted for its technical language and unusual word choices. The classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall argues that while "at his best, Manilius may remind us of Lucretius", the "metre [that he uses] has the regular and monotonous flow of the age". Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have attributed the "Astronomica" idiosyncrasies to Manilius's reported African origin; they argue he wrote and spoke a form of "Africitas"âa putative African dialect of Latin "with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary, syntax, sentence-structure, and style"âthus explaining the poem's quirks. Aside from the dubiously hypothesized presence of "Africitas" in the poem, however, M. Dorothy Brock argues there is very little evidence that Manilius was from Africa.
