The male yellow-followed dark cockatoo has a dark bill, a dull yellow fix behind each eye, and pinkish or rosy eye-rings. The female has dim eye-rings, a horn-hued bill, and more splendid and all the more plainly characterized yellow cheek-patches. Juvenile feathered creatures have more blunt plumage by and large, a horn-shaded bill, and dim eye-rings; The upper nose of the youthful male obscures to dark by two years old, initiating at the base of the bill and spreading more than ten weeks. The lower nose darkens later by four years old. The lengthened bill has a pointed maxilla (upper snout), fit to uncovering grubs from tree limbs and trunks. Records of the planning of the eye ring changing from dark to pink in male winged creatures are scanty, yet have been recorded somewhere in the range of one to four years old. Australian rancher and beginner ornithologist John Courtney recommended that the similitude among adolescent and female eye rings averted grown-up guys getting to be forceful to more youthful fowls. He likewise watched the eye rings to flush more brilliant in forceful guys. Shedding seems to occur in stages through the span of a year, and is inadequately comprehended.
