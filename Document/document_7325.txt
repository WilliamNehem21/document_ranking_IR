Roberts conveyed the primary arrangement of coins to Said receptacle Sultan on October 1, 1835. He conveyed the following set to King Rama III of Siam the next year, on April 6. Roberts passed on in Macau on June 12, 1836, preceding he could start contact with some other countries. On June 30, Edmund P. Kennedy, commodore of the discretionary armada, kept in touch with the State Department that he had "coordinated that the presents [which remained awkward because of Roberts' death] be sent to the United States". The confirmation sets implied for Cochin-China and Japan were likely incorporated into the shipment of returned presents. All dollars struck for consideration in the conciliatory blessing sets were likely dated 1804. It is obscure why that date was picked for the dollars, yet numismatic antiquarian R.W. Julian recommends that it could have been done to forestall irritated authorities who might not have had the capacity to gain the 1834-dated mint piece for their accumulations; Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt, in the wake of counseling with Moore, erroneously established that 19,570 dollars bearing the date 1804 were struck in that year. The dollars printed for the discretionary blessing sets, just as different models hit with similar bites the dust, are all things considered known as "Class I" 1804 dollars. Altogether, eight examples of this sort are known today.
