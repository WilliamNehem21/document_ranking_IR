In the "All Music Guide to Jazz" (2002), Lindsay Planer composed that Monk's group of four "ceaselessly rehashed" their solid, firm stable with "overpowering and instinctual limits" all through "Misterioso". He particularly applauded Griffin, saying he "reliably freed the exhibitions". Priest biographer Robin Kelley felt since he had aced Monk's melodies by then, his performances on "Misterioso" and "Thelonious in real life" were digressive and vivacious. Jazz pundit Scott Yanow discovered "Misterioso" to be the prevalent record in light of what he said was Griffin's remarkable solo on an energetic interpretation of "In Walked Bud", while music student of history Ted Gioia recorded Monk and Griffin's "freewheeling" execution on the title track as one of his prescribed chronicles of the creation. As per Robert Christgau, both this record and "Splendid Corners" (1957) spoke to Monk's imaginative pinnacle. He refered to "Misterioso" as his most loved collection and, in a 2009 article for "The Barnes and Noble Review", composed that Griffin's tenor solo amid "In Walked Bud" remained his "most loved five minutes of recorded music". Liam McManus from "PopMatters" was less excited about Griffin's playing, which he accepted was at times cumbersome and diminished the music, yet at the same time suggested "Misterioso" as an excellent Monk record including the piano player in an easygoing act with his group of four.
