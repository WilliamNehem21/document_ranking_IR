"A Many Splendored Thing" was written by Noel Behn, who became consulting producer with the series. That episode featured a subplot about a man who killed another man over a pen, which was inspired by a real-life murder in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, in which a 23-year-old man shot another man 10 times in a doughnut shop when the victim refused to sell the shooter his pen. Since NBC had not decided on whether to renew "Homicide" until after the four episodes aired, the screenwriters did not start working on any scripts for the third season until after the second season concluded. As a result, once NBC was committed to renewal, the scripts had to be written later and the "Homicide" producers were not able to turn around new shows until the fall. Additionally, Fontana was working on other projects, including "Philly Heat", an ABC miniseries about members of the Philadelphia Fire Department. Some media outlets criticized NBC for not commissioning Fontana and Levinson to write back-up scripts, which prevented "Homicide" from starting earlier once the show was renewed. Alan Pergament of "The Buffalo News" wrote, "Understandably, Fontana didn't sit by idly and wait for NBC to make its decision on "Homicide"."
