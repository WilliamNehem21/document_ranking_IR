Carol maintained its intensity as it moved inland, and its winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Hampshire. One tree fell onto a car, killing a person, and there were three deaths overall in the state, along with $3Â million in damage. There was also a death in neighboring Vermont. Carol produced winds of up to 80Â mph (130Â km/h) in Augusta, Maine. Throughout the state, the winds downed hundreds of trees, some of which damaged houses, wrecked cars, destroyed one building, or fell onto power lines. Fallen trees blocked highways, and one person was injured by a falling tree limb. Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services. The winds flattened hundreds of acres of corn in North Livermore, and throughout the state, there was heavy damage to the apple crop. Damage to the apple crop amounted to $1.7Â million. While moving west of Maine, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, including a report of 2.15Â inches (63Â mm) in 12Â hours. Along the coast, high waves damaged boats. In Maine, the hurricane killed three people, injured at least eight, and caused $10Â million in damage, the costliest natural disaster in the state's history. Carol lost this distinction 10Â days later when Hurricane Edna caused $15Â million in damage in the state.
