The leader of Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was unfriendly to the Congress, and did not see much future in India for him or the way of life he wished to lead. Alongside the leader of Jaisalmer, he went into exchanges with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the assigned head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was quick to pull in a portion of the bigger outskirt states, trusting accordingly to draw in other Rajput states to Pakistan and make up for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to allow Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to consent to Pakistan on any terms they picked, giving their rulers clear sheets of paper and requesting that they record their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer cannot, contending that it would be troublesome for him to agree with Muslims against Hindus in case of shared issues. Hanwant Singh verged on marking. Notwithstanding, the air in Jodhpur was by and large unfriendly to increase to Pakistan. Mountbatten additionally brought up that the promotion of a transcendently Hindu state to Pakistan would disregard the guideline of the two-country hypothesis on which Partition was based, and was probably going to cause public brutality in the State. Hanwant Singh was convinced by these contentions, and to some degree reluctantly consented to acquiesce to India.
