Plans called for Hubble to be adjusted in February 2005, yet the "Columbia" calamity in 2003, in which the orbiter broke down on reentry into the climate, had wide-running impacts on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe chose that all future transport missions must most likely achieve the place of refuge of the International Space Station ought to in-flight issues create. As no buses were equipped for achieving both HST and the ISS amid a similar mission, future maintained administration missions were dropped. This choice was pounced upon by various cosmologists, who felt that Hubble was sufficiently significant to justify the human hazard. HST's arranged successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to dispatch until no less than 2018. A hole in space-watching capacities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the charging of a successor was of real worry to numerous stargazers, given the critical logical effect of HST. The thought that JWST won't be situated in low Earth circle, and in this manner can't be effectively overhauled or fixed in case of an early disappointment, just makes these worries increasingly intense. Then again, numerous stargazers felt emphatically that the adjusting of Hubble ought not occur if the cost were to originate from the JWST spending plan.
