"Furious" and the fleet carriers and made another attempt to sink the "Tirpitz" on 17 July 1944, in Operation Mascot. For this attack the carrier embarked 880 Squadron with three Seafire L.IICs, 20 Grumman Hellcats of 1840 Squadron, Barracudas of 830 Squadron and three Swordfish of 842 Flight. The Barracudas, heavily loaded with bombs of up to , launched using a wooden ramp that was temporarily placed at the end of the flight deck, an early example of what was to be later named the ski-jump. The attack was unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences as a smokescreen covered the German battleship so that the Barracudas had to drop their bombs blindly through the smoke. Four more attacks on "Tirpitz" were made in August 1944 under the name of Operation Goodwood in a concerted effort to sink her. "Furious" carried twelve Seafire F.IIIs of 801 Squadron, another twelve Seafire L.IICs of 880 Squadron and nine Barracudas of 827 Squadron for this operation. The first attack on 20 August 1944 was recalled because of bad weather, but the attack on 22 August 1944 was spotted by the Germans and 11 aircraft were lost. Another attack was made two days later; one armour-piercing bomb penetrated "Tirpitz"s armoured deck but failed to detonate, and another bomb did only superficial damage. A fourth attack was made on 29 August, but inflicted no damage.
