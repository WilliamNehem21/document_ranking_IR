Alexander set out on his endeavor to vanquish the Persian Empire in the spring of 334ÃÂ BC, having appeased the warring Greek states and solidified his military may. Amid the main months of the Macedonian entry into Persian Asia Minor, Darius III Ã¢ÂÂ lord of Persia Ã¢ÂÂ to a great extent overlooked the nearness of Alexander's 40,000ÃÂ men. The Battle of the Granicus, battled in May, was Persia's first significant exertion to go up against the intruders, however brought about a simple triumph for Alexander. Throughout the following year, Alexander took the greater part of western and waterfront Asia Minor by constraining the capitulation of the satrapies in his way. He proceeded with inland, voyaging upper east through Phrygia before turning southeast toward Cilicia. In the wake of passing the Cilician Gates in October, Alexander was postponed by fever in Tarsus. Darius in the interim assembled a multitude of up to 100,000 (some old sources set overstated figures of more than 600,000) and by and by guided it over the eastern inclines of the Amanus Mountains. Toward the beginning of November, as Alexander continued about the Gulf of Issus from Mallus by means of Issus, the two armed forces accidentally passed each other on inverse sides of the mountains. This was emphatically further bolstering Darius' good fortune: presently at the back of Alexander, he had the capacity to counteract retreat and square the supply lines Alexander had built up at Issus. It was not until Alexander had digs in at Myriandrus, a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of Iskenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He promptly backtracked his course to the Pinarus River, only south of Issus, to discover Darius' power gathered along the northern bank. The Battle of Issus resulted.
