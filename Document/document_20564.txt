"Phantasmagoria" received mixed reviews. Vince Broady, executive editor of "Multimedia World", said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as "The 7th Guest." Dwight Silverman of the "Houston Chronicle" declared it the best game of the year, calling it a "masterwork" and "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. "Entertainment Weekly" gave it a B+ and called it "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of "The Salt Lake Tribune" called it "the most sophisticated computer game to date" and "a weird, wild, horrific ride that will make you jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced players, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual players than difficult games like "The 7th Guest".
