Lyrically, Jackson's album is said to exhibit a "politically driven feminist" message, as stated by Lilly Goren in "You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture" (2009). Musically, according to Rickey Vincent, author of "Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One" (1996), Jam and Lewis's collaboration with her is said to be one of the high points of the 1980s, as they redefined dance music by mixing a youthful sound with industrial-strength beats. As documented by musicologist Richard J. Ripani, author of "The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950â1999" (2006), "Control" is regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of rhythm and blues and the first album to bridge the gap between R&B and rap music. Its success in both the mainstream R&B and pop music charts "led to the incorporation of many of the stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development." Furthermore, the album's second single "Nasty" has been credited with influencing the new jack swing genre, pioneered by Teddy Riley. "The New Rolling Stone Album Guide" (2004) wrote that the album impacted popular music with a "blockbuster momentum all its own", while Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine noted "Control" "was every bit the hit machine that her brother's "Thriller" was." Steve Morse of "The Boston Globe" commented: "All things considered, 1986 was a stellar year for the black female vocalistâthe best, in fact, since the disco era of a decade backÂ ... Black music crossed over to the pop charts in dramatic fashion, with Whitney Houston, Patti LaBelle and Janet Jackson each having No. 1 albums."
