Their disillusioned season finished the same number of intellectuals had dreaded. In the Japanese Grand Prix toward the finish of lap 46, Senna made his turn at the Casio Chicane. Prost, transforming into the corner, transformed into his partner's way bringing about an impact and the autos sliding interlocked down the departure street. Prost, thinking the World Championship was finished, move out of his slowed down vehicle. To isolate the autos, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren in reverse onto the track. This left it in a perilous position, so they pushed it advances once more. As they did as such, Senna knock began the motor. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his vehicle was harmed and he needed to pit, however he rejoined just five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton cut past Nannini at the chicane to lead the pack and won the race. In any case, it was Nannini who showed up on the top advance of the platform, race authorities having avoided Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren claimed the choice, however the FIA Court of Appeal maintained the choice as well as fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended half year boycott. In this manner Prost secured his third driver's title in dubious conditions.
