KetÃ¨lbey wrote music in the style of the Gilbert and Sullivan works for a comic opera "The Wonder Worker", which was staged at the Grand Theatre, Fulham in 1900. The reviewer for the "London Evening Standard" thought KetÃ¨lbey's score was "attractive though conventionalÂ ... No originality is shown in conception or treatment, but the conception is appropriate, and the treatment effective." The same year KetÃ¨lbey began undertaking transcription work at the music publisher A. Hammond & Co, making arrangements of music for smaller orchestras. In 1904 he also began to work for a second music publisher, Chappell & Co, a third in 1907, the Columbia Graphophone Company, and a fourth in 1910, when he worked for Elkin & Co. McCanna considers that "this hack-work may have been tedious, but the experience was invaluable in moulding the composer's fluent writing for both piano and orchestra". Throughout the time working for the companies he continued to compose and publish his own work, comprising organ music, songs, duets, piano pieces and anthems. He worked for Columbia for over twenty years and rose to the position of Musical Director and Adviser, working with leading musicians across a range of musical styles; Columbia released more than 600 recordings with KetÃ¨lbey conducting.
