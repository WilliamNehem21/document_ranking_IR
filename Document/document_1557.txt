"Mother's Milk" includes a highly contrasting photo of the band spread over the arms of a proportionately bigger stripped lady. A rose disguises one of her areolas while Kiedis' standing body covers the other. There were initially two ladies whose photos were wanted to be utilized, one being Kiedis' better half Ione Skye and the other being model Dawn Alane; the last was eventually picked. Debate emerged, notwithstanding, when Dawn guaranteed the band did not tell her that she was the one picked to be on the front of "Mother's Milk". Moreover, a few mainstream stores would not sell the record since they trusted the female subject showed a lot of bareness. An all the more carefully controlled rendition was made for certain retailers that highlighted the band individuals in far bigger extent than the first. The front of the record was impacted by a limited time blurb Kiedis had from the 1960s of Sly and the Family Stone, in which frontman Sly Stone held a scaled down band in his palm. At the point when Kiedis was discovering shots of the band to use on the spread, Frusciante at first rejected each photo the vocalist demonstrated him however settled on one of him taking a seat giggling. "Mother's Milk" was joined with an "express language" cautioning sticker that, as indicated by Kiedis, "[D]oesn't trouble me. Our verses are extremely unequivocal, regardless of whether it's about sex or fellowship or love for life when all is said in done." The spread booklet of the record includes an artistic creation by Hillel Slovak. Following the collection's discharge, a set number of special blurbs were issued with the model's bosoms uncovered. First light had no information of the squeezing and sued the band, winning a $50,000 settlement.
