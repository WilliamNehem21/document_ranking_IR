Since a significant number of the essential records negate each other now and again, it is difficult to give a portrayal of the fight that is past debate. The main undisputed realities are that the battling started at 9ÃÂ am on Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the fight endured until nightfall. Nightfall upon the arrival of the fight was at 4:54ÃÂ pm, with the front line for the most part dim by 5:54ÃÂ pm and in full dimness by 6:24ÃÂ pm. Moonrise that night was not until 11:12ÃÂ pm, so once the sun set, there was minimal light on the war zone. William of JumiÃÂ¨ges reports that Duke William kept his military equipped and prepared against an unexpected night assault for the whole night prior. The fight occurred north of Hastings at the present-day town of Battle, between two hillsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Caldbec Hill toward the north and Telham Hill toward the south. The zone was vigorously lush, with a bog adjacent. The name generally given to the fight is unusualÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ there were a few settlements a lot nearer to the war zone than Hastings. The "Old English Saxon Chronicle" considered it the fight "at the ancient apple tree". Inside 40 years, the fight was depicted by the Anglo-Norman writer Orderic Vitalis as "Senlac", a Norman-French adjustment of the Old English word "Sandlacu", which signifies "sandy water". This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the front line. The fight was at that point being alluded to as "bellum Hasestingas" or "Skirmish of Hastings" by 1087, in the "Domesday Book".
