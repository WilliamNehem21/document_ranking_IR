Walter was not a heavenly man, despite the fact that he was, as John Gillingham, a student of history and biographer of Richard I, says, "a standout amongst the most remarkable government serves in English History". Hugh of Lincoln, a contemporary and later consecrated, is said to have approached pardoning of God for not having reproached Walter as frequently as he most likely ought to have. Present day students of history tend not to share the more seasoned view that Walter was the main thrust behind the authoritative changes amid Richard's rule, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all choices in the hands of his pastors, particularly Longchamp and Walter. The investigations of James Holt and others have demonstrated that Richard was very engaged with government choices, and that it was more an organization between the ruler and his priests. Walter was, be that as it may, imaginative in his way to deal with government. Walter kept on getting a charge out of the help of Richard's sibling John, and it was amid John's rule that some of Walter's regulatory changes occurred, albeit how much regal activity was behind the advancements is obscure, given John's enthusiasm for government and organization.
