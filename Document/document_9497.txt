Its fingers are thin, cushioned, for the most part deficient with regards to webbing, and semi-able with level, human-like nails. The thumb is both short and broadly isolated from different fingers. Notwithstanding being set at a correct edge to the palm, the thumb isn't opposable since the wad of the joint is fixed set up. Similarly as with all strepsirrhines, the hand is ectaxonic (the pivot goes through the fourth digit) instead of mesaxonic (the hub going through the third digit) as observed in monkeys and chimps. The fourth digit is the longest, and just marginally longer than the second digit. In like manner, the fifth digit is just marginally longer than the second. The palms are long and weathered, and like different primates, they have dermal edges to improve grasp. The feet are semi-digitigrade and more specific than the hands. The enormous toe is opposable and is littler than the huge toe of different lemurs, which are increasingly arboreal. The second toe is short, has a little terminal cushion, and has a latrine paw (some of the time alluded to as a "prepping paw") particular for individual preparing, explicitly to rake through hide that is inaccessible by the mouth. The latrine hook is an attribute shared among almost all living strepsirrhine primates. In contrast to different lemurs, the ring-followed lemur's heel isn't secured by hide.
