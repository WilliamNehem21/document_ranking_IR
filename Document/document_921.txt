Investigating the collection for "The New York Times" in 1976, Robert Palmer said it is defaced by extended lengths of "messy, one-harmony jams", incoherent sounds, and a hackneyed quality plainly rendered by the faultless Japanese designing. He grumbled that Davis' utilization of the wah-wah pedal restrained his capacity to express notes and that the septet sounded poor "by shake gauges", especially Cosey, whose overamplified guitar "whimpered and thundered like a boisterous machine shop" and consigned Lucas to foundation riffs. "Jazz Forum" commentator Andrzej Trzaskowski composed that Fortune appeared to be the main jazz performer on the record, discovering his performances regularly faultless while deriding the exhibitions of Davis, Lucas, and Cosey, whose guitar and synthesizer impacts he found absurdly fierce. As Trzaskowski would like to think, the individual sections did not connect all in all and were additionally hampered by the worn out "shake manner" of the guitarists, who he said needed mind, amicability, and taste. Jazz faultfinder Ian Carr thought Davis' trumpet sounded exhausted, down and out, and strange with the band's extraordinary rhythms and tediously loud guitars; all in all, he regarded the music "too non-Western in the feeling of a lot of cadence and insufficient structure". Gary Giddins wrote an irately cavalier audit of "Agharta" for "The Village Voice", in which he accused Davis of neglecting to declare his melodic nearness on the frightfully "tragic" record. A couple of days after it was distributed, he was sent a bundle brimming with expansive cotton swabs, mechanical quality scouring cushions, and a card that read, "whenever you survey Miles Davis wipe out your head."
