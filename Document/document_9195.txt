Like each of the three types of "Palaeopropithecus", "Archaeoindris" showed determined qualities not found in the two different less particular genera of sloth lemur. These qualities included collapsed sound-related bullae and combined distensions of bone around the nasal opening comprising of part of the premaxilla and the nasal bones. Its skull was more extensive than that of "Megaladapis", however shorter, estimating . Its face was shorter than that of "Palaeopropithecus", with its eyes coordinated further forward. The neurocranium (braincase) was little and raised in respect to the face, dissimilar to "Palaeopropithecus". Postorbital tightening (narrowing of the skull behind the eye attachments) is articulated. The skull additionally bore a low, expansive sagittal peak (an edge of bone on the highest point of the skull to which jaw muscles connect) and vigorous however littler nuchal peaks (edges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles join). Not at all like "Palaeopropithecus" the edges of the circles (eye attachments) were not as thick. The region of the circle was , tantamount to that of gorillas. In view of the proportion of its circle territory to the measure of its optic trench, "Archaeoindris" had low retinal summation, which means its eyes were less delicate to light (like living diurnal lemurs). However the proportion was not as low as in similarly estimated chimps, recommending "Archaeoindris" had low visual keenness and needed trichromatic shading vision.
