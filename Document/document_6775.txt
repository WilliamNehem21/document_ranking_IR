What is currently perceived as a solitary morphologically factor taxon named "Galerina marginata" was once part into five unmistakable species. Norwegian mycologist Gro Gulden and associates inferred that every one of the five spoke to similar species in the wake of contrasting the DNA arrangements of the inner deciphered spacer locale of ribosomal DNA for different North American and European examples in "Galerina" area "Naucoriopsis". The outcomes demonstrated no hereditary contrasts among "G.ÃÂ marginata" and "G.ÃÂ autumnalis", "G.ÃÂ oregonensis", "G.ÃÂ unicolor", and "G.ÃÂ venenata", therefore decreasing every one of these names to synonymy. The most established of these names are "Agaricus marginatus", depicted by August Batsch in 1789, and "Agaricus unicolor", portrayed by Martin Vahl in 1792. "Agaricus autumnalis" was depicted by Charles Horton Peck in 1873, and later moved to "Galerina" by A.ÃÂ H.ÃÂ Smith and Rolf Singer in their 1962 overall monograph on that family. In a similar distribution they additionally presented the "G.ÃÂ autumnalis" assortments "robusta" and "angusticystis". One more of the synonymous species, "G.ÃÂ oregonensis", was first portrayed in that monograph. "Galerina venenata" was first distinguished as an animal types by Smith in 1953. Since "Agaricus marginatus" is the most seasoned truly distributed name, it has need as indicated by the guidelines of herbal classification.
