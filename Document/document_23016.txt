The year 1877 was significant for FaurÃ©, both professionally and personally. In January his first violin sonata was performed at a SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale concert with great success, marking a turning-point in his composing career at the age of 31. Nectoux counts the work as the composer's first great masterpiece. In March, Saint-SaÃ«ns retired from the Madeleine, succeeded as organist by ThÃ©odore Dubois, his choirmaster; FaurÃ© was appointed to take over from Dubois. In July FaurÃ© became engaged to Pauline Viardot's daughter Marianne, with whom he was deeply in love. To his great sorrow, she broke off the engagement in November 1877, for reasons that are not clear. To distract FaurÃ©, Saint-SaÃ«ns took him to Weimar and introduced him to Franz Liszt. This visit gave FaurÃ© a liking for foreign travel, which he indulged for the rest of his life. From 1878, he and Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw "Das Rheingold" and "Die WalkÃ¼re" at the Cologne Opera; the complete "Ring" cycle at the Hofoper in Munich and at Her Majesty's Theatre in London; and "Die Meistersinger" in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw "Parsifal". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent "Souvenirs de Bayreuth". This short, up-tempo piano work for four hands sends up themes from "The Ring". FaurÃ© admired Wagner and had a detailed knowledge of his music, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.
