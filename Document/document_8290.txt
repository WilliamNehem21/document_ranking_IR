The skull of "Baryonyx" is not entirely known, and a great part of the center and rear bits are not protected. The full length of the skull is assessed to have been for some time, in light of examination with that of the related sort "Suchomimus" (which was 20% bigger). It was lengthened, and the front 170ÃÂ mm (6.6ÃÂ in) of the premaxillae framed a long, thin, and low nose (platform) with an easily adjusted upper surface. The (hard nostrils) were long, low, and put far once again from the nose tip. The front 130ÃÂ mm (5.1ÃÂ in) of the nose ventured into a spatulate (spoon-like), "terminal rosette", a shape like the platform of the cutting edge gharial. The front 70ÃÂ mm (2.7ÃÂ in) of the lower edge of the premaxillae was downturned (or snared), while that of the front part of the maxillae was upturned. This morphology brought about a sigmoid or S formed edge of the lower upper tooth push, in which the teeth from the front of the maxilla were anticipating forward. The nose was especially thin legitimately behind the rosette; this region got the expansive teeth of the mandible. The maxilla and premaxilla of "Baryonyx" fit together in a mind boggling verbalization, and the subsequent hole between the upper and lower jaw is known as the . A downturned premaxilla and a sigmoid lower edge of the upper tooth push was likewise present in indirectly related theropods, for example, "Dilophosaurus". The nose had broad pits (which would have been exits for veins and nerves), and the maxilla seems to have housed sinuses.
