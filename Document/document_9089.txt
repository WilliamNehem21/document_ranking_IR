"Pobeda" struck a mine amid the squadron's fight on 13 April and stayed under fix for right around two months. The two boats had a portion of their enemy of torpedoboat weapons and optional combat hardware evacuated amid the mid year to support the protections of the port. They took an interest in the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904; "Pobeda" was just gently harmed by 11 substantial gauge hits, yet "Peresvet", hit multiple times, endured a lot of flooding. More weapons were arrived after the squadron's arrival to Port Arthur, yet the Imperial Japanese Army caught the slopes sitting above the harbor in November, and this permitted Japanese attack firearms to shoot legitimately at the Russian boats. "Pobeda" and "Peresvet" were hit ordinarily, and "Pobeda" sank on 7 December 1904 from the aggregated harm. "Peresvet" was left in shallow water around the same time.
