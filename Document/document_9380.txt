After the war, those near Ravel perceived that he had lost a lot of his physical and mental stamina. As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, "Ravel's passionate harmony, so hard won in the earlier decade, had been genuinely traded off". His yield, never substantial, decreased. In any case, after the demise of Debussy in 1918, he was for the most part observed, in France and abroad, as the main French writer of the time. FaurÃÂ© kept in touch with him, "I am more joyful than you can envision about the strong position which you involve and which you have obtained so splendidly thus quickly. It is a wellspring of delight and pride for your old teacher." Ravel was offered the Legion of Honor in 1920, and in spite of the fact that he declined the embellishment, he was seen by the new age of authors embodied by Satie's protÃÂ©gÃÂ©s Les Six as a foundation figure. Satie had betrayed him, and remarked, "Ravel declines the LÃÂ©gion d'honneur, however the entirety of his music acknowledges it." Despite this assault, Ravel kept on appreciating Satie's initial music, and constantly recognized the more seasoned man's impact individually advancement. Ravel took a generous perspective on Les Six, advancing their music, and safeguarding it against journalistic assaults. He respected their response against his functions as common, and desirable over their duplicating his style. Through the SociÃÂ©tÃÂ© Musicale IndÃÂ©pendente, he had the capacity to energize them and writers from different nations. The SociÃÂ©tÃÂ© displayed shows of late works by American arrangers including Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English associates Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott.
