In the early 1950s "Greed"s reputation began to grow and it appeared on several lists of the greatest films ever made. In 1952 at the "Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux Arts de Belgique", "Greed" was named the fifth greatest film ever made, with such directors as Luchino Visconti, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder voting for it. Later in 1952 "Sight and Sound" magazine published its first list of the "ten greatest films ever made". "Greed" was tied for 7th place on that list, with such critics as Andre Bazin, Lotte Eisner, Curtis Harrington, Penelope Houston and Gavin Lambert voting for it. In 1962 it was tied for 4th on the same list. Since 1972 it has failed to reach a spot on the top ten. The "CinÃ©mathÃ¨que royale de Belgique" released a list of "the most important and misappreciated American films of all time" in 1978. "Greed" was third on its list after "Citizen Kane" and "". In a University of Southern California list of the "50 Most Significant American Films" made by the school's Performing Arts Council, "Greed" was listed as number 21. In 1991 "Greed" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
