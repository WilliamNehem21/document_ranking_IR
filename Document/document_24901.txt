Prominent Swedish entomologist Carl StÃ¥l named the genus "Abricta" in 1866, and it was either treated as a subgenus of the genus "Tibicen" or a genus in its own right. Thus it became known as "Tibicen curvicostus", and "Abricta curvicosta" from 1906. French entomologist Jean Baptiste Boisduval described two specimens collected from Port Jackson as "Cicada tephrogaster" (later "Tibicen tephrogaster") in 1835; this has long been considered a junior synonym. However, a review of the genus in 2003 showed "Abricta" to be a disparate group of species, and the Australian members were moved to other genera. Max Moulds conducted a morphological analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region. Of the 15Â Australian species, the floury baker was the earliest offshoot. Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14Â species, and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus "Aleeta", while most of the others were placed in the genus "Tryella". The morphological distinction between "Aleeta" and "Tryella" is based on two factors: "A.Â curvicosta" has a larger forewing sizeÂ â rarely less than 3.2Â cm (1.3Â in) and usually over 4Â cm (1.6Â in), whereas "Tryella" is never above 3.2Â cm (1.3Â in); the uncal lobes of "Aleeta"'s distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends, whereas those of "Tryella" are upturned. The name "Aleeta" is derived from the Greek "aleton" meaning flour or meal.
