Morard de Galles intended to cruise his armada from the French maritime fortification of Brest under front of haziness the evening of 15Ã¢ÂÂ 16ÃÂ December. The British Channel Fleet typically kept up a squadron off Brest to bar the port, however its administrator, Rear-Admiral John Colpoys, had pulled back his power from its standard station seaward to northwest of Brest in view of extreme Atlantic winter storms. The main British ships inside sight of Brest were an inshore squadron of frigates under Sir Edward Pellew in , joined by , and the lugger HMS "Duke of York". Pellew was at that point prestigious, having been the primary British officer of the war to catch a French frigate: the "ClÃÂ©opÃÂ¢tre" at the Action of 18 June 1793. He later caught the frigates "Pomone" and "Virginie" in 1794 and 1796, and spared 500ÃÂ lives after the wreck of the East Indiaman "Dutton" in January 1796. For these activities he had first been knighted and afterward raised to a baronetcy. "Relentless" was a razee, one of the biggest frigates in the Royal Navy, initially built as a 64-weapon trashy rate and chop down to 44 firearms in 1795 to make the ship quick and sufficiently amazing to catch and battle the biggest of French frigates. Furnished with 24-pounder gun on the fundamental decks and 42-pounder carronades on the quarter deck, she had a more grounded weapon than any identical French frigate.
