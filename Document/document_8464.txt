By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de BÃÂ©xar. Stephen F. Austin sent a development scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to watch the Mexican powers. While taking shelter at Mission ConcepciÃÂ³n on October 28, they repulsed an assault by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea amid the fight. Austin kept on sending troops to BÃÂ©xar. Bowie was requested on November 26 to assault a Mexican supply train asserted to convey a finance. The subsequent encounter wound up known as the Grass Fight, after it was found that the main payload was grass to encourage the steeds. At the point when Austin was chosen to join Branch T. Bowman and William H. Wharton on a discretionary mission to look for global acknowledgment and backing, Edward Burleson was named as authority. On December 5, James C. Neill started diverting Cos by terminating cannons legitimately at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson drove a few hundred volunteers in an unexpected assault. The battling at the Siege of BÃÂ©xar proceeded until December 9 when Cos sent word he needed to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, yet would later join with Santa Anna's powers.
