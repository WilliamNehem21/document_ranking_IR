"B.ÃÂ brownii" has been evaluated as having an exceptionally high danger of annihilation. It is evaluated that without defensive measures set up, it would be wiped out inside 10 years; and that eradication would be "a catastrophe in itself as well as may have unanticipated, and conceivably heartbreaking, ramifications for the working of the vegetation networks of which plume leaved banksia is an essential part." The species has not yet been formally surveyed for the IUCN Red List, however warrants a "Basically Endangered (CR)" positioning since populaces are anticipated to decay by over 80% inside the following three ages. It is right now recorded as "Imperiled" under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and "Uncommon" under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These demonstrations give authoritative insurance against a scope of potential dangers, including business gathering of blooms and land clearing. Further statutory assurance is managed by the way that populaces happen inside the Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket undermined biological network, which is recorded as "Imperiled" under the EPBC Act, and the Montane Mallee Thicket of the Stirling Range compromised environment network, which has been evaluated as "Jeopardized" by the Western Australian government; and by the nearness of northern populace inside the Stirling Range National Park.
