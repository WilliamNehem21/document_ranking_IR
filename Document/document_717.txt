Subsequently, his underlying impression of the gathering was that of an amusing live act who were in fact skilled just by the norms of other unsophisticated New York groups. "The Dolls weren't out to extend any melodic skylines", said Rundgren, in spite of the fact that he making the most of Thunders' "frame of mind" and Johansen's appealling tricks in front of an audience. Johansen alluded to Rundgren as "a specialist on below average shake 'n' roll", yet in addition said the band was "somewhat persona non grata, at the time, with generally makers. They feared us, I don't have the foggiest idea why, yet Todd wasn't. We as a whole loved him from Max'sÃÂ ... Todd was cool and he was a maker." Sylvain, then again, felt the choice to enroll him depended on accessibility, time, and cash: "It was certainly not an extensive rundown. Todd was in New York and appeared as though he could deal with the pace." Upon being procured, Rundgren pronounced that "the main individual who can deliver a New York record is somebody who lives in New York".
