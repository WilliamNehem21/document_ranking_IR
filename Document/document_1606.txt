Koechlin featured in Shonali Bose's dramatization "Margarita with a Straw", playing Laila, a young lady with cerebral paralysis who abandons her home in India to consider in New York City, surprisingly becomes hopelessly enamored, and sets out on a voyage of self-revelation. Her character was roused by Malini Chib, Bose's cousin. Bose previously drew nearer Koechlin, who she said was her "sole decision", for the job when the last was shooting for "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewaani". Because of the conflicting calendar Bose proceeded to try out different on-screen characters to substitute Koechlin, yet felt that "something was absent" in every one, and she in the end chose to push the recording for three months to suit her. In a meeting with the "Seasons of India", Koechlin recognized that the job was the most testing of her movie profession, and she took a half year off her recording calendar to get ready for it. She experienced a six-week preparing workshop with performing artist Adil Hussain. The workshop went for making her "non-verbal communication appear to be regular", while likewise concentrating on the discourse example of patients with cerebral paralysis. Koechlin invested significant energy with Chib and her physiotherapist and language instructor. She likewise went to a month-long workshop in Delhi, where she took a shot at the development of the body parts. In spite of the fact that the film covers parts of physical handicap, Koechlin named it "a romcom with certain obstacles".
