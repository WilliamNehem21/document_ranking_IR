The "Rokeby Venus" was for some time held to be one of VelÃÂ¡zquez's last works. In 1951, it was discovered recorded in a stock of 1 June 1651 from the accumulation of Gaspar MÃÂ©ndez de Haro, seventh Marquis of Carpio, a nearby partner of Philip IV of Spain. Haro was the extraordinary nephew of VelÃÂ¡zquez's first benefactor, the Count-Duke of Olivares, and a famous profligate. As per the craftsmanship student of history Dawson Carr, Haro "cherished artworks nearly as much as he adored ladies", and "even his panegyrists deplored his unreasonable preference for lower-class ladies amid his childhood". Therefore it appeared to be likely that he would have authorized the work of art. In any case, in 2001 the workmanship student of history ÃÂngel Aterido found that the artistic creation had first had a place with the Madrid craftsmanship seller and painter Domingo Guerra Coronel, and was sold to Haro in 1652 after Coronel's demise the earlier year. Coronel's responsibility for painting brings up various issues: how and when it came into Coronel's ownership, and why VelÃÂ¡zquez's name was overlooked from Coronel's stock. The workmanship commentator Javier PortÃÂºs has recommended that the oversight may have been because of the artistic creation's depiction of a female bare, "a kind of work which was painstakingly administered and whose spread was viewed as tricky".
