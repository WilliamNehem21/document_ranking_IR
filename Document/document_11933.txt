After World War II, Haflinger rearing projects nearly crumbled as the military quit purchasing steeds and government-run reproducing focuses were shut. Reproducers kept on underlining those highlights important for pack ponies (the biggest use by the military), yet dismissed other key Haflinger qualities. Haflinger reproducing needed to change to make a pony that better fit current patterns toward recreational use. Around this time, all little breed cooperatives were joined into the Haflinger Breeders' Association of Tyrol. Post-World War II Tyrol, including the reproducing focus at Zams, was under the control of American powers, who butchered numerous steeds to give meat to emergency clinics. Be that as it may, the troops allowed the reproducing chief to pick 30 stallions to be kept for rearing purposes. Those ponies were moved to the French-involved Kops Alm high field in Vorarlberg, yet they were in this manner stolen and gone forever. In different regions of Tyrol, every one of the one-to three-year-old colts had been demanded by military rearing focuses, and along these lines it was important to treat colts not by any means a year old as potential reproducing stallions. In the years after World War II, a few onlookers expected that the breed was ceasing to exist as a result of unpredictable intersection with different breeds.
