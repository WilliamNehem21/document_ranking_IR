Giuseppe Bassan â a frequent Argento collaborator â was the film's production designer. The surroundings are given a bleached, "merciless" look, made from marble and stone faÃ§ades, shiny metallic sculptures, with steel, water and glass surfaces. Some of the homes â specifically those of the lesbian couple and the first killer â are "cold, austere, brutalist" slabs of granite, and many of the interior shots feature plain white backgrounds, with characters' wearing pale-coloured clothes against them â better, Newman felt, to contrast the blood once the violence started. The studio-set scenes were filmed at Elios Studios in Rome, unlike Argento's previous films in the city, which he had filmed at Incir De Paolis. He was not able to use Elios, as the director Michelangelo Antonioni, of whom he was a huge fan, was using the studio to film "Identification of a Woman" (1982) at the time. The design and creation of "Tenebrae"s special effects were supervised by Giovanni Corridori, who â with his brother Tonino â had a near-monopoly on special effects in the Italian film industry at the time. The scene in which Jane is hacked to death after having her arm cut off was filmed about eight times. Argento was not satisfied with any of the takes he had, which used a type of bicycle pump to spray fake blood from the "wound" across the white wall, so the director had Corridori place an explosive squib in the prosthetic arm â a solution which apparently satisfied Argento.
