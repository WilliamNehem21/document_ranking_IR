To address worries about past races, amid which onlookers swarming excessively near the track had been murdered or harmed via vehicles, the ACF raised of palisade fencing around the circuit, thought around towns and towns, and at the finishes of paths, pathways and streets converging the track. The planking used to keep away from the towns of Saint-Calais and Vibraye was introduced as an option in contrast to the framework utilized in the Gordon Bennett races, where vehicles going through towns would back off to a set speed and were illegal to overwhelm. A few footbridges were raised over the track, and a 2,000-situate canopied show off was worked toward the begin and end goal at Montfort. This confronted the pit path on the opposite side of the track, where the groups were put together and could work with respect to the vehicles. A passage under the track associated the show off and the pit path. The street surface was minimal more than compacted residue and sharp stones which could be effectively kicked up by the autos, and to restrain the subsequent issue of impeded perceivability and punctures the ACF fixed the whole length of the track with tar. More was added to the twists of the track after vehicles running on them amid training separated the surface.
