Edward VI turned out to be genuinely sick from tuberculosis and the councilors were informed that he didn't have long to live. In May 1553, the gathering sent a few letters to Continental reformers guaranteeing them that Edward's wellbeing was improving. Among the letters was one routed to Melanchthon welcoming him to come to England to take up the Regius Chair in Cambridge which was empty since the passing of Martin Bucer in February 1551. Both Henry VIII and Cranmer had recently neglected to persuade Melanchthon to come; this time the gathering attempted by sending him a development to cover his movement costs. Cranmer sent an individual letter asking him to take the offer. Regardless of his supplication, Melanchthon never made the voyage to England. While this push to shore up the transformation was occurring, the gathering was attempting to persuade a few judges to put on the royal position Lady Jane Gray, Edward's cousin and a Protestant, rather than Mary, Henry and Catherine of Aragon's little girl and a Catholic. On 17 June 1553 the ruler influenced his will to noticing Jane would succeed him, negating the Third Succession Act. Cranmer endeavored to address Edward alone, yet he was can't and his group of onlookers with Edward happened within the sight of the councilors. Edward revealed to him that he bolstered what he wrote in his will. Cranmer's choice to help Jane more likely than not happened before 19 June when illustrious requests were sent to gather the Convocation for the acknowledgment of the new progression.
