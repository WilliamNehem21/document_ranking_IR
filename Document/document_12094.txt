In "New York Times Co. v. US" 403 U.S. 713 (1971)Ã¢ÂÂ otherwise called the Pentagon Papers caseÃ¢ÂÂthe administration had tried to keep the distribution of grouped material by "The New York Times". For this situation, the Supreme Court decided 6Ã¢ÂÂ 3 that the legislature had not achieved the standard required by "Close" to legitimize earlier limitation, however the agreeing judges gave varying feelings about where the line ought to be drawn. As he would see it, Justice Potter Stewart composed that while production of "The Pentagon Papers" would probably hurt the national intrigue, it would not result in "immediate, prompt or hopeless damage to our Nation or its kin". Inability to give a reasonable line definitely implied that the court needed to manage earlier limitation on a case-by-case premise. In "Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart", 427 U.S. 539 (1976), the court was called upon to choose whether news reportage of an offensive mass homicide case in a community in Nebraska would legitimize earlier restriction so as to secure the respondent's entitlement to a reasonable preliminary. For this situation, the court decided consistently that it would not. The greater part of the judges saw "Close" as giving the main grounds to earlier restriction, and declined to extend its degree any further.
