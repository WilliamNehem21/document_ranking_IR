The development of a changeless structure for the Memorial was postponed by the Great Depression. In January 1924 the Commonwealth Government's Cabinet endorsed a proposition to develop the War Memorial at the foot of Mount Ainslie in Canberra. A compositional challenge was along these lines held, and Treloar was in charge of choosing the last plans to be considered after the passing judgment on board had decreased the quantity of sections from 69 to 29. None of these structures met all the fundamental criteria, however two of the engineers in charge of very put plans consented to team up to deliver a last plan. Plans for the Memorial building were endorsed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1928, however assets for development work were not accessible because of the effect of the Great Depression. Work at long last started on the structure in 1933, and it was finished in 1941. Until 1935, Treloar and the Memorial's regulatory staff were situated in Melbourne while the gathering was part among Sydney and Melbourne. In that year, Treloar, alongside 24 other Memorial staff, moved into the uncompleted structure in Canberra and the Memorial in Sydney was shut to empower the accumulation to be migrated.
