John Kricfalusi, the creator of "The Ren & Stimpy Show", claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, "Nutty the Friendly Dump", which was part of a cartoon book series viewable online. Kricfalusi even confirmed that he pitched the idea for an animated series of "Nutty the Friendly Dump" to Comedy Central, who turned it down. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, "I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!'Â ... This idea of [feces] singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea." Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of "South Park" were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company SpÃ¼mcÃ¸ was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with "Nutty the Friendly Dump" and that the claim was "ludicrous". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of "Ren & Stimpy", which he said he did not enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying. Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the "South Park" creators: "He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, I see how it could just be a coincidence, but you should just admit to the press that you're a big "Ren and Stimpy" fan.' â I'm not a "Ren and Stimpy" fan."
