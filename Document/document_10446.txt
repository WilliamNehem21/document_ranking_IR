The oligarchs, driven by Critias, one of the "regulators" and a previous outcast, called a Spartan battalion to guarantee their security and afterward started a rule of fear, executing any men who they thought may have adequate activity or a sufficiently substantial after to viably challenge them. It was this crusade previously drove a wedge among Theramenes and the pioneers of the Thirty; at first a supporter of Critias, Theramenes now contended that it was superfluous to execute men who had appeared indication of wishing the government hurt since they had been prevalent under the majority rule government. This challenge, notwithstanding, neglected to moderate the pace of the executions, so Theramenes next contended that, if the theocracy was to oversee by power, it should at any rate extend its base; dreadful that Theramenes may lead a mainstream development against them, Critias and the pioneers of the Thirty issued a rundown of 3,000 men who might be relates in the new government. At the point when Theramenes again questioned that this number was still excessively little, the pioneers organized a military audit to be arranged after which the residents were requested to heap their arms; with the assistance of the Spartan army, the oligarchs then reallocated all arms aside from those having a place with the 3,000.
