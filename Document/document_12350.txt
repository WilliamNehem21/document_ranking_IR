"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" has been depicted as one of the exemplary scenes of "South Park". Chris Vognar of "The Dallas Morning News" portrayed Mr. Hankey himself as "the most unbelievable character yet on TV's most ludicrous show". Charlie Patton of "The Florida Times-Union" said the scene was "rough, awful, disrespectful and by and large hostileÃ¢ÂÂlikewise amazingly clever". He likewise said of the Mr. Hankey character, "In case you're the kind of individual who couldn't have cared less for that scene in "Trainspotting" where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the can and into the sewer in quest for his lost suppository, the entire Mr. Hankey subplot will be profoundly irritating." Doug Pratt, a DVD commentator and "Moving Stone" donor, stated, "In fact, the Christmas scene likely could be the show's best exertion, creatively, on the grounds that it handles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and furthermore has a fascinating mental subtext: does the legend really observe Mr. Hankey, or does he have some genuine mental issues?" Diane Werts of "Newsday" said of the scene, "It's gross. It's yucky. It's most likely hostile. It's likewise potentially the most entertaining occasion scene anyone's airing this year." Werts especially applauded the melody "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, creator of "Paying attention to South Park", stated, "This scene ostensibly pushes the limits of what is adequate, both for Christmas specials and TV all in all, more remote than any past one." Weinstock said this was especially valid for the scene's phony real life business.
