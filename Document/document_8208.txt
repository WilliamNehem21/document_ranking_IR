Mycena aurantiomarginata, ordinarily known as the brilliant edge hood, is a types of agaric growth in the family Mycenaceae. First formally portrayed in 1803, it was given its present name in 1872. Generally circulated, usually in Europe and North America, and has likewise been gathered in North Africa, Central America, and Japan. The organism is saprobic, and produces natural product bodies (mushrooms) that develop on the floor of coniferous woodlands. The mushrooms have a chime formed to funnel shaped top up to in distance across, set on a thin stipe up to long with yellow to orange hairs at the base. The organism is named after its trademark brilliant orange gill edges. A tiny trademark is the club-molded cystidia that are secured with various spiky projections, looking like a mace. The edibility of the mushroom has not been resolved. "M.ÃÂ aurantiomarginata" can be recognized from comparable "Mycena" species by contrasts in size, shading, and substrate. A 2010 production announced the revelation and portrayal of a novel shade named mycenaaurinÃÂ A, detached from the mushroom. The shade is in charge of its shading, and it has anti-microbial movement that may capacity to keep certain microscopic organisms from developing on the mushroom.
