Harald turned into the first of the two Bohr siblings to gain a graduate degree, which he earned for arithmetic in April 1909. Niels took an additional nine months to procure his. Understudies needed to present a theory regarding a matter doled out by their director. Bohr's chief was Christiansen, and the theme he picked was the electron hypothesis of metals. Bohr in this way expounded his lord's proposition into his a lot bigger Doctor of Philosophy (dr. phil.) proposal. He overviewed the writing regarding the matter, settling on a model proposed by Paul Drude and explained by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to carry on like a gas. Bohr broadened Lorentz's model, however was as yet unfit to represent wonders like the Hall impact, and inferred that electron hypothesis couldn't completely clarify the attractive properties of metals. The postulation was acknowledged in April 1911, and Bohr led his formal resistance on 13 May. Harald had gotten his doctorate the earlier year. Bohr's proposition was pivotal, yet pulled in little enthusiasm outside Scandinavia since it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University prerequisite at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would freely get a hypothesis from Bohr's proposition that is today known as the BohrÃ¢ÂÂ van Leeuwen hypothesis.
