Bizet's third envoi was deferred for almost a year by the delayed disease and demise, in September 1861, of his mom. He in the long run presented a trio of instrumental works: a suggestion entitled "La Chasse d'Ossian", a scherzo and a burial service walk. The suggestion has been lost; the scherzo was later retained into the "Roma" orchestra, and the memorial service walk music was adjusted and utilized in a later musical drama. Bizet's fourth and last envoi, which involved him for a lot of 1862, was a one-demonstration musical drama, "La guzla de l'ÃÂ©mir". As a state-financed theater, the OpÃÂ©ra-Comique was obliged now and again to arrange crafted by Prix de Rome laureates, and "La guzla" properly went into practice in 1863. Be that as it may, in April Bizet got an offer, which began from Count Walewski, to form the music for a three-demonstration musical drama. This was "Les pÃÂªcheurs de perles", in light of a lyrics by Michel CarrÃÂ© and EugÃÂ¨ne Cormon. Since a state of this offer was that the musical show ought to be the arranger's first freely organized work, Bizet briskly pulled back "La guzla" from generation and consolidated pieces of its music into the new musical drama. The primary execution of "Les pÃÂªcheurs de perles", by the ThÃÂ©ÃÂ¢tre Lyrique organization, was on 30 September 1863. Basic sentiment was commonly threatening, however Berlioz adulated the work, composing that it "does M. Bizet the best respect". Open response was tepid, and the musical drama's pursued finished 18 exhibitions. It was not performed again until 1886.
