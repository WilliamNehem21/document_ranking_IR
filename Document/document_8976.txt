The main Test started at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 1932, and was played in a strained and warmed air. Bradman, whose uneasiness and poor structure against the sightseers' bowling in the preliminary amusements had progressed toward becoming wellsprings of nervousness, was kept from playing by sickness. Britain won by 10 wickets; Larwood's match figures were 10 for 124, with just restricted utilization of quick leg hypothesis. The match's best batsman was Australia's Stan McCabe, who scored 187 in his side's first innings, assaulting both the standard and leg hypothesis assaults in a "passing or wonder" approach. Amid the match Hugh Buggy, a journalist for the "Melbourne Herald", utilized "bodyline" to portray the English leg hypothesis bowling. The term was soon all around embraced in Australia, however English sources kept on alluding to "leg hypothesis". The second Test, at Melbourne starting 30 December, was played on a much slower pitch that blunted the English pace assault. Larwood was additionally impeded by agonies from sore feet, brought about by another pair of boots. Bradman came back to the Australian side and scored a century, controlling his group to triumph by 111 runs; his prosperity drove numerous pundits to assume that quick leg hypothesis would thus demonstrate inadequate. The arrangement was tied 1Ã¢ÂÂ 1 and, in the expressions of the essayist antiquarian Ronald Blythe, "everything was sweetness and light".
