In 1911, H. L. Mencken stated: "No other comic musical show at any point composed Ã¢ÂÂ no other stage play, undoubtedly, of any kind Ã¢ÂÂ was ever so popular.ÃÂ ... "Pinafore"ÃÂ ... has been given, and with incredible achievement, wherever there are theaters Ã¢ÂÂ from Moscow to Buenos Aires, from Cape Town to Shanghai; in Madrid, Ottawa and Melbourne; even in Paris, Rome, Vienna and Berlin." After the passings of Gilbert and Sullivan, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company held select rights to play out their musical dramas in Great Britain until 1962, visiting all through Britain for the greater part of the year and, starting in 1919, regularly performing in London for a period of around four months. "The Times" gave the organization's 1920 London generation an eager audit, saying that the group of onlookers was "delighted", and lamenting that "Pinafore" would be played for just two weeks. It lauded the cast, singling out Leo Sheffield as the Captain, Henry Lytton as Sir Joseph, Elsie Griffin as Josephine, James Hay as Ralph, Bertha Lewis as meager Buttercup and the "mind blowing" choral tone. It reasoned that the musical show made a "romping peak to the season". After two years, it gave a much all the more gleaming report of that season's exhibitions, calling Derek Oldham a "perfect saint" as Ralph, taking note of that Sydney Granville "reasonably cut down the house" with his melody, that Darrell Fancourt's Deadeye was "a splendidly continued bit of personification" and that it was an "incredible delight" to hear the returning principals. A 1961 audit of the organization's "Pinafore" is much the equivalent.
