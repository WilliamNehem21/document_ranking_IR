"B. aemula" is most commonly found in deep sandy soils, either on dunes or flattish areas which may be seasonally wet. On coastal dunes in southern Queensland, it replaces "Banksia serrata", which occupies the same niche to the south. The latter areas, with open woodland or heathland, are known as wallum. In Queensland it is found with "Banksia robur", with the latter species found in flatter wetter areas and "B.aemula" found on rises. It is also found with "Banksia oblongifolia" in Queensland. In some areas of wallum, it may grow as a small tree, along with mallee forms of the red bloodwood ("Corymbia gummifera"). In Cooloola National Park, it is an occasional emergent plant (along with "Melaleuca quinquenervia" and "Eucalyptus umbra") in closed graminoid heathland, a community of shrubs high containing "Xanthorrhoea fulva", "Empodisma minus", "Petrophile shirleyae", and "Hakea" and "Leptospermum" species. On the New South Wales Central Coast, it generally grows as a high shrub and is a canopy component of "Banksia aemula" open heathland, located on coastal headlands on highly leached Pleistocene white sands overlying Triassic and Permian strata. Areas include Wybung Head in Munmorah State Conservation Area, and near Myall Lakes. Other plants it grows in association with include "Ricinocarpos pinifolius", "Brachyloma daphnoides", "Dillwynia glaberrima", "D. retorta", "Allocasuarina distyla", "Bossiaea ensata", "Aotus ericoides", "Phyllota phylicoides", and "Empodisma minus". Sandmining has eradicated much of the community around Redhead. In less leached yellower sands, the community (and "B.aemula") is replaced by a taller heath containing "B.serrata" and "B.oblongifolia".
