The last form of Valve's high-dynamic-run innovation includes countless impacts to the motor, went for influencing the diversion to seem increasingly sensible. Sprout shading was presented, obscuring splendid edges in the diversion world and imitating a camera's overexposure to light. This is joined with presentation control to tailor the impact to speak to the human eye. For instance, as the player leaves a dim region into a light territory, the new region is at first extremely splendid, however rapidly obscures, speaking to the change of the player character's eyes to the light. New 3D shape mapping methods permit the reflection thrown by an item to compare with the splendor of the light source, and lightmaps empower light ricocheting and worldwide enlightenment to be considered in the rendering. Refraction impacts were added to make light record for the physical qualities of an article and to copy the manner in which light is reflected by water. The "Lost Coast" level is explicitly intended to exhibit these impacts. It utilizes the ocean and shoreline as chances to exhibit water-based impacts, the religious community to show sprout from its whitewash dividers, and the haven to give the way to indicate refraction through recolored glass windows and 3D shape maps on brilliant urns and candles.
