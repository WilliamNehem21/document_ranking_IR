Howard's grandma, Jannie Mae Howard, was the little girl of tenant farmers from Belzoni, Mississippi. She had four little girls by her nineteenth birthday celebration, including Howard's mom Helena. Helena was a representative at a Chicago eatery when she wound up pregnant with Juwan. Howard's dad, Leroy Watson, had quite recently come back from the Army to a telephone organization work in Chicago. The two wedded rapidly once they understood Helena was pregnant. For Howard's first seven day stretch of life, his secondary school junior mother kept him in a cabinet at Jannie Mae's home. Helena, who was 17 years of age, did not have any desire to be confined or loaded bringing up her youngster, so Jannie Mae embraced him. His natural dad, Leroy Watson Jr., needed to name him Leroy Watson, III, however his grandma dismissed the recommendation, demanding Juwan Antonio Howard. In spite of the fact that his mom visited every so often as he was growing up, his grandma raised him, alongside two cousins. Howard has no kin and isn't near his organic guardians; his grandma was the essential impact in his life. He moved with her to a few low-salary Chicago South Side ventures; she kept him out of inconvenience and far from posses as he was growing up. One of their living arrangements was a three-room loft on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago. As he bloomed under his grandma's impact and order, he turned into her "pride and satisfaction".
