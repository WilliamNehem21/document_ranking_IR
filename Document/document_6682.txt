The choice to nationalize AESC and create Leigh Creek ended up being farsighted. In mid 1947, mines in New South Wales were again disabled by strikes. The most exceedingly awful strike came in 1949, compelling Chifley to send in the military to extricate coal. While different states needed to endure mechanical power proportioning and along these lines diminished assembling yield and greater joblessness, South Australia figured out how to escape as the excavators at Leigh Creek worked nonstop. Inside four years the mine was working at a surplus and the town was additionally remunerated with government financing. From 1947 until the finish of Playford's administration in 1965, the yield of the mine expanded ten times to right around two million tons every year. Transport framework was improved, European foreigner laborers were selected, and twin power plants at Port Augusta were finished in 1960 and named after the head. The new plants solely utilized Leigh Creek coal and by 1970, the entire state was independent for power. ETSA and the mine were creating enough income to keep up the townÃ¢ÂÂhere and there named Uncle Tom's BabyÃ¢ÂÂand mine of Leigh Creek and making a benefit too. From 1946 to 1965, the extent of South Australians associated with power expanded from 70 to 96%.
