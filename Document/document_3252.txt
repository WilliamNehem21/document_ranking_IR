In light of fossil proof from Russia and Bulgaria, the principal known individuals from the family Procyonidae lived in Europe in the late Oligocene around 25 million years back. Comparable tooth and skull structures propose procyonids and weasels share a typical predecessor, however sub-atomic investigation demonstrates a closer connection among raccoons and bears. After the then-existing species crossed the Bering Strait somewhere around six million years after the fact in the early Miocene, the focal point of its dissemination was most likely in Central America. Coatis ("Nasua" and "Nasuella") and raccoons ("Procyon") have been considered to share normal plunge from an animal types in the sort "Paranasua" present somewhere in the range of 5.2 and 6.0ÃÂ million years prior. This presumption, in light of morphological examinations of fossils, clashes with a 2006 hereditary investigation which demonstrates raccoons are all the more firmly identified with ringtails. In contrast to different procyonids, for example, the crab-eating raccoon ("Procyon cancrivorus"), the precursors of the normal raccoon left tropical and subtropical zones and relocated more remote north about 2.5ÃÂ million years prior, in a movement that has been affirmed by the disclosure of fossils in the Great Plains going back to the center of the Pliocene. Its latest progenitor was likely "Procyon rexroadensis", an extensive Blancan raccoon from the Rexroad Formation described by its limited back teeth and expansive lower jaw.
