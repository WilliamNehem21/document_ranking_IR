The north wing, alluded to as the Alter Hauptbau (Old Main structure), is the most seasoned bit of the royal residence. It was initially worked to house the lofts of Eberhard Louis and Princess Henrietta Maria. Its veneer was worked from 1705 to 1708 and its insides were for the most part finished by 1715, in spite of the fact that work inside its structures endured into 1722. In 1809, and from 1826 to 1828, the rooms confronting the patio in the "beletage" (primary floor) were rebuilt in the Neoclassical style, yet their Baroque frescoes were uncovered in 1865. The "corps de logis" opens with a wide vestibule, enriched by Frisoni in 1712, that ends in an unadorned staircase. At the highest point of the stairs is a gatekeeper room and the four suites on the "beletage". These pursue the French Baroque model of a lounge room, gathering of people chamber, and room. Eberhard Louis' condo includes a corridor of mirrors adorned with stucco by Frisoni and a concealed staircase, since expelled, into the room of his special lady Wilhelmine von GrÃÂ¤venitz. The third floor, completed in 1708, houses two exhibitions. The principal takes up the greater part of the south divider and filled in as a representation exhibition and "ahnentafel" (table of precursors), with stucco pictures of Eberhard Louis and his predecessors made by Frisoni and Soldati in 1713. The roof fresco were lost in the 1808 redesign that partitioned into littler rooms. The exhibition was reestablished to somewhere in the range of 2000 and 2004. Over the third floor is a mansard rooftop that currently houses Zwiefalten Abbey's unique precision, taken from by King Frederick I in 1809.
