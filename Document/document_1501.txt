In 908, Plegmund passed on the contributions of the English ruler and individuals to the Pope, the primary visit to Rome by an Archbishop of Canterbury for very nearly a century, and the voyage may have been to look for ecclesiastical endorsement for a proposed re-association of the West Saxon sees. At the point when Edward went to the honored position Wessex had two wards, Winchester, held by Denewulf, and Sherborne, held by Asser. In 908 Denewulf kicked the bucket and was supplanted the next year by Frithestan; soon a short time later Winchester was separated into two sees, with the formation of the see of Ramsbury covering Wiltshire and Berkshire, while Winchester was left with Hampshire and Surrey. Produced sanctions date the division to 909, yet this may not be right. Asser passed on around the same time, and at some date somewhere in the range of 909 and 918 Sherborne was partitioned into three sees, Crediton covering Devon and Cornwall, and Wells covering Somerset, leaving Sherborne with Dorset. The impact of the progressions was to fortify the status of Canterbury contrasted and Winchester and Sherborne, however the division may have been identified with an adjustment in the mainstream elements of West Saxon ministers, to move toward becoming operators of illustrious government in shires instead of regions, aiding barrier and participating in shire courts.
