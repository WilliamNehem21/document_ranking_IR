"Blackrock" was formed into a film of a similar name, which was incompletely recorded in Stockton and discharged in 1997. The people group of Stockton contradicted shooting in the zone, expressing the recollections of the occasions were still crisp and the subtleties of the content were "far too close". At the point when movie producers landed in Stockton the neighborhood media treated them with threatening vibe, and areas that had recently been held were never again accessible. The circumstance was exacerbated by the producers' disavowal that the film was explicitly about Leigh, in spite of the decision of Stockton for taping. Leigh's family were against the film, saying the movie producers were "devouring a grievous circumstance" and depicting Leigh contrarily. Partner educator Donna Lee Brien of Central Queensland University expressed that some anecdotal angles in the film depicted Leigh in a negative way, however the book "Reel Tracks" by Rebecca Doyle acknowledged the film for amending falsehood revealed in the media in regards to the homicide, just as with giving a discussion to reflection on the occasions. The film got a blended to-positive gathering in Australia, yet performed ineffectively when appeared; Brien expressed that in light of the fact that the film did not have the "impactful and amazing account backing of Leigh's catastrophe", it was esteemed by faultfinders to be "shallow and prosaic".
