Upon his arrival to America, his recently imported steeds turned out to be a piece of his Davenport Desert Arabian Stud in Morris Plains, New Jersey. By 1908, be that as it may, the Davenport Desert Arabian Stud was recorded in the Arabian Stud Book as situated in Hingham, Massachusetts, and he remained firmly partnered with Bradley's Hingham Stock Farm, which turned into the sole proprietor of the ponies after Davenport's passing in 1912. In 1908, Davenport ended up one of the five incorporators of the Arabian Horse Club of America (presently the Arabian Horse Association). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) perceived the association as the official vault for Arabian steeds in 1909. Preceding that time, the Thoroughbred stud books of both the United Kingdom and the United States likewise took care of the enlistment of Arabian ponies. The reason another association, separate from the American Jockey Club, was expected to enroll Arabians came about to a great extent on account of Davenport. He had fastidiously looked for steeds with unadulterated bloodlines and known reproducing strains with the master help of Haffez, however once out of the desert, he didn't know that he additionally expected to acquire composed affirmations and other desk work to record their bloodlines. Furthermore, on the grounds that his Arabians were not sent by means of Britain, they were not confirmed by the United Kingdom's Jockey Club before landing in America, and without that validation, the American Jockey Club wouldn't enroll his imported ponies. Another factor may have impacted the association's position: in an animation, Davenport had ridiculed Jockey Club President August Belmont.
