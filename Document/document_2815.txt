The naval force endured a few extreme difficulties amid the 1620s. In 1625, a squadron cruising in the Bay of Riga was gotten in a tempest and ten boats steered into the rocks and were destroyed. In the Battle of Oliwa in 1627, a Swedish squadron was outflanked and crushed by a Polish power and two vast boats were lost. "Tigern" ('The Tiger'), which was the Swedish chief of naval operations' lead, was caught by the Poles, and "Solen" ('The Sun') was exploded by her very own team when she was boarded and close catch. In 1628, three more huge boats were lost in under a month; Admiral Klas Fleming's lead "Kristina" was destroyed in a tempest in the Gulf of Danzig, "Riksnyckeln" ('Key of the Realm') steered into the rocks at Viksten in the southern archipelago of Stockholm and "Vasa" foundered on her first venture. Gustavus Adolphus was occupied with maritime fighting on a few fronts, which further exacerbated the troubles of the naval force. Notwithstanding doing combating the Polish naval force, the Swedes were by implication undermined by Imperial powers that had attacked Jutland. The Swedish ruler had little compassion toward the Danish lord, Christian IV, and Denmark and Sweden had been harsh foes for well over a century. In any case, Sweden dreaded a Catholic success of Copenhagen and Zealand. This would have conceded the Catholic forces authority over the vital sections between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, which would be terrible for Swedish interests. As it turned out, the Imperial control of Denmark finished before Swedish mediation was essential, and a squadron doled out to help Denmark was retasked to help lift the Imperial attack of Stralsund.
