After Crane's unexpected passing from tuberculosis at 28 years old, his work delighted in a resurgence of prominence. Creator and pundit Elbert Hubbard wrote in Crane's eulogy in the "Philistine" that "The Open Boat" was "the sternest, creepiest piece of authenticity at any point wrote". Additionally noticing the discouraging Realism used in the story, proofreader Vincent Starrett expressed: "It is a ruined picture, and the story is one of our most prominent short stories." Another of the writer's companions, H. G. Wells, composed that "The Open Boat" was "past all inquiry, the crown of all [Crane's] work." Singling out Crane's use of shading and chiaroscuro in his composition, Wells proceeded: "It has all the unmistakable intensity of the prior stories, with another component of limitation; the shading is as full and solid as ever, more full and more grounded, without a doubt; however those chromatic sprinkles that on occasion stun and befuddle in "The Red Badge", those pictures that flabbergast as opposed to edify, are restrained and controlled." The story stays mainstream with pundits; Thomas Kent alluded to "The Open Boat" as Crane's "artful culmination", while Crane biographer Stanley Wertheim called it "Crane's best short story and one of the masterworks generally nineteenth-century American writing".
