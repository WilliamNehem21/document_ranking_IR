In 2005, "Standpoint" magazine distributed that Mukerji had set up herself as the best on-screen character of contemporary Hindi film. Her first film job that year was inverse Amitabh Bachchan in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's exceedingly acclaimed "Dark", a dramatization around a heavy drinker man who devotes his life to show a visually impaired and hard of hearing young lady how to impart. Bhansali composed the piece of the visually impaired hard of hearing young lady explicitly for Mukerji, who was at first reluctant to take on the job because of its "testing" topic. Once Bhansali authorized his confidence in her, she concurred and started seriously concentrating communication via gestures with experts at the Helen Keller Institute in Mumbai. "Dark" won a few honors including two National Film Awards and eleven Filmfare Awards, and Richard Corliss of "TIME" highlighted it as the fifth best film of the year. Mukerji's execution met with consistent recognition; "Domain" called the execution "amazing", "Filmfare" incorporated her work in their posting of Indian film's "80 Most Iconic exhibitions" and expressed, "Rani has left a permanent imprint with this job as a rule comes rare for most". She turned into the main on-screen character to win both the Best Actress and Best ActressÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Critics trophies at the Filmfare Awards service.
