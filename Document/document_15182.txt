At the beginning of February, "Faryl" was placed at 295 in Amazon.co.uk's best-sellers chart and 13 in its easy listening chart, based on pre-orders alone. A week before its release, the album was in the top 100 selling albums, and was the top-selling opera album. Retailers in the UK ordered more than 80,000 copies of the album in the week leading up to release, which Simon Cable, writing for the "Daily Mail", noted was more than U2's recent "No Line on the Horizon". It also topped the Amazon.co.uk presale chart. On the day of the release, based only on presales, the album was at the number 1 spot on the UK Albums Chart. The album became the fastest-selling classical solo album in Britain, beating Hayley Westenra's "Pure", selling 20,000 copies in the first four days. The first week resulted in sales of 29,200 copies, which is higher than any other debut album of a classical singer. "Faryl" officially entered the UK Albums Chart at number 6, and climbed to number 4 the following week. "Faryl" made Smith the third former "Britain's Got Talent" contestant to achieve a top ten album, after Paul Potts (with "One Chance") and Andrew Johnston (with "One Voice"). In the US, "Faryl" peaked at 31 on Top Heatseekers Albums chart, and at 6 on the Classical Albums chart, remaining in the charts for one and 17 weeks respectively. By February 2010, over 160,000 copies of "Faryl" had been sold, with over 150,000 of these in the UK. In July 2013, the British Phonographic Industry certified the album gold, denoting shipments of over 100,000 units in the United Kingdom.
