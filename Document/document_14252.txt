In the initial segment of his gatherings, one of Branham's buddy evangelists would lecture a message. Ern Baxter or F. F. Bosworth normally filled this job, however different clergymen likewise took an interest in Branham's battles. Baxter by and large centered around book of scriptures educating; Bosworth directed supplicants on the requirement for confidence and the convention of celestial mending. Following their development, Branham would take the platform and convey a short message, in which he normally related anecdotes about his own background. In the wake of finishing his lesson, he would continue with a supplication line where he would petition God for the wiped out. Branham would regularly demand God to "affirm his message with a few confidence motivated supernatural occurrences". His battle supervisor sorted out the petition line, sending supplicants forward to be appealed to God for in front of an audience separately. Branham for the most part petitioned God for a couple of individuals every night and thought seeing the outcomes on the stage would move confidence in the crowd and license them to encounter comparative outcomes without being actually appealed to God for. Depicting Branham's strategy, Bosworth said "he doesn't start to petition God for the recuperating of the harrowed in body in the mending line every night until God blesses him for the task of the blessing, and until he is aware of the nearness of the Angel with him on the stage. Without this awareness he is by all accounts superbly vulnerable."
