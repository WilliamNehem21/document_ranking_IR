One methods for gathering pledges that Harvest Campaign chairmen settled on was to counterstamp a portion of the coins at deal at premium costs. The letters and numbers are accepted to have been punched by the Association, as they are for the most part uniform. Some were given a state shortened form and a number, and were sent to be unloaded in different towns. Gibbes detailed that the counterstamped pieces sent to South Carolina sold for a normal of $23, running from $10 to $110, and suggested that the barterings be gone before with the record of the closeout of one in Bradenton, Florida, for $1,300. Which town got which number was the result of pure chance. Others were set apart with "U.D.C." and a state truncation, together with a number which most likely speaks to an enrollment or part number. These were proposed for introduction to individuals meriting unique respect, for example, a cordial president. They didn't sell well, as the Association had distanced numerous UDC individuals over the terminating of Borglum. The Association likewise reported a program available to be purchased to the Sons of Confederate Veterans, despite the fact that whether any coins were sold under this program is vague, as none have been distinguished. Pieces stamped "G.L." and "S.L." were considered by gatherers for a long time; A. Steve Deitert in the January 2011 release of "The Numismatist" recognized the markings as "Gold Lavalier" and "Silver Lavalier". These coins were given to region victors and sprinters up in a selling rivalry for young ladies.
