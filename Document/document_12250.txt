Occupants on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de BÃÂ©xar started emptying in January after learning of the Mexican armed force's troop developments into their region, an occasion that was eventually replayed crosswise over Texas. Amid early clashes, some Texian warriors surrendered, trusting that they would progress toward becoming detainees of war Ã¢ÂÂ however Santa Anna requested their executions. The updates on the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad slaughter imparted dread in the populace and brought about the mass departure of the non military personnel populace of Gonzales, where the opening skirmish of the Texian unrest had started and where, just days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a local army to fortify the protectors at the mission. The regular citizen outcasts were joined by the recently shaping temporary armed force, as Houston purchased time to prepare troopers and make a military structure that could contradict Santa Anna's more prominent powers. Houston's activities were seen as weakness by the "temporary" government, just as by his very own portion troops. As he and the displaced people from Gonzales got away first to the Colorado River and afterward to the Brazos, evacuees from different zones streamed in and new state army bunches landed to unite with Houston's power.
