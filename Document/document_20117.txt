The gameplay was similarly lauded; the "GamePro" review claimed that ""Dungeon Siege"s gameplay is perhaps its biggest and most transparent improvement over previous titles in the genre." Several reviewers compared it favorably to "Diablo II" (2000), then one of the most popular computer action role-playing games, with Adams of IGN claiming that it was very similar to "Diablo II" with some changes and improvements, and Coffey of "Computer Gaming World" stating that the only thing keeping it from being directly rated as better was that the shift to a more tactical gameplay made it too different of a game to directly compare. "PC Gamer"s Vederman, "Computer Gaming World"s Coffey, and the GameSpot reviewer praised the gameplay as being streamlined and accessible; they liked the tactical nature of controlling a party of adventurers who improved according to how they were used rather than directly controlling their actions and statistics. IGN's Adams, however, said that the gameplay could get monotonous, Vederman of "PC Gamer" felt that the gameplay combat choices were somewhat limited, and GameSpy's Suciu disliked the linearity of the single-player game. Adams further added that many of the tactical choices in the game were inconsequential, as all battles quickly devolved into brawls, and that the freeform system of leveling was essentially the same as four character classes as pursuing multiple tracks was ineffective.
