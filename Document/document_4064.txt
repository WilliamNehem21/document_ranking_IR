The significance of practice to Monteux was appeared, in 1923, Diaghilev requested that he direct Stravinsky's new "Les noces" with no practice, as the writer would as of now have led the principal execution, Monteux following on from that point. Monteux told the director "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, yet I need to do what ze arranger 'as composed." Monteux's self-destroying way to deal with scores prompted periodic unfriendly remark; the music faultfinder of "The Nation", B. H. Haggin, while conceding that Monteux was for the most part viewed as one of the monsters of directing, composed of his "over and again shown melodic unremarkableness". Other American scholars have taken an alternate view. In 1957 Carleton Smith stated, "His way to deal with all music is that of the ace specialist. ... Seeing him at work, unassuming and calm, it is hard to understand that he is a greater film industry fascination at the Metropolitan Opera House than any diva ... that he is the main director consistently welcome to assume responsibility for America's 'enormous three'ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic symphonies." In his 1967 book "The Great Conductors", Harold C. Schonberg composed of Monteux, "[A] conductor of global stature, a conductor respected and adored everywhere throughout the world. The word 'cherished' is utilized consciously." Elsewhere, Schonberg composed of Monteux's "energy and appeal". At the point when asked in a radio meeting to portray himself (as a conductor) in single word, Monteux answered, "Accursed proficient".
