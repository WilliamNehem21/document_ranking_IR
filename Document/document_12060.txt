Antiquarian J.K. Hyde states that the "Nuova Cronica" of Villani is illustrative of the solid vernacular custom in Florence, engaging the general population of the time as an account that might have been "anything but difficult to peruse, brimming with human intrigue and periodically spiced with novella-type tales." Hyde additionally noticed that Villani's reactions of the cooperative governmental issues in Florence advanced a pattern of individual articulation among later recorders that challenged authority congruity. The "Cronica" is additionally an extraordinarily rich verifiable record; its most prominent incentive to present day antiquarians is its depictions of the general population, information, and occasions experienced by Villani amid his lifetime. Student of history Mark Phillips states that all resulting Florentine records of the oppressive routine of WalterÃÂ VI of BrienneÃ¢ÂÂincluding those by Leonardo Bruni and NiccolÃÂ² MachiavelliÃ¢ÂÂdepended on the essential wellspring of Villani's "Cronica". Villani's composed work on Dante Alighieri and the age in which he lived has given knowledge into Dante's work, thinking, and mind. The republishing of new versions of Villani's work in the mid twentieth century gave material to a resurgence in the investigation of Dante.
