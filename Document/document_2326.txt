Gatherings of current elephant remains have been designated "elephants' burial grounds", in light of the fact that these destinations were wrongly thought to be the place old elephants went to kick the bucket. Comparable aggregations of mammoth bones have been discovered; it is thought these are the aftereffect of people biting the dust close or in waterways more than a large number of years and their bones being amassed by the water, (for example, in the Aucilla River in Florida), or creatures kicking the bucket in the wake of getting to be buried in mud. A few aggregations are believed to be the remaining parts of crowds which kicked the bucket in the meantime, maybe because of flooding. Columbian mammoths are once in a while protected in volcanic stores, for example, those in Tocuila, Texcoco, Mexico, where a volcanic lahar mudflow secured somewhere around seven people 12,500 years back. It is obscure what number of mammoths inhabited one area at any given moment, yet all things considered, the number fluctuated via season and life cycle. Present day elephants can frame vast crowds, once in a while comprising of various family gatherings, and these groups can incorporate a large number of creatures moving together. Mammoths may have framed expansive groups more frequently than present day elephants, since creatures living in open zones are bound to do this than those in forested territories. Despite the fact that it is vague to what degree Columbian mammoths moved, an isotope investigation of Blackwater Draw in New Mexico demonstrated that they went through piece of the year in the Rocky Mountains, away. The investigation of tusk rings may help further investigation of mammoth relocation.
