The film was declared in October 2003 by maker Subhash Ghai, to honor the 25th commemoration of his creation organization Mukta Arts. The media revealed that Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead jobs, making it the third film joint effort among Kumar and Chopra after the profoundly effective "Andaaz" (2003) and "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" (2004). Kumar was given a role as Raj, a working man blamed for assault at his work environment; Kapoor depicted his steady spouse, who goes to limits to shield him. As indicated by the chiefs, Kumar was thrown against sort; he for the most part played activity legends, and they needed him to underplay his character. AbbasÃ¢ÂÂ Mustan, known for classy spine chillers and charming enemies, cast Chopra in her first negative job. She plays a lady, wedded to a business tycoon more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who erroneously denounces her ex-sweetheart (Kumar) of assaulting her to look for vengeance. Chopra was at first fearful about such an intense character, because of the disputable subject of inappropriate behavior, however AbbasÃ¢ÂÂ Mastan and Subhash Ghai persuaded her to acknowledge the job. The chief couple had recently offered her the lead job in their 2002 spine chiller "Humraaz", which she couldn't do.
