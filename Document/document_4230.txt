Lieven describes how the salvage parties "in their desperation,ÃÂ ... were careless with their lives" in their endeavors to discover survivors; many were harmed in little rooftop crumples, or endured the impacts of carbon monoxide harming. Their undertakings spared lives all through the rest of the day and into the night, including a gathering of 18 men found at around 1:00ÃÂ am. They were the last survivors found. A sum of 432 excavators had passed on that dayÃ¢ÂÂalbeit a few bodies were not found until some other timeÃ¢ÂÂand 7 others kicked the bucket later in medical clinic or at home. A writer from "The Times" expressed: "The numbers are really dreadful. We talk in awed terms of the obliteration of a regiment in a ridiculous fight, however here an extraordinary network occupied with the quest for a tranquil work is undermined with the loss of no less than a fourth of its physically fit masculinity". Superficially the townsfolk sat tight for news; a journalist for "The Dundee Courier" thought: "the scene at Senghenydd the previous evening was discouraging in the outrageous. The boulevards were brimming with quiet crowds of individuals who moved capriciously about or stood stolidly at the road corners."
