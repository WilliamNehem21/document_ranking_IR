The structure of "The Wrongs of Woman", with its intertwined stories of the comparably manhandled upper-white collar class Maria, the lower-white collar class mariner's better half Peggy, the average workers retailer, the motel proprietor, and the regular workers household hireling Jemima, is a "phenomenal" portrayal of the mutual worries of ladies in a man centric culture. Wollstonecraft wrote in a letter, distributed as a major aspect of the introduction to "The Wrongs of Woman", that she pointed "to demonstrate the wrongs of various classes of ladies, similarly abusive, however, from the distinction of training, fundamentally different". Her epic is recently comprehensive and one of the principal works in the historical backdrop of women's activist writing that alludes to a cross-class contention that ladies of various financial positions have similar interests "since" they are ladies. In her portrayal, Jemima asks "who at any point gambled anything for me?Ã¢ÂÂ Who at any point recognized me to be an individual animal?" It isn't until Maria gets a handle on her turn in compassion that she feels this; moreover, it is Jemima's story that first pushes Maria's own "contemplations [to] take a more extensive territory" and "thinking about Jemima's exceptional destiny and her own, she was directed to think about the persecuted condition of ladies, and to mourn that she had brought forth a little girl".
