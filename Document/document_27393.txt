In the meantime, Minh left the JGS headquarters and traveled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan with his aide and bodyguard, Captain Nguyá»n VÄn Nhung. Minh arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military ceremonial uniform to supervise the arrest of Diá»m and Nhu. Minh had also dispatched a M-113 armored personnel carrier and four jeeps to Gia Long Palace to transport an arrested Diá»m and Nhu back to JGS headquarters for official surrender. While Minh was on the way to supervise the takeover of the palace, Generals ÄÃ´n, Tráº§n Thiá»n KhiÃªm and LÃª VÄn Kim prepared the army headquarters for Diá»m's arrival and a ceremonial handover of power to the junta. Diá»m's pictures were taken down and his statue was covered up. A large table covered with green felt was brought in with the intention of seating Diá»m for the handover to Minh and Vice President Nguyá»n Ngá»c ThÆ¡, who was to become the civilian Prime Minister. In a nationally televised event witnessed by international media, Diá»m would "ask" the generals that he and his brother be granted exile and asylum in a foreign country, which would be granted. The brothers were then to be held in a secure place at JGS headquarters while awaiting deportation.
