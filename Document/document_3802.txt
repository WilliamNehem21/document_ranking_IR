Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday raceÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ two on Thursday, and one on Saturday. The Thursday morning and evening sessions each kept going 90ÃÂ minutes; the third session, on Saturday morning, went on for 60 minutes. One hour into the primary session, authorities saw a free channel spread in the go through Beau Rivage, and suspended practice. Ferrari and McLaren took the best four spots after the resumptionÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ RÃÂ¤ikkÃÂ¶nen in front of Hamilton, McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen, and Massa. Behind Williams driver Nico Rosberg, Kubica was the best of the BMW Saubers in 6th; his colleague Heidfeld was compelled to resign due to a motor disappointment, and ceased his vehicle in Casino Square after simply 13ÃÂ laps. Regardless of further postponements amid the second sessionÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ both Renault drivers smashed in discrete episodes at Sainte Devote, requiring the marshals to clear the track of debrisÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Hamilton again demonstrated solid, quickest in front of Rosberg, RÃÂ¤ikkÃÂ¶nen, Massa, Kovalainen and Kubica. Aside from the Renault drivers, two additional vehicles struck the boundaries: Toyota driver Jarno Trulli scratched the divider out of Piscine; Adrian Sutil's Force India lost its front wing in the wake of labeling the hindrance at Rascasse. While light downpour fell on Saturday morning, Kovalainen set the quickest time in the last session, before losing control at Piscine and harming the back of his vehicle. The downpour expanded as the marshals cleared the flotsam and jetsam, and in the resulting poor track conditions Kovalainen's time stayed unbeaten. Hamilton oversaw second quickest, in front of RÃÂ¤ikkÃÂ¶nen, Rosberg, Kubica and Massa.
