In 2007, Davies was named for the "Best Soap/Series" Writers' Guild of Great Britain AwardÃ¢ÂÂalongside Chris Chibnall, Paul Cornell, Stephen Greenhorn, Steven Moffat, Helen Raynor, and Gareth RobertsÃ¢ÂÂfor their work on the third arrangement of "Specialist Who". He was again named for two BAFTA Awards in 2009: a Television Award for his work on "Specialist Who", and the Television Craft Award for Best Writer, for the scene "Midnight". Under his residency, "Specialist Who" won five successive National Television Awards somewhere in the range of 2005 and 2010. He has likewise been named for three Hugo Awards, all in the class of "Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form": in 2007, the story involving "Armed force of Ghosts" and "Doomsday" was crushed by Steven Moffat's "The Girl in the Fireplace"; in 2009, the scene "Turn Left" was vanquished by Joss Whedon's "Dr. Ghastly's Sing-Along Blog"; and in 2010, every one of the three of his contents which were qualified for the honor, "The Next Doctor", the DaviesÃ¢ÂÂ Roberts joint effort "Planet of the Dead", and the DaviesÃ¢ÂÂ Ford coordinated effort "The Waters of Mars", were named: the honor was won by "The Waters of Mars" and different scenes took second and third spot.
