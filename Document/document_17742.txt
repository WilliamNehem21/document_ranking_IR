In October 1769, "Endeavour" reached the coastline of New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to do so since Abel Tasman's "Heemskerck" in 1642. Unfamiliar with such ships, the MÄori people at Cook's first landing point in Poverty Bay thought the ship was a floating island, or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of Hawaiki. "Endeavour" spent the next six months sailing close to shore, while Cook mapped the coastline and concluded that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for "Terra Australis". In March 1770, the longboat from "Endeavour" carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand. On his return, "Endeavour" resumed her voyage westward, her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April. On 29 April, she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia, when Cook landed one of the ship's boats on the southern shore of what is now known as Botany Bay, New South Wales.
For the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11Â pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef, today called Endeavour Reef, within the Great Barrier Reef system. The sails were immediately taken down, a kedging anchor set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef "Endeavour" had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to less than one ship's length away.
