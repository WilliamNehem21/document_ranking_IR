Horner's trick of weakness is an incredible achievement, and he engages in sexual relations with numerous women of idealistic notoriety, generally the spouses and little girls of natives or "cits", for example upwardly versatile businesspeople and business people of the City of London, instead of the Town, the noble quarters where Horner and his companions live. Three such women show up in front of an audience, generally together: Lady Fidget, her sister-in-law Mrs Dainty Fidget, and her tag-along companion Mrs Squeamish names that pass on both a fragile affectability about the gem of notoriety, and a specific nervous physical unease or tickle and the discourse gives an inconclusive impression of some more. The play is organized as a sham, driven by Horner's mystery and by a progression of close revelations of reality, from which he removes himself by assurance and good karma. A last hair-raising risk of introduction comes in the last scene, through the benevolent straightforwardness of the youthful nation spouse Margery Pinchwife. Margery is angry at the allegations of feebleness coordinated at "poor dear Mr. Horner", which she knows from individual experience to be false, and is resolved to stating so at the conventional end-of-the-play open social event of the whole cast. In a last cheat perfect work of art, Horner turns away the risk, uniting with his progressively modern darlings to induce the envious Pinchwife to at any rate profess to trust Horner inept and his own better half still guiltless. Horner never turns into a transformed character yet is expected to continue harvesting the products of his planted deception, past the last demonstration and past.
