Figs have entangled inflorescences called syconia. Blooms are totally contained inside an encased structure. Their solitary association with the outside is through a little pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like "F. aurea" have both male and female blooms inside the syconium. Female blossoms develop first. When develop, they produce an unstable concoction attractant. Female wasps crush their way through the ostiole into the inside of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they fertilize the blossoms, lay their eggs in some of them, and pass on. The eggs incubate and the hatchlings parasitise the blooms in which they were laid. Following four to seven weeks (in "F. aurea"), grown-up wasps rise. Guys rise first, mate with the females, and slice leave openings through the dividers of the fig. The male blooms develop around a similar time as the female wasps rise. The recently developed female wasps effectively pack their bodies with dust from the male blooms before leaving through the leave gaps the guys have sliced and take off to discover a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Throughout the following one to five days, figs mature. The ready figs are eaten by different warm blooded animals and feathered creatures which scatter the seeds.
