The level design received mixed comments. Mueller called some levels "extremely frustrating". Helgeson stated that the fast-paced "levels are poorly designed", and Andrew Reiner, who wrote a second-opinion review for "Game Informer", called the level design "disastrous". "Official Xbox Magazine" was more mixed, balancing the possibility of getting lost in the large levels with the likely appeal of these stages to 3D "Sonic" gamers, particularly those who had enjoyed "Sonic Heroes". GameTrailers found that "the levels are either dark and urban, or bright and psychedelic. Either way, they fit in well to the "Sonic" universe. They are loaded with speed ramps, loops and an assortment of other boosts that rocket Shadow like a pinball." Bettenhausen included "the classic run-like-hell roller coaster design philosophy" of some stages in his limited praise. Casamassina disliked the "stupid level design", saying that "[j]ust because they dazzled players six years ago does not mean that Sonic Team can copy and paste exactly the same loops and spins into each new franchise iteration and expect everyone to be happy with the outcome." GameSpy observed that "the areas are much less open than in previous "Sonic" games, but the level designers haven't taken advantage of the constraints." "Nintendo Power" singled out the difficulty of the missions that require the player to locate objects.
