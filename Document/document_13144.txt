The most up to date connect over the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a walker footbridge near the Great Bow Bridge. It was raised in 2006 and frames some portion of the River Parrett Trail. The following extension upstream is Bicknell's scaffold, which was once in the past known as Bickling span, which conveys the street from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It supplanted a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge conveys a minor street over the waterway, and another minor street crosses on the Thorney Bridge near the Thorney (or quiet) Mill and a lock. The plant, with an iron overshot wheel, was worked to pound corn in 1823. Another extension and factory happen further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the plant has been the subject of a possibility examine by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was worked of Ham stone in the eighteenth century and named after Carey's Mill, which initially involved the site. It is encompassed by an accumulation of structures known as the Parrett Iron Works, established in 1855 on the site of a previous snuff factory, which incorporated a foundry, with a conspicuous fireplace, ropewalk, workshops and a few littler workshops and bungalows. The conduit which fueled the waterwheel and floodgate guardian's bungalow still exist. Further south the stream streams under the A303 close Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 close Chedington.
