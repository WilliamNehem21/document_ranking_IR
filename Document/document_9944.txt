Lody was additionally the subject of artistic and stage works; a hagiographic true to life account, "Lody Ã¢ÂÂ Ein Weg um Ehre" ("Lody Ã¢ÂÂ One Way to Honor"), was distributed by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called "Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers" ("Lody: the life and demise of a German officer"), by Walter Heuer, debuted on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It portrays Lody as daring and energetic yet awkward, leaving a trail of signs behind him as he goes in the UK: wearing garments stamped "Made in Germany", composing maritime mysteries on the back of a transport ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard investigator discovers, preparing for action when an ensemble in London plays the German maritime hymn, stimulating doubt when he calls for German wine while composing mystery reports to Berlin, and leaving implicating letters in the pockets of suits which he sends to be squeezed. Lody is captured in London and condemned to death. Offered an opportunity to get away, he cannot and drinks a glass of wine with the terminating squad, toasting Anglo-German fellowship. He is driven out to his execution, saying his last words: "I will see Germany again Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ from the stars." The Dundee "Night Telegraph" depicted the storyline as "curious".
