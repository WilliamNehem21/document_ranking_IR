In 1931, C. C. Youthful named another types of "Psittacosaurus" for an incomplete skull found in Inner Mongolia, China. The skull was named "P. osborni" after Henry Fairfield Osborn. The legitimacy of this species is currently viewed as dubious. Sereno (1990) thought of it as an equivalent word of "P. mongoliensis", which is found in adjacent strata of a similar age. You and Dodson (2004) recorded it as substantial in a table, however not in their content. In a 2010 audit, Sereno again respected "P. osborni" as an equivalent word of "P. mongoliensis", however noted it was speculative in light of the nearness of different substantial psittacosaur species in Inner Mongolia. Youthful additionally portrayed the species "P. tingi" in the equivalent 1931 report which contained "P. osborni". It depends on a few skull parts. He later synonymised the two species under the name "P. osborni". You and Dodson (2004) pursued this in a table, yet Sereno viewed the two species as equivalent words of "P. mongoliensis"; a table in the last announced "P. tingi" as a "nomen dubium", be that as it may. The front portion of a skull from Guyang County in Inner Mongolia was depicted as "Psittacosaurus guyangensis" in 1983. Disarticulated postcranial remains speaking to various people were found at a similar territory and were relegated to the species. While it contrasts from the sort example of "P. mongoliensis", it falls inside the scope of individual variety seen in different examples of that species and is never again perceived as a legitimate animal varieties. You and Dodson (2004) included "P. guyangensis" in a table of legitimate taxa, yet did exclude it thusly in their content.
