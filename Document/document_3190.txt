For reasons that are obscure, Theodore did not restore his assault on Constantinople in 1226 or the years from there on. Rather, he appears to have involved himself with local illicit relationships, just as taking consideration to improve relations with Frederick II amid the last's stop-over at Corfu and Cephallonia to lead the Sixth Crusade in 1228. In 1229, he even sent an organization of Greek troops to serve under Frederick in Italy. In the meantime, Theodore managed a break in relations with Venice, after his representative in Corfu sequestered the payload of a wrecked Venetian ship. Theodore issued an order on 19 August 1228 precluding Venetian dealers from rehearsing business in his domain. In January of that year, Robert of Courtenay kicked the bucket, leaving the position of royalty of the Latin Empire to his eleven-year-old sibling, Baldwin II. With a rule assuming control over the administration of the express, the Latin Empire stood additionally enfeebled. Right now, John Asen offered a collusion. Baldwin II would wed his little girl Helena, while John Asen would assume control over the rule and loan his help at repulsing Theodore's assaults. The Latin aristocrats saw the idea with question, as it would offer John Asen each chance to assume control over Constantinople himself; rather, they unstable arrangements, and in the end picked the 80-year-old however fiery John of Brienne () as official. In spite of the fact that the Bulgarian offer fizzled, it served to open a crack among Theodore and his ostensible partner. In a move obviously coordinated against John Asen, in September 1228, Theodore consented to a one-year ceasefire with the Latin Empire's official, Narjot of Toucy, with the outskirt between the two domains running along a line from Ainos to Vrysis.
