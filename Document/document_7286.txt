Second-line units quickly expected that the third line would assume control over their locally situated obligations, in the conviction that second-line divisions would be conveyed abroad. Some second-line brigades would not take initiates who had not acknowledged the Imperial Service Obligation, a training that was not formally endorsed until March 1915 when the choice to enroll just for home administration was annulled. The arrangement of second-line units abroad was formally embraced in mid 1915. Until the third line was prepared, the clashing requests to supply drafts, protect the country and plan for sending caused issues for the second line. In May 1915, Kitchener educated the War Cabinet that the second line was so exposed of prepared men as to render it problematic for home guard. Just in 1916 could the War Office guarantee that the second line would never again be trawled for substitutions to be sent to the primary line. Around this time, second-line contingent foundations had been diminished to 400 men, not exactly a large portion of the number regularly serving in an infantry legion at full quality. It took by and large 27 months to set up a second-line arrangement for dynamic administration, contrasted with eight months for the main line, and the second line regularly needed adequate weapons and ammo. The craving among the second-line officers to keep up a dimension of preparing and effectiveness in preparation for their own arrangement prompted erosion with their first-line partners, who blamed the second line for keeping down the best men and sending unsatisfactory substitutions to the primary line.
