Immediately after the President announced his resignation, DÃ­az announced on the radio that he was taking over the presidency, and that the army would continue to fight against the invasion of Castillo Armas. He headed a military junta which also consisted of Colonels Elfego HernÃ¡n MonzÃ³n Aguirre and Jose Angel SÃ¡nchez. Two days later Ambassador Peurifoy told DÃ­az that he had to resign because, in the words of a CIA officer who spoke to DÃ­az, he was "not convenient for American foreign policy". Peurifoy castigated DÃ­az for allowing Ãrbenz to criticize the United States in his resignation speech; meanwhile, a U.S.-trained pilot dropped a bomb on the army's main powder magazine, in order to intimidate the colonel. Soon after, DÃ­az was overthrown by a rapid bloodless coup led by Colonel MonzÃ³n, who was more pliable to U.S. interests. DÃ­az later stated that Peurifoy had presented him with a list of names of communists, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day; DÃ­az had refused, turning Peurifoy further against him. On 17 June, the army leaders at Zacapa had begun to negotiate with Castillo Armas. They signed a pact, the "Pacto de Las Tunas", three days later, which placed the army at Zacapa under Castillo Armas, in return for a general amnesty. The army returned to its barracks a few days later, "despondent, with a terrible sense of defeat".
