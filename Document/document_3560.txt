The collection's hallucinogenic title track, which creator Sean Egan portrayed as impressionistic, included the post-current soundscapes of in reverse guitar and drums that pre-date scratching by 10 years. Musicologist Ritchie Unterberger considers the verses to "I Don't Live Today" to be more at home in a gothic shake setting than in psychedelia, notwithstanding; he depicts the music as being "played and sung with an exuberance that gives a false representation of the obscurity of the verses." The melody's innate rhythms filled in as a stage for Hendrix's inventive guitar input act of spontaneities. While "Flame" is a funk and soul cross breed driven by Mitchell's drumming, "May This Be Love" and "The Wind Cries Mary" are delicate ditties that exhibit Hendrix's capacity to compose insightful verses and inconspicuous songs. The impact of raga shake can be heard in his sitar-like guitar solo on "Adoration or Confusion". "Would you be able to See Me" is an uptempo rocker that includes Hendrix's twofold followed vocals and his utilization of a one-note twist in the style of Hank Marvin.
