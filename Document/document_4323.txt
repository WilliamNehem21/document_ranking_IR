Welles and a right hand along these lines rectified the divider mount of the holotype example dependent on the new skeleton, by reestablishing the peaks, re-trying the pelvis, making the neck ribs longer, and putting them closer together. Subsequent to examining the skeletons of North American and European theropods, Welles understood that the dinosaur did not have a place with "Megalosaurus", and required another sort name. As of now, no different theropods with substantial longitudal peaks on their heads were known, and the dinosaur had in this manner picked up the enthusiasm of scientistss. A shape of the holotype example was made, and fiberglass throws of it were dispersed to different shows; to make naming these throws simpler, Welles chose to name the new class in a short note, instead of hold up until the production of a point by point portrayal. In 1970 Welles begat the new class name "Dilophosaurus", from the Greek words di (ÃÂ´ÃÂ¹) signifying "two", lophos (ÃÂ»ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂ) signifying "peak", and sauros (ÃÂÃÂ±ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂ) signifying "reptile"; "two-peaked reptile". Welles distributed an itemized osteological portrayal of "Dilophosaurus" in 1984, however the 1964 example has not yet been appropriately depicted. "Dilophosaurus" was the principal understood theropod from the Early Jurassic, and stays a standout amongst the best-safeguarded instances of that age.
