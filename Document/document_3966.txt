In the good 'ol days, Greeley's central collaborator was Henry J. Raymond, who 10 years after the fact established "The New York Times". To put the "Tribune" on a sound monetary balance, Greeley sold a half-enthusiasm for it to lawyer Thomas McElrath, who moved toward becoming distributer of the "Tribune" (Greeley was manager) and maintained the business side. Politically, the "Tribune" sponsored Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, who had fruitlessly looked for the presidential assignment that tumbled to Harrison, and bolstered Clay's American System for improvement of the nation. Greeley was one of the primary paper editors to have a full-time journalist in Washington, a development immediately pursued by his adversaries. Some portion of Greeley's methodology was to make the "Tribune" a paper of national degree, not just nearby. One factor in building up the paper broadly was the "Week by week Tribune", made in September, 1841 when the "Log Cabin" and "The New-Yorker" were combined. With an underlying membership cost of $2 per year, this was sent to numerous over the United States via mail, and was particularly famous in the Midwest. In December 1841, Greeley was offered the editorship of the national Whig paper, the "Madisonian". He requested full control, and declined when not given it.
