In "Brideshead", the proletarian junior officer Hooper illustrates a theme that persists in Waugh's postwar fiction: the rise of mediocrity in the "Age of the Common Man". In the trilogy "Sword of Honour" ("Men at Arms", 1952; "Officers and Gentlemen", 1955, "Unconditional Surrender", 1961) the social pervasiveness of mediocrity is personified in the semi-comical character "Trimmer", a sloven and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance. In the novella "Scott-King's Modern Europe" (1947), Waugh's pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster's admonition: "I think it would be very wicked, indeed, to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world". Likewise, such cynicism pervades the novel "Love Among the Ruins" (1953), set in a dystopian, welfare-state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that euthanasia is the most sought-after of the government's social services. Of the postwar novels, Patey says that "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold" (1957) stands out â³a kind of mock-novel, a sly invitation to a gameâ³. Waugh's final work of fiction, "Basil Seal Rides Again" (1962), features characters from the prewar novels; Waugh admitted that the work was a â³senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youthâ³. Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story, â³The Balance" of 1926, with a "fusillade of unattributed dialogue".
