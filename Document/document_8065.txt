In 1853, Congress approved a three-dollar piece. In a note found among his papers, Longacre composed that his assignment was to make the coin as simple as conceivable to recognize from the quarter hawk, which at $2.50 was close in esteem. Longacre delivered a structure for a Native American princess, which he made not quite the same as Gobrecht's Liberty plan on the quarter falcon with a more slender and more extensive planchet. At the time, a female Native American was regularly used to speak to America in workmanship, and a portrayal of Liberty as an Indian princess was as per contemporary practices. The central etcher wrote to Mint Director Snowden that the three-dollar piece, which went into generation in 1854, was the first occasion when he had been permitted masterful opportunity in structuring a coin. The gold dollar was changed that year to make the planchet both more slender and more extensive; Longacre adjusted his princess structure for the gold dollar. For the turn around of the coins, Longacre made a wreath of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton, mixing the agrarian results of the North and the South. This wreath would likewise be utilized on the turn around of the Flying Eagle penny in 1856; reused on the dime starting in 1860, the "grain wreath" would be Longacre's keep going enduring structure on coinage, staying with adjustments until the 1916 relinquishment of the Barber dime.
