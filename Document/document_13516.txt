A noteworthy break among Johnson and MillerÃ¢ÂÂpast opponents for the Australian captaincyÃ¢ÂÂcreated amid the Fourth Test, played at Kensington Oval in Barbados. Amid the third day, Miller, bowling quick medium swingers, had expelled Everton Weekes and Collie Smith one after another to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza batting. Johnson, feeling that the two batsmen would be helpless against express pace, requested that Miller increment his bowling speed. At the point when Miller won't, Johnson denounced with him: "I'll state who bowls and what they bowl". With Miller declining to bowl as coordinated, Johnson supplanted him in the assault with Ray Lindwall. Strolling off the field toward the day's end play and proceeding in the changing area, Miller incited Johnson, revealing to him he "couldn't commander a group of students", among different put-down. At long last Johnson reacted, asking "In the event that you need to go on like that for what reason don't we go around the back and work it out?" The a lot bigger Miller declined the offer and the pair headed out back to the group inn together. The following day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted all through the whole day's play. Their organization of 347ÃÂ runs for the seventh wicket is as yet a world record.
