The canal also carried packet services, with passengers facing a three-hour journey between Bolton and Manchester. The first passenger boat to Bolton was launched in 1796 from the Windsor Castle public house, and in 1798 a new packet boat was built for the use of the company. Fares were initially fixed by the canal company (although from 1805 contracted-out) and based upon the service required; a passenger using the state cabin from Bolton to Manchester would be charged oneÂ shillingÂ sixÂ pence, and a single shilling on the return journey. Passengers would change boats at Prestolee to avoid delays at the lock flight and also to save water, and a purpose-built covered walkway the length of the road was constructed for their benefit. Another passenger service ran along the two arms from Bolton to Bury, and over 60,000Â passengers per year travelled on the canal; between July 1833 and June 1834, 21,060Â made the journey from Bolton to Manchester, 21,212Â people travelled from Manchester to Bolton, and 20,818Â intermediary passengers hopped on and off the boats en route. In 1834 the Bolton to Manchester service earned Â£1,177 and the Bolton to Bury service earned Â£75. The service was quite luxurious compared to some packet boat services: central heating was provided in winter and drinks were served on board. This caused a tragedy in 1818, however, when a party of twenty drunken passengers managed to capsize the boat and a number of passengers, including two children, were drowned.
