Like other state thruways in Michigan, I-196 is kept up by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the division's traffic reviews demonstrated that by and large, 77,500ÃÂ vehicles utilized the interstate every day between Lane Avenue and USÃÂ 131 in Grand Rapids and 12,778ÃÂ vehicles did as such every day north of the split with USÃÂ 31 close Holland. These are the most noteworthy and least checks along the roadway, separately. As an Interstate Highway, every one of I-196 is recorded on the National Highway System, a system of streets critical to the nation's economy, protection, and versatility. Likewise, the expressway has been named by the Michigan Legislature the "Gerald R. Portage Freeway" to respect the 38th President of the United States. The first enactment from 1974 stretched out that name to the full length of the turnpike, however when the different dedication parkway names were re-classified in 2001, the name was not connected to the Berrien County portion. From the intersection with M-63 north to the split with USÃÂ 31 aside from the segment that interfaces the closures of the South Haven business circle, the turnpike is likewise a piece of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT), a visitor course that pursues Lake Michigan.
