At 14:30 on 17 January, twelve 155 mm and thirty-seven 105Â mm guns opened fire on the Gifu. Over the next one and a half hours, the American artillery fired 1,700 shells into an area about square. Because of the lateness of the hour, the Americans were unable to follow the barrage with an immediate attack but instead had to wait until the next day, which allowed the Japanese time to recover. On 18 January, the Americans attacked into the weaker west side of the Gifu, making some headway and destroying several Japanese pillboxes over the next two days until heavy rain stopped the attack on 20 January. That night, 11 Japanese were killed trying to escape from the Gifu.
On 22 January, the Americans were able to move a light tank up their supply trail to Mount Austen. The tank proved to be the decisive factor in the battle. At 10:20, the tankâprotected by 16â18 riflemenâblasted three Japanese pillboxes and penetrated into the Gifu pocket. Proceeding onward, the tank completely traversed the Gifu and destroyed five more pillboxes, breaching a gap wide in the Japanese line. The American infantry surged through the gap and took positions in the middle of the Gifu.
