Davidson was 39 years of age at the episode of war in 1914. In October 1915, perhaps to get away from the undeniably tempestuous environment in the Stiffkey parsonage, he joined the Royal Navy as a clergyman. He started his administration on HMS "Gibraltar", a station deliver situated in the Shetland Islands, where he bothered his shipmates by calling church marches each time another ship visited the dock; he had the full endorsement of the base administrator, Vice Admiral Sir Reginald Tupper, who was known as "Heavenly Reggie". Davidson's administration report from "Gibraltar"s commander records that "he plays out his obligations in a spur of the moment way. Not on great terms with messmates, ignores mess standards and guidelines". In October 1916 Davidson joined HMS "Fox" in the Middle East, and in the blink of an eye a while later was captured by the maritime police amid an assault on a Cairo massage parlor. He clarified that he was searching for an ailing whore who had been tainting his men. Again his leader's reports were negative; be that as it may, Davidson stayed with the "Fox" until August 1918 when he was presented on HMS "Leviathan" in the northern Atlantic. Here, his authority was somewhat progressively complimentary; he discovered Davidson "a cunning essayist and performer [who] focuses on obligation". Davidson left the Navy in March 1919.
