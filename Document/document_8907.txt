While visiting Europe for a second time, trying to incorporate outside plan patterns into the new Trubia, Captain Ruiz de Toledo found another kind of track framework in Germany. Intended to abstain from having issues with the tracks falling off the vehicle, the new plan substituted the conventional tracks with a framework which was held together by a sidelong metal divider, with the roadwheels suspended from the body. The track framework was the most inventive and exceptional piece of the new Trubia light tank. Aside from the new tracks, the Trubia was to have a more noteworthy speed (at any rate ) and more prominent street extend than the FT. While another assault rifle was introduced on the glacis plate, the tank's team was expanded from a few, which made the structure be broadened; this additionally enabled the motor to be kept up from inside the vehicle, enabling the group to fix little breakdowns in the field. To refrigerate the motor and the group, a packed air distributor was introduced inside the body. This tackled issues managing the group's claustrophobia and the admission of gasses starting from the motor found in the FT, and made manning the tank significantly more ergonomic. The first was supplanted with an all the more dominant Daimler four barrel motor. The transmission had four forward apparatuses and four invert gears. The new tank demonstrated acceptableÃ¢ÂÂand even bettered the FT in certain anglesÃ¢ÂÂand the Spanish Army requested the development of four models.
