The album has been cited by some as undeserving of its acclaim. In a poll surveying thousands conducted by BBC Radio 6 Music, "OK Computer" was named the sixth most overrated album "in the world". David H. Green of "The Daily Telegraph" called the album "self-indulgent whingeing" and maintains that the positive critical consensus toward "OK Computer" is an indication of "a 20th-century delusion that rock is the bastion of serious commentary on popular music" to the detriment of electronic and dance music. The album was selected as an entry in "Sacred Cows", an "NME" column questioning the critical status of "revered albums", in which Henry Yates said "there's no defiance, gallows humour or chink of light beneath the curtain, just a sense of meek, resigned despondency," and criticised the record as "the moment when Radiohead stopped being 'good' [compared to "The Bends"] and started being 'important'." In a "Spin" article on the "myth" that "Radiohead Can Do No Wrong", Chris Norris argues that the acclaim for "OK Computer" inflated expectations for subsequent Radiohead releases. In Christgau's opinion, "the reason the readers of the British magazine "Q" absurdly voted "OK Computer" the greatest album of the 20th century is that it integrated what was briefly called electronica into rock." Having deemed it "self-regarding" and overrated, he later warmed to the record a little bit, specifically three or four songs, while finding the music in general to be indicative of Radiohead's cerebral sensibility and "rife with discrete pleasures and surprises."
