The "Kearsarge"-class battleships were designed to be used for coastal defense. They had a displacement of , an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . The two 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines and five Scotch boilers, connected to two propeller shafts, produced a total of , and gave a maximum speed of . "Kearsarge" was manned by 40 officers and 514 enlisted men, a total of 554 crew.
"Kearsarge" had two double turrets, with two /35 caliber guns and two /40 caliber guns each, stacked in two levels. The guns and turret armor were designed by the Bureau of Ordnance, while the turret itself was designed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair. This caused the guns to be mounted far back in the turret, making the ports very large. Admiral William Sims claimed that as a result, a shell fired into the port could reach the magazines below, disabling the guns. In addition to these guns, "Kearsarge" carried fourteen /40 caliber guns, twenty 6-pounder () guns, eight 1-pounder () guns, four machine guns, and four 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. "Kearsarge" had a very low freeboard, which resulted in her guns becoming unusable in bad weather.
