Wilton's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Daly, asked Murdoch to acquire particular helicopter gunships, for example, the AH-1 HueyCobra for Vietnam, to help the more defenseless troop-conveying "slicks". Murdoch to a great extent overlooked the proposal, advising his staff to treat the Army's suggestion with a lesser need than "anything we currently have on our 'shopping list. His inclination was for V/STOL fixed-wing air ship like the Harrier Jump Jet, which he thought would open "another period in close help air ship". In the occasion, the Federal government reserved eleven AH-1G HueyCobras for buy in 1971, however the arrangement never proceeded because of Australia's withdrawal from South East Asia. Murdoch's inability to welcome the requirement for collaboration with land powers has been accused for encouraging long-running animosity between the administrations, which twenty years after the fact would add to the administration's choice to exchange the RAAF's war zone helicopters to the Army. Flying corps student of history Alan Stephens fought that regardless of Murdoch's "capability" and "great personality", his "understanding of air control in its fullest sense and treatment of between administration legislative issues were separately insufficient and disastrousÃÂ ... An age of lieutenant-colonels and majors had come to trust that the RAAF did not think about armed force backing, and they were to convey that conviction into the 1970s and past". Murdoch additionally contradicted sending Canberra fly aircraft to Vietnam on what were later portrayed in the official post-war history of the RAAF as "misdirecting" grounds that the sort was inadmissible for low-level strike and close help; their organization proceeded in April 1967.
