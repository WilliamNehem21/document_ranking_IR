Neither one of the opponents expected the conflict at the definite minute or spot where it happened. The French moved first to Tienen, (as though to compromise Zoutleeuw, relinquished by the French in October 1705), preceding turning southwards, setting out toward Jodoigne Ã¢ÂÂ this line of walk took Villeroi's military towards the restricted gap of dry ground between the Mehaigne and Petite Gheete streams near the little towns of Ramillies and Taviers; however neither authority very refreshing how far his rival had voyage. Villeroi still accepted (on 22 May) the Allies were an entire day's walk away when in truth they had stayed outdoors close Corswaren trusting that the Danish squadrons will make up for lost time; as far as it matters for him, Marlborough esteemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in actuality he was presently moving toward the level of Mont St. AndrÃÂ© with the expectation of setting up a campsite close Ramillies (see map at right). Be that as it may, the Prussian infantry was not there. Marlborough wrote to Lord Raby, the English inhabitant at Berlin: "On the off chance that it ought to satisfy God to give us triumph over the adversary, the Allies will be little obliged to the King [Frederick] for the achievement."
