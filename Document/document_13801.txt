Horner thought he had discovered the instrument driving this advancement, expounding on thoughts he had grown even before he had researched Landslide Butte. The creatures were living on a tight strip on the east-bank of Laramidia, circumscribing the Western Interior Seaway and compelled in the west by the high proto-Rocky Mountains. Amid the Bearpaw Transgression ocean levels were rising, relentlessly diminishing the width of their seaside living space from going to . This prompted more grounded determination weights, the severest for "Achelousaurus" that lived amid the stage that the beach front strip was at its tightest. The lower number of people that the littler territory could have supported comprised a populace bottleneck, making fast development conceivable. Expanded sexual determination would have incited changes in the sexual ornamentation, for example, spikes, horns and supervisors. A decreased natural worry by lower ocean levels then again, would be encapsulated by versatile radiation. That sexual determination had without a doubt been the fundamental system would be demonstrated by the way that youthful people of each of the three populaces were very much like: they all had two decoration spikes, a little nasal horn indicating the front, and orbital horns as marginally raised handles. Just in the grown-up stage did they start to vary. As indicated by Horner, this likewise demonstrated the populaces were in all respects firmly related.
