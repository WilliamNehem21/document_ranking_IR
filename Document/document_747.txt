Bones in the auxiliary internment were masterminded without regard for anatomical request; it is conceivable to accept that the circulation procedure was the aftereffect of representative customs that demonstrated the changing of the expired's job by fusing the person in question into the gathering of illustrious precursors. Ceramics vessels were saved beside the optional entombment remains; they were fixed over sustenance contributions implied as a sustenance supply for the dead, giving proof for the execution of Kispu (supporting and thinking about one's progenitor through a customary supply of nourishment and drink). Many pilled vessels give proof that the living partook and ate with their precursors, adoring them. PfÃÂ¤lzner contends for a third internment process which he calls the tertiary entombment; the eastern assembly of the hypogeum was utilized as an ossuary where human remains and creature bones left from the Kispu were blended and pilled. PfÃÂ¤lzner infer that bones left in that chamber were kept there in light of the fact that they had turned out to be pointless in funerary customs, along these lines the chamber was their last resting spot. Bones in the eastern chamber were put away with no regard for the solidarity of an individual, showing that the people covered were currently part of the aggregate gathering of progenitors; this did not imply that the people were never again thought about, as the numerous dishes in the chamber demonstrate the continuation of nourishment contributions to those precursors.
