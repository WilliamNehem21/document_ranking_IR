In February 1927 she went to the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and become friends with the Indian patriot pioneer Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she was chosen to the Labor Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the definition of gathering strategy. Her development was noted with endorsement by Beatrice Webb, who found in her a future contender for high officeÃ¢ÂÂin front of progressively senior Labor ladies, for example, Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A vigorous campaigner for ladies' correspondence, she tested the exaggeration of voteless more youthful ladies as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson casted a ballot in the House of Commons for the bill that turned into the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, giving the vote to all ladies matured 21 or over. Amid the discussion she stated: "[W]e are doing finally an incredible demonstration of equity to the ladies of the countryÃÂ ... similarly as we have [previously] opened the way to the more established ladies, today around evening time we are opening it to the individuals who are simply entering on the limit of life and in whose hands is the new existence of things to come nation that we are going to assemble".
