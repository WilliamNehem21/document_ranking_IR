Maiden Castle had been abandoned by the end of the 1st century, a time when "Durnovaria" (Dorchester) rose to prominence as the "civitas", or regional capital, of the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest England. However, in July 2015 archaeologists from Bournemouth University discovered the remains of the Iron Age settlement of Duropolis and believe that the abandonment of the fort may be connected with the new site. According to the ancient geographer Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd centuryÂ AD, "Dunium" was the main settlement of the Durotriges. Although "Dunium" has long been thought to refer to Maiden Castle, Hod Hill and Hengistbury have been identified as two other possible sites for "Dunium". "Dunium" may have derived from British "duno-" which meant "a fort". Sometime after 367, a Romano-Celtic temple was built at Maiden Castle in the eastern half of the hill fort. The date was deduced from a hoard of coins discovered beneath a mosaic floor in the temple. A central room, measuring square, was surrounded by a passageway, similar to many Romano-Celtic temples found in the south of England. Nearby were two other buildings: a rectangular building with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest, and a circular building that may have been a shrine. At the same time as the temple was built, the fort's eastern gateway was refurbished; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway.
