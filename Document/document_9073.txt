In September 1928, Leane gave police security to non-association strikebreakers got to chip away at the Port Adelaide wharves to evade an argument about the modern honor that secured the waterfront. Leane went to the degree of expressly directing police tasks, in spite of an absence of turmoil toward the start of the question. There were recommendations that socialists were meddling in inward association consultations to determine the issue. After seven days, the proceeded with work of non-association work brought about huge brutality on the waterfront. On the morning of 27 September, a horde of between 4,000Ã¢ÂÂ 5,000 unionists and others overran the Port Adelaide wharves, boarding ships and harming and threatening strikebreakers. That evening, a horde of 2,000 walked the from Port Adelaide to Outer Harbor to go up against the strikebreakers working there. Leane, joined by only one investigator, met the pioneers and endeavored to deter them from entering the wharf zone. Rather, the group flooded forward towards the docks. Be that as it may, Leane, his overseers and around 150 mounted and foot police quickly set into movement plans to initially separate the mass of the group among the structures, at that point cordon off a huge bit of it in an open designation. For quite a while they stayed at a stalemate, however the group in the long run scattered having been unfit to approach any of the strikebreakers or the vessels they were taking a shot at. The unionists had assaulted various police and police steeds, there had been a lot of stone tossing by the group, and the police had utilized their rod unreservedly now and again. The occasions of the day were depicted in "The Register" as "likely without parallel ever of state".
