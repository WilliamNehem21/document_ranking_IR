They perceived Alfred Tichborne's newborn child, Henry Alfred, as the twelfth baronet. Woman Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had at first acknowledged the proof from Australia however altered her opinion not long after the Claimant's entry in England. Woman Tichborne's sibling Henry Seymour condemned the Claimant as false when he found that the last neither talked nor got French (Roger's first language as a kid) and did not have any hint of a French intonation. The Claimant was unfit to distinguish a few relatives and grumbled about endeavors to get him out by giving him impostors. Vincent Gosford, a previous Tichborne Park steward, was disinterested by the Claimant, who, when solicited to name the substance from a fixed bundle that Roger left with Gosford before his flight in 1853, said he couldn't recollect. The family trusted that the Claimant had obtained from Bogle and different sources data that empowered him to show some learning of the family's issues, including, for instance, the areas of specific pictures in Tichborne Park. Aside from Lady Tichborne, an inaccessible cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the main connection who acknowledged the Claimant as certifiable; be that as it may, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and keeping up her help, the Claimant's position stayed solid.
