ÃÂthelwulf's notoriety among students of history was poor in the twentieth century. In 1935, the student of history R. H. Hodgkin ascribed his journey to Rome to "the eccentric devotion which had driven him to leave his kingdom during a period of extraordinary peril", and portrayed his marriage to Judith as "the habit of a man feeble before his time". To Stenton during the 1960s he was "a religious and unambitious man, for whom commitment in war and governmental issues was an unwelcome result of rank". One nonconformist was Finberg, who in 1964 portrayed him as "a lord whose valor in war and august consideration reviewed the figures of the chivalrous age", yet in 1979 Enright stated: "More than everything else he seems to have been an illogical religious lover." Early medieval authors, particularly Asser, underline his religiosity and his inclination for accord, found in the concessions made to turn away a common war on his arrival from Rome. In Story's view "his heritage has been blurred by allegations of intemperate devotion which (to present day sensibilities at any rate) has appeared inconsistent with the requests of early medieval majesty". In 839 an anonymous Anglo-Saxon ruler kept in touch with the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious requesting authorization to go through his domain while in transit to Rome, and relating an English minister's fantasy which predicted debacle except if Christians deserted their transgressions. This is presently accepted to have been an unrealised venture of Egbert toward a mind-blowing finish, yet it was once ascribed to ÃÂthelwulf, and seen as showing what Story calls his notoriety for "sensational devotion", and untrustworthiness for wanting to relinquish his kingdom toward the start of his rule.
