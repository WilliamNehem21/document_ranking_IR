Later in 1994, Kielan-Jaworowska and the Russian scientist Petr P. Gambaryan referenced caudal (tail) vertebrae which may have had a place with "Catopsbaatar"; this attribution is questionable, since they may rather have a place with the related "Tombaatar" (named in 1997). A fourth skull (PIN 4537/4, an adolescent), found amid the 1975 SovietÃ¢ÂÂMongolian Expedition, was referenced by Gambaryan and Kielan-Jaworowska in 1995. Canadian palaontologist Phillip J. Currie found another "Catopsbaatar" example amid the 1999 Dinosaurs of the Gobi endeavor, composed by the American Nomadic Expeditions Company. Housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar as PM120/107, this most totally protected realized example comprises of the total skull (which might be somewhat smoothed) and incomplete skeleton of a grown-up person. The example has rather total fore-and rear appendages, which were obscure for the sort up to that point and which are commonly once in a while saved in multituberculates. Its pelvic ilia were stolen and wrecked by a student on visit at the Natural History Museum of Oslo, when it was set up in 2000. The example was accounted for in 2002 by Kielan-Jaworowska, Norwegian scientist JÃÂ¸rn Hurum, Currie and Mongolian scientist Rinchen Barsbold, who likewise referenced another skull (PIN 4537/5, an adolescent) discovered amid the 1975 endeavor. "Catopsalis joyneri", the premise of the name "C. catopsaloides", was moved to the new family "Valenopsalis" in 2015.
