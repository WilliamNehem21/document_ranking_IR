Hereditary examination of Sumatran rhino populaces has recognized three unmistakable hereditary ancestries. The channel among Sumatra and Malaysia was not as noteworthy a boundary for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains along the length of Sumatra, for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more firmly related than the rhinos on the opposite side of the mountains in western Sumatra. Truth be told, the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so minimal hereditary fluctuation, the populaces were likely not separate amid the Pleistocene, when ocean levels were much lower and Sumatra shaped piece of the territory. The two populaces of Sumatra and Malaysia, in any case, are close enough hereditarily that interbreeding would not be tricky. The rhinos of Borneo are adequately unmistakable that preservation geneticists have exhorted against intersection their genealogies with different populaces. Protection geneticists have as of late concentrated the decent variety of the quality pool inside these populaces by distinguishing microsatellite loci. The consequences of beginning testing discovered dimensions of fluctuation inside Sumatran rhino populaces practically identical to those in the number of inhabitants in the less imperiled African rhinos, however the hereditary decent variety of Sumatran rhinos is a zone of proceeding with study.
