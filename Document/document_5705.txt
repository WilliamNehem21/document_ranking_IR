Edmonds was established in 1876 and got its first railroad in 1891, developed by the Seattle and Montana Railroad among Seattle and British Columbia. The Great Northern Railway later procured the railroad and finished its cross-country course to Seattle in 1893, conveying long-remove traveler administration to Edmonds. The first station was situated on the west side of the tracks from downtown and mocked as out of reach and undersized for the developing city. A formal examination of stations crosswise over Snohomish County by the Washington State Railroad Commission in 1909 prompted a court request for Great Northern to improve their stops, including a modernized office for Edmonds at James Street, which the railroad opposed in their fizzled intrigue to the state court. Incredible Northern later consented to manufacture the new warehouse after further interview with Edmonds city pioneers over its area and conveniences. Later visits by the commission pulled in hordes of up to a hundred natives, and the city consented to an option to proceed establishment with Great Northern for the new warehouse in January 1910. The railroad and city kept on argueing over the proposed terminal's separation from James Street until the council of trade mediated and mentioned a trade off be come to.
