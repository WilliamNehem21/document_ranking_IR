Like Ice-T's gangsta rap collections, "Body Count's" material centered around different social and political issues, with tunes concentrating on themes going from police mercilessness to sedate maltreatment. As per Ernie C, "Everyone expounds on whatever they got the hang of growing up, and we were no exemption. Like The Beach Boys sing about the shoreline, we sing about the manner in which we grew up." Ice-T expresses that ""Body Count" was an irate record. It was intended to be a dissent record. I put my resentment in it, while binding it with dim cleverness." The verbally expressed presentation, "Smoked Pork" highlights Ice-T assuming the jobs of a hoodlum claiming to be apparently stranded driver and a cop who won't help. The track starts with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their vehicle towards a squad car, and afterward Ice-T requests the weapon Mooseman has and advises Mooseman to remain in the vehicle, a lot to Mooseman's embarrassment, as Mooseman needed to murder the cop in this round. Ice-T at that point approaches the policeman, professing to be a stranded driver, requesting help, yet the policeman can't, saying: "Nah, that is not my activity! My activity's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", at that point disclosing to him that "my activity is eatin' these doughnuts". At the point when the officer perceives Ice-T, shots are heard. The last voice on the track is Ice-T affirming his character.
