After the loss of four speedy wickets, the Compton and Yardley chose to not play at any balls that were not at stake of the stumps, and Lindwall and Johnston were taken off to recover in front of the second new ball. Australia had the choice of taking the new ball just before the coffee break, however Bradman chose to pause so his two pacemen could have an additional 20 minutes to renew their vitality levels. In the mean time, Johnson and Toshack worked, and the English couple played them mindfully and serenely. At tea, England had recouped to be 129/4, with Compton on 51 and Yardley 42.

After tea, Lindwall and Johnston came back with the new ball, however the previous seemed, by all accounts, to be drained and ailing in soul in his first finished. Compton edged Johnston into the slips, where Miller took a low catch, finishing his innings for 53. One run later, Lindwall cut Yardley's off stump with the principal bundle of the following over to leave England at 134/6; the home captain had made 44 preceding an outswinger had avoided his bat as he endeavored to play a back foot protective shot. Evans went to the wrinkle and endeavored to counter-assault, hitting Lindwall for a limit past square leg. Johnston at that point expelled Evans for nine, gotten by a jumping Miller from a swing of the bat wide outside off stump, leaving the hosts at 145/7.
