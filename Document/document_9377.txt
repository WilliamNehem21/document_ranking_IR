Sir Thomas Lewknor was a supporter of the House of Lancaster amid the Wars of the Roses, which started in 1455. At the point when Richard of the House of York climbed to the position of authority as Richard III in 1483, Lewknor was blamed for conspiracy and of bringing men-at-arms up in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, were offered authorization to collect men and attack Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It isn't recorded whether the attack proceeded, and Thackray proposes that Lewknor surrendered absent much obstruction. His property was reallocated, and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the stronghold. On Henry VII's promotion to the English position of authority the attainder was repudiated, and Bodiam Castle was come back to Lewknor. Be that as it may, not all the encompassing area was come back to the family until 1542. Ownership of Bodiam Castle went through a few ages of the Lewknor family. In spite of the fact that the legacy of the chÃÂ¢teau can be followed through the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of years, there is little to show how it was utilized in this period, or if the family invested much energy in it.
