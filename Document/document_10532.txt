The library, its dividers fixed with cabinets, includes a designed mantelpiece looking like the Tower of Babel. The hooded chimneypiece speaks to the "scattering of dialects", with figures portraying Nimrod administering over the components of discourse. Two trumpeters speak to the pronouns, a ruler epitomizes the action word, a doorman the thing, and various other plated and painted figures are shown. The roof is partitioned into eight compartments, with delineations of the six authors of law and theory, Moses, St. Paul, Luther, Mahomet, Aristotle and Justinian. An enlightened letters in order frieze of design and the visual expressions going around the shelves finishes the plan, with the letters of the letter set joined, including a letter "H" falling beneath the cornice. Because of "H"- dropping being a social unthinkable in Victorian occasions, Handley-Read portrayed it as the "most celebrated of every one of Burges' jokes". Specialists and skilled workers are highlighted at work on each lettered entryway of the shelves that encompass the room. In a board in one of the coated entryways which open onto the greenhouse, Burges is appeared before a model of the Tower House. He includes as Architect, the A shaping the principal letter of the letter set frieze. Both the Architecture Cabinet and the Great Bookcase remained in this room. The recolored glass windows in the room speak to painting, engineering and form, and were painted by Weekes.
