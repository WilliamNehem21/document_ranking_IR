Jin Kobayashi started stating "School Rumble", his introduction work, in 2002. He expressed to a group of people at Honolulu's 2006 Kawaii Kon tradition that he began composing the arrangement since he considered the possibility of a manga including a reprobate beginning to look all starry eyed at intriguing. Kobayashi's most loved character, Kenji Harima, depends to a great extent on an amalgam of different companions, despite the fact that he gauges "about 30%" of Harima is an impression of himself. In any case, in spite of putting the vast majority of his own emotions into the female characters, he expressed that Ryuuhei Suga, a minor supporting character, is the most self-portraying. A large portion of different characters depend on recollections of previous secondary school colleagues; Kobayashi reviewed that he had no genuine thought of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until some other time, when he heard the voice performing artists' elucidations amid the generation of the anime arrangement, that he knew how they should sound. He recognized that a few characters are more created than others; in answer to a fan question about the puzzling Akira Takano, he conceded that, notwithstanding the closeness he feels for her, he didn't put much accentuation on Takano and intended to build up her affection life gradually. Kobayashi deliberately based his story curves on errors which he at that point settle, since he accepts "in the event that there's no misconception, at that point there's no entertaining story." He asserts that none of his accounts depend on genuine occasions, in spite of the fact that when squeezed concedes the likelihood of certain similarities yet without revealing explicit subtleties.
