As indicated by Brook, "in each age, a chivalrous sage battles to safeguard Benjamin from lack of definitionÃ¢ÂÂand perpetually comes up short." Benjamin left no journal and pulverized his own papers, by which "the assignment of future analysts and history specialists was made exceedingly troublesome and arduous". After his demise, Benjamin was once in a while expounded on, rather than Davis and other Confederate pioneers. Some portion of this was because of Benjamin denying his potential biographers of source material, however even Davis, in his two-volume war diary, makes reference to him just twice. Evans recommends that as Davis composed the books to some degree to shield and memorialize his place ever, it would not have been normal for him to give much credit to Benjamin. Davis, amidst after war business battles, may have loathed Benjamin's prosperity as a counselor, or may have expected that charges of association in Lincoln's death would again be made against the two men. Stream agrees that Benjamin's after war achievement, that started as Davis lay in jail and different Confederates battled for survival, may have soured Southerners towards the previous secretary, however that enemy of Semitism was likewise likely a factor. "For the gatekeepers of Confederate memory after Reconstruction, Benjamin turned into a sort of pet Jew, for the most part overlooked, however then jogged out at ideal minutes to shield the isolated South against charges of dogmatism."
