"B. aemula" is most regularly found in profound sandy soils, either on ridges or flattish territories which might be occasionally wet. On beach front ridges in southern Queensland, it replaces "Banksia serrata", which involves a similar specialty toward the south. The last regions, with open forest or heathland, are known as wallum. In Queensland it is found with "Banksia robur", with the last species found in compliment wetter zones and "B.aemula" found on rises. It is additionally found with "Banksia oblongifolia" in Queensland. In certain territories of wallum, it might develop as a little tree, alongside mallee types of the red bloodwood ("Corymbia gummifera"). In Cooloola National Park, it is an intermittent new plant (alongside "Melaleuca quinquenervia" and "Eucalyptus umbra") in shut graminoid heathland, a network of bushes high containing "Xanthorrhoea fulva", "Empodisma less", "Petrophile shirleyae", and "Hakea" and "Leptospermum" species. On the New South Wales Central Coast, it by and large develops as a high bush and is an overhang part of "Banksia aemula" open heathland, situated on seaside headlands on very drained Pleistocene white sands overlying Triassic and Permian strata. Regions incorporate Wybung Head in Munmorah State Conservation Area, and close Myall Lakes. Different plants it develops in relationship with incorporate "Ricinocarpos pinifolius", "Brachyloma daphnoides", "Dillwynia glaberrima", "D. retorta", "Allocasuarina distyla", "Bossiaea ensata", "Aotus ericoides", "Phyllota phylicoides", and "Empodisma less". Sandmining has destroyed a significant part of the network around Redhead. In less drained yellower sands, the network (and "B.aemula") is supplanted by a taller heath containing "B.serrata" and "B.oblongifolia".
