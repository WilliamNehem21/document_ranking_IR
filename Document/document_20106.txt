With the Wildcats' record sitting at 11â13 overall and 6â6 in conference play headed into a February road game against conference leader LSU, Farmer remained in Lexington with a combination of a stomach virus and the flu. Teammates LaRon Ellis, Chris Mills, and Derrick Miller had also been ill, but all recovered in time to make the trip. Farmer shot just 2 of 14 in limited minutes in the month of February. In Kentucky's final home game of the season, Farmer hit a three-pointer â his only points of the game â with two seconds left to lift the Wildcats to a 70â69 win over Ole Miss. The following game, Farmer missed a potentially game-winning jump shot at the buzzer in a 68â67 loss at Mississippi State to end the Wildcats' regular season. In its first game of the Southeastern Conference Tournament the next week, Kentucky lost to Vanderbilt 77â63 in a game where Farmer missed all four of his field goal attempts. Finishing with a 13â19 record â the team's worst record since the 1926-27 season â the Wildcats were not invited to any postseason tournament. At the team's annual postseason awards banquet, Farmer received the free throw award.
