In the system's 2012 upfronts, GSN declared designs to dispatch another class of programming entitled "Genuine Games," which would incorporate arrangement that "happen in true settings and highlight genuine hazard and reward, champs and washouts, satisfaction and dissatisfaction." "Family Trade" first showed up in the system's upfronts on March 21, 2012, as a half-hour unscripted TV drama under the new classification, at that point under the title "The Family Trade". Regardless of this, the Stones demanded that there were no "amusement" parts of the arrangement, rather that everything seen on the show was identified with business. After three test crowds gave positive audits of the pilot, GSN continued to arrange eight scenes of the arrangement on August 9, 2012. Recording for the eight scenes, which started September 1, went on for around five or a month and a half. The arrangement was initially expected to debut on March 5, 2013; on February 1, GSN pushed the debut go back seven days to March 12 (a particular reason was not given). In spite of the fact that the system never made an official cancelation declaration, the show has not disclosed on GSN since the finish of the principal season and is along these lines attempted to have been dropped.
