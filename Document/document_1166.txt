The USÃÂ Navy directed its first assaults against the Japanese home islands in mid-February 1945. This activity was attempted basically to annihilate Japanese air ship that could assault the USÃÂ Navy and Marine Corps powers required with the arrival on Iwo Jima on 19ÃÂ February, and was directed by Task Force 58 (TFÃÂ 58). This team was the US Navy's principle striking power in the Pacific, and contained 11 armada transporters, five light plane carrying warships and an amazing power of escorts. TFÃÂ 58 moved toward Japan undetected, and assaulted runways and air ship processing plants in the Tokyo district on 16 and 17ÃÂ February. The American maritime pilots asserted 341 "kills" against Japanese airplane and the annihilation of a further 160 on the ground for the loss of 60 air ship in battle and 28 in mishaps. A few boats were likewise assaulted and soaked in Tokyo Bay. The real Japanese airplane misfortunes in this activity are questionable, be that as it may; the Imperial General Headquarters conceded losing 78 air ship in dogfights and did not give a figure to those devastated on the ground. TFÃÂ 58's boats were not assaulted amid this period in Japanese waters, and on 18ÃÂ February cruised south to give direct help to the arrivals on Iwo Jima. The Task Force endeavored a second strike against the Tokyo zone on 25ÃÂ February, yet this activity was baffled by awful climate. The American boats cruised south, and assaulted Okinawa from 1ÃÂ March.
