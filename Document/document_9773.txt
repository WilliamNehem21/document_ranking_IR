As right on time as 1851, New York Congressman William Duer claimed that Patterson had made the gold dollar excessively little in distance across deliberately to incite analysis. Patterson resigned that year following 16 years in his position, and under his successor, George N. Eckert, annular gold dollar and half dollar designs were struck. "Open Ledger" detailed that albeit gold dollars would not be struck in annular structure, gold half dollars would be, to help fill the requirement for change.

Pettit answered, expressing that none had been saved, however encased a silver bit of identical size. He noticed that while there would be specialized troubles in the creation of the annular dollar, these could be survived. In a letter dated May 10, Pettit proposed an oval-formed holed piece, or a rakish molded coin, which would diminish the creation issues. Pettit kicked the bucket all of a sudden on May 31; Guthrie did not give the issue a chance to fall, yet questioned Pettit's substitution, James Ross Snowden, concerning the issue on June 7. As U.S. coins were required to endure some gadget symbolic of freedom, the secretary trusted that specialists could be discovered who could locate some such plan for an annular coin.
