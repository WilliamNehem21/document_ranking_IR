Frightened by the possibility of a furnished resistance in Bjelovar and the encompassing field, Kvaternik chose an expansive region in and around the town where Serbs were to be "washed down". "For each Croat murdered," he stated, "we should execute 100 Serbs." The incapacitating and capturing of VKJ work force by the UstaÃÂ¡e was joined by various occurrences, in which around 20 equipped VKJ troops and Serb regular citizens were slaughtered. Kvaternik expected that these passings would just improve the probability of a furnished revolt and turned out to be considerably progressively watchful when he heard bits of gossip that Bjelovar's Serbs were arranging an uprising to agree with the gala day of St. George "(ÃÂurÃÂevdan)", on 6 May. Inside Minister Andrija ArtukoviÃÂ touched base in Bjelovar in the wake of hearing such gossipy tidbits. At a gathering with Verhas and his lieutenants, he expressed that "genuine activity" would need to be taken to "make an impression on the foes of the UstaÃÂ¡e and the NDH". On 26 April, Kvaternik and his nearest partner, Ivica ÃÂ ariÃÂ, composed the mass capture of 530 Serb townspeople from GrubiÃÂ¡no Polje. Thirty UstaÃÂ¡e partook in the captures. The prisoners were transported to the Danica camp, close Koprivnica, and from that point taken to UstaÃÂ¡e camps at GospiÃÂ, Pag Island, Jasenovac and Stara GradiÃÂ¡ka, where most were murdered.
