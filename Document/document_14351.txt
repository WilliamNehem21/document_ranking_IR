In 1876 the zoologist Joel Asaph Allen found the remaining parts of "Canis mississippiensis" (Allen 1876) and related these with "C.dirus" (Leidy 1858) and "Canis indianensis" (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three examples, Allen thought it best to leave every example recorded under its temporary name until progressively material could be found to uncover their relationship. In 1908 the scientist John Campbell Merriam started recovering various fossilized bone sections of a substantial wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 he had observed a skeleton adequately total to have the capacity to formally perceive these and the recently discovered examples under the name "C.dirus" (Leidy 1858). Since the tenets of terminology stipulated that the name of an animal types ought to be the most seasoned name at any point connected to it, Merriam along these lines chosen the name of Leidy's 1858 example, "C.dirus". In 1915 the scientist Edward Troxell demonstrated his concurrence with Merriam when he pronounced "C.indianensis" an equivalent word of "C.dirus". In 1918, subsequent to examining these fossils, Merriam proposed merging their names under the different sort "Aenocyon" (from "Aenos", horrendous and "cyon", wolf) to progress toward becoming "Aenocyon dirus", however not every person concurred with this terminated wolf being set in another family discrete from the class "Canis". "Canis ayersi" (Sellards 1916) and "Aenocyon dirus" (Merriam 1918) were perceived as equivalent words of "C.dirus" by the scientist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. The majority of the above taxa were pronounced equivalent words of "C.dirus" in 1979, as indicated by the scientist Ronald M. Nowak.
