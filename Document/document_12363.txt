As the USMC needed a generously improved Harrier without the advancement of another motor, the arrangement for Harrier II improvement was approved by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) in 1976. The United States Navy (USN), which had customarily secured military airplane for the USMC, demanded that the new structure be confirmed with flight testing. McDonnell Douglas altered two AV-8As with new wings, reexamined admissions, upgraded exhaust spouts, and other streamlined changes; the adjusted forward fuselage and cockpit found on all ensuing air ship were not joined on these models. Assigned YAV-8B, the main changed over air ship flew on 9 November 1978, because of Charles Plummer. The airplane performed three vertical departures and floated for seven minutes at LambertÃ¢ÂÂ St. Louis International Airport. The second flying machine pursued on 19 February 1979, however slammed that November because of motor flameout; the pilot shot out securely. Flight testing of these changed AV-8s proceeded into 1979. The outcomes demonstrated more prominent than anticipated drag, hampering the airplane's greatest speed. Further refinements to the streamlined profile yielded little improvement. Positive test results in different zones, including payload, range, and V/STOL execution, prompted the honor of an improvement contract in 1979. The agreement stipulated an acquirement of 12 flying machine at first, trailed by a further 324.
