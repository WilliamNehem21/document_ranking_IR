Birley, his arm in a sling, continued direction of the regiment on 13ÃÂ January 1942, and when a German Africa Corps counter-assault pushed the British and Commonwealth powers back to Gazala soon thereafter, he told Birley Force, a composite regiment to which the second Royal Gloucestershire Hussars contributed the HQ and a squadron of tanks. The regiment was re-prepared in the main seven day stretch of February; F Squadron with the new M3 Grant tanks, and G and H Squadrons with Crusaders, and in May its quality was 36 officers, 563 different positions and 48 tanks. Toward the finish of May, with the 22nd Armored Brigade currently came back to its parent unit, the first Armored Division, the regiment saw activity in the Battle of Gazala. It battled in the regions of Bir el Harmat and 'Knightsbridge', a cautious box held by the 201st Guards Motor Brigade some south-west of Tobruk. Toward the beginning of the fight, F Squadron lost everything except one of its Grants, and the regiment was immediately decreased to 16 Crusaders and two Honies. These were shaped into a composite squadron under order of the third County of London Yeomanry. On 1ÃÂ June the regiment gave over its residual Crusaders to the fourth County of London Yeomanry and was removed from the line for a refit the following day.
