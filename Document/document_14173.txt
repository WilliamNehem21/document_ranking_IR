Kripke rather supported the "one of a kind and fundamentally intriguing" self-encased scenes, which in some cases emerged from the authors' unused thoughts. From the earliest starting point, Kripke wanted to include an insidious comedian since he felt that "jokesters in a setting where shouldn't be are mother truckin' alarming". To fit with the arrangement, the jokester turned into a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu folklore. This choice made the comedian "less fulfilling", to Kripke's dismay, since it restricted the jokester related scenes. Another component of old stories supported by Kripke was the narrative of Robert Johnson, which he concentrated on in his first screenplay as an essayist. He found the legend like "Heavenly", noticing, "It's a bit of genuine American history and old stories, it's an American repulsiveness story, it happens on the dusty byways of provincial America, and it has incredible music." However, the legend happens in the mid twentieth century, and kept the consideration of Sam and Dean. To bypass this, essayist Sera Gamble proposed Johnson's story be made into a subplot nitty gritty in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more arrangements. Despite the fact that Gamble imagined the evil presence's hellhound as being comparative in appearance to a Rottweiler, Kripke felt it would "look dumb". The animal was rather made imperceptible, which Gamble accepts gave it an all the more startling nearness.
