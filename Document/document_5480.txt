The Mannerheim Line, a variety of Finnish barrier structures, was situated on the Karelian Isthmus roughly from the Soviet outskirt. The Red Army fighters on the Isthmus numbered 250,000, confronting 130,000 Finns. The Finnish order conveyed a barrier inside and out of around 21,000 men in the territory before the Mannerheim Line to postpone and harm the Red Army before it achieved the line. In battle, the most extreme reason for disarray among Finnish fighters was Soviet tanks. The Finns had couple of hostile to tank weapons and deficient preparing in current enemy of tank strategies. As indicated by Trotter, the favored Soviet heavily clad strategy was a basic frontal charge, the shortcomings of which could be abused. The Finns discovered that at short proximity, tanks could be managed from various perspectives; for instance, logs and crowbars stuck into the bogie wheels would regularly immobilize a tank. Before long, Finns handled a superior specially appointed weapon, the Molotov mixed drink, a glass bottle loaded up with combustible fluids and with a straightforward hand-lit breaker. Molotov mixed drinks were in the long run mass-created by the Finnish "Alko" mixed refreshment organization and packaged with matches with which to light them. 80 Soviet tanks were devastated in the outskirt zone commitment.
