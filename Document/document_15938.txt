As the highway approaches Thompson, USÂ 2 leaves the western unit of the Hiawatha National Forest and enters the Lake Superior State Forest. The roadway runs along Lake Michigan to Manistique, crossing the Manistique River. The trunkline turns inland approaching Gulliver and then turns north-northeast to Blaney Park. The community there is a former logging town-turned-resort at the southern terminus of Mâ77; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s. From Blaney Park, USÂ 2 turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City. Where it intersects a former routing, the main highway crosses the CN Railway one last time and runs to the south of Engadine to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through Naubinway. After passing the community of Epoufette, USÂ 2 crosses the Cut River Bridge, over the Cut River. The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the Hiawatha National Forest near Brevort, running between Lake Michigan and Brevort Lake in the process. The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline, passing Mystery Spot near Gros Cap and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace. The USÂ 2 designation ends at the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with Iâ75. The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as Business Loop Iâ75 (BLÂ Iâ75).
