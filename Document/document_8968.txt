The Austro-Hungarian government accordingly chose to hand over the main part of its armada to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs without a shot being discharged. This was viewed as particular to giving the armada to the Allies, as the new state had proclaimed its lack of bias. Besides, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs had additionally not yet openly dismissed Emperor KarlÃÂ I, keeping the likelihood of transforming the Empire into a triple government alive. The exchange to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs started on the morning of 31 October, with Rear Admiral (German: "Konteradmiral") MiklÃÂ³s Horthy meeting delegates from the South Slav nationalities on board his leader, . After "short and cool" exchanges, the courses of action were settled and the handover was finished that evening. The Austro-Hungarian Naval Ensign was struck from "Viribus Unitis", and was trailed by the rest of the boats in the harbor. Power over the boats in the harbor, and the leader of the recently settled naval force for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, tumbled to Captain Janko VukoviÃÂ, who was raised to the position of naval commander and assumed control over Horthy's old duties as Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet.
