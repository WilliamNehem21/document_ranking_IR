It was not until Richard Carlile's 1818 preliminary for distributing "The Age of Reason" that Paine's content turned into "the counter Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century unbeliever fomenters". In spite of the fact that the book had been selling a long time before the preliminary, once Carlile was captured and charged, 4,000 duplicates were sold in only a couple of months. At the preliminary itself, which made a media craze, Carlile read the aggregate of "The Age of Reason" into the court record, guaranteeing it an even more extensive distribution. Somewhere in the range of 1818 and 1822, Carlile professed to have "sent into flow close to 20,000 duplicates of the "Time of Reason"". Similarly as during the 1790s, it was the language that most maddened the experts in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her investigation of profanation in the nineteenth century, calls attention to, "at these preliminaries plain English was reconfigured as itself 'oppressive' and 'absurd.' The "Period of Reason" battle nearly tolled the hour when the words 'plain,' 'coarse,' 'normal,' and 'revolting' took on a disparaging importance." Carlile was indicted for obscenity and condemned to one year in jail, however gone through six years rather in light of the fact that he rejected any "legitimate conditions" on his discharge.
