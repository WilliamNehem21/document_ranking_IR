After Ernest kicked the bucket in 1971, Ruth succeeded him as their gathering's chief and essential channeler. She in this way started distributing records of her encounters and disclosures. In mid 1974, she anticipated that a space armada of considerate extraterrestrials, the Space Brothers, would arrive on Earth soon thereafter, which drove the Unarius Academy to buy a property to fill in as the arrival site. After the extraterrestrials neglected to show up, Norman said that injury she had endured in a previous existence had made her make an off base forecast. Resolute, she leased a structure for Unarius' gatherings and looked for exposure for the development, professing to have joined the Earth with an interplanetary confederation. She updated the Space Brothers' normal arrival date a few times, before at long last settling on 2001. Her wellbeing declined in the late 1980s, provoking her understudies to attempt to mend her with ceremonies of previous existence relapse. In spite of foreseeing that she would live to see the extraterrestrials land, Norman kicked the bucket in 1993. Unarius has kept on working after her demise, and shaped a governing body. Since the 2000s, pioneers have focused on individual change prompting profound change in mankind.
