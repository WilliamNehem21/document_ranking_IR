The African crake is a smallish crake, long with a wingspan. The male has blackish upperparts streaked with olive-darker, aside from the scruff and hindneck which are plain pale dark colored; there is a white streak from the base of the bill to over the eye. The sides of the head, foreneck, throat and bosom are somewhat blue dim, the flight plumes are dull darker, and the flanks and sides of the midsection are banished high contrast. The eye is red, the bill is ruddy, and the legs and feet are light dark colored or dim. The genders are comparable in appearance, despite the fact that the female is marginally littler and more blunt than the male, with a less differentiating head design. Youthful fowls have darker and more blunt upperparts than the grown-up, a dull bill, dim eye, and less notwithstanding on the underparts. There are no subspecific or other topographical varieties in plumage. This crake has a total shed in the wake of reproducing, primarily before movement. Despite the fact that this species happens in genuinely open territories, it comes up short on the unadulterated white undertail utilized for motioning in untamed water or gregarious species like the coots and moorhens.
