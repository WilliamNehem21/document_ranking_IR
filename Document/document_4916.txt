At the point when, in the prompt result of Leuctra, the Thebans had sent an envoy to Athens with updates on their triumph, the dispatcher was met with stony quiet. The Athenians at that point chose to exploit the Spartan disappointment, holding a meeting in Athens, in which the harmony terms proposed before in 371 BC were sanctioned by all urban communities (with the exception of Elis); and this time, the bargain expressly made the Peloponnesian urban areas, in the past under Spartan strength, free. Exploiting this, the Mantineans chose to bring together their settlements into a solitary city, and to sustain it; a choice which incredibly maddened Agesilaus. Besides, Tegea, bolstered by Mantinea, impelled the development of an Arcadian coalition. This prompted the Spartans pronouncing war on Mantinea, whereupon most of Arcadian urban areas assembled together to restrict the Spartans (in this manner framing the confederation that the Spartans were endeavoring to keep), and mentioned help from the Thebans. The Theban power arrived late in 370ÃÂ BC, and it was driven by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, both as of now Boeotarchs. As they traveled into Arcadia, the Thebans were joined by furnished contingents from a large number of Sparta's previous partners, swelling their powers to some 50Ã¢ÂÂ 70,000 men. In Arcadia Epaminondas urged the Arcadians to shape their proposed association, and to manufacture the new city of Megalopolis (as a focal point of intensity contradicted to Sparta).
