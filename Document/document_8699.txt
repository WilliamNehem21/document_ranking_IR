The quick and suffering achievement of "Limited consolidation Farm" overwhelmed the remainder of Gibbons' vocation. Neville felt that after so particular a triumph toward the beginning of her vocation, the rest was something of a let-down, notwithstanding her impressive industry and undoubted aptitudes. The 1985 release of "The Oxford Companion to English Literature" characterizes Gibbons exclusively as far as "Limited consolidation Farm"; it specifies none of her different worksÃ¢ÂÂwhile giving her "bÃÂªtes noires" Morgan and Mary Webb with full sections. To Gibbons, "Limited consolidation Farm" turned into "That Book" or "You-Know-What", its title never referenced. Regardless of her developing disturbance and communicated dislike for it, the book kept on being commended by progressive ages of faultfinders, Boston portrayed it as "one of those uncommon books of comic virtuoso that engraves itself on the cerebrum and can never a while later be destroyed". A progressively negative perspective on the book has been communicated by the artistic commentator Mary Beard, who thinks of it as "a somewhat controlling triumph of present day request, neatness, contraception and medication over these untidy, unique, country typesÃÂ ... I wound up shouting for the privileges of these poor nation society NOT to fall under the control of individuals like Flora".
