Michell endeavored to be as loyal to the novel as could be allowed, specifically staying away from what he felt was the cleaned, counterfeit feel of other period dramatizations set in the nineteenth century. The executive clarified, "I was frantically attempting to make it have an inclination that it could be going on in the following room. I endeavored to make it something which is completely about genuine individuals and not tied in with dressing or haircuts or rug". Thus, since he felt the sensible look of the age would make the film progressively sensational, Michell portrayed the performing artists without make-up, and denied them from looking excessively clean. Root remarked about the film's characteristic look in a meeting, "I fundamentally didn't wear any cosmetics [in the film], and my hair was clearly set in an unflattering manner... I guess the lighting was very unforgiving, too. None of us looked great". She said in a different meeting, "I needed to make Anne Elliot a to some degree plain lady who was not by any means hopeless yet had figured out how to be content in some way or another, but feelings are humming around her constantly". Root trusted the film's practical portrayal of the age was a key part of its allure.
