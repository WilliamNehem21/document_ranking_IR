While there are occupant populaces of the yellow-colored honeyeater all through its range, it is generally an occasional, latitudinal, daytime vagrant. Amid the harvest time (March to May) it relocates north along the good countries and waterfront edge of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring (August to October) of that year. The winged animals usually move in herds of 10 to 100 feathered creatures, however sometimes in bigger gatherings of up to at least 1,000 fowls. The gatherings can incorporate different species, for example, the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, boisterous friarbird and silvereye. They move in progressive rushes at a rate of up to a few thousand feathered creatures 60 minutes. More than 100,000 winged animals were recorded passing Hastings point in New South Wales throughout a solitary day in May 1965. The species can recognize geomagnetic fields and uses them to explore while moving. Tests where the vertical part of the attractive field was turned around demonstrate that the attractive compass of the yellow-colored honeyeater depends on the tendency of the field lines and not on extremity, which means they recognize the bearing of the equator and posts, instead of north and south. While their flight is one general way, it isn't in a straight line as the groups remain in vegetated territories, arrange holes in the mountain ranges and bypass around urban areas.
