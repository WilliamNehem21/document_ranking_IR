The mission was intended to most recent 75 hours and 55 circles. After the Agena lifted off at 10:00:00 EST, the Titan II rocket conveying Armstrong and Scott touched off at 11:41:02 EST, placing them into a circle from which they pursued the Agena. They accomplished the main consistently docking between two rocket. Contact with the team was discontinuous because of the absence of following stations covering their whole circles. While out of contact with the ground, the docked rocket started to roll, and Armstrong endeavored to address this with the Gemini's Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS). Following the prior counsel of Mission Control, they undocked, yet the roll expanded drastically until they were turning about once every second, showing an issue with Gemini's frame of mind control. Armstrong drew in the Reentry Control System (RCS) and killed the OAMS. Mission decides directed that once this framework was turned on, the rocket needed to reemerge at the following conceivable chance.
