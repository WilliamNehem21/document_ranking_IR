d. Lucas depicted the scene on "Redoutable": In not exactly thirty minutes our ship had been so dreadfully destroyed that she looked like minimal in excess of a load of flotsam and jetsam. In light of appearances, no uncertainty, the "Temeraire", presently hailed us to surrender and not draw out a futile obstruction. My answer was right away to arrange a few officers who were close me to flame back; which they did with extraordinary energetic willingness. At a similar minute nearly, the principle pole of the "Redoutable" fell on board the English ship. The two topmasts of the "Temeraire" at that point descended, falling on board of us. Our entire crap was stove in, steerage rudder and stern post all broke to chips, all the stern edge, and the decks shot through. All our own firearms were either crushed or gotten off by the broadsides of the "Triumph" and the "Temeraire"...ÃÂ The structure itself was perplexed, shot through from side to side; deck shafts were broken, port covers shredded away or thumped. Four of our six siphons were so harmed as to be pointless. The quarter-deck stepping stools were broken, which rendered correspondence with the remainder of the ship troublesome. Wherever the decks were strewn with dead men, lying underneath the trash. Out of a team of 634 men we had 522 "hors de battle"; of whom 300 were executed and 222 injured almost every one of the officers among themÃÂ ... The batteries and upper decks were for all intents and purposes relinquished Ã¢ÂÂ exposed of men and were not able longer to offer any opposition. Nobody who had not seen the province of "Redoutable" would ever frame a thought of her terrible condition. Truly I am aware of nothing ready that had not been hit by shot.
