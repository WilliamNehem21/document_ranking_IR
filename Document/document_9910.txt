As the Japanese progressed in the South West Pacific amid mid 1942, the RAAF quickly settled three warrior unitsÃ¢ÂÂNos.ÃÂ 75, 76 and 77 SquadronsÃ¢ÂÂoutfitted with Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks as of late conveyed from the United States. No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron was framed at RAAF Station Pearce, Western Australia, on 16ÃÂ March, with a supplement of three officers and 100 men. Briefly directed by Squadron Leader D. F. Forsyth, the unit was at first in charge of the protection of Perth. Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell accepted direction on 20ÃÂ April. The squadron exchanged to Batchelor Airfield close Darwin, Northern Territory, in August, the first RAAF contender unit to be positioned in the zone. Until this time, air protection over Darwin had been given by the P-40s flown by the USAAF's 49th Fighter Group. No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron moved to another of Darwin's satellite landing strips, Livingstone, in September. Among its pilots was John Gorton, future Prime Minister of Australia. No.ÃÂ 77 Squadron saw activity protecting Darwin from Japanese air assaults and guaranteed its first elevated triumph soon after 5ÃÂ a.m. on 23ÃÂ November 1942, when Cresswell wrecked a Mitsubishi "Betty" plane. It was the primary "slaughter" for an Australian squadron over the terrain, and the main night triumph over Australia. As of 24ÃÂ December, the unit's quality was twenty-four Kittyhawks.
