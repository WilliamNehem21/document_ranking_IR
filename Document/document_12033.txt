In the mid eighteenth century, Russians started to chase ocean otters in the Kuril Islands and sold them to the Chinese at Kyakhta. Russia was additionally investigating the far northern Pacific as of now, and sent Vitus Bering to delineate Arctic coast and discover courses from Siberia to North America. In 1741, on his second North Pacific voyage, Bering was wrecked off Bering Island in the Commander Islands, where he and a considerable lot of his team passed on. The enduring team individuals, which included naturalist Georg Steller, found ocean otters on the shorelines of the island and spent the winter chasing ocean otters and betting with otter pelts. They came back to Siberia, having executed almost 1,000 ocean otters, and had the capacity to direction high costs for the pelts. In this manner started what is at times called the "Incomparable Hunt", which would proceed for an additional hundred years. The Russians found the ocean otter unquestionably more significant than the sable skins that had driven and paid for the majority of their development crosswise over Siberia. In the event that the ocean otter pelts brought back by Bering's survivors had been sold at Kyakhta costs they would have paid for one tenth the expense of Bering's endeavor. In 1775 at Okhotsk, ocean otter pelts were worth 50Ã¢ÂÂ 80 rubles rather than 2.5 rubles for sable.
