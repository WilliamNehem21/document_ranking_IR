Brown's paper was approved for printing in May 1809, but did not appear in print until March the following year. In the meantime, Joseph Knight published "On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae", which appeared to draw heavily on Brown's unpublished material, without permission, and in most cases without attribution. It contained the first publication of Brown's "Josephia", for which two species were listed. The first, "Josephia sessilis", was based on one of Menzies' specimens: "This species, discovered by Mr. A. Menzies on the West coast of New Holland, is not unlike some varieties of "Ilex Aquifolium", and now in his Majesty's collection at Kew." The etymology of the specific epithet was not explicitly stated, but it is universally accepted that it comes from the Latin "sessilis" (sessile, stalkless), in reference to the sessile leaves of this species. Blame for the alleged plagiarism largely fell on Richard Salisbury, who had been present at Brown's readings and is thought to have provided much of the material for Knight's book. Salisbury was ostracized by the botanical community, which undertook to ignore his work as much as possible. By the time Brown's monograph appeared in print, Brown had exchanged the generic name "Josephia" for "Dryandra", giving the name "Dryandra floribunda" to Knight's "Josephia sessilis". As there were then no firm rules pertaining to priority of publication, Brown's name was accepted, and remained the current name for over a century.
