Scott came back to Kentucky from Philadelphia in June 1794, assembled 1,500 minute men, and joined Wayne at Fort Greeneville on July27. He and Thomas Barbee drove this power in help of Wayne's 1,000 customary troops. The joined power walked rapidly and caught the as of late cleared Indian town of Grand Glaize on August8. Here, Wayne requested the development of Fort Defiance, which took roughly seven days. Scott was in charge of the naming of the post; while watching its development, he announced, "I oppose the English, Indians, and every one of the fallen angels in damnation to take it." Based upon knowledge given by Scott's mounted volunteers, Wayne requested his power to walk toward Fort Miami on August14, envisioning a fight with a consolidated British and Indian power of 2,400 there. About 8:45a.m. on August20, Major William Price's detachment of volunteers drew in the Indian power close Fort Miami, starting the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The very much situated Indian power turned back Price's men, however Wayne requested his regulars to direct a vivacious blade charge, which steered the Indians. Major William Campbell, the British leader of Fort Miami, would not open the stronghold to his Indian partners, and Wayne's power won a definitive triumph.
