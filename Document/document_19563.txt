After the new specimens were announced, it was rumoured that a looted skull had found its way to a European museum through the black market. The poached elements were spotted in a private European collection by the French fossil trader FranÃ§ois EscuillÃ©, who notified Belgian palaeontologist Pascal Godefroit about them in 2011. They suspected the remains belonged to "Deinocheirus", and contacted the Korean-Mongolian team. EscuillÃ© subsequently acquired the fossils and donated them to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The recovered material consisted of a skull, a left hand, and feet, which had been collected in Mongolia, sold to a Japanese buyer, and resold to a German party. The team concluded that these elements belonged to specimen MPC-D 100/127, as the single leftover toe bone fit perfectly into the unprepared matrix of a poached foot, the bone and matrix matched in colour, and because the elements belonged to an individual of the same size, with no overlap in skeletal elements. On May 1, 2014, the fossils were repatriated to Mongolia by a delegation from the Belgian Museum, during a ceremony held at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. The reunited skeleton was deposited at the Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs in Ulaanbaatar, along with a "Tarbosaurus" skeleton which had also been brought back after being stolen. American palaeontologist Thomas R. Holtz stated in an interview that the new "Deinocheirus" remains looked like the "product of a secret love affair between a hadrosaur and "Gallimimus"".
