The gathering "Lansing for Cesar E. Chavez" was raising assets to rename the segment among Oakland and Pine boulevards in Old Town. Already, a segment of Grand Avenue was renamed for ChÃÂ¡vez in 1994, yet the voters toppled the choice. The renaming proposition was even referenced as an approach to unwind a labyrinth of various parts of Grand River Avenue going through Old Town. As of now, East Grand River Avenue and North Grand River Avenue connect between segments of Grand River Avenue, notwithstanding Grand Avenue which keeps running along the Grand River close downtown. While Lansing's Latino people group upheld the proposition, the business network contradicted it. One shop proprietor said she would have $10,000 in expenses related with a name change, including, "I believe there's numerous delightful approaches to respect such a fantastic man. Changing five squares of a road doesn't appear to do equity." Another entrepreneur refered to the work the Old Town Commercial Association has done to advertise the zone utilizing the Grand River Avenue name, promoting that would be futile after a name change. The trade off arrangement came to in August 2010 was to rename parcel 56, where Old Town holds celebrations, to Cesar Chavez Plaza. Road signs would be introduced checking portions of Grand River Avenue as Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, however just in a commemoration limit; the road would even now be formally named Grand River Avenue.
