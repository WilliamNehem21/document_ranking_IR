After Compton and chief Norman Yardley had included 26 for the 6th wicket, the previous edged Lindwall down the leg side, and Saggers finished his first Test catch to leave England at 473/6. O'Reilly theorized that Compton's powerlessness to gain ground against the bowling flattened his partners. Playing in his second Test of the mid year, Loxton bowled Ken Cranston for 10 to guarantee his first Ashes wicket, leaving England at 486/7. Cranston selected to not play at a ball that went straight into his leg stump. Loxton then evacuated Godfrey Evans and Jim Laker with hardly a pause in between as England tumbled to 496/9. Evans fell compliantly, pushing a ball directly to Hassett at senseless mid-on, provoking O'Reilly to regard Loxton "fortunate to be on deck when the English tail were falling over themselves in their anxious speed to submit hara-kiri". Interestingly, Laker edged Loxton down the leg side and it took a plunging, low catch from Saggers to finish the expulsion. Umpire Baldwin asked his associate Chester at square leg to affirm the ball had carried on the full before sending Laker back to the structure. Mill operator at that point bowled Yardley to end England's innings at 496. The home side had batted for 192.1 overs and lost their last eight wickets for the expansion of 73 runs. Loxton took 3/55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two each. Nonetheless, the late wickets included some significant pitfalls for Australia, who lost the administrations of Toshack to knee damage.
