Author Joley Wood compared "Lisa the Skeptic" to an alternate reality game, in analyzing the effects of watching the television program "Lost" on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality. Dan O'Brien cited the episode in a discussion of ontology, skepticism, and religious faith, in his book "An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge". O'Brien leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not Lisa was justified in her skepticism. In "", "Lisa the Skeptic" is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a nerd. The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible, for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else. Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner's "Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented Defined a Generation" as yet another example of her conflict with corporations throughout the series. Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about existentialism, self-absorption, and consumption. In "The Psychology of the Simpsons: D'oh!", the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront social injustice, and keep her mind clear for critical thinking. Mark Demming of "Allmovie" noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.
