Inglis was included with the Cambridge University Officer Training Corps (CUOTC), being charged a second lieutenant on 24 May 1909. He presented with the CUOTC's designing separation and saw that when the unit was sent on field days with the remainder of the power it regularly had little to do. To cure this, Inglis planned a reusable steel connect, with the expectation that it could be raised and destroyed by the unit in a solitary evening. A military general who was assessing the unit seen his structure and offered counsel: "In case you're making anything for the military, keep it simpleÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ no confounded devices". Upon the flare-up of the First World War in 1914, Inglis volunteered for dynamic administration in the British Army and was formally recorded as an Assistant Instructor in the School of Military Engineering, with the brief position of lieutenant. The military communicated enthusiasm for Inglis' scaffold plan; it was affirmed for use by a board of armed force officers that incorporated the general who had first remarked on the structure, to whom Inglis said "I trust, Sir, you will discover I have benefitted by your recommendation". The structure stayed in administration with the British Army until the higher-limit Bailey connect was presented amid the Second World War.
