The Germans acknowledged Richthofen for shooting down Ball, however there is some uncertainty with respect to what occurred, particularly as Richthofen's case was for a Sopwith Triplane, not a S.E.5, which was a biplane. Given the measure of purposeful publicity the German High Command produced touting the more youthful Richthofen, an abnormal state choice may have been taken to ascribe Ball's passing to him. It is likely that Ball was not shot down by any stretch of the imagination, however had turned out to be confused and lost control amid his last battle, the casualty of a type of impermanent vertigo that has asserted different pilots. Ball's squadron harbored trusts that he was a POW, and the British government formally recorded him as "absent" on 18 May. There was much hypothesis in the press; in France, the Havas news office announced: "Albert Ball, the star of pilots... has been absent since the seventh May. It is safe to say that he is a detainee or has he been executed? On the off chance that he is dead, he passed on battling for his forty-fifth triumph." It was just toward the month's end that the Germans dropped messages behind Allied lines reporting that Ball was dead, and had been covered in Annoeullin with full military distinctions two days after he slammed. Over the grave of the man they named "the English Richthofen", the Germans raised a cross bearing the engraving "In Luftkampf gefallen fÃÂ¼r sein Vaterland Engl. Flieger Hauptmann Albert Ball, Royal Flying Corps" ("Fallen in air battle for his country English pilot Captain Albert Ball").
