Beginning in the days after the broadcast of "Death on the Rock", the British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's key witnesses. The day after the broadcast, the "London Evening Standard" printed a story about Proetta's husband; the pieceâciting the Gibraltar Police press officerâclaimed that Maxie Proetta was a drug smuggler well known to the Gibraltar Police. Over the course of the week, several of the tabloids ran stories claiming that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record; in one headline, "The Sun" labelled her "the tart of Gib". Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti-British, including one in the broadsheet "The Daily Telegraph" which claimed she was one of the 44 people who voted to end the British administration in Gibraltar's 1967 referendum. In fact, Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was, at the time of the shootings, facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers. Proetta later sued "The Sun" and other newspapers for libel and won substantial damages.
