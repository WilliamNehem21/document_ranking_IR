In the developmental transition from "God of War III" to "Ascension", one of the graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that the limits of the "God of War III" engine restricted artist creativity, so they "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance." For example, the number of UV sets was increased to three per mesh. For a complex character model like Kratos, "independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him, each wrapping around the head, torso and limbs - all of which form an editable 'UV set' when laid out flat." Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment. "Ascension" was not as dramatic an advance in graphics over its predecessor as "God of War III" had been: "From a graphics 'technical' perspective, to a large degree "God of War: Ascension" was more refinement on the graphics front" said another graphics engineer, Ben Diamand, who focused on optimization during "Ascension"s development. The development team also added dynamic lighting, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved from "God of War III": "the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles" said Perthuis.
