Three rocket frameworks were created to be mounted on the AMX-30 undercarriage. Perceiving the requirement for strategic atomic rocket portable launchers, the French Army started building up the Pluton rocket in 1963. In 1964, the program was suspended and rather the French Army decided on a rocket with a more extended territory, ready to be mounted on the AMX-30. An agreement to build up the framework was set up in 1968. The primary model was before long conveyed and testing happened among July and August 1970, trailed by the creation of a second model in 1971. Two additional models were created in 1972. The following year, the vehicle was put into large scale manufacturing and by 1 May 1974 four of these vehicles had been conveyed to the third Artillery Regiment. The rocket itself gauges and is long. Utilizing a rearranged inertial direction framework and a strong force rocket engine, the Pluton has a most extreme scope of . The second rocket framework is the AMX-30R (Roland) surface-to-air rocket propelling framework, which started advancement in 1974. Five vehicles of a pre-arrangement were finished by 1977 and after that assessed, inciting the request of 183 vehicles that equivalent year. The Roland incorporates a rectangular superstructure, taller than that of both the AMX-30D and the Pluton, which houses the radar framework and mounts two propelling cylinders on either side, with an autoloading framework encouraging from an eight rocket hold inside the superstructure. The Roland's investigation radar has a location scope of . The third rocket framework, called the AMX-30SA, was created in 1975 for Saudi Arabia, to flame the SA-10 "Shahine", created and fabricated by Thomson-CSF; the starting vehicle was vigorously founded on the AMX-30R.
