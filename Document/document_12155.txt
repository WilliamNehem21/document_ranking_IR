A noteworthy function was held in Placentia on January 30, 1967, to start development of the Orange Freeway. The principal partition was committed on May 16, 1969, and opened before long, broadening north from the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) to Nutwood Avenue in Fullerton. Throughout the following couple of years, the road was finished from SR 91 north to I-10, and I-210 was manufactured north to the present end of SRÃÂ 57; the Pomona Freeway (SR 60), which covers it through Diamond Bar, was built in the meantime. The last bits of that partition were the turnpike through Brea Canyon, which opened March 13, 1972, and the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange at I-10, which was devoted May 1, 1972, and opened before long. At last, the Orange Freeway was stretched out south from SRÃÂ 91 to I-5 in the mid-1970s, permitting RouteÃÂ 250 to be swung back to nearby governments, however the ensuing cancellation from the Streets and Highways Code did not happen until 1981. With the expansion of SR 210 around San Bernardino in 1998, the previous easternmost bit of I-210 to the Kellogg Hill Interchange rather turned into a northerly augmentation of SRÃÂ 57, however it remains authoritatively part of the Interstate Highway System.
