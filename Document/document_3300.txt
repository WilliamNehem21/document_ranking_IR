As with "And after that There Were None", Sheldon acquainted another character with the plot of "Homicide on the Orient Express", who was absent in Christie's epic, so as to satisfy the job of a player character and hero. The character, Antoinette Marceau, is portrayed by Sheldon as an amalgam of two characters from the novel. These were Poirot's companion who ran the Orient Express, Marcel Bouc, and a youthful officer who is available in both the novel and the film variant of the story, who shepherds Poirot to Istanbul. Sheldon expressed that he would not like to make totally new heroes for the Christie recreations, yet rather liked to attract from sources Christie's books to sort out the diversions' heroes. Sheldon likewise tended to worries from a few early reviews of the diversion, which inquired as to why the player couldn't really play as Poirot. He clarified the decision of Marceau as the hero, saying "the explanation behind picking Marceau over Poirot as the hero is that the vast majority of the enjoyment of Poirot is seeing what he is doing, observing how he acts and settles things. I've generally thought the all the more intriguing character was the 'Watson' character as opposed to the Sherlock Holmes character."
