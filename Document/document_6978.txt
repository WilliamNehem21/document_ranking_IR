Amid the rule of Andrianampoinimerina, Nanjakana encased five houses that filled in as living arrangements for his kids. The house called Nanjakana ("spot of sovereignty") was worked by Andriambelomasina and remodeled by Andrianampoinimerina, who moved it into the compound and lived in it before prevailing to the position of authority. He redesigned it for use by his child, Radama I, who rested here amid visits to Ambohimanga in the wake of succeeding his dad as King of Madagascar. As per oral history, an expansive stone close to the Nanjakana house was utilized as a seat by Andriambelomasina and Andrianampoinimerina while considering administration choices. Andrianampoinimerina included a two-story house called Manambitana ("supported by destiny") that was the biggest of all the customary houses at Ambohimanga. The lord's kids rested on the upper floor amid visits to the imperial city, while the ground floor housed such regal property as palanquins and capacity chests. This house was demolished in the 1861 flame and was reproduced under Rasoherina, who utilized it as a living arrangement. In the wake of expelling the noteworthy Manandraimanjaka house from the Mahandrihono compound, Andrianampoinimerina manufactured another house with a similar name in the Nanjakana compound. This was similarly decimated in the 1861 flame, and was later revamped by Ranavalona II. Likewise crushed in the flame was a house called Fohiloha ("short") that Ranavalona I had moved from the illustrious compound in Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga in 1845; Fohiloha was later remade by Rasoherina. Different structures that Ranavalona I moved from the rova at Antananarivo to the Nanjakana compound at Ambohimanga included Kelisoa ("excellent minimal one") and Manantsara.
