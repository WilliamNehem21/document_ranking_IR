Sega released the Mega Drive, a 16-bit video game console, in Japan on October 29, 1988. The final licensed release for the Mark III/Master System in Japan was "Bomber Raid" in 1989. During the same year, Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive, relabeled "Genesis", in North America. Displeased with Tonka's handling of the Master System, Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System for the United States. In 1990, Sega released the remodeled Master System II, designed to be a lower-cost version of the console which also removed the Sega Card slot. Sega promoted the new model themselves, but the console still sold poorly in the region despite Tonka no longer being involved with the Master System's marketing. In 1991, Nintendo entered into a consent agreement under United States antitrust law and was forced to abandon some of its licensing practices. By early 1992, Master System production ceased in North America. By the time of its discontinuation, Master System had sold between 1.5 million and 2 million units in the United States, finishing behind both Nintendo and Atari, which controlled 80 percent and 12 percent of the market, respectively. The last licensed release in North America was "Sonic the Hedgehog" in 1991.
