Tau Canis Majoris is a Beta Lyrae-type overshadowing various star framework that changes from extent 4.32 to 4.37 over 1.28 days. Its four primary part stars are hot O-type stars, with a consolidated mass multiple times that of the Sun and sparkling with multiple times its glow, however little is known about their individual properties. A fifth segment, a greatness 10 star, lies at a separation of . The framework is just 5 million years of age. UW Canis Majoris is another Beta Lyrae-type star 3000 light-years from Earth; it is an overshadowing double that ranges in extent from at least 5.3 to a limit of 4.8. It has a time of 4.4 days; its segments are two gigantic hot blue stars, one a blue supergiant of otherworldly kind O7.5-8 Iab, while its partner is a marginally cooler, less developed and less brilliant supergiant of phantom sort O9.7Ib. The stars are 200,000 and multiple times as brilliant as the Sun. Anyway the fainter star is the more gigantic at 19 sun based masses to the essential's 16. R Canis Majoris is another overshadowing paired that differs from size 5.7 to 6.34 over 1.13 days, with a third star circling these two like clockwork. The shortness of the orbital period and the low proportion between the two fundamental parts make this an uncommon Algol-type framework.
