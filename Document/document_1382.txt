Numerous faultfinders consider Streltsov to be one of the best footballers ever from Russia or the Soviet Union: British writer and writer Jonathan Wilson depicts him as "the best outfield player Russia has ever producedÃÂ ... a tall, ground-breaking forward, had of a fine first touch and uncommon footballing insight", while Russian writer Aleksandr Nilin composes that "the kid came to us from the place where there is wonder". Streltsov's skilful, imaginative style of play helped him to emerge in Soviet football, and his spearheading of the back-obeyed pass brought about it getting to be referred to in Russia as "Streltsov's pass". Amid his initial vocation, this specialized capacity joined with impressive speed and physical nearness to make a considerable all-round forward player. In his later years, with his physical qualities diminished, he underlined his aptitude and on-field knowledge to turn out to be to a greater extent a playmaker, playing further back and setting up assaulting moves for partners instead of driving them himself. In reality, for his last two seasons, Streltsov played in an assaulting midfield job as opposed to in advance. In spite of the eight-year hole between his two spells as an individual from the Soviet national group, Streltsov, nicknamed "The Russian PelÃÂ©", was the fourth most noteworthy universal goalscorer in the nation's history.
