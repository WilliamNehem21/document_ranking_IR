With updates on the passing of his girl's companion, Wera Knoop (1900Ã¢ÂÂ 1919), Rilke set to chip away at "Poems to Orpheus". The "Works" as often as possible allude to Wera, both straightforwardly where he tends to her by name and in a roundabout way in implications to an "artist" or the legendary Eurydice. Rilke kept in touch with the young lady's mom expressing that Wera's phantom was "telling and instigating" him to compose. In a surge of motivation, Rilke dealt with the "Pieces" and restored his concentration towards finishing the rest of "Duino Elegies." In multi week, Rilke finished the incomplete requiems, and from 2 February to 23 February 1922 he finished all the 55 poems of the two pieces of "Works to Orpheus". Rilke believed the two accumulations to be "of a similar birth". In a letter to Klossowska on 9 February 1922, Rilke expressed: "what overloaded me and caused my anguish most is doneÃÂ ... I am as yet trembling from it.ÃÂ ... What's more, I went out to touch old Muzot, a few seconds ago, in the twilight." after two days, finishing the remainder of his work on the "Funeral poems" at night, he wrote to Lou Andreas-SalomÃÂ© that he had completed the process of "everything in a couple of days; it was a vast tempest, a tropical storm of the soul, and whatever inside me resembles string and webbing, system, everything broke and twisted. No idea of sustenance."
