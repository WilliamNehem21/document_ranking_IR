After "Indefatigable"s misfortune, "New Zealand" moved her flame to "Von der Tann" as per Beatty's standing directions. The range had become unreasonably far for precise shooting, so Beatty changed course four points to port to close the range again somewhere in the range of 4:12 and 4:15. At this point, the fifth Battle Squadron, comprising of four s, had shut everything down was connecting with "Von der Tann" and "Moltke". At 4:23, a shell from struck close "Von der Tann"s back turret, beginning a discharge among the training targets stowed there that totally clouded the ship and caused "New Zealand" to move shoot to "Moltke". At 4:26, the ship was hit by a shell, discharged by "Von der Tann", on 'X' barbette that exploded on contact and thumped free a bit of protective layer that quickly stuck 'X' turret and punctured the upper deck. After four minutes, "Southampton", exploring before Beatty's boats, recognized the lead components of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. After three minutes, she located the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer's war vessels, yet did not transmit a message to Beatty for an additional five minutes. Beatty proceeded with south for an additional two minutes to affirm the locating himself before requesting a sixteen-point swing to starboard in progression. "New Zealand", the last ship in the line, swung rashly to remain outside the scope of the approaching ships.
