In late 1077 or mid 1078 inconvenience started among William and his oldest child, Robert. Despite the fact that Orderic Vitalis depicts it as beginning with a squabble among Robert and his two more youthful siblings, William and Henry, including a story that the fight was begun when William and Henry tossed water at Robert, all things considered, Robert was feeling frail. Orderic relates that he had recently requested control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuked. The inconvenience in 1077 or 1078 brought about Robert leaving Normandy joined by a band of young fellows, a considerable lot of them the children of William's supporters. Included among them was Robert of Belleme, William de Breteuil, and Roger, the child of Richard fitzGilbert. This band of young fellows went to the chÃÂ¢teau at Remalard, where they continued to assault into Normandy. The thieves were bolstered by numerous individuals of William's mainland foes. William promptly assaulted the revolutionaries and drove them from Remalard, however King Philip gave them the chÃÂ¢teau at Gerberoi, where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid attack to Gerberoi in January 1079. Following three weeks, the blockaded powers sallied from the mansion and figured out how to shock the besiegers. William was unhorsed by Robert and was just spared from death by an Englishman, Toki child of Wigod, who was himself executed. William's powers were compelled to lift the attack, and the ruler came back to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had achieved a convenience, with William yet again confirming that Robert would get Normandy when he kicked the bucket.
