The works from the center of the decade were fruitless monetarily and imaginatively. "Le Chevalier d'Harmental" (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first obvious opÃÂ©ra comique ("in a to some degree self important style") was a disappointment, and a straightforward opÃÂ©rette around the same time, "La FiancÃÂ©e en loterie", fared no better. After these failure Messager completed the 1890s with two extensive victories. Traubner depicts "Les P'tites Michu" (1897) as "a shocking hit", and Harding considers it the best of Messager's opÃÂ©rettes up until now (classing "Le Basoche" as opÃÂ©ra comique, as did its writer). The plot was not strikingly unique: commentators remarked that its account of infants exchanged during childbirth was at that point exceptionally recognizable from Gilbert and Sullivan musical dramas. Traubner portrays the piece as "one of those abnormal works that start all around ok and shows signs of improvement and better". Setting a scene in the market of Les Halles was not inventive, yet Messager's theme for the marchands and marchandes was strange, and Traubner likewise singles out the two part harmony for the Michus in Act 1: "cunning, liltingÃÂ ... throbbing with a polish and beauty that other operetta writers have neglected to acquire". He likewise makes a decision about the finales as extraordinary, including a three step dance number that in different hands would be unsurprising however is transformed by Messager into something significantly more symphonic.
