It is not known whether he had any descendants, but the chronicler Ãthelweard was a great-great-grandson of King Ãthelred, and this may have been through Ãthelwold. Shashi Jayakumar suggests the rivalry between King Eadwig and his younger brother Edgar in the 950s dates back to the conflict which resulted in the Battle of the Holme. Eadwig's wife, Ãlfgifu, was probably Ãthelweard's sister, and one of Eadwig's supporters, Byrhtnoth, may have been descended from the Mercian royal family through the Ã¦theling Beorhtnoth, whose son Byrhtsige died fighting on Ãthelwold's side at the Holme. Opponents of Eadwig included his grandmother, Eadgifu, and Eadwig confiscated her property. In Jayakumar's view: "The emergence of Ãlfgifu, descendant of the Ã¦theling Ãthelwold, did not just threaten Edgar's position, it represented a "revanche" to a line and lineage with royal claims of its ownÂ ... The ancestors of Byrhtnoth and Ãthelweard had in all likelihood fought together with Ãthelwold on the "Danish" side at the Battle of the Holme, the opposite side to that which Eadgifu's father Sigehelm had fought for." The marriage between Eadwig and Ãlfgifu was dissolved on the grounds of consanguinity, and Edgar succeeded to the throne when Eadwig died without leaving children. In the view of Nick Higham, Ãthelweard shows a "lack of empathy" for Edward in his chronicle, which Higham attributes to Edward's victory over Ãthelweard's ancestor. Ãthelweard was Ealdorman of the Western Provinces in the late tenth century, showing that Ãthelred's descendants held on to land and power in the century after his death. Ãthelweard's grandson, Ãthelnoth, was an eleventh-century Archbishop of Canterbury.
