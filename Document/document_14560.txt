Character structures were finished by Kimihiko Fujisaka. "Drakengard" was his first occupation as a character architect: his plans were immovably situated inside the Medieval European stylish. To accomplish this, he envisioned that he had been sent back to that chronicled period. His structures were roused by the character plans of "Conclusive Fantasy" and "Mythical beast Quest". Caim was one of the most punctual characters made for "Drakengard". In Inuart's structure, Fujisaka consolidated overwhelming protection into his plan to give an increasingly commanding impression for players. His definitive job and last structure were based around the possibility of him being Caim's adversary. The plan of the dark mythical serpent, which went about as Inuart's agreement monster, did not inspire Shiba, who thought about cutting it from the last item. Manah's red attire was intended to bring out the two its status as the diversion's key shading, and her status as the pioneer of the Cult of the Watchers. Shiba endorsed of the plan, feeling that it stood out pleasantly from Furiae's dominatingly white structure. Fujisaka likewise helped plan Furiae's beast structure for the amusement's second closure. Looking back, Fujisaka was disappointed with his work on "Drakengard", especially his work on Caim. The diversion's beasts were planned by Taro Hasegawa.
