The Edmonds Crossing plan included arrangements for a between time suburbanite rail station in downtown Edmonds, to be worked by the new local travel expert (later renamed Sound Transit). The travel expert ran a pilot worker rail administration to Seattle in mid 1995, ceasing at Everett and Edmonds, to advance a $6.7 billion travel plan that would be put on a provincial ticket measure in March. The poll measure was dismissed by voters, however a $3.9 billion arrangement was affirmed in the November 1996 race, including a worker rail line from Everett to Seattle and $6 million in subsidizing for an Edmonds station on hold. The Amtrak station was chosen by Sound Transit as the site of the between time station in 2000 and the regional government endorsed a fifteen-year plan for the interval station in 2002. The suburbanite rail line was initially planned to start administration in 2001, yet was postponed because of exchanges with the Federal Transit Administration and BNSF Railway, the successor to Burlington Northern. The break station in Edmonds incorporated an all-inclusive stage and new parking garage on the south side of the Amtrak office, both situated on property obtained from BNSF. Sounder worker rail administration from Everett and Edmonds started on December 21, 2003.
