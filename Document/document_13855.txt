Paine starts "The Age of Reason" by assaulting disclosure. Disclosure, he keeps up, must be checked by the individual collectors of the message and is in this way feeble proof for God's presence. Paine rejects predictions and supernatural occurrences, stating: "it is disclosure to the primary individual just, and noise to each other, and therefore they are not obliged to trust it". He likewise brings up that the Christian disclosures seem to have modified after some time to modify for changing political conditions. Asking his perusers to utilize reason as opposed to depend on disclosure, Paine contends that the main solid, perpetual and general proof of God's presence is the common world. "The Bible of the Deist", he battles, ought not be a human development, for example, the Bible, yet rather a celestial innovationÃ¢ÂÂit ought to be "creation". Paine takes this contention significantly further, keeping up that similar tenets of rationale and principles of proof that oversee the investigation of mainstream writings ought to be connected to the Bible. In Part II of "The Age of Reason", he will do only this, bringing up various inconsistencies in the Bible. For instance Thomas Paine notes, " The most exceptional of the considerable number of things called wonders, related in the New Testament, is that of the demon taking off with Jesus Christ, and conveying him to the highest point of a high mountain, and to the highest point of the most elevated zenith of the sanctuary, and appearing and encouraging to him every one of the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he didn't find America, or is it just with kingdoms that his dirty height has any intrigue? "
