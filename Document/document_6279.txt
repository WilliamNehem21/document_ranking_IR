Hogarth imitates every one of the highlights of the peaceful scene in a urban scene. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the homeless people and prostitutes, the sun overhead is supplanted by the clock on the congregation, the snow-topped mountains become the blanketed housetops. Indeed, even the setting of Covent Garden with heaps of foods grown from the ground echoes the nation scene. In the focal point of the image the frigid goddess of the day break as the demure churchgoer is trailed by her shuddering red-nosed pageboy, reflecting Hesperus, the day break conveyor. The lady is the special case who appears to be unaffected by the cool, proposing it might be her component. Albeit apparently stunned, the dress of the lady, which is unreasonably popular for a lady of her age and in the work of art is appeared to be a striking corrosive yellow, may propose she has different contemplations at the forefront of her thoughts. She is ordinarily depicted as an old maid, and viewed as a scoundrel, pompously going to chapel and conveying an in vogue ermine muff while showing no philanthropy to her solidifying footboy or the half-seen poor person before her. The figure of the old maid is said to be founded on a relative of Hogarth, who, perceiving herself in the image, cut him out of her will. Handling later utilized the lady as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in "Tom Jones".
