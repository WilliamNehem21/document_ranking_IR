Battle utilizes a card-based fight framework executed continuously. The player can hop and move around the fight screen as they would on the field map, however all physical assaults, enchantment, things and summonings are enacted by playing a game of cards. Cards are positioned from zero to nine, and are utilized for making assault combos or breaking foe cards. Except for zero-positioned cards which are increasingly costly regarding Card Points (CP) contrasted with different cards of a similar sort and have different positions, more CP are required to put higher-positioned cards in the player's deck. Card PointsÃ¢ÂÂexpanded through dimension upÃ¢ÂÂlimit the quantity of cards the player can use in a deck. Cards with rank "zero" can break any restricting card or combo whenever played after the contradicting card or combo, however they can be broken by any card or combo too on the off chance that it is played after the zero card is played. Breaking a restricting card will drop that assault and stagger the washout of a card break for a brief span. Unique adversary cards might be acquired by crushing adversaries and managers, and are utilized to give the player an impermanent capacity, going from improved hostile and protective abilities to adjusting the qualities of specific cards.
