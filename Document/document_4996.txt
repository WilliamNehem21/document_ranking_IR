Charles Pearson (1793Ã¢ÂÂ 1862) had proposed the possibility of an underground railroad associating the City of London with the moderately far off fundamental line ends in around 1840. Development started in 1860. On 9ÃÂ January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground traveler railroad. The MR was fruitful and developed relentlessly, expanding its administrations and getting other nearby railroads north and west of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819Ã¢ÂÂ 1901) was selected its Chairman. A chief of numerous railroad organizations, he had a dream of binding together a series of rail routes to make a solitary line from Manchester by means of London to a planned Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered dealings to assume responsibility for the A&B and the segment of the previous Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He wanted to broaden the MR north from London to Aylesbury and the Tramway southwest to Oxford, making a through course from London to Oxford. Rail benefits among Oxford and London as of now were poor: albeit still an incredibly circuitous course, this plan would have shaped the most brief course from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was excited, and authorisation was looked for from Parliament. Parliament did not share the energy of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did, be that as it may, get agree in 1881 to stretch out the MR to Aylesbury.
