The fledgling is accepted to have assumed a huge environmental job in the organization of pre-Columbian timberlands of eastern North America. For example, while the traveler pigeon was surviving, woodlands were commanded by white oaks. This species sprouted in the fall, along these lines making its seeds practically pointless as a nourishment source amid the spring rearing season, while red oaks created oak seeds amid the spring, which were eaten up by the pigeons. The nonappearance of the traveler pigeon's seed utilization may have added to the advanced strength of red oaks. Because of the enormous measure of fertilizer present at perching locales, few plants developed for quite a long time after the pigeons left. Additionally, the gathering of combustible trash, (for example, appendages parted from trees and foliage killed by waste) at these locales may have expanded both the recurrence and power of timberland fires, which would have favored flame tolerant species, for example, pod oaks, dark oaks, and white oaks over less flame tolerant species, for example, red oaks, accordingly clarifying the adjustment in the piece of eastern backwoods since the traveler pigeon's annihilation (from white oaks, pod oaks, and dark oaks prevailing in presettlement woods, to the "emotional development" of red oaks today).
