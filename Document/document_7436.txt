By the late spring of 1996, Oasis were broadly thought to be, as per guitarist Noel Gallagher, "the greatest band in the worldÃÂ ... greater than, might I venture to state it, screwing God." The business achievement of the band's two past collections had brought about media free for all and a universality in the prevailing media that was in threat of prompting a backfire. In the late spring of 1997, Oasis individuals were being welcome to capacities at 10 Downing Street by new Prime Minister Tony Blair and holidaying with Johnny Depp and Kate Moss in Mick Jagger's manor in Mustique. Amid their keep going remain on the island, Noel composed most of the melodies that would make up Oasis' third collection. He had experienced a temporarily uncooperative mind amid the past winter, and has since conceded he composed just a solitary guitar riff in the a half year following the arrival of "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?". Following half a month "sitting", he trained himself to an everyday practice of songwriting where he would go "into this room in the first part of the day, turn out for lunch, return in, turn out for supper, return in, at that point hit the hay." Noel has later said about the collection "...ÃÂ most of the melodies were composed before I even got a record bargain, I left and composed the verses in around about fourteen days." The band's maker Owen Morris joined Gallagher later with a TASCAM 8-track recorder, and they recorded demos with a drum machine and a console.
