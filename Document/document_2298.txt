A few extra examples were quickly depicted by Jensen in 1987. One of these finds, the humerus USNM 21903, was found in ca. 1943 by uranium miners Vivian and Daniel Jones in the Potter Creek Quarry in western Colorado, and gave to the Smithsonian Institution. Initially, this humerus was a piece of an ineffectively protected fractional skeleton that was not gathered. As per Taylor in 2009, it isn't unmistakably referable to "Brachiosaurus" in spite of its huge size of . Jensen himself worked at the Potter Creek site in 1971 and 1975, unearthing the disarticulated example BYU 4744, which contains a mid-dorsal vertebra, a fragmented left ilium, a left range and a correct metacarpal. As per Taylor in 2009, this example can be unquestionably alluded to "B. altithorax", to the extent it is covering with its sort example. Jensen besides referenced an example found close Jensen, Utah that incorporates a rib long, a foremost cervical vertebra, some portion of a scapula, and a coracoid, in spite of the fact that he didn't give a portrayal. In 2001, Curtice and Stadtman attributed two explained dorsal vertebrae (example BYU 13023) from Dry Mesa Quarry to "Brachiosaurus". Taylor, in 2009, noticed that these vertebrae are especially shorter than those of the "B. altithorax" holotype, albeit generally being comparative.
