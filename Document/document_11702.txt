"Landing", coordinated by Denis Villeneuve and dependent on Ted Chiang's short "Story of Your Life", positions among the most acclaimed movies of Adams' vocation. The film is about Louise Banks, an etymologist (played by Adams), who encounters peculiar dreams when she is employed by the American government to translate the language of extraterrestrials. She was attracted to playing a scholarly female lead and associated with the film's topic of solidarity and sympathy. She watched documentaries on phonetics to get ready for the part. Composing for "The Atlantic", Christoper Orr regarded Adams' execution to be "enchantingly open, by turns elevating and sad", and Kenneth Turan of the "Los Angeles Times" trusted that the film was an "exhibit for her capacity to discreetly and viably merge insight, compassion and hold". "Entry" was a business achievement, procuring over $200 million against a $47 million spending plan. Adams got BAFTA and Golden Globe designations in the Best Actress class. A few columnists communicated disillusionment over her inability to get an Oscar designation for it. Adams played Lois Lane for the third time in "Equity League" (2017), a group film about the main superheroes. The pundit Tim Grierson of "Screen International" remarked that regardless of giving "enthusiastic reverberation" to the film, Adams' abilities were squandered in an unpleasant supporting job.
