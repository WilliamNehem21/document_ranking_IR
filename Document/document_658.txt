After Stephen's increase, Nigel was at first held as treasurer, yet the ruler came to associate him and his family with furtively supporting the Empress Matilda. The prime movers behind Stephen's doubts against the priests were the Beaumont family, headed by the twin siblings Robert, Earl of Leicester, and Waleran, Count of Meulan, who wished to be the primary consultants of the ruler. Roger, Alexander, and Nigel together held key mansions, including Salisbury, Devizes, Sherborne, Malmesbury, Sleaford, and Newark. The Beaumonts claimed that Roger and his family were bracing the palaces they held in anticipation of turning them over to Matilda. They encouraged the lord to reallocate the mansions before they were lost. Despite the fact that the "Gesta Stephani", or "Deeds of King Stephen", a medieval annal of the occasions of Stephen's rule, claims that Roger was backstabbing to Stephen, the proof is against such activity by Roger, as he had been a rival of Matilda since 1126, when she was first advanced as her dad's beneficiary. Roger and his family likewise had been early supporters of Stephen's seizure of the crown after Henry I's demise. The contemporary writer Orderic Vitalis felt that Roger's family would double-cross the lord, however William of Malmesbury trusted that the claims depended on jealousy from "ground-breaking laymen". Whatever Roger's position, Nigel's own situation on Matilda is less clear, and it is conceivable that he was never instead of her as his uncle. No proof endures that he was repelled from Stephen, in any case, as Nigel kept on seeing sanctions all through the initial four years of Stephen's rule. As indicated by the history specialist Marjorie Chibnall, Nigel's family may have been gotten up to speed in a question between Henry of Blois and the Beaumonts.
