Since 1862, the Blancos had made repeated overtures to Paraguay, governed by dictator Carlos Antonio LÃ³pez, in an attempt to forge an alliance that might advance both their interests in the Platine region. Upon the death of LÃ³pez, his son, Francisco Solano LÃ³pez, succeeded him as Paraguayan dictator. Unlike the elder LÃ³pez, who strove to avoid encumbering alliances, Solano greeted the Blanco's proposal with enthusiasm. He believed Argentina was working towards the annexation of both Uruguay and Paraguay, with the goal of recreating the Viceroyalty of the RÃ­o de la Plata, the former Spanish colony that once encompassed the territories of all three nations. Solano LÃ³pez had, as far back as 1855, expressed this concern, commenting to the Uruguayan AndrÃ©s Lamas that "the idea of reconstructing [the old viceroyalty] is in the soul of the Argentines; and as a result, it isn't just Paraguay that needs to stand guard: your country, the Oriental Republic [of Uruguay], needs to get along with my own in order to prepare for any eventualities." In late 1863, Solano LÃ³pez was mobilizing his army and was in talks with Urquiza, the leader of the dissident Argentine Federalists, to convince him to join the proposed ParaguayanâUruguayan alliance.
