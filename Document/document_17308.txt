In a 2006 interview, Anderson said that although Troika Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects. In 2013, Mitsoda said that "Bloodlines" was released at "the worst possible time - most people didn't even know we were outÂ ... fans and the Troika [developers] are always going to wonder what the game could have been like with another six months." In a 2017 interview, Boyarksy echoed Mitsoda's sentiments, saying that a further three to six months of development time could have allowed Troika to address many technical flaws, but he was unsure that they could have resolved larger issues. He said "I feel the second half of the game isn't as good as the first. I feel like we devolved into relying too much on combat at the end." Boyarsky noted that it was impossible to know if the fixes would have made "Bloodlines" more successful, or if it would have remained a niche product. He said "it might have been too early for people to appreciate it, but we'll never know." The game fared better following its release on Valve's Steam digital distribution service in March 2007, where, as of 2015, it has sold 492,000 copies.
