In the February 1991 version of "Electronic Learning", Robert McCarthy expressed: "Instructors, instructive chairmen and programming designers are excited about the new, lower cost Apple Macintosh PCs". Steve Taffe, chief of instructional methodology at MECC, a designer and distributer of instructive programming, clarified his energy about the Classic: "[it] is dynamite Ã¢ÂÂ both on the grounds that it's a Mac and in light of that low cost. Everybody would now be able to bear the cost of a Macintosh." Scholastic, an instructive programming designer, was additionally certain of Apple's capacity to contend with MS-DOS machines, expressing: "They are similarly as financially savvy and as ground-breaking as MS-DOS PCs, yet the Apples will have a predominant solace level." Sue Talley, Apple's supervisor of key arranging in training, said of the Classic: "we see it going into applications where you need a reasonable number of ground-breaking stations, yet where shading is certifiably not a major issue." Talley referenced that it was most appropriate for composing labs and other fundamental efficiency employments. Numerous schools chose not to purchase the Macintosh Classic in light of the absence of a shading screen, an alternative which the higher-evaluated Macintosh LC had. The mainstream Apple IIe Card additionally expanded the LC's intrigue to schools. In spite of the fact that the Classic was increasingly mainstream at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was beating the Classic (1.2 million).
