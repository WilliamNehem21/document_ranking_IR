The Armistice reestablished the war among Stengel and Dreyfuss, and the outfielder held out again to start the 1919 season. Both needed to see Stengel exchanged, however no arrangement was quickly made. By at that point, Stengel's situation as standard right defender had been taken by Billy Southworth, and he experienced issues crushing spirit into the lineup. Stengel played superior to anything he had before he enrolled, and when Dreyfuss exchanged him to the Philadelphia Phillies for Possum Whitted on August 9, he was batting .293 with four grand slams. Be that as it may, before being exchanged, Stengel pulled a standout amongst his most well known tricks, on May 25 at Ebbets Field, as an individual from the meeting Pirates. It was not unordinary at Ebbets Field for right defenders of either group, as opposed to go to the burrow after three were out, to go to the Dodgers' warm up area, in foul region down the correct field line, on the off chance that they were not prone to bat in the forthcoming inning. Stengel did as such to visit old companions, and found that pitcher Leon Cadore had caught a sparrow. Stengel took it, and, called to bat in the 6th inning, unobtrusively set it under his top. He got blended boos and cheers from the Brooklyn swarm as a previous Dodger, took a profound bow at the plate, and doffed his top, whereupon the feathered creature took off to incredible chuckling from the group.
