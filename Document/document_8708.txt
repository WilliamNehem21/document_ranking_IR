A release of the score by the minor Italian writer Giacomo Orefice (Milan, 1909) got a few show exhibitions in Italy and somewhere else when the First World War. This version was the premise of the musical drama's United States debut, another show execution at the New York Met in April 1912. The musical drama was acquainted with London, in d'Indy's release, when it was sung to piano backup at the Institut FranÃÂ§ais on 8 March 1924. The main British organized execution, with just little cuts, was given by the Oxford University Operatic Society on 7 December 1925, utilizing a release arranged for the occasion by Jack Westrup. In the London "Saturday Review", music commentator Dyneley Hussey called the event "a standout amongst the most essential occasions of ongoing years"; the generation had "demonstrated without a moment's delay Monteverdi's case to rank among the extraordinary masters who have composed sensational music". Westrup's version was restored in London at the Scala Theater in December 1929, that year in which the musical show got its first US organized execution, at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. The three Scala exhibitions brought about a monetary calamity, and the musical drama was not seen again in Britain for a long time.
