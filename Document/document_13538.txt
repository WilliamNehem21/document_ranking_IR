In spite of the fact that the vertebral section of the storage compartment or middle is not entirely known, the back of "Brachiosaurus" doubtlessly contained twelve dorsal vertebrae; this can be induced from the total dorsal vertebral segment safeguarded in an anonymous brachiosaurid example, BMNH R5937. Vertebrae of the front piece of the dorsal section were somewhat taller yet any longer than those of the back part. This is as opposed to "Giraffatitan", where the vertebrae at the front part were a lot taller however just marginally more. The centra (vertebral bodies), the lower some portion of the vertebrae, were progressively extended and generally roundabout in cross-area, while those of "Giraffatitan" were more extensive than tall. The foramina (little openings) on the sides of the centra, which considered the interruption of air sacs, were bigger than in "Giraffatitan". The diapophyses (expansive projections broadening sideways from the neural curve of the vertebrae) were level, while those of "Giraffatitan" were slanted upward. At their closures, these projections enunciated with the ribs; the articular surface was not unmistakably triangular as in "Giraffatitan". In side view, the upward-anticipating neural spines stood vertically and were twice as wide at the base than at the top; those of "Giraffatitan" tilted in reverse and did not widen at their base. At the point when found in front or back view, the neural spines extended toward their tops.
