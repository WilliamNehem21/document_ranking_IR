Winning the League Cup in 1961 was an apex for the club. Despite the fact that Villa completed seventh in 1961Ã¢ÂÂ 62, the accompanying season saw the start of a decrease in structure that would see them complete in fifteenth spot in 1963 and fourth from base in 1964. The administrator Joe Mercer went separate ways with the club in July 1964 in view of these outcomes and his declining wellbeing. His substitution, Dick Taylor, figured out how to maintain a strategic distance from transfer in the 1964Ã¢ÂÂ 65 season as Villa completed sixteenth after a poor begin to the season. The next year Villa completed sixteenth by and by. Following a 4Ã¢ÂÂ 2 last day rout by Everton the club was consigned to the Second Division in the 1966Ã¢ÂÂ 67 season. Administrator Dick Taylor was sacked and Tommy Cummings was selected in his place. The decrease was not exclusively the obligation of the chief; the club had a maturing five-man board "who had neglected to adjust to the new football reality." The club had neither built up an exploring system nor a compelling instructing structure. The board had additionally sold two of Villa's best players, Phil Woosnam and Tony Hateley. The fans' requires the board to leave turned out to be increasingly more articulated when Villa completed sixteenth in the Second Division in 1968.
