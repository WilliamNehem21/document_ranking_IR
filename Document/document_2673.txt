One of Walker's assignments was to revise the siege content. He felt it was imperfect since it neglected to commute home what he saw as the most imperative truth, that "barrage flight is the fundamental arm of the aviation based armed forces". Following the perspectives on air control scholars Billy Mitchell, Hugh Trenchard, and Giulio Douhet, Walker articulated two key standards: that siege would appear as light accuracy bombarding; and that it ought to be coordinated against basic mechanical targets. In his article "Driving Home the Bombardment Attack", distributed in the "Coast Artillery Journal" in October 1930, he contended that warriors couldn't keep a shelling assault and that "the most effectual strategy for ceasing a barrage assault would give off an impression of being a hostile against the siege airdrome." The Bomber Mafia contended that planes flew excessively high and too quick to even consider being caught by warriors, that regardless of whether they were captured, the aircraft had enough capability to drive off their aggressors, and enough protective layer and strength to assimilate any harm their assailants may endeavor to deliver. The Air Corps Tactical School built up a teaching that wound up known as mechanical web hypothesis, which called for exactness assaults against deliberately chosen basic modern targets. Walker drove home his confidence in assault with a popular proclamation from his addresses: "An efficient, all around arranged, and well-flown aviation based armed forces assault will establish a hostile that can not be halted."
