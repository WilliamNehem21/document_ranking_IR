In the Early Iron Age, Maiden Castle was commonly unexceptional; it was one of over 100ÃÂ hill fortifications of comparable size worked around a similar time in the territory that is currently Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire. In the Middle Iron Age, Maiden Castle was extended and in the process it turned into the biggest slope fortification in Britain and one of the biggest in Europe. As per prehistorian Niall Sharples it is, by certain definitions, the biggest in western Europe. In about 450ÃÂ BC, Maiden Castle was extended from . The zone was at first encased by a solitary bank and discard, with the bank standing high despite the fact that the dump was shallow. The slope fortification's extension was not novel; it was one of a progression of "created slope strongholds" in southern England. As some slope fortifications were extended, a considerable lot of the littler slope strongholds that had multiplied in the Early Iron Age dropped out of utilization, just like the case in Dorset. The created slope fortifications in Dorset were separated broadly separated. This, and the surrender of the littler slope strongholds in the territory when the created slope posts were constructed, shows that these created slope fortresses were critical. The created slope strongholds of Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire were similarly divided separated, with generally break even with access to assets, for example, water.
