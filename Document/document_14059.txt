Despite the fact that Churchill's, portrayed by Lewington as "the most exceedingly awful club that has ever been in Reading", endured such conduct, the town's stylish Sindlesham Mill dance club did not, normally excepting Friday for his odd exercises, including a move he created called "the elephant" which comprised of turning the pockets of his pants back to front and fixing his flies to uncover himself. He and his companions would consistently drink throughout the day, however he had the capacity to apply some poise; as indicated by his companion Syd Simmonds, Friday would comply with Hurley's guidance not to drink for 48 hours before each diversion. Be that as it may, he would play his prized overwhelming metal records all around boisterously whenever of the day or night and take LSD with easygoing impassion. Hurley endeavored to quiet Friday somewhere near moving him into a loft over the football club's old ex-groundsman, yet without much of any result: "Regardless of whether it was three in the first part of the day, the principal thing is get the music playing", Simmonds later said. "We had an old kid living beneath us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a puppy's life in the level. Beating music, individuals thumping on the entryway, young ladies tossing stones at the windows. Poor old grass."
