When it was depicted in 1962, "Heterodontosaurus" was named a crude individual from Ornithischia, one of the two principle requests of Dinosauria (the other being Saurischia). The creators thought that it was most like the inadequately known genera "Geranosaurus" and "Lycorhinus", the second had been viewed as a therapsid stem-warm blooded animal up to that point because of its dentition. They noticed a few likenesses with ornithopods, and temporarily set the new class in that gathering. Scientistss Alfred Romer and Oskar Kuhn autonomously named the family Heterodontosauridae in 1966 as a group of ornithischian dinosaurs including "Heterodontosaurus" and "Lycorhinus". Thulborn rather considered these creatures as hypsilophodontids, and not a particular family. Bakker and Galton perceived "Heterodontosaurus" as essential to the development of ornithischian dinosaurs, as its hand design was imparted to crude saurischians, and consequently was crude or basal to the two gatherings. This was questioned by certain researchers who trusted the two gatherings had rather advanced autonomously from "thecodontian" archosaur predecessors, and that their similitudes were because of merged development. A few creators likewise recommended a relationship, for example, relative/progenitor, among heterodontosaurids and fabrosaurids, both being crude ornithischians, just as to crude ceratopsians, for example, "Psittacosaurus", however the idea of these relations were discussed.
