Reviewers struggled to master the game's controls. "GamePro"s Slo Mo praised this aspect of the game, saying that even mastering the extreme precision of the steering is fun, and rewards the player with both better gameplay technique and an appreciation for the strong distinction between the game's many vehicles. Schneider likewise overcame his initial concerns to appreciate the complexity of the controls and the differences between the vehicles. He considered the locked camera view restrictive when compared to the unrestricted 3D camera in the game's contemporaries. Schneider thought the game should have been longer, with fewer bonus levels and more main missions, though he did appreciate the pacing, design, and difficulty of the included levels. Slo Mo instead asserted that "Over 60 levels and hidden areas within hidden areas give you your money's worth". A "Next Generation" critic agreed, asserting that the vast size of the levels and numerous secrets and bonus areas make "Blast Corps" "one of the few Nintendo 64 games that justifies its exorbitant price tag." Shawn Smith and Sushi-X of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" ("EGM") thought the game was repetitive, as did "Computer and Video Games". The latter, though, praised "Blast Corps" level design and difficulty progression. Ward had fewer reservations, writing that "basically what you have here is a game with great graphics, great sound, and a great premise. What's even more impressive is that the game doesn't really have any substantial flaws to speak of - unless you want to count lack of a two-player mode, which really isn't fair." Crispin Boyer of "EGM" wrote that the game's best feature was its "palpable sense of suspense" as the carrier advanced on resistant buildings.
