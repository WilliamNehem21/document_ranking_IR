Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and FBI operator Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) find that Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) has consented to come back with his genuine dad, named "Walternate" (Noble), to his very own universe called the Other Side, which runs parallel to our own. One of the puzzling Observers (Michael Cerveris) leaves Olivia a note showing that Peter is named in a prescience as the one in charge of the apocalypse. To caution Peter of his approaching job, the Fringe Division work with biotechnology company Massive Dynamic to think of an approach to traverse. They structure an arrangement that exploits Olivia's universe-jumping capacity, and enroll three other Cortexiphan guineas pigs who have one of a kind capacities: Nick Lane (David Call), Sally Clark (Pascale Hutton), and James Heath (Omar Metwally), two of whom showed up in past scenes. The groupÃ¢ÂÂmade out of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and JamesÃ¢ÂÂeffectively touches base on the Other Side. James bites the dust not long after entry, yet the rest figure out how to get away from the other reality's Fringe Division, who had utilized their unique innovation to recognize their landing. It is uncovered that Walternate is the Secretary of Defense on the Other Side.
