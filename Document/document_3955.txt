Welles came back to Tuba City in 1964 to decide the age of the Kayenta Formation (it had been proposed to be Late Triassic in age, while Welles thought it was Early to Middle Jurassic), and found another skeleton about south of where the 1942 examples had been found. The almost total example (recorded as UCMP77270) was gathered with the assistance of William Breed of the Museum of Northern Arizona and others. Amid arrangement of this example, it turned out to be certain that it was a bigger individual of "M.wetherilli", and that it would have had two peaks on the highest point of its skull. Being a slender plate of bone, one peak was initially thought to be a piece of the missing left half of the skull which had been hauled out of its situation by a forager. When it ended up obvious that it was a peak, it was likewise understood that there would have been a comparing peak on the left side, since the correct peak was right of the midline, and was curved along its center length. This disclosure prompted reconsideration of the holotype example, which was found to have bases of two slight, upwards expanded bones, which were squashed together. These likewise spoken to peaks, however it had some time ago been expected they were a piece of a lost cheek bone. It was additionally inferred that the two 1942 examples were adolescents, while the 1964 example was a grown-up, around 33% bigger than the others. Welles later reviewed that he thought the peaks were as surprising as discovering "wings on a worm".
