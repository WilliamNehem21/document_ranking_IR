The Sind sparrow was first formally depicted by Edward Blyth, from an example gathered by Alexander Burnes at Bahawalpur in around 1840. Blyth's portrayal was distributed in an issue of the "Diary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal" which, albeit dated 1844, was distributed just in 1845. The sparrow was not recorded until some other time, notwithstanding the endeavors of noted ornithologists Allan Octavian Hume in Sindh and William Thomas Blanford in eastern Iran. This was most likely in view of its general closeness to the house sparrow, however moreover, Blyth's depiction of the species inaccurately portrayed its backside plumes as maroon, and a depiction by Thomas C. Jerdon contained comparable blunders. Remarking on his ineffective inquiry, Hume composed that the several house sparrows he murdered in quest for the Sind sparrow "should frame a substantial burden" on Blyth's inner voice, and that if the Sind sparrow existed "it would be not too bad for it ... to put on an appearance with as meager postponement as would be prudent". Hume questioned its qualification, as did different ornithologists. The Sind sparrow was rediscovered by Scrope Berdmore Doig in 1880, in the Eastern Nara locale. Ernst Hartert thought of it as a subspecies of the house sparrow, "Passer domesticus pyrrhonotus", in his "Pass on VÃÂ¶gel der palÃÂ¤arktishen Fauna", however Doig and Claud Ticehurst both found that the two species reproduced in similar territories without interbreeding.
