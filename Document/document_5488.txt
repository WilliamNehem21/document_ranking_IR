Expecting to win the match to keep an Australian arrangement triumph, England skipper Norman Yardley won the hurl and chose to bat. Britain kept on revising their group, rolling out three improvements trying to discover a mix that could challenge Australia, which rolled out two improvements constrained by damage. In contrast to the former Tests, England's openers had the capacity to withstand the Australian new ball assault, and the association of Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook put on 168 for the opening stand. Washbrook fell for 143 in the last over of the day, yet England obviously had the better of the play, finishing at 268/2 by stumps. Australia's bowlers were vigorously censured for their execution, which was viewed as torpid. The following day, England kept on accumulating runs, with Australia seeming pleasant and unfit to remove Bill Edrich and nightwatchman Alec Bedser, who batted until mid-evening. Bedser and Edrich then fell one after another for 79 and 111 separately as England at that point crumbled and lost 8/73 to be hard and fast for 496 late in the day. The hosts were intensely scrutinized for the breakdown, which was to a great extent because of unforced blunders. Among the Australian bowlers, the wickets were shared. Australia at that point came to 63/1 in answer at stumps on day two.
