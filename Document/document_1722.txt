The dentary (lower jaw bone) itself is vigorous and short. The length pivot of the p4 makes a point of about 58ÃÂ° with the length hub of the jawbone. The bone is inward on the lingual, yet arched on the labial side. There is a diastema (hole) between the p4 and the incisor that would have been before it, as in the jaw of "Sudamerica". Gurovich assessed the length of the diastema as 2.5ÃÂ mm. There is an adjusted mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a breadth of 0.7ÃÂ mm, situated about 0.8ÃÂ mm beneath the dorsal edge of the bone and 1.5ÃÂ mm before the p4. In spite of the fact that the incisor itself isn't safeguarded, its alveolus (the lodging of the root) is to a limited extent. As in "Sudamerica", it stretches out far into the dentary, going beneath p4. The alveolus is 1.5ÃÂ mm wide underneath the front base of p4 and 1.4ÃÂ mm at the back of the jaw section. Despite the fact that the tallness of the alveolus can't be resolved on the grounds that the lower side is split away, the incisor more likely than not been very profound.
