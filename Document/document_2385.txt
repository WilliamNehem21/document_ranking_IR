Numerous baseball players were drafted to battle in World War I in 1918, however Hornsby was given a draft delay since he was supporting his family. Amid the offseason, Miller Huggins, discontent with the Cardinals' administration, left the group to deal with the New York Yankees. He was supplanted by Jack Hendricks, who had dealt with the Indianapolis Indians to a flag in the American Association the earlier year. Hornsby needed trust in Hendricks' capacity to run the Cardinals, and the two men created ill will towards one another because of Hornsby's developing narcissism and affection for previous supervisor Huggins. Under Hendricks, Hornsby's batting normal plunged to .281. He had issues off the field as well; on JuneÃÂ 17, Hornsby hit St. Louis inhabitant Frank G. Rowe with his Buick when Rowe ventured out before traffic to cross a convergence. Rowe sued Hornsby for $15,000 ($ today), yet Hornsby in the end made due with a littler, undisclosed sum, and the case was rejected. He was still among the association chiefs in triples and slugging rate in 1918, however after the season finished with the Cardinals in last spot, he reported that he could never play under Hendricks again. In part because of Hornsby's objections, Hendricks was terminated after the season and supplanted by Branch Rickey, at that point leader of the Cardinals.
