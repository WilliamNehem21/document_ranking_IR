In an investigation of an average workers lesbian network in Buffalo, New York, during the 1950s, "The Well of Loneliness" was the main work of lesbian writing anybody had perused or known about. For some youthful lesbians during the 1950s, it was the main wellspring of data about lesbianism. "The Well's" name acknowledgment made it conceivable to discover when book shops and libraries did not yet have segments given to LGBT writing. As late as 1994, an article in "Women's activist Review" noticed that "The Well" "normally shows up in turning out storiesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and not only those of more established lesbians". It has frequently been ridiculed: Terry Castle says that "in the same way as other erudite lesbians I appear to have spent a lot of my grown-up life poking fun at it", and Mary Renault, who read it in 1938, giggled at its "sincere humourlessness" and "impermissible remittance of self indulgence". However it has additionally delivered ground-breaking enthusiastic reactions, both positive and negative. One lady was so furious at the prospect of how "The Well" would influence a "disengaged developing lesbian" that she "composed a note in the library book, to tell different perusers that ladies adoring ladies can be excellent". A Holocaust survivor stated, "Recalling that book, I needed to live sufficiently long to kiss another lady."
