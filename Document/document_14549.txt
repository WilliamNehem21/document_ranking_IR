Less than 100 Texian officers stayed at the Alamo Mission in BÃÂ©xar, under the direction of Colonel James C. Neill. Unfit to save the quantity of men important to mount a fruitful safeguard of the rambling office, in January Houston sent Bowie with 30 men to evacuate the cannons and pulverize the complex. In a letter to Governor Smith, Bowie contended that "the salvation of Texas depends in extraordinary measure on keeping BÃÂ©xar out of the hands of the adversary. It fills in as the boondocks picquet watch, and on the off chance that it were in the ownership of Santa Anna, there is no fortress from which to repulse him in his walk towards the Sabine." The letter to Smith finished, "Colonel Neill and myself have gone to the serious goals that we will preferably pass on in these trench over surrender it to the foe." Few fortifications were approved; mounted force officer William B. Travis touched base in BÃÂ©xar with 30ÃÂ men on February 3 and after five days, a little gathering of volunteers arrived, including the renowned frontiersman Davy Crockett. On February 11, Neill left to enroll extra fortifications and assemble supplies. In his nonattendance, Travis and Bowie shared order.
