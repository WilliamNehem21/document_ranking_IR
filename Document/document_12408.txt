Following long-standing custom for a city surprised, the ravaging went on for three days. As per Anagnostes, 7,000 occupants, including himself, were kidnapped to be sold in the slave markets of the Balkans and Anatolia, albeit many were therefore delivered by the Despot of Serbia, ÃÂuraÃÂ BrankoviÃÂ. The city's landmarks endured substantial harm in the sack, especially the house of prayer of Hagios Demetrios, as fighters scoured them for valuable articles and shrouded treasure. This harm was intensified later when the Sultan requested that marble segments be taken from them and taken to his capital, Adrianople, to clear a shower. On the fourth day, Sultan Murad entered the city himself and implored at the Church of the Acheiropoietos, which turned into the city's first mosque. The Sultan at that point reestablished request, removing the warriors from the homes they had involved and returning them to their proprietors. Just 2,000 of the populace were left after the sack, huge numbers of whom changed over to Islam. The Sultan before long took measures to repopulate the city. He guaranteed to restore their properties to those occupants who had fled on the off chance that they returned, and now and again even recovered hostages from the sack himself. Likewise, he acquired Muslim and Christian pilgrims from different territories of Macedonia. An incredible number of void houses were reallocated and given to the pilgrims, while the greater part of the principle places of worship were changed over to mosques. The Turks settled for the most part in the upper piece of the city, from where they could more readily control it.
