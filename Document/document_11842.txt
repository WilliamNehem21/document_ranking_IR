On 10 June 1166, Becket expelled some of his adversaries, some explicitly by name, just as any who contradicted his motivation. Henry's reaction was to arrange the English diocesans to engage the pope, which they did at a committee that Foliot sorted out and drove in London on 24 June. The intrigue was composed by Foliot, and a different letter from the ministers, additionally composed by Foliot, was sent to the diocese supervisor. The ministers trusted the jury to decide wisely on the way that those banned had not been cautioned or permitted to guard themselves. They indicated out the pope that the ruler had not raised the contention and had acted sensibly to the last ecclesiastical suggestions in the mid year of 1165. Becket answered to these moves with a letter written to Foliot that was brimming with disdain and rebukes. Foliot's answer, in a letter that is generally titled "Multiplicem nobis", put forward his perspective on Becket's capacities as ecclesiastical overseer just as giving reasons why Becket wasn't right. He at that point proposed that the ecclesiastical overseer bargain and exercise some lowliness so as to achieve his objectives. Before the finish of 1166, Foliot figured out how to leave his authority of the appropriated Canterbury benefices, something he had been endeavoring to accomplish for quite a while, consequently expelling one wellspring of contention among him and Becket.
