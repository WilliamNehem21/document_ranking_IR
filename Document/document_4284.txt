Gaozong advanced Qin Hui in 1138 and place him responsible for considerations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and an extensive number of authorities at court reprimanded the harmony suggestions. Helped by his control of the Censorate, Qin cleansed his adversaries and proceeded with arrangements. In 1138 the Jin and Song consented to an arrangement that assigned the Yellow River as outskirt between the two states and perceived Gaozong as a "subject" of the Jin. But since there remained restriction to the arrangement in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the bargain never became effective. A Jurchen armed force driven by Wuzhu attacked in mid 1140. The Song counteroffensive that pursued accomplished substantial regional additions. Melody general Liu Qi () won a fight against Wuzhu at Shunchang (present day Fuyang in Anhui). Yue Fei was allocated to head the Song powers safeguarding the Huainan locale. Rather than progressing to Huainan, notwithstanding, Wuzhu withdrew to Kaifeng and Yue's military tailed him into Jin region, defying a request by Gaozong that restricted Yue from going into all out attack mode. Yue caught Zhengzhou and sent fighters over the Yellow River to work up a worker defiance to the Jin. On July 8, 1140, at the Battle of Yancheng, Wuzhu propelled an unexpected assault on Song powers with a multitude of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei guided his rangers to assault the Jurchen troopers and won an unequivocal triumph. He proceeded to Henan, where he recovered Zhengzhou and Luoyang. Later in 1140, Yue was compelled to pull back after the sovereign arranged him to come back to the Song court.
