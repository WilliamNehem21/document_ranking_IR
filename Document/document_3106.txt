The last night of chronicle was hung on January 28, 1985, at A&M Recording Studios in Hollywood. Michael Jackson touched base at 9ÃÂ pm, sooner than different craftsmen, to record his performance area and record a vocal tune independent from anyone else. He was in this way participated in the chronicle studio by the rest of the USA for Africa craftsmen, who included Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, and Smokey Robinson. Additionally in participation were five of Jackson's kin: Jackie, LaÃÂ Toya, Marlon, Randy, and Tito. A large number of the members came straight from an American Music Award function, which had been held that equivalent night. Welcomed performer Prince, who might have had a section in which he and Michael Jackson sang to one another, did not go to the chronicle session. The reason given for his nonappearance has fluctuated. One paper asserted that Prince did not have any desire to record with different acts. Another report, from the season of "We Are the World's" recording, proposed that the artist did not have any desire to share in the session since coordinator Bob Geldof considered him a "creep". Ruler did, in any case, give a restrictive track, "4 The Tears In Your Eyes", for the "We Are the World" collection. Taking all things together, more than 45 of America's top artists took an interest in the chronicle, and another 50 must be dismissed. After entering the account studio, the performers were welcomed by a sign stuck to the entryway which read, "If it's not too much trouble abandon your self images." were likewise welcomed by Stevie Wonder, who announced that if the chronicle was not finished in one take, he and Ray Charles, two visually impaired men, would drive everyone home.
