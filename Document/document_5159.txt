Hoffman was held in high respect inside both the film and theater businesses, and he was regularly refered to in the media as one of the best on-screen characters of his age. Regardless of this status among his companions and pundits, he was never a standout amongst the most prevalent film stars, and has been ignored in arrangements ever most prominent on-screen characters. He was not a run of the mill film performing artist, with a plump form and lacking matinÃÂ©e icon looks, however Hoffman asserted that he was appreciative for his appearance as it made him convincing in a wide scope of jobs. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, "The terrible news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. Fortunately he'll work for an amazing remainder". The "Aiken Standard" of South Carolina alluded to him as a "hostile to star", whose genuine personality stayed "undefined and unmoored". Hoffman was intensely mindful that he was frequently unreasonably unconventional for the Academy voters. He commented, "I'm certain that individuals in the enormous partnerships that run Hollywood don't know very how to manage somebody like me, yet that is OK. I think there are other individuals who are keen on what I do."
