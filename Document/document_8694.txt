An upbeat parade went through the lanes of London, with Sheppard's truck drawn along Holborn and Oxford Street joined by a mounted City Marshal and liveried Javelin Men. The event was as much as anything a festival of Sheppard's life, gone to by hordes of up to 200,000 (33% of London's populace). The parade ended at the City of Oxford bar on Oxford Street, where Sheppard drank a half quart of sack. A jamboree climate infested Tyburn, where his "official" collection of memoirs, distributed by Applebee and most likely secretly composed by Defoe, was on special. Sheppard gave "a paper to somebody as he mounted the platform", maybe as a representative underwriting of the record in the "Account". His slight form had supported his past jail get away, yet it sentenced him to a moderate passing by strangulation from the executioner's noose. In the wake of hanging for the recommended 15 minutes, his body was chopped down. The group squeezed forward to prevent his body from being evacuated, dreading analyzation; their activities accidentally kept Sheppard's companions from actualizing an arrangement to take his body to a specialist trying to restore him. His gravely battered remains were recouped later and covered in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields that night.
