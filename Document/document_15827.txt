"The Red Badge of Courage" received generally positive reviews from critics on its initial publication; in particular, it was said to be a remarkably modern and original work. Appleton's 1895 publication went through ten editions in the first year alone, making Crane an overnight success at the age of twenty-four. H. G. Wells, a friend of the author, later wrote that the novel was greeted by an "orgy of praise" in England and the United States. An anonymous reviewer for "The New York Press" wrote shortly after the novel's initial publication that "One should be forever slow in charging an author with genius, but it must be confessed that "The Red Badge of Courage" is open to the suspicion of having greater power and originality than can be girdled by the name of talent." The reviewer for "The New York Times" was impressed by Crane's realistic portrayal of war, writing that the book "strikes the reader as a statement of facts by a veteran", a sentiment that was echoed by the reviewer for "The Critic", who called the novel "a true book; true to life, whether it be taken as a literal transcript of a soldier's experiences in his first battle, or... a great parable of the inner battle which every man must fight."
