In 1976, Agnew reported that he was setting up an altruistic establishment "Training for Democracy", however nothing more was known about this after B'nai B'rith blamed it for being a front for Agnew's enemy of Israeli perspectives. Agnew was presently well sufficiently off to move in 1977 to another home at The Springs Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, and quickly subsequently to reimburse the Sinatra advance. That year, in a progression of broadcast interviews with British TV have David Frost, Nixon guaranteed that he had no immediate job in the procedures that had prompted Agnew's renunciation and suggested that his VP had been harassed by the liberal media: "He committed errors ... be that as it may, I don't think for one moment that Spiro Agnew intentionally felt that he was abusing the law". In 1980, Agnew distributed a diary, "Go Quietly ... or disaster will be imminent". In it, he challenged his absolute honesty of the charges that had brought his abdication, and asserted that he had been constrained by the White House to "go unobtrusively" or face an implicit danger of conceivable death, a recommendation that Agnew biographer Joseph P. Coffey depicts as "preposterous". Agnew's affirmations of blamelessness were undermined when his previous legal advisor George White affirmed that his customer had conceded statehouse pay off to him, saying it had been continuing "for a thousand years".
