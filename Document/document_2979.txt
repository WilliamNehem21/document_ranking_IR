Roger kicked the bucket in December 1139 while in the ruler's guardianship. After the demise of his uncle, Nigel, at that point in East Anglia, revolted. In January 1140, he sustained the Isle of Ely, yet was before long attacked and compelled to escape. Indeed, even his own house of prayer part would not bolster him, and his revolt fallen in January. Nigel took asylum at the court of Stephen's opponent, the Empress Matilda, who had arrived in England in the south on 30 September 1139 of every an offer to take the position of authority. The revolt stood minimal shot of succeeding, for there were no supporters of Matilda near East Anglia, and almost certainly, Nigel responded increasingly out of dread and outrage at his uncle's demise than all else. It seems likely that Nigel engaged Pope Innocent II as of now, for in October 1140 Innocent issued an ecclesiastical bull, or ecclesiastical guidance, requesting the rebuilding to Nigel of the terrains of his ministerial office, and it creates the impression that after the catch of Stephen, Matilda figured out how to reestablish Nigel to Ely quickly. In 1141, Nigel, alongside his sibling Alexander, was one of the supporters of Matilda who, after the catch of Stephen by Matilda's powers, achieved a concurrence with Henry of Blois to supplant Stephen with Matilda on the position of authority. Eventually, this understanding came to nothing when Matilda's main supporter, her stepbrother Robert of Gloucester, was caught and later traded for Stephen. Stephen's discharge implied that the lord was allowed to send Geoffrey de Mandeville against Nigel, and Nigel submitted to the ruler, most likely in 1142.
