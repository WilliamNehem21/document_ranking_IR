Crow Dog was a BrulÃÂ© subchief who lived on the Great Sioux Reservation, in the part that is presently the Rosebud Indian Reservation in south-focal South Dakota on its fringe with Nebraska. The clan had made a few arrangements with the United States, the most huge being the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. This bargain gave that Indians consented to turn over those blamed for violations to the Indian operator, a delegate of the U.S. government in Indian issues. The arrangement additionally stipulated that ancestral individuals would remain on the booking gave (which incorporated the Black Hills) except if three-fourths of the grown-up male inborn individuals concurred something else. In 1874, Colonel George Armstrong Custer drove a gathering into the Black Hills to research gossipy tidbits about gold. When he reported the disclosure of gold on French Creek, the Black Hills Gold Rush acquired miners into that territory infringement of the Fort Laramie bargain. The Lakota dissented in 1875 without any result, as the United States requested that the Lakota sell the Black Hills. The United States at that point announced the Lakota as threatening, which began the Black Hills War. The war incorporated the Battle of the Rosebud, the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the Battle of Slim Buttes, among others. The war finished in 1877. Crow Dog battled in this war, while the man he later executed, Spotted Tail, did not. Congress passed a law later in 1877 () that removed the Black Hills from the clan, in opposition to the language of the arrangement.
