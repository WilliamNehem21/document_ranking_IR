She was just hit by a solitary 12-inch shell that injured two crew members. The two weapons in her toward the back 12-inch firearm turret, nonetheless, were impaired by shells that exploded rashly in their barrels. Thus she focused the majority of her shoot upon the ships and albeit the two boats were just softly harmed by the Japanese shells, which for the most part neglected to infiltrate any defensive layer and exploded on effect. The ship made the basic hits of the fight, be that as it may, when two of her 12-inch shells struck the extension of "Tsesarevich", slaughtering the Russian squadron authority, Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, two of his staff officers and the ship's officer. The ship's wheel was stuck to port by destruction and afterward eased back to an end which tossed the remainder of the Russian boats into absolute disarray. The second-in-direction, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, in the long run dealt with the rest of the squadron and made a beeline for Port Arthur. Somewhat over two months after the fact, on 26 October, "Asahi" struck a mine off Port Arthur while on bar obligation. Seriously harmed, she was under fix at Sasebo Naval Arsenal from November 1904 to April 1905.
