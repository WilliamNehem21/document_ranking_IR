On 19 January AjKowoj, the king of the Kowoj, arrived at NojpetÃ©n and spoke with AvendaÃ±o, arguing against the acceptance of Christianity and Spanish rule. The discussions between AvendaÃ±o, Kan EkÊ¼ and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza â and the apparent treachery of the Itza king in offering his kingdom to the Spanish undermined Kan Ek's power over his own people. Kan EkÊ¼ learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their ChakÊ¼an Itza allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to MÃ©rida via Tipuj. The Itza king's efforts to save his Spanish guests effectively ended his power to rule; from that point on anti-Spanish sentiment governed Itza responses to the Spanish. The Franciscans were guided to Yalain where they were well received but while they were there the Yalain heard rumours of battle and a Spanish advance towards Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡. The Franciscans were shown a path that led to Tipuj but their Yalain guides soon abandoned them. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of AvendaÃ±o's companions, but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki and from there made their way back to MÃ©rida.
