In the English Civil War, the town changed hands a few times, and in 1645 the extension was seized by Royalist fighters from Raglan in a fizzled endeavor to retake the town from the Parliamentarian powers under Colonel Kyrle. Kissack depicts the commitment as "the most fearless Royalist assault made (on) Monmouth", which saw eight of Kyrle's rivals murdered and five caught. By 1705, the scaffold and gatehouse required upkeep: the first towers were supplanted with strong dividers, and the structure was refitted to shape a two-story abiding house with timber and strip expansions anticipating over the stream. The house was then rented to an inhabitant guard, in charge of fixing and keeping up the structure. Some portion of the gatehouse stayed being used as a lock-up. Such different utilizations were normal; the classicist C. J. Bond recorded that "entryways regularly included chambers which could be utilized for lock-ups, houses of prayer or meeting rooms". Both the scaffold and the gatehouse were again fixed somewhere in the range of 1771 and 1775. The bill for fixes incorporated the expense of 100 gallons of beer for the laborers utilized. Exchange kept on being fundamental to the significance of the extension. The Monmouthshire essayist and craftsman Fred Hando records that, on a solitary Saturday in the mid eighteenth century, "500 steeds each conveying five bushels of corn entered by method for the Monnow entryway".
