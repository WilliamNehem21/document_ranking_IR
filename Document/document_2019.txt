Regardless of the triumphs under Basil, amid the rule of his successor Leo VI the Wise (886Ã¢ÂÂ 912), the Empire again confronted genuine dangers. In the north, a war broke out against the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, and a piece of the Imperial Fleet was utilized in 895 to ship a multitude of Magyars over the Danube to strike Bulgaria. The Bulgarian war created a few exorbitant thrashings, while in the meantime the Arab maritime danger achieved new statures, with progressive assaults destroying the shores of Byzantium's maritime heartland, the Aegean Sea. In 891 or 893, the Arab armada sacked the island of Samos and took its "stratÃÂgos" prisoner, and in 898, the eunuch chief naval officer Raghib stole away 3,000 Byzantine mariners of the "Kibyrrhaiotai" as detainees. These misfortunes bared Byzantine guards, opening the Aegean up to strikes by the Syrian armadas. The primary overwhelming blow came in 901, when the maverick Damian of Tarsus pillaged Demetrias, while in the following year, Taormina, the Empire's last station in Sicily, tumbled to the Muslims. The best fiasco, be that as it may, came in 904, when another rebel, Leo of Tripoli, assaulted the Aegean. His armada entered even into the Dardanelles, before continuing to sack the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, all while the Empire's armada stayed inactive despite the Arabs' unrivaled numbers. Besides, the Cretan corsairs' strikes achieved such power, that before the finish of Leo's rule, the majority of the southern Aegean islands were either surrendered or compelled to acknowledge Muslim control and pay tribute to the privateers. It is nothing unexpected that a guarded and careful outlook is predominant in the Leo's contemporary guidelines on maritime fighting ("Naumachica").
