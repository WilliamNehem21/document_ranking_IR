Throughout the following month, discussion against the band developed. VP Dan Quayle marked "Cop Killer" as being "indecent," and President George H.W. Hedge freely upbraided any record organization that would discharge such an item. "Body Count" was expelled from the racks of a retail location in Greensboro, North Carolina after neighborhood police had told the administration that they would never again react to any crisis calls at the store on the off chance that they kept on selling the collection. In July 1992, the New Zealand Police Commissioner ineffectively endeavored to keep an Ice-T show in Auckland, contending that "Any individual who results in these present circumstances nation lecturing in revolting terms the executing of police, ought not be welcome here," before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the Indecent Publications Tribunal, with an end goal to get it prohibited under New Zealand's Indecent Publications Act. This was the first run through in 20 years that a sound account had preceded the oversight body, and the first historically speaking case including prominent music. Subsequent to looking into the different entries, and listening cautiously to the collection, the Tribunal found the melody "Cop Killer" to be "not exhortatory," saw the collection as showing "a fair reason," and discovered Body Count not foul.
