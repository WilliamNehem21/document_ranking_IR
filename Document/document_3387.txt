As the sun set on 13 September, Kawaguchi confronted Edson's 830 Marines with 3,000 troops of his detachment, in addition to a collection of light cannons. The night was pitch dark, with no moon. At 21:00, seven Japanese destroyers quickly barraged the edge. Kawaguchi's assault started soon after sunset, with Kokusho's regiment striking Raider Company B on the Marine right flank, just toward the west of the edge. The power of the attack caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123. Under Marine big guns shoot, Kokusho reassembled his men and proceeded with his assault. Without stopping to endeavor to "move up" the other close-by Marine units, whose flanks were presently unprotected, Kokusho's unit flooded forward through the swampy marshes between the edge and the Lunga River, heading for the landing strip. Kokusho's men happened upon a heap of Marine supplies and apportions. Not having eaten sufficiently for a few days, they delayed to "gorge themselves" on the "C" and "K" apportions. Kokusho requested his men to proceed with the assault. At about 03:00, he drove them against the Marine units around the northern segment of the edge, barely shy of the landing strip, just as Hill 123. In the substantial battling that pursued, Kokusho and around 100 of his men were slaughtered, finishing that assault.
