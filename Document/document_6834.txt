The story pursued an anonymous warrior who turned into the player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior was a local of Kirra whose father was slaughtered by a coldblooded general who harmed the water supply of the town, executing numerous individuals. Prior to passing on, the warrior's dad coaxed him to respect the divine beings and vow to never give hurt a chance to go to their family. The warrior swore his dad's pledge and was met by a shrouded figure, The Giver, who guided him and tailed him all through his adventure. Before long, the warrior called upon Ares to spare his kin from the harmful water; the god annihilated the reservoir conduit and water wheel that provided water to the town. The warrior at that point experienced the enduring fighters who had been under his dad's direction. One trooper told the warrior that swords alone couldn't overcome the general. The warrior and his men made a trip to the place that is known for Aeaea and selected the witch Circe, who apparently likewise looked for retribution against the general. Circe conceded the troopers otherworldly weapons to help them on their adventure, and proposed that they see the Oracle of Delphi to find whether the general had any shortcomings. Amid this time, the warrior promised dependability to Poseidon and to ensure his men.
