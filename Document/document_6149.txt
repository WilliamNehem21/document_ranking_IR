At 6:30 left the West Dock, Millwall, responsible for Mr Dicks, pilot; continuing gradually, the ace and pilot being on the upper bridgeÃÂ ... Light air and climate minimal murky. At 7:45 pm continuing at half speed down Gallions Reach. Being about focal point of the Reach, watched a journey steamer coming up Barking Reach, appearing red and masthead lights, when we ported our rudder to keep over towards Tripcock Point. As the vessel neared, saw that the other steamer had ported, and quickly a short time later observed that she had starboarded and was endeavoring to cross our bows, appearing green light close under the port bow. Seeing impact inescapable, ceased our motors and turned around full speed, when the two vessels impacted, the bow of "Bywell Castle" cutting into the other steamer, which was packed with travelers, with a terrifying accident. Took quick methods for sparing life by pulling up over the bows a few men of the travelers, tossing rope's-finishes over all round the ship, tossing more than four lifebuoys, a hold stepping stool and a few boards, and getting out three water crafts, keeping the whistle blowing uproariously all the ideal opportunity for help, which was rendered by a few pontoons from shore and a vessel from a passing steamer. The journey steamer, which ended up being "Princess Alice", turning over and sinking under the bows. Prevailing with regards to saving a large number of travelers and secured throughout the evening. About 8:30 pm the steamer "Duke of Teck" came nearby and took off such travelers as had not been taken on shore in the water crafts.
