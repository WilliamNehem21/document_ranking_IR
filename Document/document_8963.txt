On 2 September, Walker talked by phone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command, in Tokyo. He depicted the circumstance around the Perimeter and said the most genuine danger was along the limit between the U.S. second and 25th Infantry Divisions. He said he had begun the first Provisional Marine Brigade toward Yongsan yet had not yet discharged them for responsibility there and he needed to make certain that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur endorsed his utilization of them, since he realized this would meddle with different plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he didn't figure he could reestablish the second Division lines without utilizing them. Hickey answered that MacArthur had the day preceding endorsed the utilization of the Marines if and when Walker thought about it important. A couple of hours after this discussion, at 13:15, Walker appended the first Provisional Marine Brigade to the U.S. second Division and requested an organized assault by every single accessible component of the division and the Marines, with the mission of pulverizing the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the second Division part and of reestablishing the stream line. The Marines were to be discharged from second Division control when this mission was cultivated.
