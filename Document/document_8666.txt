It is absolutely clear that Jocelin was a standout amongst the most regarded figures in the kingdom. In this period, the Pope named Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) a bigger number of times than some other priest in the kingdom. As a cleric and an ex-abbot, different precincts and cloisters called him in to intervene question, as prove by his regular appearance as an observer in debate settlements, for example, the question between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a debate between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey. Jocelin had the regard of the mainstream world class as well. He saw 24 regal sanctions and 40 non-regal contracts, including sanctions issued by David, Earl of Huntingdon (the sibling of King William), Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, and Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again went with the ruler to England when the lord headed out to Woodstock close Oxford to wed Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186. The marriage was honored by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William depended her for the adventure to Scotland.
