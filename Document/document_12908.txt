Around the same time the Peace Conference began, nearby voters chose Tyler to the Virginia Secession Convention. He directed the opening session on February 13, 1861, while the Peace Conference was still under way. Tyler surrendered any expectation of trade off and considered withdrawal to be the main choice, foreseeing that a perfect split of every single Southern state would not result in war. In mid-March he criticized the Peace Conference goals, and on April 4 he voted in favor of withdrawal notwithstanding when the tradition rejected it. On April 17, after the assault on Fort Sumter and Lincoln's call for troops, Tyler casted a ballot with the new greater part for withdrawal. He headed a council that arranged the terms for Virginia's entrance into the Confederate States of America and helped set the compensation rate for military officers. On June 14, Tyler marked the Ordinance of Secession, and multi week later the tradition collectively chosen him to the Provisional Confederate Congress. Tyler was situated in the Confederate Congress on August 1, 1861, and he served until just before his passing in 1862. In November 1861, he was chosen to the Confederate House of Representatives however he kicked the bucket of a stroke in his room at the Ballard Hotel in Richmond before the principal session could open in February 1862.
