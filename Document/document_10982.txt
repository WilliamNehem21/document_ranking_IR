Milner and partners analyzed the Utah trackway SGDS.18.T1 in 2009, which comprises of run of the mill impressions with tail hauls and an increasingly bizarre resting follow, saved in lacustrine shoreline sandstone. The trackway started with the creature previously arranged roughly in parallel with the shoreline, and after that halting by a berm with the two feet in parallel, whereafter it brought down its body, and brought its metatarsals and the callosity around its ischium to the ground; this made impressions of symmetrical "impact points" and round impressions of the ischium. The piece of the tail nearest to the body was kept off the ground, while the end further far from the body reached the ground. The way that the creature laid on a slant is the thing that empowered it to convey two hands to the ground near the feet. Subsequent to resting, the dinosaur rearranged advances, and left new impressions with its feet, metatarsals, and ischium, yet not the hands. The correct foot presently ventured on the print of the correct hand, and the second paw of the left foot made a drag mark from the first resting position to the following. After some time, the creature stood up and moved advances, with the left foot first, and once completely erect, it strolled over the remainder of the uncovered surface, while leaving dainty drag marks with the finish of the tail.
