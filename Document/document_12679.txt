In a positive audit of the melody, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave it four out of five stars and adulated Rihanna's course towards a "milder and increasingly productive edge". Brittany Lewis of GlobalGrind called "Precious stones" an appealing tune and felt that it could be another hit for Rihanna. Glenn Gamboa of "Newsday" said that, in spite of the fact that it doesn't seem like a decided hit, the expressive substance of the melody portrays an "individual move" for Rihanna. As indicated by James Montgomery of MTV News, "Precious stones" is more positive than past singles, for example, "We Found Love" and "Where Have You Been", in spite of its moderate rhythm. Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is more grounded than at any other time. Contactmusic's commentator depicted it as a "laid-back track", and proposed that the expressive substance is identified with her previous beau Chris Brown. In a track-by-track audit of "Proud", Andrew Hampp of "Announcement" found the tune rousing and remarked that it "discovers Rihanna completing one of her throatiest, most ardent vocals to date". Andy Kellman of Allmusic refered to the tune as one of the features on "Proud", and gave it three and a half stars.
