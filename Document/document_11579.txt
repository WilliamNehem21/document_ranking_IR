At Geauga Academy, which he went to from 1848 to 1850, Garfield learned scholastic subjects he possessed not recently had energy for. He shone as an understudy, and was particularly keen on dialects and statement. He started to value the power a speaker had over a crowd of people, composing that the speaker's stage "makes some fervor. I adore tumult and examination and magnificence in shielding disagreeable truth against mainstream mistake." Geauga was co-instructive, and Garfield was pulled in to one of his kindred understudies, Lucretia Rudolph, whom he later wedded. To help himself at Geauga, he filled in as a craftsman's associate and as an educator. The need to go from town to town to discover a spot as an educator nauseated Garfield, and he from there on built up an abhorrence of what he called "place-chasing", which progressed toward becoming, he stated, "a mind-blowing law." In later years, he would shock his companions by giving positions a chance to pass that could have been his with a touch of politicking. Garfield had gone to chapel more to satisfy his mom than to venerate God, however in his late adolescents experienced a religious arousing, and went to many camp gatherings, at one of which he was conceived once more. The following day, March 4, 1850, he was purified through water into Christ by being submerged in the frosty waters of the Chagrin River.
