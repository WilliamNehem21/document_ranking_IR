In December 2015, stargazers at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) identified a short arrangement of 350ÃÂ GHz heartbeats that they closed should either be a progression of free sources, or a solitary, quick moving source. Choosing that the last was the no doubt, they determined dependent on its speed that, were it bound to the Sun, the article, which they named "Gna" after a quick moving dispatcher goddess in Norse folklore, would be about 12Ã¢ÂÂ 25 AU inaccessible and have a diminutive person planet-sized distance across of 220 to 880ÃÂ km. Be that as it may, in the event that it were a rebel planet not gravitationally bound to the Sun, and as far away as 4000 AU, it could be a lot bigger. The paper was never formally acknowledged, and has been pulled back until the identification is affirmed. Researchers' responses to the notice were to a great extent wary; Mike Brown remarked that, "In the event that the facts demonstrate that ALMA coincidentally found a huge external Solar System object in its minor, little, small, field of view, that would recommend that there are something like 200,000 Earth-sized planets in the external Solar System ... Far and away superior, I recently understood that this many Earth-sized planets existing would destabilize the whole Solar System and we would all bite the dust."
