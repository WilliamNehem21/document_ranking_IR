Ernst Lindemann was frustrated by the fact thatâas commander of the Naval Gunnery Schoolâhe would never come into direct contact with the enemy. When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that he would be able to get "Bismarck" ready for action before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding "Bismarck", Lindemann had never held any shipboard command, a situation rare if not unique in the "Kriegsmarine". Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany's leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.
Lindemann arrived at the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding works in Hamburg at the beginning of August 1940. "Bismarck"s keel had been laid on 1 July 1936 and she was launched on 14 February 1939. Burkard Freiherr von MÃ¼llenheim-Rechberg joined "Bismarck" as fourth gunnery officer in June 1940, and he would become the highest-ranking officer to survive "Bismarck"s last battle on 27 May 1941. Much of what is currently known about "Bismarck"s final days is attributed to his account as a witness. Lindemann made Von MÃ¼llenheim-Rechberg his personal adjutant and instructed him to refer to the ship as "he" rather than "she"; Lindemann considered the ship too powerful to be referred to as a female. He commissioned the battleship on 24 August 1940. He showed a great deal of attachment to the ship and was respected by his crew.
