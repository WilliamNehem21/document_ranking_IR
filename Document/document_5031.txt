Eight laps later Earnhardt passed Raines for second position, and Gordon had a 1.7-second favorable position over Earnhardt by lap 80. Raines was passed by Stewart for third on lap 83, and Johnson took third spot from Stewart six laps later. J.J. Yeley headed to pit street on the 94th lap with a level left-back tire. On lap 106, Burton (whose vehicle was hot on account of the tape on his hood) reached Gordon and got away with minor harm after a three-lap fight. Twenty-four laps later Johnson passed Earnhardt for second spot, and on lap 144 he passed Gordon for the lead. One lap later Gordon recovered in front of the pack, and fabricated a quarter-second lead by lap 150. Johnson moved once more into the lead on lap 153. Two laps later Stremme spun sideways, provoking the third alert, and every one of the pioneers made pit stops. Johnson remained the pioneer at the lap-161 restart, in front of Gordon and Stewart. After the alert finished, Burton changed to a second start in the wake of inclination he had an issue with his motor. Forty-two laps later Waltrip's turn-four turn provoked the fourth alert, in spite of the fact that he had the capacity to proceed. Amid the alert, the pioneers again made pit stops. Johnson, who had minor pneumatic stress changes due to daylight introduction at his pit stop, kept up his lead at the restart.
