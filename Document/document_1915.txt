Kellner and Campos initially found the jaws of "Thalassodromeus" like those of present day skimmers Ã¢ÂÂ three feathered creature species in the family "Rhynchops" Ã¢ÂÂ with their sideways-packed jaws, sharp edge like snout, and projecting lower jaw (taking after scissors in side view). They contended that "Thalassodromeus" would have encouraged likewise, as suggested by the variety name; skimmers skim over the outside of water, plunging their lower jaw to get fish and shellfish. Kellner and Campos recorded extra skull highlights of skimmers which are adjustments for skim encouraging, including expanded palatine bones, an element likewise imparted to "Thalassodromeus". In contrast to skimmers and different pterosaurs, the palatine bones of "Thalassodromeus" were curved, which the essayists proposed could have helped it immediately store sustenance. Like skimmers, "Thalassodromeus" additionally seems to have had incredible neck muscles, extensive jaw muscles, and an upper jaw tip very much flooded by blood (highlights which Kellner and Campos deciphered as adjustments for skimming). They inferred that the scissor-like bill and flimsy peak nearly made different methods of catching prey Ã¢ÂÂ, for example, swooping down toward water and diving into it Ã¢ÂÂ incomprehensible. Yielding the trouble of recreating "Thalassodromeus"s angling strategy, they imagined it with a less-versatile neck than skimmers; with the peak blocking its head from submersion, it would float and just fold its wings once in a while. They found that the pterosaur with jaws most like those of "Thalassodromeus" was the littler "Rhamphorhynchus", in spite of the fact that they trusted that it would have had restricted skimming capacity.
