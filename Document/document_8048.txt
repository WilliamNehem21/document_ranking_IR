John Hick condemned the Augustinian theodicy when he built up his own theodicy in 1966. Hick bolstered the perspectives on the German scholar Friedrich Schleiermacher, which he named Irenaean, who contended that the world is flawlessly appropriate for the ethical improvement of people and this legitimizes the presence of shrewdness. He demanded that, while the Augustinian theodicy endeavored to legitimize authentic events of fiendishness, the Irenaean theodicy looks to legitimize God everlastingly. Hick saw Augustine's view that an ideal world turned out badly as indiscernible and conflicting, and contended that, on the off chance that people were made consummately great, at that point it should have been incomprehensible for them to have settled on an indecent decision. He scrutinized the accomplishment of the theodicy with the charge that it doesn't expel the fault for shrewdness from God: Augustine exhibited a philosophy of destiny; Hick contended that, if God knew the decisions that his creation would make, he should be in charge of them. Hick's theodicy dismissed the possibility of the legacy of corruption, and he trusted that an unceasing hellfire would render "a Christian theodicy incomprehensible". The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, endeavor to shield God from being in charge of underhandedness; rather, it contends that God is capable yet advocated for it in view of the advantages it has for human improvement. The two theodicies stress the flawlessness of God's creation, however contrast in why the world is viewed as impeccable. Augustine additionally accepted, as Hick did, that bringing great out of abhorrence is desirable over the underhandedness not happening in any case.
