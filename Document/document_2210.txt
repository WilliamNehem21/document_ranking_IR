Tracey Ross was initially reluctant to try out for another cleanser musical show after her spell as Diana Douglas on "Ryan's Hope" from 1985 to 1987, which she contrasted with "working in a funeral home" on the grounds that the show was always undermined with crossing out. She at first rejected the idea to play Eve Russell, however she was more than once reached by NBC about the job more than a while before her operator persuaded her to try out for "Interests"' throwing chief Jackie Briskey. Ross said later that she didn't understand that "Interests" should be "wacky" until the character Grace Bennett skimmed out of her window. In light of the principal week's contents, she depicted "Interests" as "my sort of show" attributable to the extraordinary and dream components. Ross assumed the job from the arrangement debut on July 5, 1999 to its finale on August 7, 2008. In 2003, performers Amanda Maiden and Kimberly Kevon Williams played the character in flashbacks to her adolescence and her time as a dance club artist. Ross depicted "Interests" as the inverse of "Ryan's Hope"; "Interests", she felt, was "the spring of a cleanser musical drama" due to the cast and team's fervor about future storylines, while "Ryan's Hope" was "the winter of one" because of the dread of retraction.
