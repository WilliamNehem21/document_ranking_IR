In late 1960 or mid 1961, another I-75/USÃÂ 10/USÃÂ 23 expressway was worked from the north end of the Saginaw sidestep to Kawkawlin, using the Zilwaukee drawbridge (later supplanted by the Zilwaukee Bridge) over the Saginaw River; when it opened, MSHD broadened M-13 along the previous course of USÃÂ 23 from the northside of Saginaw into Bay City as far as possible of the interstate at Kawkawlin. Another segment associated the Whitmore Lake zone with Brighton in the equivalent time span. General Motors was offering in 1961 to develop an electronic expressway. USÃÂ 23 between Ann Arbor and Toledo was under thought to be the area of this venture; the testing for such a roadway was at last done at Ohio State University. Before the year's over, turnpike areas opened to sidestep Saginaw south and ran south to Birch Run, another associated south from Fenton to Hartland, and a third associated Milan with Dundee. The rest of the holes were wiped out with extra expressway openings in 1962: Brighton to Hartland opened in September, and Milan to Ann Arbor opened in November. The I-75/USÃÂ 23 expressway north of the Kawkawlin territory to Standish opened in 1967, and M-13 was appeared on maps finishing USÃÂ 23's previous course Linwood and Pinconning after the change.
