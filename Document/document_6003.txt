The yellow-colored honeyeater is a medium-little, grayish-dark colored fledgling that takes its normal name from particular yellow stripes on the sides of the head. Yellow plumes structure a tight stripe over the expand, which widens and bends underneath the eye to finish in a little white fix of quills on the ear coverts. Over the yellow stripe is a bruised eye stripe which is broken by a little yellow to grayish fix behind the eye, and beneath is another unmistakable dark stripe running the length of the yellow line. The jawline, throat and bosom are a pale grayish darker, streaked with marginally darker dim, and the belly is light dim. The chest area is a dull grayish dark colored to olive-darker. Olive green external edges on the remiges consolidate to shape an olive board on the collapsed wing. The bill is dark and somewhat down-bended, and the expand is cream. The legs and feet are dim dark colored. The iris is a shadowy blue in grown-up winged creatures, and dark colored in adolescents. The adolescent is fundamentally the same as the grown-up, with marginally less streaking on the bosom, an orange-dark colored tip on the bill and a yellower expand; male and female winged creatures are likewise comparative, with the male being somewhat bigger (by and large, heavier); and in the field there are no obvious contrasts between the subspecies. The yellow-colored honeyeater midpoints long, with a wingspan of and a weight of between (normal ).
