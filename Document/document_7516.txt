The court's decision swelled the well known tide for the Claimant. He and Kenealy were hailed as legends, the last as a saint who had relinquished his legitimate profession. George Bernard Shaw, composing a lot later, featured the mystery whereby the Claimant was seen at the same time as a real baronet and as a regular workers man denied his lawful rights by a decision world class. In April 1874 Kenealy propelled a political association, the "Magna Charta Association", with a wide motivation that mirrored a portion of the Chartist requests of the 1840s. In February 1875 Kenealy battled a parliamentary by-decision for Stoke-upon-Trent as "The People's Candidate", and won with a resonating greater part. In any case, he neglected to influence the House of Commons to set up an illustrious commission into the Tichborne preliminary, his proposition verifying just his own vote and the help of two non-casting a ballot tellers, against 433 contradicted. From that point, inside parliament Kenealy turned into a for the most part ridiculed figure, and the vast majority of his battling was directed somewhere else. In the long periods of the Tichborne development's notoriety an extensive market was made for gifts as emblems, china puppets, teacloths and other memorabilia. In any case, by 1880 enthusiasm for the case had declined, and in the General Election of that year Kenealy was vigorously crushed. He passed on of heart disappointment a couple of days after the decision. The Magna Charta Association proceeded for a few additional years, with decreasing help; "The Englishman", the paper established by Kenealy amid the preliminary, shut down in May 1886, and there is no proof of the Association's proceeding with exercises after that date.
