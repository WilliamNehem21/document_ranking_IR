DiMaggio's retirement after the 1951 season gave Stengel more prominent authority over the players, as the connection among genius and director had once in a while been full. Stengel moved Mantle from ideal to focus field in DiMaggio's place. The Yankees were not the top picks to win the flag again in 1952, with DiMaggio resigned, Mantle as yet recouping from his damage and a few Yankees in military administration, conveyed in the Korean War. Sportswriters supported the Indians. More youthful players, some of whom Stengel had created, went to the fore, with Martin the ordinary second baseman out of the blue. Mantle demonstrated moderate to grow, yet hit well towards the finish of the period to complete at .311. The Yankee season was likewise moderate to jump on track; the group had a record of 18Ã¢ÂÂ 17 on May 30, yet they improved from there on. Stengel arranged about 100 distinctive lineup cards for the 1952 season. The race was still tight toward the beginning of September, and on September 5, Stengel addressed the group for unnecessary levity on the train after the Yankees lost two of three to Philadelphia. Humiliated by the scene, which advanced into print, the Yankees reacted by winning 15 of their next 19, securing the flag on September 27.
