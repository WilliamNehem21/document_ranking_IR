St. Clair's gathering left Fort Washington on October1. On November3, he requested his men to make camp on a little tributary of the Wabash River, erroneously trusting they were exploring the great outdoors on the St. Marys River. His aim was for the men to develop some defensive works the following day, however before dawn, a joined gathering of Miami and Canadians assaulted the gathering, steering them and catching piece of their gunnery and the greater part of their provisions. Of St. Clair's power of 1,400 men, 600 were murdered and 300 caught amid the assault. The Kentucky minute men dissipated amid the assault, and their pioneer, Colonel Oldham, was killed. By and by, they and most residents in Kentucky accused St. Clair for the whole fiasco. St. Clair withdrew to Fort Washington, and on November24, Scott went along with him there with 200 mounted volunteers in the event that the Indians chose to seek after him and attack Kentucky. When it ended up obvious that no Indian attack was inevitable, Scott's men returned home. Because of St. Clair's crusade, clans that had recently been unbiased in the conflictÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ including the Delawares and WyandotsÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ aligned with the Miami and Shawnee against the frontiersmen.
