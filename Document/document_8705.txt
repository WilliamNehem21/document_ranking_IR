To this end, endeavoring to widen South Africa's worldwide associations, he acknowledged dark outside ambassadors in the nation and started to design an arrangement to permit blended race game to avert South Africa's global disconnection. In any case, such approaches were disliked with his residential supporters and he was mindful so as not to go excessively far. Oborne expresses: "Vorster realized that there was a cutoff to how far he could abandon jeopardizing his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira."

Vorster in this manner attempted to give the impression abroad that D'Oliveira would be welcome, while in the meantime doing his most extreme to prevent him from playing. He pursued the British minister, Sir John Nicholls, and disclosed to him that a visit party including D'Oliveira would be worthy. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government. Vorster in the mean time observed D'Oliveira's advancement intently; from his presentation in 1966, South Africa kept a security document on him.
