Scheer switched the course of the armada through a "Gefechtskehrtwendung" (fight about turn), a move that required each unit in the German line to turn 180ÃÂ° at the same time. Having fallen behind, the boats of the II Battle Squadron couldn't fit in with the new course following the turn. "Deutschland" and the other five boats of the squadron were thusly on the withdrawn side of the German line. Mauve thought about moving his boats to the back of the line, toward the back of the III Battle Squadron gunboats, however ruled against it when he understood the development would meddle with the moving of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Rather, he endeavored to put his boats at the leader of the line. Later in the day, the hard-squeezed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being sought after by their British partners. "Deutschland" and the other alleged "five-minute boats" went to their guide by steaming between the contradicting battlecruiser squadrons. Poor perceivability made the ensuing commitment brief. "Deutschland" shot just a single round from her 28ÃÂ cm firearms amid this period. Mauve chose it is ill advised to proceed with the battle against the substantially more dominant battlecruisers, thus requested a 8-point swing to starboard.
