Drury Lane organized the musical show "Lodoiska", in which Grimaldi, his mom and his significant other all had featuring jobs. After this he was approached to arrange John Tobin's play, "The Honey Moon", at Drury Lane without prior warning. He acknowledged on the stipulation that his wages be expanded for the show's whole run and not simply until another moving teacher was found. The Drury Lane the executives consented to pay Grimaldi ÃÂ£2 more every week. Half a month into his new task, the executives designated James D'Egville as the new expressive dance ace. D'Egville's introduction generation was "Terpsichore's Return", in which Grimaldi played Pan, a job which he viewed as a standout amongst his best assignments to date. That October, be that as it may, the venue diminished his wages. The additional ÃÂ£2 that he had been guaranteed had been deducted from his compensation when "Terpsichore" shut, and he moved toward Thomas Dibdin for exhortation. Dibdin prompted him to leave Drury Lane and to take up a residency at the close-by Covent Garden Theater. Grimaldi kept in touch with Thomas Harris, the director of the Covent Garden Theater, planning to influence him to arrange Christmas emulates. Harris was at that point a supporter of the shows and had utilized the composition gifts of both Charles Dibdin and his co-author Charles Farley. Grimaldi met with Harris and acquired an agreement.
