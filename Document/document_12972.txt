During the 1930s, the prevalence of Pearl Buck's books, particularly "The Good Earth", just as developing American compassion toward China in its battles with Japanese Imperialism, opened up open doors for progressively positive Chinese jobs in U.S. films. Wong came back to the U.S. in June 1935 with the objective of acquiring the job of O-lan, the lead female character in MGM's film form of "The Good Earth". Since its distribution in 1931, Wong had made realized her longing to play O-lan in a film adaptation of the book; and as right on time as 1933, Los Angeles papers were touting Wong as the best decision for the part. By the by, the studio clearly never truly considered Wong for the job since Paul Muni, a performing artist of European drop, was to play O-lan's better half, Wang Lung, and the Hays Code restricted depicting miscegenation on camera (albeit both the characters were Chinese, the on-screen characters not being of a similar race gambled crossing paths with the Code). The Chinese government likewise prompted the studio against throwing Wong in the job. The Chinese guide to MGM remarked: "at whatever point she shows up in a motion picture, the papers print her image with the subtitle 'Anna May again loses face for China'ÃÂ ".
