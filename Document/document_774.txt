Manley depicts Headley as simply under medium tallness with slanting shoulders. His developments were exact and prudent on the cricket field; his top was for the most part at a slight edge and his sleeves were fastened down to the wrist. "Wisden" noted in 1933 that his planning and arrangement of the ball was flawless. Particularly sharp witted, he watched the ball onto the bat more than some other batsman. As per "Wisden", every one of his shots were similarly great yet most prominent was his on drive played from the back foot. He hit the ball hard and was hard to get out. He confronted analysis for playing off the back foot so regularly, however R. C. Robertson-Glasgow trusted his square cut, late cut, and snare were especially great. Headley was especially viable on terrible batting wickets. C. L. R. James determined that Headley found the middle value of 39.85 and passed fifty on seven events in thirteen innings on troublesome wickets. As per James' retribution, Bradman in comparable conditions passed fifty once, and arrived at the midpoint of 16.66 in fifteen innings. Headley himself favored batting when the chances supported the bowlers as he needed to go for his shots and play his characteristic assaulting diversion. He expressed: "On an awful wicket, it was you and the bowlerÃÂ ...no jabber."
