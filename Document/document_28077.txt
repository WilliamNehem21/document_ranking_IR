Among those who have praised "Greed" over the years are Sergei Eisenstein; Joseph von Sternberg, who said, "We were all influenced by "Greed""; Jean Renoir, who called it "the film of films"; and Ernst Lubitsch, who called von Stroheim "the only true 'novelist'" in films. More recently Guillermo del Toro called it "a perfect reflection of the anxiety permeating the passage into the 20th century and the absolute dehumanization that was to come", and Norbert Pfaffenbichler said that "the last shot of the movie is unforgettable." Jonathan Rosenbaum has stated that "Greed" was a major influence on the style and content of many films. Stroheim's shots filming the sun predated Akira Kurosawa's better-known uses of the technique in "Rashomon" (1950). Rosenbaum compared specific shot set-ups in "Greed" to shots in King Vidor's "The Crowd", Jean Renoir's "Le Crime de Monsieur Lange", Orson Welles's "The Magnificent Ambersons", Howard Hawks' "To Have and Have Not" and Michelangelo Antonioni's "L'Avventura". In addition, he likened certain plot elements or characters in "Greed" to John Huston's "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" (1948), Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window" (1954), Claude Chabrol's "Les Bonnes Femmes" (1960) and Elaine May's "Mikey and Nicky" (1975). Rosenbaum singled out Stroheim's influence on May, an American director, with "Mikey and Nicky" centering on the disintegration of a friendship over money and sex, and including grotesque elements and characters caught between innocence and corruption. Rosenbaum also asserts that Orson Welles' use of satirical caricatures in all of his films is in "the spirit of von Stroheim".
