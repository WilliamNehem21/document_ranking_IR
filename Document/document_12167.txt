"Triaenops menamena" is a medium-sized animal types with variable hide shading, running from rosy dark colored to dim. It is bigger and darker than "Paratriaenops auritus" and "P.ÃÂ furculus". Among living "Triaenops" species, it is littler than "T.ÃÂ persicus" and "T.ÃÂ afer", yet fairly bigger than "T.ÃÂ parvus". The wiped out "Triaenops goodmani", which is known just from three mandibles (lower jaws), is additionally bigger. In the impressively formed noseleaf (a gathering of meaty structures around the nose and mouth), "T.ÃÂ menamena" has the trident structure normal for "Triaenops" and "Paratriaenops": three contiguous lancets (anticipating structures) on the back leaf. In "T.ÃÂ menamena", the two external lancets are shorter than the center one and bended, though the three lancets are increasingly equivalent in "Paratriaenops". The front leaf contains a wide, level, even procedure and the moderate leaf contains a pointed procedure. The ears are little and wide and contain scores on the internal side. The hide is velvety and the hairs on the body are around 5 to 6ÃÂ mm long. The wing layer is dull and translucent and the finish of the tail for the most part extends from the uropatagium (tail film). Guys normal marginally bigger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305ÃÂ mm (10.6 to 12.0ÃÂ in).
