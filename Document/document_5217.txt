The "New York Daily Mirror" pundit stated, "Customized as a melodic play, "South Pacific" is only that. It flaunts no ballet productions and no hot hoofing. It has no tune in the traditional sense. Each one in it has an impact. It is probably going to set up another pattern in musicals." The audit proceeded: "Each number is outstanding to the point that it is hard to choose which will be the most well known." The survey in "New York World-Telegram" observed the show to be "a definitive present day mixing of music and mainstream theater to date, with the best sort of harmony among story and tune, and humorousness and disaster." Brooks Atkinson of "The New York Times" particularly applauded Pinza's execution: "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most delightful that has been heard on a Broadway organize for an age or two. He singsÃÂ ... with interminable delicacy of inclination and flawlessness of tone." He pronounced that "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, "should turn out to be sensibly unfading." Richard Watts, Jr. of the "New York Post" concentrated on Mary Martin's execution, expressing, "nothing I have ever observed her do set me up for the perfection, humor, present for upbeat portrayal, and sheer adorableness of her depiction of Nellie ForbushÃÂ ... who is so stunned to locate her initial racial preferences springing up. Hers is a totally overpowering exhibition."
