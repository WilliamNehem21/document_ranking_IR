Ganesha does not appear in the Indian epic literature that is dated to the Vedic period. A late interpolation to the epic poem "Mahabharata" (1.1.75-79) says that the sage Vyasa () asked Ganesha to serve as his scribe to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed but only on condition that Vyasa recites the poem uninterrupted, that is, without pausing. The sage agreed but found that to get any rest he needed to recite very complex passages so Ganesha would have to ask for clarifications. The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the "Mahabharata", in which the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote in an appendix. The story of Ganesha acting as the scribe occurs in 37 of the 59 manuscripts consulted during preparation of the critical edition. Ganesha's association with mental agility and learning is one reason he is shown as scribe for 's dictation of the "Mahabharata" in this interpolation. Richard L. Brown dates the story to the 8th century, and Moriz Winternitz concludes that it was known as early as c. 900, but it was not added to the "Mahabharata" some 150 years later. Winternitz also notes that a distinctive feature in South Indian manuscripts of the "Mahabharata" is their omission of this Ganesha legend. The term ' is found in some recensions of the ' and ' that are regarded as interpolations. A reference to "" ("Creator of Obstacles") in "Vanaparva" is also believed to be an interpolation and does not appear in the critical edition.
