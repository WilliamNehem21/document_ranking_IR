[A]/[G] Copy of "the Winchester Chronicle": [A] was replicated from [A] at Winchester in the eleventh century and pursues a tenth century duplicate of an Old English interpretation of Bede's "Ministerial History". The last archive duplicated was 1001, so the duplicate was made no sooner than that; an episcopal rundown annexed to [A] proposes that the duplicate was made by 1013. This original copy was totally crushed in the 1731 flame at Ashburnham House, where the Cotton Library was housed. Of the first 34 leaves, seven remain, ff. 39Ã¢ÂÂ 47 in the composition. In any case, a transcript had been made by Laurence Nowell, a sixteenth century collector, which was utilized by Abraham Wheelocke in a version of the "Narrative" imprinted in 1643. Along these lines, it is additionally now and again known as [W], after Wheelocke. Nowell's transcript replicated the genealogical presentation disconnected from [B] (the page now British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178), as opposed to that initially part of this report. The first [A] presentation would later be expelled before the flame and makes due as British Library Add MS 34652, f. 2. The nicknames [A], [A] and [G] get from Plummer, Smith and Thorpe, separately.
