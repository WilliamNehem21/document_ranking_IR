The phalanx development utilized by Greek armed forces had a particular propensity to veer to one side amid fight, "since dread makes each man do his best to protect his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the right". Customarily, a phalanx along these lines fixed up for the fight to come with the first class troops on the correct flank to counter this inclination. In this manner, in the Spartan phalanx at Leuctra, Cleombrotus and the first class 'Spartiates' were on the right, while the less experienced Peloponnesian partners were on the left. Be that as it may, expecting to counter the Spartans' numerical leverage, Epaminondas executed two strategic developments. Right off the bat, he took the best troops in the military, and masterminded them 50 positions profound (rather than the typical 8Ã¢ÂÂ 12 positions) on the "left" wing, inverse Cleombrotus and the Spartans, with Pelopidas and the Sacred Band on the extraordinary left flank. Also, perceiving, that he couldn't have coordinated the width of the Peloponnesian phalanx (even before the developing the left flank), he relinquished all endeavors to do as such. Rather, putting the flimsier troops on the correct flank, he "taught them to keep away from fight and pull back step by step amid the adversary's assault". The strategy of the profound phalanx had been foreseen by Pagondas, another Theban general, who utilized a 25 man profound arrangement at the Battle of Delium. Nonetheless, the switching of the situation of the world class troops, and a sideways line of assault were advancements; it appears that Epaminondas was in this way in charge of the military strategy of denying one's flank.
