In 1919, with an arrival to ordinariness after the First World War, Pick started creating plans to expand the Underground system out into rural areas that needed sufficient transport administrations. The main significant augmentations made to the Underground system since the three cylinder lines had opened were the expansion of the District Railway to Uxbridge in 1910, and the augmentation of the Bakerloo cylinder to Watford Junction somewhere in the range of 1913 and 1917. Affirmed plans put on hold amid the war were resuscitated: the CLR was reached out to Ealing Broadway in 1920, the Hampstead tube was stretched out to Edgware somewhere in the range of 1923 and 1924 and the C&SLR was reproduced and stretched out to Camden Town somewhere in the range of 1922 and 1924. Fund for the last two expansions was acquired through the administration's Trade Facilities Acts which guaranteed advances for open functions as a methods for reducing joblessness. For new lines, Pick initially considered stretching out Underground administrations toward the north-east of London where the mainline rural administrations of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and Great Eastern Railway (GER) were poor and problematic. Studies were completed for an expansion of the Piccadilly tube on GNR tracks to New Barnet and Enfield or on another course to Wood Green and plans were created for an augmentation of the CLR along GER tracks to Chingford and Ongar, yet both mainline organizations firmly restricted the Underground's infringement into their domains.
