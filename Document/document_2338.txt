Extrasolar planets have been affirmed in five star frameworks, four of which were found by the spiral speed technique. The range of Epsilon Coronae Borealis was investigated for a long time from 2005 to 2012, uncovering a planet around 6.7ÃÂ times as huge as Jupiter () circling each 418ÃÂ days at a normal separation of around 1.3ÃÂ AU. Epsilon itself is an orange mammoth of unearthly kind K2III that has swollen to and . Kappa Coronae Borealis is a ghostly kind K1IV orange subgiant almost twice as enormous as the Sun; around it lie a residue garbage plate, and one planet with a time of 3.4ÃÂ years. This current planet's mass is evaluated at . The elements of the flotsam and jetsam circle show it is likely there is a second substellar partner. Omicron Coronae Borealis is a K-type bunch goliath with one affirmed planet with a mass of that circles each 187ÃÂ daysÃ¢ÂÂone of the two least gigantic planets known around cluster monsters. HD 145457 is an orange monster of ghostly kind K0III found to have one planet of . Found by the Doppler strategy in 2010, it takes 176ÃÂ days to finish a circle. XO-1 is an extent 11 yellow primary grouping star found roughly light-years away, of ghostly kind G1V with a mass and range like the Sun. In 2006 the hot Jupiter exoplanet XO-1b was found circling XO-1 by the travel strategy utilizing the XO Telescope. Generally the measure of Jupiter, it finishes a circle around its star each three days.
