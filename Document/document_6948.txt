"Dei Gratia" had achieved a place of , halfway between the Azores and the shoreline of Portugal at around 1 pm on Wednesday, December 4, 1872, land time (Thursday, December 5, ocean time). As Captain Morehouse went ahead deck, the helmsman revealed a vessel about inaccessible, heading precariously towards "Dei Gratia". The ship's flighty developments and the odd arrangement of her sails drove Morehouse to presume that something wasn't right. As the vessels moved close, he could see no one on deck, and he got no answer to his signs, so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright in a ship's pontoon to examine. From the name on her stern the pair built up this was the "Mary Celeste"; they at that point moved on board, where they found the ship betrayed. The sails, incompletely set, were in a poor condition, some missing by and large, and a significant part of the gear was harmed, with ropes hanging freely over the sides. The primary bring forth spread was secure, yet the fore and lazarette hatches were open, their spreads close to them on the deck. The ship's single raft, a little yawl that had obviously been stowed over the principle bring forth, was missing, while the binnacle lodging the ship's compass had moved from its place, its glass spread broken. There was about of water in the hold, a critical yet not disturbing sum for a ship this size. An improvised sounding bar (a gadget for estimating the measure of water in the hold) was discovered deserted on the deck.
