Due to its extensive number (17) of for the most part short segments, Part II is the most diffuse of the three sections, texturally and agreeably. The account is driven to a great extent by exchanging melodies and remarks from the Narrator, with two brief operatic scenas in which the four soloists take an interest. Kemp finds in one of the melodies a reference to "Sei gegrÃÂ¼sset" from Bach's "St John Passion", and hears hints of Elgar in the soprano's performance "O my child!" which starts the first scena. The story peak is come to with the "Profound of Anger": "Go Down, Moses", which Tippett masterminds as a chorale. This is trailed by three short contemplations from tenor, soprano and alto soloists, before a conceivable recovery is seen in the otherworldly which closes the Part, "O eventually", with a soprano comment which Steinberg portrays as "delighted". Part III comprises of just five numbers, each preferably increasingly broad over the majority of those in the prior areas of the oratorio. The Part has, overall, a more prominent solidarity than its ancestors. The melodic and passionate peak to the entire work is the penultimate outfit: "I Would Know my Shadow and my Light". Kemp expresses: "The entire work has been prompting this minute ... the gathering streams into a cheerful silent beatitude [before] a regulation leads into 'Profound River'". In this last otherworldly, out of the blue the full vocal and instrumental assets are sent. The oratorio closes unobtrusively, on an all-encompassing "pianissimo" "Ruler".
