In London, late eighteenth century anatomists may have designated their grave-looting on the whole to body snatchers, or, as they were regularly known, resurrectionists. A fifteen-in number group of such men, uncovered in Lambeth in 1795, provided "eight specialists of open notoriety, and a man who considers himself an Articulator". The report into their exercises records a cost of two guineas and a crown for a dead body, six shillings for the main foot, and nine pence per inch "for all it gauges more long". These costs were in no way, shape or form fixed; the bootleg market estimation of carcasses shifted significantly. Offering proof to the 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy, the specialist Astley Cooper affirmed that in 1828 the cost for a body was around eight guineas, yet in addition that he had paid anything from two to fourteen guineas beforehand; others guaranteed they had paid up to twenty guineas for every body. Contrasted with the five shillings an East End silk weaver could gain every week, or the single guinea a steward to a well off family unit was paid, these were significant wholes of cash and body grabbing was in this manner an exceptionally productive business. Specialists at the Royal College in Edinburgh griped that resurrectionists were profiteering, especially when nearby deficiencies constrained costs up. One specialist told the Select Committee that he thought the body snatchers were controlling the market for their very own advantage, however no analysis was made of the "Life systems Club", an endeavor by anatomists to control the cost of cadavers for their advantage.
