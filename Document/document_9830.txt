Soon after the merger, Bernhard chose to resign, and moved toward Edward Ferman, the editorial manager of "Imagination and Science Fiction", and Joel Davis, at Davis Publications, among others, about a conceivable clearance of "Stunning". Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, trusted he had closed an arrangement with Bernhard, and started to promote for entries, however the exchanges fizzled. Bernhard additionally moved toward George H. Scithers, who declined, yet place Bernhard in contact with Gary Gygax of TSR. On 27 May 1982 TSR, Inc. procured the trademarks and copyrights of "Astonishing Stories". Scithers was taken on by TSR as proofreader starting with the November 1982 issue. He was supplanted by Patrick Lucien Price in September 1986, and after that by Kim Mohan in May 1991. TSR stopped production of "Astounding" with the Winter 1995 issue, however in 1997, soon after they were gained by Wizards of the Coast, the magazine was relaunched, again with Mohan as manager. This adaptation went on for just ten issues, however it included an exceptional celebratory 600th issue in mid 2000. The sci-fi exchange diary "Locus" remarked in an early survey that dissemination of the magazine appeared to be frail. The title demonstrated unfit to endure: the last issue of this variant was dated Summer 2000. The title was then procured by Paizo Publishing, who propelled another month to month form in September 2004. The February 2005 issue was the last printed; a March 2005 issue was discharged in PDF group, and in March 2006 Paizo reported that it would never again distribute "Stunning". In September 2011, the trademark for "Astounding Stories" was procured by Steve Davidson. Two online issues showed up, in July and August 2012, trailed by another in 2014. Davidson relaunched print production of "Astonishing Stories" with the Fall 2018 issue.
