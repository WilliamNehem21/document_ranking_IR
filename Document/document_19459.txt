"C.Â pepo" is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, domesticated species with the oldest known locations being Oaxaca, Mexico, 8,000â10,000 years ago, and Ocampo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, about 7,000 years ago. It is known to have appeared in Missouri, United States, at least 4,000 years ago. Debates about the origin of "C.Â pepo" have been on-going since at least 1857. There have traditionally been two opposing theories about its origin: 1) that it is a direct descendant of "C.Â texana" and 2) that "C.Â texana" is merely feral "C.Â pepo". A more recent theory by botanist Thomas Andres in 1987 is that descendants of "C.Â fraterna" hybridized with "C.Â texana", resulting in two distinct domestication events in two different areas: one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States, with "C.Â fraterna" and "C.Â texana", respectively, as the ancestral species. "C.Â pepo" may have appeared in the Old World before moving from Mexico into South America. It is found from sea level to slightly above . Leaves have 3â5 lobes and are wide. All the subspecies, varieties, and cultivars are interfertile. In 1986 Paris proposed a revised taxonomy of the edible cultivated "C.Â pepo" based primarily on the shape of the fruit, with eight groups . All but a few "C.Â pepo" cultivars can be included in these groups. There is one non-edible cultivated variety: "C. pepo" var. "ovifera".
