In October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael Fortier and his wife, Lori, a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, mixed with about of liquid nitromethane and of Tovex. Including the weight of the sixteen 55-U.S.-gallon drums in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about . McVeigh had originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel, but it proved to be too expensive. During the Chief Auto Parts Nationals National Hot Rod Association Drag Racing Championship Series event at the Texas Motorplex, McVeigh posed as a motorcycle racer and initially attempted to purchase drums of nitromethane on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing, despite the lack of nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and not having an NHRA competitors' license. Denied by one representative, Steve LeSeuer, due to LeSeur's suspicions of McVeigh's actions and attitudes, he was then permitted to purchase three barrels from another representative, Tim Chambers. Chambers questioned the purchase of three barrels when typically only 1-5 gallons of nitromethane, he noted, would be purchased by a Top Fuel Harley rider, even though the class was not raced that weekend. LeSeuer reported the incident to the FBI immediately after rejecting McVeigh's request.
