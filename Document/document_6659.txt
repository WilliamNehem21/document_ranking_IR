While looking at old and medieval maritime tasks, it is important to initially comprehend the mechanical confinements of cookroom armadas. Galleys did not deal with well in harsh waters and could be overwhelmed by waves, which would be disastrous in the untamed ocean; history is packed with occasions where cookroom armadas were sunk by awful climate (for example the Roman misfortunes amid the First Punic War). The cruising season was in this manner normally limited from mid-spring to September. The viable cruising velocity of a kitchen, notwithstanding when utilizing sails, was constrained, just like the measure of provisions it could convey. Water specifically, being basically a kitchen's "fuel" supply, was of basic significance. With utilization levels evaluated at 8 liters per day for each rower, its accessibility was an unequivocal operational factor in the frequently water-rare and sun-heated banks of the Eastern Mediterranean. Littler dromons are assessed to have had the capacity to convey around 4 days of water. Successfully, this implied armadas made out of galleys were restricted to seaside courses, and needed to make visit landfall to recharge their provisions and rest their groups. This is very much bore witness to in Byzantine abroad undertakings, from Belisarius' battle against the Vandals to the Cretan endeavors of the ninth and tenth hundreds of years. It is thus that Nikephoros Ouranos accentuates the need accessible "men with exact learning and experience of the ocean [...], which winds cause it to swell and which blow from the land. They should know both the shrouded shakes in the ocean, and the spots which have no profundity, and the land along which one sails and the islands nearby it, the harbors and the separation such harbors are the one from the other. They should know both the nations and the water supplies."
