The savant John Bale during the 1550s recorded six works of Foliot known to him, five of which were letters. The 6th work known to Bale was the discourse on the "Melody of Songs", which made due in a solitary original copy, presently in the Bodleian Library. Youthful likewise recorded a "Lundinensis Ecclesiae" as being by Foliot. The researcher John Pits gave much a similar rundown in 1619, including one work, a "Vitas aliquot sanctorum Angliae, Librum unun", yet this work never shows up in a medieval book list and has not made due under this name so it is vague if Foliot composed such a work. The classicist Thomas Tanner, writing in the mid eighteenth century, recorded Foliot as the writer of the seven works given by Bale and Pits, including an eighth, the "Tractatus Gilberti, episcopi London: Super Istud "Sunt diuae olivae"", refering to John Leland, the sixteenth century collector, as his source. This obviously is the accumulation of nine messages on Saints Peter and Paul that presently can't seem to be distributed is still in original copy at the Bodleian Library. Leland additionally recorded another work by Foliot, the "Omeliae Gileberti, episcopi Herefordensis", which he expressed was held at Forde Abbey. This work, since lost, may have been the messages referenced above, or could have been a known gathering of lectures, additionally lost. It is likewise conceivable that another Gilbert was the creator. In conclusion, Walter Map recorded that Foliot had started chip away at a "the Old and the New Law" right away before his passing.
