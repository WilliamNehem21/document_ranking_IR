The detainees were taken to the Gudovac civil structure and held there for a period. They were informed that they would be taken to Bjelovar for cross examination. Rather, they were requested to walk the other way, towards a field close to the waterway Plavnica where an outside market was held every week. The detainees left Gudovac just before nightfall, managed by upwards of 70 furnished watchmen. A significant number of the detainees detected the destiny that anticipated them however were unfit to get away. As indicated by one post-war declaration, ÃÂikoÃÂ¡ was "agitated, uneasyÃÂ ... what's more, in no state of mind to talk". As the detainees were being walked out of Gudovac, he pulled one of his Serb neighbors from the gathering and instructed him to "get lost" before requesting the staying 200 prisoners to arrange against a divider. Kvaternik showed up before the gathering and inquired as to whether it contained any Croats. Four ventured forward and offered their recognizable proof papers; three were allowed to come back to their homes after having their personalities checked yet the fourth was sent back among the Serbs since he was a socialist. Kvaternik, ÃÂikoÃÂ¡ and a few recently named UstaÃÂ¡e officers directed the walk. As indicated by survivors, the gatekeepers rushed abuse at the detainees, and constrained them to sing UstaÃÂ¡e tunes and serenade "Long live PaveliÃÂ! Long live Kvaternik!"
