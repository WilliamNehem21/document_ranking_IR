The pelvic bones are well-preserved, with the right side better articulated than the left. The fused sacral vertebrae are still attached to the pelvis, which lacks the distal ends of both of its and (lower and rearmost hip bones). The (main hip bone) is long. The (front expansion) of the ilium was curved on the bottom and was somewhat shorter and deeper than the (rear expansion). The preacetabular ala were somewhat enlarged at the front, in contrast to the more slender condition of the postacetabular ala. The (groove at the bottom of the postacetabular ala) was concave, as was the rear margin of the ischium. The pubis bore a relatively large and almost closed , an indentation in the lower margin of the rear part of the bone that allowed for the passage of the obturator nerve. The upwards projecting neural spines of the sacrum were elongated, as is typical in spinosaurs. In life, these would have been covered in skin, forming a "sail" down the animal's back. MN 4819-V is distinguished from "Suchomimus" due to its longer and shallower ilium with a less curved upper margin, and from "Baryonyx" by having a more developed , a blade-like structure on the bottom of the ischium.
