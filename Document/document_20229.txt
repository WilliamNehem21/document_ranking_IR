She served in this role to replace the battleships and , which had been sold to the Ottoman Empire just before the start of the maneuvers. On 14 October, she joined up with the battleship and steamed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to Kiel for her yearly overhaul at the Imperial Dockyard there. These repairs lasted until 4 January 1911. "Schwaben" served in the III Battle Squadron during the autumn maneuvers again in 1911. By 1911, the eight and es of dreadnought battleships had entered service; these ships were assigned to the I Battle Squadron, which displaced the newer pre-dreadnoughts of the and es to the II and III Battle Squadrons. As a result, "Schwaben" was decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 30 December 1911 and assigned to the Reserve Division in the North Sea. She was placed back in service briefly from 9 to 12 May 1912 to move to Kiel. "Schwaben" returned to service again to participate in the autumn maneuvers from 14 August to 28 September, as the flagship of then-"KAdm" Maximilian von Spee.
