Pleydell was a Protestant, and he is portrayed by P. W. Hasler as "a religious and political radical" under Queen Mary, and casted a ballot against an administration bill in 1555 while he was a Member for Marlborough. This, joined with his past offenses, may have been the explanation behind his internment at the famous Fleet Prison at the disintegration of Parliament that year. An intense supporter of Sir Anthony Kingston in the House of Commons, Pleydell came to be related with Sir Henry Dudley's plot to oust Mary and guarantee the progression of things to come Queen Elizabeth to the position of authority (a thwarted endeavor which prompted Kingston's unexplained demise and Dudley's intentional outcast to France); the Star Chamber blamed Gabriel for affecting mobs contradicting Mary's rule. He was along these lines "viewed as an instigator" of the scheme and asserted parliamentary benefit when the Star Chamber discovered him blameworthy amid the Michaelmas expression of the 1555 session. The charges were upheld by a ÃÂ£500 bond and a writ requested by the court, conceivably a crown activity to threaten future resistance in Parliament. The Commons acknowledged his case that his benefit had been encroached and sent an assignment driven by Sir Robert Rochester on 6 December to the House of Lords in help of his insusceptibility.
