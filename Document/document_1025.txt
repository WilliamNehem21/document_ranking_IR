In 2000 Matra Marconi Space, a joint BAE Systems/Matra organization, was converged with the space division of DASA to shape Astrium. On 16 June 2003 BAE sold its 25% offer to EADS for ÃÂ£84ÃÂ million, anyway because of the lossmaking status of the organization, BAE Systems contributed an equivalent sum for "rebuilding". In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was changed from an inalienably wasteful consortium structure to a formal business entity. BAE Systems sold its 54% dominant part offer of BAE Systems Canada, a hardware organization, in April for CA$310 (approx. ÃÂ£197ÃÂ million as of December 2010). In November 2001, the organization declared the conclusion of the Avro Regional Jet (Avro RJ) generation line at Woodford and the wiping out of the Avro RJX, a propelled arrangement of the air ship family, as the business seemed to be "never again reasonable". The last Avro RJ to be finished turned into the last British common carrier. In November 2001 BAE sold its 49.9% offer of Thomson Marconi Sonar to Thales for ÃÂ£85ÃÂ million. A further advance of European protection union was the merger of a lot of Matra BAe Dynamics and the rocket division of Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) into MBDA in December. MBDA hence turned into the world's second biggest rocket maker. In spite of the fact that EADS (presently Airbus SE) was later answered to be keen on securing full control of MBDA, BAE said that, in contrast to Airbus, MBDA is a "center business".
