In 1972, Love's mom separated Rodriguez, remarried, and moved the family to Nelson, New Zealand. There, she selected Love at Nelson College for Girls, from which she was before long ousted. In 1973, she was sent back to live in the United States, where she was brought up in Portland, Oregon by her previous stepfather and other family companions. Amid this time, her mom brought forth two of Love's other relatives. At age fourteen, she was captured for shoplifting a T-shirt from a Woolworth's, and was sent to Hillcrest Correctional Facility, an adolescent corridor in Salem, Oregon. She was hence set in child care until she turned out to be legitimately liberated at age 16. She upheld herself by working illicitly as a topless artist at Mary's Club in downtown Portland receiving the last name "Love" to hide her personality; she later embraced "Love" as her surname. She additionally worked different random temp jobs, including picking berries at a ranch in Troutdale, Oregon, and as a circle racer at a gay disco. Amid this time, she enlisted at Portland State University, concentrating English and theory. Love has said that she "didn't have a ton of social abilities," and that she learned them while frequenting gay clubs and investing energy with drag rulers.
