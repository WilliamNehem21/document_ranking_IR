"Oxalaia" comes from the AlcÃÂ¢ntara Formation, a progression of sedimentary rocks that is a piece of the Itapecuru Group of the SÃÂ£o LuÃÂ­s-GrajaÃÂº Basin, in northeastern Brazil. These stones have been dated by researchers to the Cenomanian phase of the Late Cretaceous Period, 100.5 to 93.9 million years back. Outcropping at the northern bank of the arrangement, the Laje do Coringa region is made up generally of sandstones and mudstones, alongside aggregate shake layers containing fossil plant and vertebrate parts. These dregs were stored under marine and fluvial conditions like those of the Bahariya Formation in Egypt, where "Spinosaurus" remains have been found. In 1999, fossils of "Oxalaia" were recouped from the Laje do Coringa. Scientist Elaine Machado, of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, was astounded to discover such a very much safeguarded fossil at the site and expressed in a public statement that "this is the manner by which most logical disclosures occur, it was coincidentally". The finding was an uncommon event because of the erosive idea of the tides at the store, which are in charge of the divided condition of most fossils in the bone bed; remains not found nearby are regularly expelled from the development by wave activity. For the most part, most of fossil stays found at the AlcÃÂ¢ntara Formation comprise of teeth and secluded skeletal components, of which the Laje do Coringa site has yielded hundreds.
