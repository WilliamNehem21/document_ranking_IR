The congregation was cruciform fit as a fiddle, with vaulting and a square asylum and a low focal pinnacle containing ringers. It was aisled all through, with a couple of houses of prayer on the east side of every transept. There was no triforium, yet a thin display surmounted by a clerestory of triple lancet windows kept running over each sound of the arcade, as can be found in the enduring area in the south transept. The vaulting sprang straightforwardly from the highest point of the arcade. The divider at the eastern end of the asylum, most likely worked after 1260, had an expansive window which includes an upper rose and expand tracery; the passageway windows were basic matched lancets recessed inside a curve. In the nave, the south passageway had plain triple lancets set high in the divider to stay away from the house rooftop. The north passageway windows by differentiation had lavishly enriched cusped tracery, mirroring the adjustments in taste over the significant lot of development, and proposing this was among the last pieces of the congregation to be done, likely in the exceptionally late thirteenth or mid fourteenth hundreds of years. The west mass of the congregation additionally has an extensive window, the tracery of which was obliterated in a breakdown amid the eighteenth century. Enduring sections demonstrate that it was worked in a "more liberated and further developed style" than different pieces of the congregation, and recommend a date around the turn of the fourteenth century.
