Curiously for a rainforest-abiding fledgling, the white-necked rockfowl manufactures a home out of mud with changing measures of plant strands blended in. Mud is gathered from adjacent waterways and streams and is formed into a solid, thick-walled, and profound container connected to the cavern divider or rooftop, a precipice, or a vast stone roughly over the ground. These stones must be inclined inwards to furnish the home with insurance from the downpour. Phloem filaments and roots from plants line within the glass. The white-necked rockfowl's settling caverns regularly are populated by wasps, and the wasp settles long are frequently discovered inserted in the rockfowl's homes. It is trusted that so as to manufacture their home on the smooth cavern dividers, rockfowl utilize the homes of the wasps as a core to work around. Bluff homes are constantly worked at a separation from adjacent plants. The two winged creatures chip away at the development of the home, with jobs exchanging as one flying creature gathers the materials while different shapes them into the home. The mud is some of the time gulped and spewed before use. While almost all rockfowl homes are found in caverns or on bluffs, there are records of settling happening on a riverbank and on a fallen tree trunk. Homes are commonly developed at any rate separated, however one settlement had six homes abutting one another. Homes additionally differ generally in size, however they normal to be long, wide, and profound. It used to be trusted that each pair fabricates two homes, one for reproducing and one for perching; be that as it may, ongoing studies have discovered no proof of this, with all homes in the state being utilized for rearing.
