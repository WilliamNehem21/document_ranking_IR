The i3 of "Dermotherium delusion" is a lengthen tooth bearing six tines (limited, high "fingers" as in a brush) masterminded from front to back. The frontmost is bigger, the following four are about equivalent in size, and the 6th is littler. The quantity of tines looks like that found in the Sunda colugo, which has four to seven; the Philippine colugo has three to five. The c1 is likewise an extend, limited tooth; at the front, it is somewhat bended towards the midline of the jaw. On the buccal (external) side of this tooth are six cusps, of which the third (checking from the front) is the biggest. The p3 is likewise lengthen and adjusted at the front, however it is more extensive at the back, framing a talonid (a "heel" of cusps at the back of a tribosphenic tooth). There are six cusps on the restricted foremost piece of the tooth, and the fifth (recognized as the protoconid) is by a long shot the biggest. On the buccal side of the talonid is a solid cusp, the hypoconid, with a peak, the cristid obliqua, plunging from it towards the front. A second, littler cusp, the hypoconulid, is available on the lingual side of the talonid, associated with the hypoconid by a postcristid. The pectinate (brush like) state of the front teeth is a mutual normal for the colugos and exceedingly surprising among well evolved creatures. "Dermotherium fabrication" looks like the Sunda colugo in that the c1 and p3 are likewise pectinate; in the Philippine colugo, these teeth are not pectinate.
