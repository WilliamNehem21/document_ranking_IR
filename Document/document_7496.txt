The encompassing scene is populated by cottage molded structures, some of which are produced using stone, while others are in any event halfway natural. Behind Eve rabbits, symbolizing fertility, play in the grass, and a monster tree inverse is thought to speak to interminable life. The foundation uncovers a few creatures that would have been colorful to contemporaneous Europeans, including a giraffe, an elephant, and a lion that has executed and is going to eat up his prey. In the frontal area, from an expansive gap in the ground, develop feathered creatures and winged creatures, some of which are practical, some phenomenal. Behind a fish, an individual dressed in a short-sleeved hooded coat and with a duck's nose holds an open book as though perusing. To one side of the region a feline holds a little reptile like animal in its jaws. Belting sees that, regardless of the way that the animals in the closer view are fantastical imaginings, a large number of the creatures in the mid and foundation are drawn from contemporary travel writing, and here Bosch is speaking to "the information of a humanistic and refined readership". Erhard Reuwich's photos for Bernhard von Breydenbach's 1486 "Journeys to the Holy Land" were for some time thought to be the hotspot for both the elephant and the giraffe, however later research shows the mid-fifteenth century humanist researcher Cyriac of Ancona's travelogs filled in as Bosch's introduction to these extraordinary creatures.
