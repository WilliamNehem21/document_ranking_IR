Creation originator Allan Cameron found a lethargic well of lava close Erfoud where the whole set for Hamunaptra could be built. Sommers preferred the area in light of the fact that, "A city covered up in the cavity of a wiped out spring of gushing lava seemed well and good. Out amidst the desert you could never observe it. You could never consider entering the hole except if you comprehended what was inside that fountain of liquid magma." A study of the spring of gushing lava was directed with the goal that a precise model and scale models of the segments and statues could be duplicated back at Shepperton Studios, where the majority of the scenes including the underground ways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took four months to construct, and included fiberglass segments fixed with embellishments for the film's last scenes. Another vast set was built in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which multiplied for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was long and included "a steam train, an Ajax footing motor, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four pony drawn trucks, five dressing steeds and grooms, nine pack jackasses and donkeys, just as market slows down, Arab-clad sellers and space for 300 costumed additional items".
