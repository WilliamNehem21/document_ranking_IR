The "Domesday Survey" of 1086 does not legitimately specify Ashton, maybe on the grounds that just a halfway study of the zone had been taken. Be that as it may, it is believed that St Michael's Church, referenced in the Domesday passage for the old area of Manchester, was in Ashton (additionally spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first referenced in the 12thÃÂ century when the house was a piece of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12thÃÂ century, a family who embraced the name Assheton held the house for the benefit of the Gresleys, aristocrats of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a villa, the authoritative focal point of the estate, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the lobby was "one of the best incredible houses in the North West" of the 14thÃÂ century. It has been perceived as critical for being one of only a handful couple of incredible houses in south-east Lancashire and perhaps one of only a handful couple of corridors impacted by French plan in the nation. The town was conceded a Royal Charter in 1414, which enabled it to hold a reasonable two times per year, and a market on each Monday, making the settlement a market town.
