Meanwhile "BlÃÂ¼cher" had been intensely harmed by flame from the various battlecruisers; her speed had dropped to and her guiding apparatus had been stuck. Beatty requested "Unstoppable" to assault her at 10:48ÃÂ a.m. After six minutes Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and requested a prompt 90ÃÂ° swing to port to maintain a strategic distance from the submarine, in spite of the fact that he neglected to raise the "Submarine Warning" banner on the grounds that the vast majority of "Lion"s flag halyards had been shot away. In a matter of seconds a while later "Lion" lost her residual dynamo to the rising water which thumped out all staying light and power. He requested "Course north-east" at 11:02 to take his boats back to their quest for Hipper. He likewise raised "Assault the back of the foe" on the other halyard in spite of the fact that there was no association between the two signs. Back Admiral Sir Gordon Moore, briefly directing in , felt that the signs implied for him to assault "BlÃÂ¼cher", which was going toward the north-east, which he did, getting some distance from Hipper's fundamental body. Beatty attempted to address the oversight, yet he was so a long ways behind the main battlecruisers that his signs couldn't be perused in the midst of the smoke and cloudiness.
