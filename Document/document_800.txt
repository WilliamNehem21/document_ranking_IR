Upon Carroll's arrival to Maryland, Hart was exasperated both at the risk to his very own capacity and the possibility of a Catholic officeholder in the province. Hart requested that Carroll make the vow of faithfulness, which he was happy to do, and the vow of forswearing affirming the Protestant progression to the English royal position, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll started to act in the limit approved by the owner's bonus, and Hart swung to the upper place of the pioneer council for alleviation. Dismissing Carroll's contentions in help of his entitlement to hold government workplaces, the get together opposed his endeavors to practice the commission and, close to the finish of 1716, passed a progression of laws affirming and limiting the pledge prerequisites for officeholders, which were hostile to Catholic by goal. Carroll's case may have been undermined when he went to the safeguard of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had endeavored to take the British position of authority amid a disobedience in 1715 and was very disliked with Protestants in the state. The owner, whose position had been so as of late reestablished and who did not have any desire to hazard the loss of the settlement, affirmed the choice of the get together. Carroll's bonus was formally denied on 20 February 1717. As per a later record Hart provided for the get together, Carroll started a battle to undermine the Governor. There is no proof that Hart was precise, yet the get together passed stricter enemy of Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic guys of the privilege to cast a ballot.
