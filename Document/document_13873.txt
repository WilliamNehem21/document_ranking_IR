Warner gained from twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was seriously harmed. Later toward the evening, while Ponsford and Richardson were all the while batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian changing area with the goal of enquiring about Woodfull's wellbeing. Records shift about what pursued. As indicated by the first paper reports and Fingleton's later portrayal, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, anticipating treatment from a specialist, despite the fact that this may have been a misrepresentation for sensational impact. Leo O'Brien portrayed Woodfull as wearing a towel around his abdomen, having showered. Warner communicated compassion to Woodfull yet was astounded by the Australian's reaction. As indicated by Warner, Woodfull answered, "I would prefer not to see you, Mr Warner. There are two groups out there. One is attempting to play cricket and the other isn't." Fingleton composed that Woodfull had included, "This amusement is too great to possibly be spoilt. It is time a few people received in return." Woodfull was typically stately and discreetly spoken, making his response amazing to Warner and others present. Warner stated, "Aside from all that, we most earnestly trust you are not very seriously harmed," to which Woodfull answered, "The wound is turning out." Embarrassed and mortified, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noticed that Woodfull talked unobtrusively and tranquilly, which expanded the adequacy of his words. He likewise brought up that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship, so an allegation of "not playing cricket" would have stung the Englishman. Warner was shaken to the point that he was found in tears soon thereafter in his lodging.
