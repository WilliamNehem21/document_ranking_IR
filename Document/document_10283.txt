A meadow on the south edge of the edge (the "pony's neck") prompting Hill 53 was the support of the Japanese safeguards. The meadow contained a few automatic weapon and mortar positions which had successfully held off the American assaults over the edge. The second Battalion's official officerÃ¢ÂÂCaptain Charles W. DavisÃ¢ÂÂvolunteered to lead four other men against the meadow. Slithering on their paunches, Davis and his gathering crawled to inside of the adversary position. The Japanese safeguards tossed two projectiles at them, however the explosives neglected to detonate. Davis and his men tossed eight explosives at the Japanese, decimating a few of their positions. Davis at that point stood up, and keeping in mind that shooting his rifle, at that point gun with one hand, waved his men forward with the different as he progressed further onto the glade. Davis and his men at that point murdered or pursued away the remainder of the Japanese on the meadow. Outlined against the sky amid the activity, Davis was noticeable to the Americans all here and there the edge. Enlivened by his activities, in addition to recharged with water by an abrupt rainstorm, the American troops "woke up" and immediately ambushed and caught Hill 53 by early afternoon. The Americans tallied the groups of 170 Japanese warriors close by the Galloping Horse. The Americans endured less than 100 murdered.
