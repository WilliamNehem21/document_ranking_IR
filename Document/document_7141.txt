In the late thirteen and mid fourteenth hundreds of years the Crown of Castile battled with the Marinids of Morocco and the Nasrids of Granada for control of the Strait of Gibraltar. This contention () is a noteworthy section in the historical backdrop of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Albeit no narrative record of Gibraltar is accessible for the period following the production of Madinat al-Fath, there are motivations to trust that a little braced town existed in Gibraltar, and that its reality was the immediate outcome of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the catch of the city, it was normal that the Castilian lord Sancho IV would lay attack to Algeciras (however in the occasion, he didn't do as such) to upset the Marinids' correspondences with the Iberian promontory. The compromising nearness of a Christian fortification toward the west would have made it important to set up an army toward the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would ensure the rearguard of Algeciras and gave a fallback position if the town fell. In the meantime, the statures of the Rock of Gibraltar gave a fantastic vantage point to checking the exercises of the Christian armadas in the Straits.
