Marla F. Prather observed that "Whaam!"'s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its position as a historic work of pop art. With "As I Opened Fire", Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, "Whaam!" is regarded as the culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with "Drowning Girl", as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's Marilyn Monroe prints, as one of the most famous works of pop art. Gianni Versace once linked the two iconic pop art images via his gown designs. According to Douglas Coupland, the "World Book Encyclopedia" used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and "Whaam!" to illustrate its Pop art entry.
Comic books were in turn affected by the cultural impact of pop art. By the mid-1960s, some comic books were displaying a new emphasis on garish colors, emphatic sound effects and stilted dialogueâthe elements of comic book style that had come to be regarded as campâin an attempt to appeal to older, college-age readers who appreciated pop art. Gravett observed that the "simplicity and outdatedness [of comic books] were ripe for being mocked".
