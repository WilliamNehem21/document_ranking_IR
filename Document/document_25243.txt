In March 2013, executive producer Adi Shankar said that a sequel was unlikely. In May 2013, Urban said that a sequel was still possible, noting that the film had found an audience, and the response of fans could resurrect the project. "Dredd" fans on Facebook launched a petition calling for a sequel. In July 2013, "2000 AD" endorsed the fan petition, supporting the campaign by printing advertisements in their publications, and by September 2013 it had attracted over 80,000 signatures. In April 2013, "2000 AD" released an image teasing a continuation of the film in comic book form with a release date scheduled for September 2013. The comic, titled "Dredd: Underbelly", was made available in "Judge Dredd Megazine" #340 which was released on 18 September 2013. In October 2014, Shankar announced the production of an unofficial spinoff online series based on the Dark Judges that would be released later that month. The animated miniseries was titled "Judge Dredd: Superfiend" and all its six episodes were released on 27 October 2014 on YouTube. In March 2015, Garland said that a direct sequel would likely not happen in the near future, at least not with the crew involved in the original film.
