In spite of the fact that Browne had been unfit to make "Awesome" fruitful by having some expertise in dream, he was as yet intrigued by the dream type, and tested in the December 1955 issue with the topic of wish satisfaction. He dropped the words "Sci-fi" from the spread, and distributed five stories, all of which managed male dreams in some structure. The spread demonstrated a man strolling through a divider to discover a lady stripping; the craftsmanship was by Ed Valigursky and outlined Paul Fairman's "All Walls Were Mist". Peruser response, as indicated by Browne, was as a rule good, and he kept on distributing infrequent stories on the desire satisfaction subject. The analysis was rehashed with the October 1956 issue, which again kept running without "Sci-fi" on the spread, and contained stories on the subject of "Amazing Powers". By and by the spread outlined a male dream: this time it demonstrated a man appearing in a shower house where ladies were showering. Browne had left Ziff Davis when this issue showed up, yet Browne's arrangements for a magazine around these topics were very much progressed, and Fairman, who at this point was altering both "Incredible" and "Stunning", was given "Dream World" to alter too. It kept running for three quarterly issues, beginning in February 1957, however demonstrated too tight a market to succeed.
