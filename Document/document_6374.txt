The oeuvre includes instrumental, vocal, symphonic and choral music. Holst was principally affected, as Gustav Holst's girl, by what the investigator Christopher Tinker terms "her regular and certain association with the English melodic foundation", by her nearby close to home association with her dad, and her adoration for folksong. A portion of her first arrangements mirror the pastoralism of Ralph Vaughan Williams, who showed her at the RCM. In her educating and EFDSS years amid the 1930s she wound up known for her folksong courses of action yet formed little music herself. The individual style that rose during the 1940s joined her liking with folksong and move, her extraordinary enthusiasm for English music of the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of years, and her desire for advancement. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had started exploring different avenues regarding scale designs; by the 1940s she was consolidating her very own six-and eight-note scales into her orchestral arrangements and once in a while into choral works, for example, the "Five Songs" (1944). This experimentation returns in later works; in "Hallo My Fancy" (1972) another scale is presented for each refrain, while the choir gives free harmonization to a performance voice. In "Respect to William Morris" (1984), among her last works, Tinker takes note of her utilization of disharmony "to add solidarity to the melodic enunciation of the content". Paradoxically, the String Quintet of 1982, the work which Holst herself thought made her "a genuine writer", is portrayed by the glow of its harmonies.
