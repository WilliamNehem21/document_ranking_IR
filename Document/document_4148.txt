Craftsmanship student of history Cornelius Vermeule esteemed the front of the half dollar "a midpoint between the plans on French silver pieces right off the bat in the new century and A. A. Weinman's 'Strolling Liberty' for the half dollar". The fifty-penny piece bears the witticism "In God We Trust", as do the $50 pieces, the main memorial coins to show it. That witticism was first utilized on U.S. coins in 1864. In the nineteenth century, it was not required that the proverb be utilized, however it in any case showed up on most divisions of U.S. coins by the turn of the twentieth century. In 1907 and 1908, there had been numerous complaints to the proverb's oversight on the gold ten dollar and twenty dollar pieces structured by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Because of the open objection, Congress in 1908 passed enactment requiring its quality on any flowing coin which had already borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. The wording on the PanamaÃ¢ÂÂ Pacific pieces was left to the tact of the Secretary of the Treasury, yet authorities may have recalled the fracas. Swiatek and Breen proposed that those engaged with making or favoring the structure may have moved to take off contention.
