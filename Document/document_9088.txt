It is typical for individual rivalries to indicate that all outfield players in a group must wear similar hues, however the Law states just "The two groups must wear hues that separate them from one another and furthermore the official and the associate refs". In case of a match between groups who might regularly wear indistinguishable or comparable hues the away group must change to an alternate shading. In light of this prerequisite a group's second-decision is frequently alluded to as its "away pack" or "away hues", in spite of the fact that it isn't obscure, particularly at global dimension, for groups to select to wear their away hues notwithstanding when not required to by a conflict of hues, or to wear them at home. The England national group once in a while plays in red shirts notwithstanding when it isn't required, as this was the strip worn when the group won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. At times the two groups have been compelled to erode their second decision packs, for example, the match among Netherlands and Brazil in the 1974 FIFA World Cup where they sported white and dim blue as opposed to their first decision of orange and yellow, separately; and the match among Netherlands and Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup where they wore dim blue and white as opposed to their home shades of orange and red, individually.
