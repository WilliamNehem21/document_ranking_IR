The fight was a conclusive occasion ever of Greece; nearly the whole Frankish world class of Athens and its vassal states lay dead on the field, and when the Catalans moved onto the terrains of the Duchy, there was inadequate opposition. The Greek occupants of Livadeia quickly surrendered their firmly sustained town, for which they were compensated with the privileges of Frankish residents. Thebes, the capital of the Duchy, was deserted by numerous individuals of its occupants, who fled to the Venetian fortress of Negroponte, and was pillaged by the Catalan troops. At last, Athens was surrendered to the victors by Walter's widow, Joanna of ChÃÂ¢tillon. All of Attica and Boeotia passed gently under the control of the Catalans, and just the lordship of Argos and Nauplia in the Peloponnese stayed in the hands of Brienne followers. The Catalans separated the region of the Duchy among themselves. The annihilation of the past medieval gentry enabled the Catalans to take ownership moderately effectively, much of the time wedding the widows and moms of the very men they had killed in Halmyros. The Catalans' Turkish partners, be that as it may, denied the idea to settle in the Duchy. The Turks of Halil took a lot of the goods and set out toward Asia Minor, just to be assaulted and nearly demolished by a joint Byzantine and Genoese power as they attempted to cross the Dardanelles a couple of months after the fact. The Turks of Malik entered the administration of the Serbian lord Stefan Milutin, however were slaughtered in the wake of defying him.
