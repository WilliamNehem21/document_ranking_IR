"Lady of Frankenstein" was exposed to oversight, both amid generation by the Hays office and following its discharge by nearby and national restriction sheets. Joseph Breen, lead blue pencil for the Hays office, questioned lines of discourse in the initially submitted content in which Henry Frankenstein and his work were contrasted with that of God. He kept on questioning such exchange in amended contents, and to an arranged shot of the Monster racing through a cemetery to a figure of an executed Jesus and endeavoring to "salvage" the figure from the cross. Breen likewise protested the quantity of homicides, both seen and suggested by the content and unequivocally exhorted Whale to diminish the number. The blue pencil's office, after exploring the film in March 1935, required various cuts. Whale consented to erase a grouping in which Dwight Frye's "Nephew Glutz" executes his uncle and accuses the Monster, and shots of Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley in which Breen felt a lot of her bosoms were unmistakable. Inquisitively, regardless of his prior complaint, Breen offered no protest to the cruciform symbolism all through the filmÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ incorporating a scene with the Monster lashed Christ-like to a poleÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ nor to the introduction of Pretorius as a coded gay. "Lady of the hour of Frankenstein" was affirmed by the Production Code office on April 15, 1935.
