"L'Arianna" was composed as a festive piece for the wedding of the heir to the duchy, Francesco Gonzaga, to Margherita of Savoy, in May 1608. Monteverdi received the commission following "L'Orfeo"s successful premiere at the court in February 1607. The libretto for "L'Arianna" was by Rinuccini, whose literary skills had earlier impressed Duke Vincenzo I of Mantua after a performance of "Euridice". The composition of "L'Arianna" became a fraught affair for Monteverdi, being only one of three works that the duke required from him for the weddingâhe had also to compose a musical prologue for Giovanni Battista Guarini's play "L'idropica", and write the music for a dramatic dance, "Il ballo delle ingrate". His life had been disrupted by the fatal illness of his wife Claudia; she died on 10 September 1607, but Monteverdi was given no respite by the duke. "L'Arianna" was largely composed in the last two months of 1607, an exertion that Monteverdi's biographer Hans Redlich describes as "superhuman". Monteverdi felt slighted by the lack of acknowledgement from the duke for his efforts; nearly 20 years later, in a letter to the Mantua court secretary Alessandro Striggio the Younger, he wrote that he had almost killed himself when writing "L'Arianna" in such a hurry.
