Simon Gikandi contended that Kenyatta, similar to a portion of his peers in the Pan-African development, was an "Afro-Victorian", somebody whose personality had been molded "by the way of life of expansionism and frontier foundations", particularly those of the Victorian time. Amid the 1930s, Kenyatta developed the picture of a "pilgrim man of his word"; in England, he showed "wonderful habits" and an adaptable disposition in adjusting to urban circumstances not at all like the grounds he had experienced childhood in. A. R. Barlow, an individual from the Church of Scotland Mission at Kikuyu, met with Kenyatta in Britain, later relating that he was inspired by how Kenyatta could "blend on equivalent terms with Europeans and to hold his end up disregarding his impediment, instructively and socially." The South African Peter Abrahams met Kenyatta in London, taking note of that of all the dark men engaged with the city's Pan-Africanist development, he was "the most loose, advanced and 'westernized' of the part of us". As President, Kenyatta frequently thought back nostalgically about his time in England, alluding to it as "home" on a few events. Berman and Lonsdale portrayed his life as being engrossed with "a scan for the compromise of the Western advancement he grasped and a similarly esteemed Kikuyuness he couldn't dispose of". Gikandi contended that Kenyatta's "relationship with Englishness was substantially more significant than the two his companions and foes have been happy to concede".
