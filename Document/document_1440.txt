The Rashtrakuta lords bolstered the famous religions of the day in the customary soul of religious resistance. Researchers have offered different contentions in regards to which explicit religion the Rashtrakutas favored, putting together their proof with respect to engravings, coins and contemporary writing. Some case the Rashtrakutas were slanted towards Jainism since huge numbers of the researchers who thrived in their courts and wrote in Sanskrit, Kannada and a couple in Apabhramsha and Prakrit were Jains. The Rashtrakutas fabricated surely understood Jain sanctuaries at areas, for example, Lokapura in Bagalkot region and their steadfast feudatory, the Western Ganga Dynasty, assembled Jain landmarks at Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. Researchers have proposed that Jainism was an essential religion at the very heart of the realm, present day Karnataka, representing over 30% of the populace and ruling the way of life of the district. Lord Amoghavarsha I was a devotee of the Jain acharya Jinasena and wrote in his religious composition, "Prashnottara Ratnamalika", "having bowed to Varaddhamana (Mahavira), I compose Prashnottara Ratnamalika". The mathematician Mahaviracharya wrote in his "Ganita Sarasangraha", "The subjects under Amoghavarsha are glad and the land yields a lot of grain. May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha, adherent of Jainism ever increment far and wide." Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainism in his maturity.
