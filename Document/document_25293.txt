Lat's career took a turn for the better on 10 February 1974; "Asia Magazine", a periodical based in Hong Kong, published his cartoons about "Bersunat"âa circumcision ceremony all Malaysian boys of the Islamic faith have to undergo. The cartoons impressed Tan Sri Lee Siew Yee, editor-in-chief of the "New Straits Times". Lee found Lat's portrayal of the important ceremony humorous yet sensitive, and grumbled that the newspaper should have hired the artist. He was surprised to be told that Lat was already working within his organisation. Lat was called to Lee's office to have a talk, which raised the reporter's profile in the company. He became the paper's column cartoonist, taking up a position created for him by Samad, now deputy editor of the "New Straits Times". His first duty was to document Malaysian culture in a series of cartoons titled "Scenes of Malaysian Life". The newspaper also sent him to study for fourÂ months at St Martin's School of Art in London, where he was introduced to English editorial cartoons and newspapers. Returning to Malaysia full of fascination with his experience, Lat transformed "Scenes of Malaysian Life" into a series of editorial cartoons. His approach proved popular, and at the end of 1975 he was appointed full-time cartoonist with total freedom in his work.
