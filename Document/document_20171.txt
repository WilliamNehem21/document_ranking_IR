Stationed on the border with France, BÃ¤r achieved his first victoryâa Curtiss P-36 Hawkâon 25 September 1939 during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the "ArmÃ©e de l'Air" (French air force). This earned him the Iron Cross 2nd Class () on 29 September 1939 which was presented to him by Hugo Sperrle. During the Battle of France, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the Battle of Britain and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class () on 6 July 1940. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. BÃ¤r was summoned to appear before Hermann GÃ¶ring and report on this battle. When GÃ¶ring asked him what he was thinking about while in the water, BÃ¤r immediately replied, "Your speech, Herr "Reichsmarschall", in which you said that England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that GÃ¶ring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His outspokenness frequently landed him in trouble with GÃ¶ring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the Royal Air Force (RAF), bringing his total to 17.
