Not long after the torpedo plane assaults, American transporter plunge aircraft touched base over the Japanese bearers practically undetected and started their jumps. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless plunge planes from "Big business", driven by C. Swim McClusky, hit "Kaga" with one bomb and somewhere around three bombs. The principal arrived close to her back lift and set the berthing compartments ablaze, and the following bomb hit the forward lift and infiltrated the upper shelter, setting off blasts and flames among the equipped and energized planes on her overhang deck. Commander Okada and the vast majority of the ship's senior officers were murdered by the third bomb, which hit the extension. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and entered the flight deck to detonate on the upper shelter. The blasts burst the ship's avgas lines, harmed both her port and starboard flame mains and the crisis generator controlling her flame siphons, just as thumping out the carbon dioxide fire concealment framework. Energized by the avgas pouring onto the storage deck, the flames exploded the of bombs and torpedoes strewn over the shed deck in a progression of disastrous different fuel-air blasts that extinguished the shed sides. At almost a similar time, plunge aircraft hit and lethally harmed "Akagi" and "SÃÂryÃÂ«".
