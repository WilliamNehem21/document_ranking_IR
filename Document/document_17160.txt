"Phallus indusiatus" was initially described by French naturalist Ãtienne Pierre Ventenat in 1798, and sanctioned under that name by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801. One author anonymously gave his impressions of Ventenat's discovery in an 1800 publication:
This beautiful species, which is sufficiently characterised to distinguish it from every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly as far from the left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, "Dictyophora", in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as "Dictyophora indusiata". Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in "Hymenophallus" in 1817, as "H.Â indusiatus". Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of "Phallus" and the species is now known again by its original name.
