In the same way as other earthstars, the organism utilizes the power of falling raindrops to help scatter the spores, which are launched out in little blasts when objects, (for example, downpour) strike the external mass of the spore sac. The gleba is dark colored to grayish-darker, with a cotton-like surface that, when packed, permits the endoperidium to flex rapidly and make a puff of air that is constrained out through the ostioles. This produces a haze of spores that would then be able to be conveyed by the breeze. There are columellae (sterile structures that begin at the base of the gleba and reach out through it), which are normally not obvious in the develop gleba, however evident at the base of the spore sac. The columellae are not associated with the ostioles, but instead, end inside the gleba at some separation from them. The capillitia (sterile strands inside the gleba) are long, thin, free, decreasing, unbranched, and 2Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m thick, with thickened dividers. The spores are round, nonamyloid, and are ornamented with unpredictably formed flaring projections up to 2ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m high. They measure 3.9Ã¢ÂÂ 4.8ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m in breadth (without ornamentation), and 5.4Ã¢ÂÂ 7.0ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m including the ornamentation.
