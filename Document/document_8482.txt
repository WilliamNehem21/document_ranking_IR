The principal significant war in New England was the Pequot War of 1637. The war's underlying foundations return to 1632, when a question emerged between Dutch hide merchants and Plymouth authorities over control of the Connecticut River Valley close present day Hartford, Connecticut. Agents from the Dutch East India Company and Plymouth Colony both had deeds which asserted that they had legitimately bought the land from the Pequots. A kind of land surge happened as pioneers from Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth provinces endeavored to beat the Dutch in settling the region; the convergence of English pilgrims likewise undermined the Pequot. Different confederations in the territory agreed with the English, including the Narragansetts and Mohegans, who were the conventional adversaries of the Pequots. The occasion that started formal threats was the catch of a vessel and the homicide of its chief John Oldham in 1636, an occasion accused on partners of the Pequots. In April 1637, a strike on a Pequot town by John Endicott prompted a retaliatory attack by Pequot warriors on the town of Wethersfield, Connecticut, where somewhere in the range of 30 English pilgrims were executed. This prompted a further striking back, where an attack driven by Captain John Underhill and Captain John Mason consumed a Pequot town to the ground close present day Mystic, Connecticut, killing 300 Pequots. Plymouth Colony had little to do with the real battling in the war.
