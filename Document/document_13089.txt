The evening of 30 SeptemberÃ¢ÂÂ 1 October, seven units are sent to seize the officers related with the Council. Nasution figures out how to escape over a divider, while his attachÃÂ© Pierre Tendean comes running out, using a weapon; Tendean is immediately caught and, when asked where Nasution is, admits himself to be the general. Yani, who battles back, is executed in his home; Major General M. T. Haryono meets a comparable destiny. Boss Military Prosecutor Sutoyo Siswomiharjo, Major General Siswondo Parman, and Lieutenant General Soeprapto are caught. Brigadier General D. I. Pandjaitan goes enthusiastically, however when he petitions God for a really long time before entering the truck he is killed. The bodies and detainees are taken to the G30S/PKI camp in Lubang Buaya, where the survivors are tormented and murdered. Their bodies are then tossed into a well. Later that morning, individuals from the development assume control over the RRI office and power the staff there to peruse a discourse by Untung (Bram Adrianto), which expresses that the G30S has moved to hinder an upset by the Generals' Council and declares the arrangement of a "Progressive Council". Different G30S/PKI men go to the royal residence to verify the president yet find that he has officially left. At Halim, the president talks with the G30S pioneers and announces that he will assume full responsibility for the Army. Another radio discourse is before long perused, laying out the sythesis of the new Revolutionary Council and reporting changes to Army chain of importance. The G30S pioneers start arranging their getaway from Halim, to be done before midnight.
