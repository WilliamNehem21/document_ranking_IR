In a meeting with the "Santa Clause Barbara Independent", Anderson said that a teacher in Philadelphia had been terminated for appearing narrative to his understudies. The instructor had looked into the narrative, and needed to show his understudies the historical backdrop of the word in light of its successive use in his class. Anderson said it was not the utilization of "fuck" in the film that cost the educator his activity, however a 38-second scene from a "Fuck for Forest" show in Europe where a couple occupied with sex in front of an audience as natural support. The instructor demonstrated the DVD to his eleventh grade reporting class at William Penn High School without seeing it or sending authorization slips home to guardians. He told the "Philadelphia Daily News" that before appearing narrative, he was unconscious that it contained the clasp indicating sex. He was rejected from his situation by the school main, and his end was maintained by the territorial director. The educator did not bid the choice, rather resigning. An investigation of the episode by the "Philadelphia Daily News" reasoned that the school region's choice to flame the instructor was proper, yet in addition concurred with the educator's position that demonstrating an hour and a half DVD ought not have destroyed his 19 years as a teacher.
