Richard was slaughtered battling the powers of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, the last significant clash of the Wars of the Roses. The Welsh writer Guto'r Glyn attributed Richard's passing to Sir Rhys ap Thomas, a Welsh individual from Henry's military who was said to have struck the lethal blow. Following his demise, Richard's body was stripped bare and taken to Leicester where it was put on open showcase. The unknown "Number of Bosworth Field" says that "in Newarke laid was hee, that numerous a one may looke on him" Ã¢ÂÂ more likely than not a reference to the university Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, a Lancastrian establishment on the edges of medieval Leicester. As per the recorder Polydore Vergil, Henry VII "faltered for two days" in Leicester before leaving for London, and on a similar date as Henry's flightÃ¢ÂÂ25 August 1485Ã¢ÂÂRichard's body was covered "at the community of Franciscan priests ["sic"] in Leicester" with "no burial service gravity". The Warwickshire cleric and classicist John Rous, composing somewhere in the range of 1486 and 1491, recorded that Richard had been covered "in the choir of the Friars Minor at Leicester". Albeit later essayists credited Richard's entombment to different spots, the records of Vergil and Rous were seen by present day agents as the most trustworthy.
