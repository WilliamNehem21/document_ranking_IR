Affirmation of Herschel's speculation of star arrangement needed to hold up an additional hundred years, when William Huggins together with his significant other Mary Huggins turned his spectroscope on different nebulae. A few, for example, the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra very like those of stars, however ended up being cosmic systems comprising of a huge number of individual stars. Others looked altogether different. As opposed to a solid continuum with assimilation lines superimposed, the Orion Nebula and other comparative articles demonstrated just few outflow lines. In planetary nebulae, the most brilliant of these otherworldly lines was at a wavelength of 500.7ÃÂ nanometres, which did not compare with a line of any known synthetic component. At first it was speculated that the line may be because of an obscure component, which was named nebuliumÃ¢ÂÂa comparative thought had prompted the revelation of helium through examination of the Sun's range in 1868. Nonetheless, while helium was separated on earth not long after its revelation in the range of the sun, nebulium was most certainly not. In the mid twentieth century, Henry Norris Russell suggested that instead of being another component, the line at 500.7ÃÂ nm was because of a recognizable component in new conditions.
