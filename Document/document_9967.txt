"Tram" was shot by Alex Zakrzewski, the arrangement's standard chief of photography. The scene was organized so that Pembleton is at first staying away from Lange, yet slowly draws nearer and closer as they bond, and by the end is sitting beside him and holding his hand. In like manner, the underlying scenes included more extensive shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the external edges of the edge, however later scenes included all the more close-ups of the two sitting together. In spite of the fact that "Murder: Life on the Street" commonly utilizes various forward and backward whip container style cuts, Fleder approached that the style be changed for this scene. In prior scenes, Fleder requested more extensive long shots to make a feeling of setting inside the metro station, and as the scene advanced and the story turned out to be increasingly extraordinary, he at that point permitted all the more close-ups and whip skillet. This prompted differences on the set among Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was attempting to being excessively problematic and troublesome. Fleder said of his conduct, "I need to concede, I'm not the most enchanting person on the set. I'm simply not. When I'm on the set, I'm engaged and my funniness leaves and I become not all that beguiling." After the scene was finished, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their disparities and were both content with the last outcome.
