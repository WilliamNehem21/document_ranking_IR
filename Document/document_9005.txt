With the BBC's History and Archeology Unit recording, Williams started the rebuilding of the vase in June 1988. He deconstructed the vase by wrapping it all around with smearing paper and giving it a chance to sit in a glass desiccator infused with solvents for three days, abandoning it in 189 pieces. In the wake of evacuating the leftovers of the old glue and cleaning the parts, Williams utilized an epoxy cement, Hxtal NYL, related to an acrylic tar to join the pieces. In spite of the fact that they endeavored to maintain a strategic distance from supposed snare outs, where the setting of a section keeps the following from fitting in, Williams and Smith left for Christmas in 1988 expecting that they may need to dismantle a half year's work so as to fit in the last couple of shards. These feelings of dread demonstrated unwarranted: a couple of more weeks spent chipping away at the top portion of the vase, and the last pieces joined splendidly. Toward the finish of nine months' work, just 17 little sections stayed unplaced, instead of the 34 that were overlooked from the past reclamation. In the wake of filling in the breaks with shaded sap, Williams gave his decision: "It's OK... destroyed my Christmas."
