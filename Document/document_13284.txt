RKO, and the film business in general, had its most productive year ever in 1946. A Goldwyn generation discharged by RKO, "The Best Years of Our Lives", was the best Hollywood film of the decade and won that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Be that as it may, the lawful status of the business' authoritative plan of action was progressively being called into uncertainty: the U.S. Incomparable Court governed in "Bigelow v. RKO" that the organization was at risk for harms under antitrust resolutions for having denied a free motion picture house access to initially run moviesÃ¢ÂÂa typical practice among the majority of the Big Five.

After Koerner's passing, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N.
