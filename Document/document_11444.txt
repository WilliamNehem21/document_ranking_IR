Examinations with the finds from the rescued "Mary Rose" itself have given a chance to think about the exactness of the records gave in the Roll. The image of the ship has given pieces of information about essential auxiliary highlights, for example, the quantity of poles and sails. At the point when contrasted and a stock of the ship from 1514, there is a nearby match, turned out to be to a great extent exact. Examination of subtleties in the development, in any case, uncovers that Anthony permitted himself some creative permit. The combat hardware in the painted ship shows up plainly misrepresented. The overwhelming stern chasers (gun set in the stern pointed in reverse) mounted through weapon ports on the orlop deck, pretty much the waterline, would not have been attainable in view of the absence of an orlop deck and the lofty edge (sheer) of the ship here. The quantity of gunports in the broadside is erroneous since it suggests two marginally stunned lines of nine ports while the enduring starboard side of the "Mary Rose" has just a single line of gunports on the primary deck with seven ports. The precision of the forecastle has been increasingly hard to discover since none of it stays; clashing elucidations of what it looked like have been proposed.
