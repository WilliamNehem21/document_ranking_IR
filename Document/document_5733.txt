In 2004, Chastain assumed the job of Anya, a temperate young lady, in a Williamstown Theater Festival creation of Anton Chekhov's play "The Cherry Orchard" in Massachusetts, featuring with Michelle Williams. Additionally that year, she worked with Playwrights Horizons on a creation of Richard Nelson's "Rodney's Wife" as the girl of a harried moderately aged film performing artist. Her execution was not generally welcomed by the commentator Ben Brantley of "The New York Times", who believed that she "by one way or another appears to continue losing shading as the night advances". While taking a shot at the play, she was prescribed by Nelson to Al Pacino, who was searching for an on-screen character to star in his generation of Oscar Wilde's disaster "Salome". The play recounts to the shocking story of its main character's sexual investigation. In the play, Salome is a 16-year-old, however Chastain, who was 29 at that point, was thrown for the part. The play was organized in 2006 at the Wadsworth Theater in Los Angeles, and Chastain later commented that it conveyed her to the consideration of a few throwing executives. Composing for "Assortment", the commentator Steven Oxman condemned her depiction in the play: "Chastain is so apprehensive with Salome, not exactly certain whether she's a skilled temptress or a whiny, rich minx; she doesn't tissue out either decision".
