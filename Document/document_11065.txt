In 1972 and 1973 Thorpe's political fortunes, and those of the Liberals, restored. Thorpe's own standing was upgraded when, on 14 March 1973, he wedded Marion, Countess of Harewood, whose previous spouse was a first cousin to the Queen. After a progression of by-decision triumphs and neighborhood government gains, a discretionary leap forward for the gathering looked conceivable when Heath called a general race in February 1974. In that decision, with in excess of six million votes (19.3% of those cast), the Liberals accomplished by a wide margin their best race result since the Second World War, yet under the first-past-the-post casting a ballot framework this extensive vote converted into just 14 seats. In any case, as neither one of the majors party won a general lion's share, these seats gave Thorpe (whose individual dominant part in North Devon expanded to 11,072) noteworthy influence. He was quickly in alliance dialogs with Heath, who was set up to give bureau presents on Thorpe and other senior Liberals. Thorpe later denied that there was any genuine prospect of understanding, and in March 1974 Harold Wilson framed a minority Labor government. In the second 1974 general race, in October, Wilson accomplished a limited larger part; the Liberals lost ground, with 5.3 million votes and 13 MPs.
