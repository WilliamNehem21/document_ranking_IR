Coming back to the surface with Kida, Milo finds Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the team deceive Milo, aiming to convey the gem to the surface and offer it. Rourke mortally wounds the King while at the same time endeavoring to extricate data about the precious stone's area, however discovers it himself covered up underneath the King's honored position room. The precious stone identifies a risk and converges with Kida, whom Rourke and the soldiers of fortune lock in a carton, and after that get ready to leave the city. Realizing that when the precious stone is gone the Atlanteans will pass on, Milo scolds the group for selling out their hearts, and at last persuades them to leave Rourke and stay in Atlantis. The King discloses to Milo that the precious stone has built up an awareness; it blossoms with the aggregate feelings of the Atlanteans and will locate an imperial host when Atlantis is in peril. He at that point uncovers that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he endeavored to utilize it as a weapon of war. As he passes on, he gives his precious stone to Milo, guiding him to spare Atlantis and Kida. Milo energizes the group and Atlanteans to stop Rourke.
