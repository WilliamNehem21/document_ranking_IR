From the get-go in 1069 the recently introduced Norman Earl of Northumbria, Robert de Comines, and a few hundred fighters going with him were slaughtered at Durham; the Northumbrian disobedience was joined by Edgar, Gospatric, Siward Barn and different dissidents who had taken shelter in Scotland. The castellan of York, Robert fitzRichard, was crushed and murdered, and the agitators attacked the Norman palace at York. William rushed north with a military, vanquished the radicals outside York and sought after them into the city, slaughtering the occupants and finishing the revolt. He fabricated a second chÃÂ¢teau at York, reinforced Norman powers in Northumbria and afterward returned south. A consequent nearby uprising was pounded by the army of York. Harold's children propelled a second assault from Ireland and were vanquished in Devon by Norman powers under Count Brian, a child of Eudes, Count of PenthiÃÂ¨vre. In August or September 1069 an expansive armada sent by Sweyn II of Denmark touched base off the bank of England, starting another flood of uprisings the nation over. After fruitless assaults in the south, the Danes united with another Northumbrian uprising, which was additionally joined by Edgar, Gospatric and different outcasts from Scotland just as Waltheof. The consolidated Danish and English powers vanquished the Norman army at York, caught the palaces and assumed responsibility for Northumbria, despite the fact that a strike into Lincolnshire driven by Edgar was crushed by the Norman battalion of Lincoln.
