No.ÃÂ 1 Wing battled its last significant commitment amid September and November 1943. On 7ÃÂ September, the Japanese dispatched a twin-engined observation air ship escorted by 20 contenders to the Darwin territory. The 48 Spitfires mixed in light of this power were driven by Flight Lieutenant Bob Foster. This was Foster's first involvement in driving the wing, and he misdeployed No.ÃÂ 54 and 452ÃÂ squadrons' flying machine, prompting them being 'ricocheted' by Japanese contenders. In the consequent battle three Spitfires were shot down while the wing asserted one contender obliterated and two 'probables'. No.ÃÂ 457 Squadron had the capacity to pick up a tallness advantage on the Japanese and shot down four warriors without misfortune. A further two night assaults were made against Fenton on 15 and 27ÃÂ September yet the Spitfires mixed accordingly were unfit to discover the planes on either event. No.ÃÂ 1 Wing encountered a noteworthy turnover of faculty amid September as pilots finished their nine-month voyages through obligation. This prompted lost experienced aviators, yet the new pilots were frequently preferred prepared over the men they supplanted. No assaults occurred amid October, and the wing did not reach the Japanese until 6ÃÂ November when a trip of six Spitfires which been sent to Drysdale River Mission, Western Australia on the third of the month bombed trying to capture a surveillance flying machine close to the settlement. In the early long periods of 12ÃÂ November nine Spitfires were mixed to block nine Japanese airplane which were destined for Darwin and Fenton. Two Betty planes were shot down over Darwin Harbor by Flying Officer John Smithson and no Allied flying machine were lost. Both these flying machine were instructed by senior officers, and their demises prompted the scratch-off of further Betty plane tasks in the Darwin territory.
