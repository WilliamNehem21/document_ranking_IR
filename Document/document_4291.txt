Media surveys of "Lions" were blended. Various journalists identified a Led Zeppelin impact (which was adulated by a few, yet panned by others) and credited it to The Black Crowes' ongoing visit with Jimmy Page. Dave McKenna, composing for "The Washington Post", contrasted Steve Gorman's drumming with that of John Bonham and discovered analogs to explicit guitar and console tones in Led Zeppelin collections. Nigel Williamson of "The Times" discovered likenesses in Chris Robinson's voice on "Please" to that of Robert Plant, and composed that the melody "could nearly be a "Driven ZeppelinÃÂ II" push off." Other analysts noted similitudes to Aerosmith; Howard Cohen of "The Miami Herald" called "Lickin'" "the best Aerosmith single that band hasn't recorded in years." The apparent absence of innovation, however, killed a few faultfinders. The "Messenger Sun's" Andrew McUtchen derived "The Black Crowes are ignorant it's never again the '70s and after one tune in to "Lions" ... it's unmistakable somebody should let them know." Everett True of Playlouder agreed, stating "It's blindingly evident the Crowes are imitators, and dependably will be", however Elysa Gardner, composing for "USA Today", perceived the band "display a vitality and aptitude that redressÃ¢ÂÂat any rate to some degreeÃ¢ÂÂfor their absence of innovation."
