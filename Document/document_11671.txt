Other than the skull components and some confined teeth, the Romualdo Formation has likewise yielded l stays from spinosaurids, huge numbers of which are until now undescribed, and every one of them relating to the Spinosaurinae subfamily. In 2004, portions of a spinal segment (MN 4743-V) were uncovered at the arrangement. Brazilian scientist Jonathas Bittencourt and Kellner relegated these, because of their structure, to the Spinosauridae. It is unsure whether this example can be alluded to "Irritator" or "Angaturama", given that both depend just on skull material. In 2007, Machado and Kellner likely alluded a rib piece (MN 7021-V) to the Spinosauridae. In any case, the most total spinosaur example recovered from the Romualdo Formation is MN 4819-V, an incomplete skeleton coming up short on the skull. First announced in 1991, the example was alluded by Kellner to the Spinosauridae in 2001 on account of its tall sacral neural spines and the augmented state of the hand paw. The skeleton was completely portrayed in 2010 out of a starting at yet unpublished ace's theory by Machado. A deficient rear appendage (MPSC R-2089) referenced in 2013 may likewise relate to the Spinosauridae. In 2018, Tito Aureliano and his group depicted LPP-PV-0042, some portion of a left tibia from an especially extensive person. As is normal with fossils from the Araripe Basin, most of spinosaurid material from the Romualdo Formation was gathered under uncontrolled conditions for use in the illicit fossil exchange. Thusly, numerous examples are mostly harmed and without exact geographical field information.
