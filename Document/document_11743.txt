The tainting of the two most holy destinations of Merina sovereignty spoke to a determined political move expected to build up the political and social prevalence of the French pilgrim control. In the prominent view, the connection among Ambohimanga and the precursors (Andrianampoinimerina specifically) rendered the regal city a significantly progressively strong image and wellspring of authentic power than the capital of Antananarivo, which was viewed as having turned into a locus of degenerate legislative issues and abnormality from genealogical convention. Trusting that the nearness of the predecessors inside the tombs blessed the earth whereupon the rova was fabricated, Menalamba opposition warriors would come to Ambohimanga to gather bunches of soil from the base of the tombs to convey with them in their offensives against the French; the French expert expected by the expulsion of the sovereigns' bodies from the tombs to undermine the contenders' certainty and solidarity. Despite the fact that the tombs were contaminated and the Menalamba contenders were at last vanquished, Ambohimanga has held its hallowed character. The imperial tombs were reproduced in 2008 by the legislature of Madagascar under the Ravalomanana organization. Amid the 1995 flame that devastated the tombs and different structures at the Rova of Antananarivo, the "lamba"- wrapped survives from just a single sovereignÃ¢ÂÂRanavalona IIIÃ¢ÂÂcould be spared from the blazes. The ruler has since been re-entombed in the regal tombs at Ambohimanga.
