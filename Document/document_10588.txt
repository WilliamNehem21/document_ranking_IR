After Pitman's catch, he was walked to Richmond in a powerless physical state. He was detained in the Confederate Libby Prison and Belle Isle, which were famously unforgiving penitentiaries. Pitman's letters home portrayed his place of detainment as the "Pen" where "the foul meat [was] tossed to them as though they were hounds". The state of his detainment including the deficiency of nourishment, absence of sanitation, congestion and his physical shortcoming made him powerless to destructive maladies present in the Confederate penitentiaries. Carter depicted how the jails "destroyed the courageous soul". Amid a detainee trade, Pitman was discharged by the Confederate Army at City Point, Virginia, on DecemberÃÂ 12, 1862, and after that sent to Camp Parole, Annapolis. Experiencing inconveniences because of the states of his detainment, he contracted "lung fever", which was maybe pneumonia. Carter composed later how his companion had "linger[ed] weakly half a month, similar to the glimmering of a lapsing fire, at that point discreetly pass[ed] away to an interminable life". Pitman kicked the bucket at Camp Parole on FebruaryÃÂ 27, 1863, only weeks shy of his eighteenth birthday celebration. As indicated by students of history Anita Manning and Justin Vance, Pitman "has the lamentable refinement of being the main known Hawaiian or Pacific Islander to kick the bucket as a captive in the Civil War".
