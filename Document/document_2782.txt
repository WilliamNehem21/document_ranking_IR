While inspecting the example, van Grouw saw that the legs had at one point been disconnected and are presently connected inverse their regular positions.

The plate going with Forbes' 1898 article demonstrates the quills on the external side, and delineates the legs as pinkish, though they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has now and again been portrayed as having a handle at the base of its bill, like that of the Nicobar pigeon. This thought appears to have begun with Forbes, who had the flying creature delineated with this component, maybe because of his conviction that it was a types of "Caloenas"; it was portrayed with a handle as late as 2002. This is in spite of the way that the enduring example does not have a handle, and Latham did not make reference to or delineate this element, so such portrayals are most likely wrong. According to the example were evacuated when it was set up into an investigation skin, however red paint around the correct eye-attachment recommends that it was initially expected to have red eyes. It is obscure whether this speaks to the normal eye shade of the winged creature, yet the eyes were additionally portrayed as red in Latham's delineation, which does not seem to have been founded on the current example. Forbes had the iris delineated as orange and the skin around the eye as green, however this was most likely mystery.
