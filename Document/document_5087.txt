Without a harmony bargain, MacArthur chose not to leave while in the meantime composing letters to Wood saying he would gladly acknowledge the Republican designation on the off chance that it were offered to him. In late 1947 and mid 1948, MacArthur got a few Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press articulation proclaiming his enthusiasm for being the Republican possibility for president, saying he would be regarded if the Republican Party were to assign him, yet would not leave from the Army to crusade for the administration. The press explanation had been constrained by Wood, who revealed to MacArthur that it was difficult to battle for a man who was not formally running for president, and that MacArthur could either proclaim his office or see Wood stop crusading for him. MacArthur's supporters tried to win the Wisconsin Republican essential hung on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to battle gravely hurt his odds and it was won shockingly by Harold Stassen. The thrashing in Wisconsin pursued by annihilation in Nebraska viably finished MacArthur's odds of winning the Republican designation, however MacArthur would not pull back his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.
