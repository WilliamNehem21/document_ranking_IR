Official strategic acknowledgment by different nations was key for Rhodesia as it was the main way it could recapture the universal authenticity it had lost through UDI. Acknowledgment by the UK itself through a respective settlement would be the "main prize", in Smith's words, as it would end assents and protected uncertainty and make remote acknowledgment, at any rate in the West, undeniably more probable. Considering their nation a possibly vital player wide open to the harshe elements War as a "bastion against socialism" in southern Africa, the RF placed that some Western nations may perceive UDI even without an earlier Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement. In particular, it anticipated discretionary acknowledgment from South Africa and Portugal, and suspected that France may perceive Rhodesia to disturb Britain and make a point of reference for an autonomous Quebec. In any case, albeit South Africa and Portugal gave financial, military and restricted political help to the post-UDI government (as did France and different countries, to a lesser degree), neither they nor some other nation at any point perceived Rhodesia as a "by right" free state. Rhodesia's fruitless endeavors to win Western help and acknowledgment included ideas to the US government in 1966 and 1967, disregarded by Lyndon B Johnson's organization, to give Rhodesian troops to battle close by the Americans and other enemy of socialist powers in Vietnam.
