Students of history have progressed different perspectives about why, despite the fact that MÃÂ¼ller was by and large viewed as the prevalent researcher, he lost to Williams. Beckerlegge recommends a few conceivable elements: in contrast to Williams, MÃÂ¼ller was known as an essayist and interpreter as opposed to an instructor of Sanskrit, he didn't have connections toward the East India Company or the Indian Civil Service that he could call upon for supporters, and he had not been taught at Oxford. In his eulogy of MÃÂ¼ller, Arthur Macdonell (Boden teacher 1899Ã¢ÂÂ 1926) said that the decision "came to turn on the political and religious sentiments of the applicants as opposed to on their benefits as Sanskrit researchers", including that "party feeling ran high and expansive numbers came up to cast a ballot." Similarly, Dowling has composed that "in the less cosmopolitan areas outside OxfordÃÂ ... the contention that MÃÂ¼ller was 'not English' told vigorously against him" since "the contention was (and was intended to be, obviously) unanswerable." She includes that Tories restricted him for his liberal political perspectives, conventionalist groups inside Oxford rejected "Germanizing" change, and "the Anglican clergyÃÂ ... recognized unbelief sneaking in his umlaut". The American student of history Marjorie Wheeler-Barclay takes the view that the three thought processes in individuals casting a ballot against MÃÂ¼ller can't be unraveled. The individuals who bolstered Indian preacher work, Dowling composes, considered it to be the way to proceeded with British standard, and there was no compelling reason to take a risk by choosing MÃÂ¼ller, who had "a notoriety for unsound religious assessments", since Williams was a researcher "of qualification known for his conservatism and devotion."
