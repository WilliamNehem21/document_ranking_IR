At the time, the utilization of such vigorous power against Katanga, including airplane, big guns, and protected vehicles, stirred much discussion. In spite of the fact that actually unnerved by the viciousness as a Bhuddist, Thant suspected the activity was defended. His thinking for such solid activity fell in accordance with simply war hypothesis. Advocates of Katanga contended that the secessionist development was a genuine exercise of self-assurance. Thant disproved the thought in his journals, posting three essential complaints: first, the Congo had been conceded into the UN in 1960 as a "brought together state" with the composed understanding of Tshombe. Second, "no sovereign state on the planet at any point perceived the freedom of Katanga". Third, Tshombe's legislature was "never ready to practice successful control" over the whole of the territory. Military specialist Walter Dorn estimated that Thant may have been by and by touchy to the issue of severance, having experienced the grisly Karen struggle in his local Burma and saw the results of the Partition of India. Holding office amid a period of across the board decolonisation in Africa and Asia, Thant was aware of the point of reference he was setting; perceiving or empowering severance in one nation could enable it to spread to others with touchy outcomes. As late as February 1970, he condemned severance, proclaiming that the UN "has never acknowledged and does not acknowledge, and I don't trust it will ever acknowledge, the guideline of withdrawal of a piece of its Member State."
