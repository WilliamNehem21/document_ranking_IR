I-675 was at first arranged in the mid-1950s, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) initially proposed the number I-275 for the turnpike through Saginaw in 1958, while the MSHD proposed an I-73 number for what is presently I-275. The state began development on I-675 of every 1969. The expressway was to give access to the downtown Saginaw zone and fill in as a detour for the first Zilwaukee Bridge upper east of downtown, jobs that proceed with today. At the time, the Zilwaukee Bridge was a bascule connect that could be raised to enable transportation traffic to utilize the Saginaw River. Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on the interstate for as long as four hours on vacation ends of the week. I-675 alleviated the clog amid such occasions. The record was a car influx on Labor Day 1968, in spite of the fact that reinforcements were normal until the delivery organizations utilizing the Saginaw River restricted their traffic in 1970. The road was finished in 1971 and opened to traffic that year. After fulfillment, the state considered reproducing I-675 to make the downtown road the through steering for I-75/USÃÂ 23 in the Saginaw zone to sidestep the bascule connect. Initially to be finished in 1983, the substitution connect on I-75/USÃÂ 23 at last opened on September 19, 1988. The following year, southbound I-675 was utilized to occupy traffic around an impermanent conclusion on the southbound range of the Zilwaukee Bridge. In the meantime, northbound I-675 was shut while teams supplanted the deck on the scaffold over the Saginaw River.
