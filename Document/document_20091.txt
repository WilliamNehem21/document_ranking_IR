Fruits and nuts were probably the mainstay of the Mauritius blue pigeon's diet, and like other blue pigeons, it may have occupied the upper canopy, and migrated seasonally to where food was available. Cossigny dissected a specimen in the mid-18th century and later sent it and its stomach contents to the French scientist RenÃ© Antoine Ferchault de RÃ©aumur with a letter describing his findings. The gizzard and crop contained four "nuts", which Cossigny was told were the seeds of either "Calophyllum tacamahaca" or "Labourdonnaisia calophylloides". The Comoro and Seychelles blue pigeons also feed on "C. tacamahaca", and the strong gizzard of the former helps in the digestion of the seeds. In 1812 Jacques GÃ©rard Milbert provided the only description of the behaviour of the bird in the wild:
The claim that the bird fed on river molluscs was criticised by the French zoologists Alphonse Milne-Edwards and Emile Oustalet in 1893, with the later agreement of the American ornithologist James Greenway in 1967, as blue pigeons are principally arboreal. It has since been pointed out that other mainly frugivorous pigeons, such as species of "Ptilinopus" and "Gallicolumba", do occasionally eat molluscs and other invertebrates. The two species of "Nesoenas" have also been reported as eating freshwater snails, and one was seen hunting tadpoles. Milbert may in any case have been referring to arboreal snails, as extant blue pigeons rarely land on the ground. A diet of snails would have provided the birds with calcium for egg production. Pretorius attempted to keep juvenile and adult Mauritius blue pigeons in captivity, but all his specimens died. This is probably because the species was almost exclusively frugivorous, like extant blue pigeons.
