There were five driver changes heading into the race. Having been in one of the two Ligier vehicles since the tenthÃÂ race of the period at Germany, Martin Brundle was supplanted by Aguri Suzuki as a major aspect of the two sharing the drive for the season. Jan Magnussen was drafted into the McLaren group to supplant Mika HÃÂ¤kkinen as a result of the Finn's activity for an infected appendix. The third driver change was Ukyo Katayama's arrival to Tyrrell in the wake of missing the European Grand Prix because of an accident at the Portuguese Grand Prix. Gianni Morbidelli came back to the Footwork group supplanting Max Papis, while at Pacific, Bertrand Gachot returned to supplant Jean-Denis DÃÂ©lÃÂ©traz, the two men having driven for these groups toward the beginning of the period. DÃÂ©lÃÂ©traz was supplanted as he had not made concurred installment portions to the Pacific group for the benefit of the drive. Pacific had initially proposed to run nearby driver Katsumi Yamamoto instead of DÃÂ©lÃÂ©traz, however he was not allowed a FIA Super License thus Gachot retook the seat. Also, the Forti group's arrangements to supplant Roberto Moreno with Hideki Noda came to nothing for a similar reason, despite the fact that Noda had begun three Grands Prix for the Larrousse group the earlier year.
