After European colonization, the traveler pigeon was chased more seriously and with more refined techniques than the more supportable strategies rehearsed by the locals. However it has likewise been proposed that the species was uncommon before 1492, and that the ensuing increment in their numbers might be because of the abatement in the Native American populace (who, just as chasing the winged animals, rivaled them for pole) brought about by European migration, and the beneficial nourishment (agrarian harvests) the settlers imported (a hypothesis for which Joel Greenberg offered a point by point rejoinder in his book, "A Feathered River Across the Sky"). The traveler pigeon was of specific incentive on the wilderness, and a few settlements depended on its meat to help their populace. The kind of the substance of traveler pigeons differed relying upon how they were readied. When all is said in done, adolescents were thought to taste the best, trailed by flying creatures stuffed in bondage and winged animals got in September and October. It was regular practice to stuff caught pigeons before eating them or putting away their bodies for winter. Dead pigeons were ordinarily put away by salting or pickling the bodies; different occasions, just the bosoms of the pigeons were kept, in which case they were commonly smoked. In the mid nineteenth century, business seekers started mesh and shooting the flying creatures to sell as sustenance in city advertises, and even as pig grain. When pigeon meat ended up prevalent, business chasing began an immense scale.
