The "retiarius" was traditionally pitted against a "secutor" or, possibly on rare occasions, a "murmillo". Despite the disparity between the nearly nude net-fighter and his heavily armoured adversary, modern re-enactments and experiments show that the "retiarius" was by no means outmatched. His lack of heavy equipment meant that he could use speed and evasion to his advantage. He also fought with three offensive weapons to his opponent's one. The net-fighter had to avoid close combat at all costs, keep his distance, and wait for an opening to stab with his trident or throw his net. The name "secutor" means "pursuer" or "chaser", because this gladiator had to chase down the "retiarius". They were also known as "contraretiarii" ("those against the net-man"). The "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strategy was to keep behind his shield ("scutum") and force his opponent into close combat so that he could strike with his sword. In close quarters, the net-man had only his "galerus" shoulder guard for defence; its design forced him to keep his head ducked down behind it. The "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s helmet greatly restricted his sight, hearing, and airflow. Coupled with the heavy weight of his arms and armourâthe gear of a "murmillo", of which the "secutor" was a variant, weighed âthis gladiator was in greater danger of exhausting himself in a long fight. One of the "retiarius"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tactics was to jab at the "secutor"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s shield (the heaviest part of his equipment), forcing him to block and wear himself out. Overall, Roman oddsmakers gave an advantage to a "retiarius", although skill and experience could affect the odds in individual matches.
