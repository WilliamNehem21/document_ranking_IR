The last account was made in August at Armory Studios in Vancouver, Canada, where Garbage based upon their first blend of the melody, including and subtracting parts, and finished last chronicle and blending. The band kept the course of action tight to protect the tune's dynamic, clearing tune. "The ensemble occupied so much room and truly managed where the tune was going progressively," keeping the chronicle straightforward, Vig reviewed. "Other than the drums and bass and some percussive circles, there's a smidgen of guitar that Duke and Steve did. There's not a great deal of different tracks on there. There's a couple of little ear-treat things that we did, however it's everything intended to work around Shirley's singing." Although Garbage claimed its very own account studio in Madison, Wisconsin, for legitimate reasons the melody couldn't be recorded in a U.S. studio. "The World Is Not Enough" was finished, blended and aced toward the month's end, and the gathering came back to their account studio in Madison to record their blend of the tune. Refuse's form (the "relaxed remix") made light of the exemplary Bond sound for the band's style. Vig later said about the first chronicle, "We're really satisfied with how it turned out. To Garbage fans, it sounds like a Garbage melody. What's more, to Bond fans, it's a Bond melody." However, Manson noticed that the form included in the film "got our expectations and delights squashed," as "they had totally screwed with every one of the stems of blend and it sounded totally extraordinary."
