Slayer wanted for "Reign in Blood" maker Rick Rubin to deliver the collection, and anticipated that him should do as such after Rubin communicated an underlying interest. Rubin was occupied, be that as it may, which made a further postpone recording. While "Christ Illusion"s recording was at long last in progress Rubin loaned generation to Metallica's "Demise Magnetic", an activity later portrayed by King as a "slap in the screwing face." Josh Abraham created the collection rather, and was lauded by Blabbermouth's Don Kaye "for catching significantly more of the sparkle than has been clear on the last couple of records." Despite botching a chance to deliver "Christ Illusion", Rubin contributed in an "official generation" limit. Ruler was incredulous of his association, and said he can't review Rubin's essence in the studio amid the account, and that Rubin's fundamental commitment was in giving recommendations amid the last blend. Jamie Thomson of UK's "The Guardian" paper was disdainful of Rubin's commitment, and watched Slayer "appear to be reluctant to jettison the nu-metal inclinations that have made a big deal about their ongoing yield so resistible, which proposes Rubin's contribution was extensively less involved than in his astounding reclamations of Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond."
