Rhodesian dark patriots and their abroad supporters, noticeably the OAU, clamored for Britain to evacuate Smith's administration with a military intrusion, yet Britain rejected this alternative due to different calculated issues, the danger of inciting a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the mental issues that were probably going to go with any showdown among British and Rhodesian troops in what Smith said would be a "fratricidal war". Wilson rather made plans to end the Rhodesian insubordination through financial approvals; these basically involved the removal of Rhodesia from the Sterling territory, a prohibition on the import of Rhodesian sugar, tobacco, chrome and different products, and an oil blacklist of Rhodesia. At the point when the Rhodesians kept on accepting oil, Wilson endeavored to straightforwardly remove their primary supply lines, to be specific the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and LourenÃÂ§o Marques, by posting a Royal Navy squadron to the Mozambique Channel in March 1966. This barricade, the Beira Patrol, was supported the next month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. The United Nations continued to organize the primary compulsory exchange endorses in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968), which required part states to stop all exchange and monetary connections with Rhodesia.
