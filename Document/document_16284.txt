In 2005, the palaeontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso and colleagues described new skull material (a snout) of "Spinosaurus" (the original fossils of which were also destroyed during World War II), and concluded this dinosaur would have been long with a weight , exceeding the maximum size of all other theropods. In 2006, Coria and Currie described the large theropod "Mapusaurus" from Patagonia; it was closely related to "Giganotosaurus" and of approximately the same size. In a 2007, the palaeontologists FranÃ§ois Therrien and Donald M. Henderson found that "Giganotosaurus" and "Carcharodontosaurus" would both have approached in length and in weight (surpassing "Tyrannosaurus"), and estimated the "Giganotosaurus" holotype skull to have been long. They cautioned that these measurements depended on whether the incomplete skulls of these animals had been reconstructed correctly, and that more complete specimens were needed for more accurate estimates. They also found that Dal Sasso and colleagues' reconstruction of "Spinosaurus" was too large, and instead estimated it to have been long, weighing , and possibly as low as in length and in weight. They concluded that these dinosaurs had reached the upper biomechanical size limit attainable by a strictly bipedal animal. In 2010, the palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul suggested that the skulls of carcharodontosaurs had been reconstructed as too long in general.
