A few forms of the fantasy give Set's thought process to murdering Osiris. As per a spell in the "Pyramid Texts", Set is delivering retribution for a kick Osiris gave him, while in a Late Period message, Set's complaint is that Osiris engaged in sexual relations with Nephthys, who is Set's partner and the fourth offspring of Geb and Nut. The homicide itself is much of the time implied, yet never obviously portrayed. The Egyptians trusted that composed words had the ability to influence reality, so they abstained from composing legitimately about significantly negative occasions, for example, Osiris' passing. Once in a while they denied his demise through and through, despite the fact that the main part of the conventions about him clarify that he has been killed. Now and again the writings propose that Set appears as a wild creature, for example, a crocodile or bull, to kill Osiris; in others they infer that Osiris' body is tossed in the water or that he is suffocated. This last custom is the root of the Egyptian conviction that individuals who had suffocated in the Nile were consecrated. Indeed, even the personality of the unfortunate casualty is alterable in writings, as it is once in a while the god Haroeris, a senior type of Horus, who is killed by Set and afterward retaliated for by another type of Horus, who is Haroeris' child by Isis.
