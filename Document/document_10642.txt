No.ÃÂ 5 Squadron was disbanded in May 1919. Alongside numerous other Australian Flying Corps faculty, including Colonel Watt, Major King, and Captain Les Holden, Malley came back to Australia on board the troopship "Kaisar-I-Hind", landing in Sydney on 19ÃÂ June. He therefore visited the nation to advance the Peace Loan. On 24ÃÂ August, while venturing out from Melbourne to Sydney to initiate his arrangement of showing flights around New South Wales, Malley smashed his Avro 504K amid departure from Benalla, Victoria. He was healthy yet needed to come back to Melbourne and in the long run advanced north via train. Continuing his flying project, he was accounted for on 17ÃÂ September as having "excited" noon swarms in Sydney the earlier day with "three brave winding plunges" over Hyde Park. Malley was released from the AIF on 4ÃÂ October 1919, and dispatched a skipper in the Commonwealth Military Forces Reserve on 1ÃÂ July 1920. He rejoined Malley's as a distribution center director in 1921. In May that year, he presented with Les Holden and other veteran pilots as a pall-carrier at Watt's burial service in Randwick. On 25ÃÂ January 1922, Malley wedded Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman. The association would deliver one child, Maldon. Malley was recognized as both a source and a commentator by F.M. Cutlack in the last's volume on the Australian Flying Corps, first distributed in 1923 as a major aspect of the official history of Australia in the war.
