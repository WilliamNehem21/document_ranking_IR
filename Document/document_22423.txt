WÄkiu bugs feed on dead insect carcasses that drift up Mauna Kea on the wind and settle on snow banks. This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus "Nysius", which consists of predominantly seed-eating insects. They can survive at extreme elevations of up to because of natural antifreeze in their blood. They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time. Their conservation status is unclear, but the species is no longer a candidate for the Endangered Species List; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980. The closely related "Nysius aa" lives on Mauna Loa. Wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and forest tent caterpillar moths have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem; the former survive by hiding under heat-absorbing rocks, and the latter through cold-resistant chemicals in their bodies.
The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an elevation of , is dominated by mÄmane ("Sophora chrysophylla") and naio ("Myoporum sandwicense"), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as mÄmaneânaio forest. MÄmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila ("Loxioides bailleui"). The palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and HualÄlai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Keaâonly 10% of its former rangeâand has been declared critically endangered.
