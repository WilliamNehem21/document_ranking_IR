Seventeen species have been alluded to the variety "Psittacosaurus", albeit just nine to eleven are viewed as substantial today. This is the most elevated number of legitimate species as of now relegated to any single dinosaur class (excluding feathered creatures). Conversely, most other dinosaur genera are monospecific, containing just a solitary known animal groups. The thing that matters is probably because of ancient rarities of the fossilization procedure. While "Psittacosaurus" is known from several fossil examples, most other dinosaur species are known from far less, and many are spoken to by just a solitary example. With a high example estimate, the assorted variety of "Psittacosaurus" can be dissected more totally than that of most dinosaur genera, bringing about the acknowledgment of more species. Most surviving creature genera are spoken to by different species, proposing this may have been the situation for wiped out dinosaur genera too, albeit a large portion of these species might not have been protected. What's more, most dinosaurs are known exclusively from bones and must be assessed from a morphological point of view, while surviving species regularly have fundamentally the same as skeletal morphology yet vary in different ways which would not ordinarily be saved in the fossil record, for example, conduct, or colouration. In this manner, genuine species assorted variety might be a lot higher than as of now perceived in this and other dinosaur genera. As certain species are known just from skull material, types of "Psittacosaurus" are basically recognized by highlights of the skull and teeth. A few animal types can be perceived by highlights of the pelvis too.
