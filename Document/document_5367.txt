Afterward, a few assaults occurred, yet they fizzled on account of punctured tires and the shielding strategies of the main riders; at last, Daems, who was a sprinter and not a climber, had the capacity to win this mountain arrange. Poulidor's harmed hand was better by stage nineteen, and his group director revealed to him that the time had come to assault. He was put ninth in the general order, ten minutes behind, so he would have not likely been viewed as a risk. Assaulting over the last ascensions, he soloed to the completion at Aix-les-Bains with favorable position of over three minutes over his opponents, moving him to third place generally, 5 min 43 s falling behind financially, with Planckaert as yet driving and Anquetil second, 1 min 8 s down. In stage twenty, an individual time preliminary completing in Lyon, Planckaert came in fourth spot, losing 5 min 19 s to the victor, Anquetil, who took the general lead. Anquetil was a period preliminary master and thought about great at the time. Baldini put second, 2 min 59 s off the time set by Anquetil, and third was Poulidor who came in 5 min 1 s down to keep his third spot by and large. Stage 21 finished in a cluster run won by Dino Bruni of Gazzola.
