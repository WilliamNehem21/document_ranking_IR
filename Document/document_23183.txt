Following the 2011â12 season, the team lost graduating senior captains Zack Novak and Stu Douglass, who moved on to professional basketball careers in Europe. The incoming class of Mitch McGary, Glenn Robinson III and Nik Stauskas was ranked among the best classes in the nation by the media. With its new lineup, the team matched the greatest starts in school history. Starting the season with 11 consecutive wins matched the best start since Michigan's 1989 national champions, the 1988â89 team. At 16â0, Michigan matched its best start since the last repeat Big Ten Regular season championship, the 1985â86 team, tying a school record. Reaching 19â1 set a record for the best start in school history. The team also reached the number one position in the AP Poll for the first time since the Fab Five 1992â93 team. The team entered February with a 20â1 record (7â1 Big Ten), but with an injury to eventual B1G All-Defensive selection Jordan Morgan and a stretch of games against its strongest conference opponents, Michigan lost three out of four games. The team closed the season with a 5â5 run to finish tied for fourth in the conference and won one game in the Big Ten Tournament before being eliminated.
