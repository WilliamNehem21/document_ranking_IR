The fifty-year rule of Vikramaditya VI, the best of the later Chalukya rulers, was an essential period in Karnataka's history and is alluded to by students of history as the "Chalukya Vikrama time". In addition to the fact that he was fruitful in controlling his amazing feudatories in the north (Kadamba Jayakesi II of Goa, Silhara Bhoja and the Yadava King) and south (Hoysala Vishnuvardhana), he effectively managed the royal Cholas whom he vanquished in the clash of Vengi in 1093 and again in 1118. He held this region for a long time notwithstanding continuous threats with the Cholas. This triumph in Vengi decreased the Chola impact in the eastern Deccan and made him ruler of domains extending from the Kaveri River in the south to the Narmada River in the north, winning him the titles "Permadideva" and "Tribhuvanamalla" (master of three universes). The researchers of his time paid him sparkling tributes for his military administration, enthusiasm for expressive arts and religious resilience. Writing multiplied and researchers in Kannada and Sanskrit embellished his court. Writer Bilhana, who moved from far away Kashmir, lauded the ruler in his outstanding work "Vikramankadeva Charita". Vikramaditya VI was a capable warrior as well as an ardent ruler as demonstrated by his various engravings that record gifts made to researchers and focuses of religion.
