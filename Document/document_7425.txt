Distinctive classifiers frequently relate to various specific things. For instance, books by and large take the classifier ÃÂ "bÃÂn", level items take ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "zhÃÂng", creatures take ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "zhÃÂ«", machines take ÃÂ "tÃÂ¡i", expansive structures and mountains take ÃÂ "zuÃÂ²", and so on. Inside these classifications are further subdivisionsÃ¢ÂÂwhile most creatures take ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "zhÃÂ«", household creatures take ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "tÃÂ³u", long and adaptable creatures take ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "tiÃÂ¡o", and ponies take ÃÂ "pÃÂ". Similarly, while long things that are adaptable, (for example, ropes) frequently take ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "tiÃÂ¡o", long things that are unbending, (for example, sticks) take ÃÂ "gÃÂn", except if they are additionally round (like pens or cigarettes), in which case in certain lingos they take ÃÂ "zhÃÂ«". Classifiers additionally fluctuate in how explicit they are; a few, (for example, ÃÂ "duÃÂ" for blooms and other likewise bunched things) are commonly just utilized with one sort, though others, (for example, ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "tiÃÂ¡o" for long and adaptable things, one-dimensional things, or unique things like news reports) are considerably less confined. Besides, there is definitely not a coordinated connection among things and classifiers: a similar thing might be matched with various classifiers in various circumstances. The particular factors that administer which classifiers are matched with which things have been a subject of discussion among language specialists.
