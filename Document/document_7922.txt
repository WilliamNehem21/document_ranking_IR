The Elba gathering of mines was somewhere in the range of 1 and 1.5 miles west of McKinley, and was generally classed with the McKinley locale mines, which incorporated the Elba and Corsica mines, and the La Belle mine, worked by the Pitt Iron Mining Company. The Minnesota Iron Company worked the Elba mine from 1898 to 1900 under the course of M. E. McCarthy. Following the arrangement of the United States Steel Corporation in 1901, Pickands Mather and Company procured the Elba and Corsica mines, expecting the mineral rents and working both after that date. Proprietors James Pickands, Samuel Mather and Jay Morse had been keen on the Corsica iron-mineral properties for quite a while, and the mines stayed on the association's delivery move for a long time. William Philip Chinn was delegated director of the Elba and adjoining Corsica mine under the new administration of Pickands Mather and Company, succeeding McCarthy. Chinn was then on his way up in mining circles, eventually getting to be general director of all Pickands Mather mining properties in the Lake Superior locale in 1918; he was prevailing as administrator of the Elba and Corsica mines by L. C. David. The Oliver Iron Mining Company likewise possessed what they assigned the "Elba No. 1 and No. 2 Reserve" metal bodies, however these were altogether not quite the same as the Elba and Corsica mines and stayed undeveloped.
