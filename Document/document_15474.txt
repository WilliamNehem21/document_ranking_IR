In the autumn of 1942, JevÄeviÄ took a radically different approach than other Chetnik leaders and spoke in favour of collaborating with the Muslims to form Muslim Chetnik units in the fight against the UstaÅ¡e and the Partisans. He favoured such tolerance in areas where the Muslims were protected by the Germans, and considered it a tactical necessity while stressing that "there can be no true unity with them". In late September or early October 1942, JevÄeviÄ and Chetnik commander Petar BaÄoviÄ held talks with Muslim leader Ismet Popovac and agreed to form a Muslim Chetnik organisation. JevÄeviÄ then urged the Italian military to occupy all of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to end UstaÅ¡e rule and claimed the support of 80 percent of the population, consisting of Serbs and Muslims. At the same time, he requested that the Germans grant autonomy to Bosnia and Herzegovina until the end of the war, citing that the Muslims were "tested friends of the Germans both in the earlier and in the present era". Although JevÄeviÄ attempted to recruit Muslims while making use of the Bosnian desire for autonomy to support his alliance with the occupying Axis powers, nothing developed from these requests.
