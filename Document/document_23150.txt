Individual "Triceratops" are estimated to have reached about 7.9 to 9.0Â m (25.9â29.5Â ft) in length, in height, and 6.1â12.0Â tonnes (13,000â26,000Â lb) in weight. The most distinctive feature is their large skull, among the largest of all land animals. The largest known skull (specimen MWC 7584, formerly BYU 12183) is estimated to have been in length when complete, and could reach almost a third of the length of the entire animal. A specimen of "T. horridus" named Kelsey measured long with a skull, stood about tall, and was estimated by the Black Hills institute to weight nearly . A "Triceratops" long has been estimated by Gregory S. Paul to have massed . It bore a single horn on the snout, above the nostrils, and a pair of horns approximately long, with one above each eye. In 2010, paleontologists revealed a fossil (named "Yoshi's Trike," MOR 3027) with horn cores, housed and displayed at the Museum of the Rockies in Montana. To the rear of the skull was a relatively short, bony frill, adorned with epoccipitals in some specimens. Most other ceratopsids had large fenestrae in their frills, while those of "Triceratops" were noticeably solid. "T. horridus" can be distinguished from "T. prorsus" by having a shallower snout.
