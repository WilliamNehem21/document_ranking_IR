Alt USÂ 40 branches from USÂ 40 near exit 14 on I-68 at Keysers Ridge. It runs parallel to I-68 through northern Garrett County as a two-lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections. The annual average daily traffic (AADT)âthat is, the number of cars that use the road per day, averaged over the course of one yearâis 1,831 at the western end of Alt USÂ 40. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 has an AADT of 14,271. Alt USÂ 40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland. The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County, and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill. The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is Negro Mountain. The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of , which is the highest point on Alt USÂ 40, and was also the highest point along the National Road. East of Negro Mountain, the highway enters Grantsville, where traffic increases, with the AADT increasing to 3,711, the highest traffic density on Alt USÂ 40 in Garrett County. In Grantsville, Alt USÂ 40 meets MDÂ 669, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 669 toward Salisbury, Pennsylvania. A short distance east of this intersection, the highway meets MDÂ 495, which junctions with I-68 and continues southward toward Oakland. East of Grantsville, Alt USÂ 40 passes over the Casselman River on a steel bridge built in 1933. Downstream from this bridge is the Casselman River Bridge State Park, centered on the stone arch bridge which originally carried the National Road over the Casselman River.
