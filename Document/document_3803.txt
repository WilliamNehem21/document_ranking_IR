In 1931, matured 19, Ferrier passed her Licentiate examinations at the Royal Academy of Music. In that year she began incidental singing exercises, and in December sang a little mezzo-soprano job in a congregation act of Mendelssohn's oratorio "Elijah". Be that as it may, her voice was not thought to be excellent; her melodic life fixated on the piano and on neighborhood shows, at King George's Hall and somewhere else. From the get-go in 1934 she exchanged to the Blackpool phone trade and took lodgings adjacent, to be near her new sweetheart, a bank agent named Albert Wilson. While at Blackpool she tried out for the new "talking clock" administration which the GPO was getting ready to present. In her energy, Ferrier embedded an additional suction into her tryout, and was not picked for the last choice in London. Her choice in 1935 to wed Wilson implied the finish of her work with the phone trade, since around then the GPO did not utilize wedded ladies. Of Ferrier's profession to this point, the music biographer Humphrey Burton expressed: "For over 10 years, when she ought to have been examining music with the best instructors, learning English writing and unknown dialects, obtaining stage art and development abilities, and venturing out to London routinely to see musical drama, Miss Ferrier was really picking up the phone, getting hitched to a bank chief and winning tinpot rivalries for her piano-playing."
