This ring structure is fundamentally the same as that of the proteins RNase PH and PNPase. In microscopic organisms, the protein RNase PH, which is engaged with tRNA handling, frames a hexameric ring comprising of six indistinguishable RNase PH proteins. On account of PNPase, which is a phosphorolytic RNA-corrupting protein found in microbes and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic creatures, two RNase PH areas, and both a S1 and KH RNA restricting space are a piece of a solitary protein, which frames a trimeric complex that embraces a structure practically indistinguishable to that of the exosome. As a result of this high comparability in both protein areas and structure, these edifices are believed to be developmentally related and have a typical progenitor. In microscopic organisms, a different RNase PH protein exists that is associated with exchange RNA handling, which has been appeared to receive a comparative six-membered ring structure, however for this situation comprising of 6 indistinguishable protein subunits. The RNase PH-like exosome proteins, PNPase and RNase PH all have a place with the RNase PH group of RNases and are phosphorolytic exoribonucleases, implying that they utilize inorganic phosphate to expel nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA atoms.
