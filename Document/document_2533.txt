After touching base in Spira, Tidus is safeguarded by Al Bhed salvagers, who talk a language that is unfamiliar to Tidus. One of them, Rikku, talks a similar language as Tidus and uncovers that Sin wrecked Zanarkand 1,000 years prior. After Sin assaults once more, Tidus is isolated from the jumpers and floats to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, commander of the neighborhood blitzball crew, and shows off his blitzball aptitudes. Wakka acquaints Tidus with Yuna, a youthful summoner going to go on a journey to acquire the Final Eon and thrashing Sin with her watchmen Lulu, a mage of dark enchantment, and Kimahri, an individual from the Ronso clan. In the mean time, Tidus joins to help Wakka in the up and coming blitzball competition to discover a path back home. The gathering makes a trip crosswise over Spira to accumulate ages, shielding against assaults by Sin and its "posterity" called Sinspawn. After the competition, they are joined by Auron, who persuades Tidus to turn into Yuna's gatekeeper. He uncovers to Tidus that Yuna's dad, Lord Braska; Tidus' dad, Jecht; and himself made a similar journey to overcome Sin ten years back. Tidus thought his dad had passed on adrift ten years sooner. Following another assault from Sin, they are joined by Rikku, later uncovered to be Yuna's cousin.
