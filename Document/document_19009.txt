As a statement against gun violence, Bullets owner Abe Pollin sought to change the franchise's name. The Bullets became the after asking fans to vote on the name. Although before the 1996â97 NBA season the Bullets/Wizards were expected to make the playoffs with Webber, Howard, and Strickland, there were rumors that Webber had difficulty adjusting to being a less important part of the offensive game plan in the presence of All-Star Howard. Howard was plagued with shin splints, causing him to miss several preseason games. On November 11, 1996, Howard failed a sobriety test when he was caught speeding and was charged with driving while intoxicated. The following month he pleaded not guilty and committed to enter an alcohol rehabilitation and education program. After Lynam coached the Bullets to a 22â24 record, he was fired and the Bullets hired Bernie Bickerstaff, who posted a 22â13 record. Over the course of the 1996â97 season, Howard accumulated 24Â doubleÂ doubles in 82Â games, while averaging 19.1Â points and 8.1Â rebounds. Although Howard averaged over 19Â points per game and played all 82Â games, he only scored 30 or more points twice during the regular season. The team finished its regular season with a 44â38 record but was swept in three games in the Eastern Conference first round by the Chicago Bulls, who went on to win their second consecutive NBA championship. The 1997 NBA Playoffs were Howard's only NBA playoff appearance in his six-plus seasons with the Washington franchise, and he averaged 18.7Â points and 6Â rebounds while playing 43Â minutes per game. The playoff appearance marked the franchise's first playoff appearance since the 1988 NBA Playoffs.
