The saxaul sparrow was first described by English zoologist John Gould in a March 1872 instalment of "The Birds of Asia", from a specimen collected near Kyzylorda, now in southern Kazakhstan, by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov. Severtzov had been planning to describe the species as "Passer ammodendri" for several years and had been distributing specimens among other naturalists. When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the Paris Commune in 1871 with some of his collection, Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the Zoological Society of London. Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873, and some later writers preferred to attribute him, but Gould's description takes priority over Severtzov's. The saxaul sparrow's species name refers to its desert habitat, coming from the name of the "Ammodendron" or sand acacia tree, which is in turn derived from the Ancient Greek "Î¬Î¼Î¼Î¿Ï" ("ammos", "sand") and "Î´Î­Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Î½" ("dendron", "tree"). The English name "saxaul sparrow" refers to the saxaul plant, with which it is closely associated. The saxaul sparrow usually is classified in the genus "Passer" with the house sparrow and around twenty other species, although a genus "Ammopasser" was created for the saxaul sparrow by Nikolai Zarudny in 1890.
