In late July 1983, Metallica set out on the two-month Kill Them All for One visit with British co-main events Raven. The visit name merged the titles of the collections the two groups were advancing: Metallica's "Slaughter Them All" and Raven's "Totally supportive of One", both discharged on Megaforce. The two gatherings met in Zazula's home two days before the visit started, and went in a similar vehicle all through the visit with five roadies and sound architect Whitaker. The visit was set to finish up with three shows in San Francisco, accordingly Hetfield painted "No Life 'til Frisco" on the Winnebago visit transport. The visit had a couple of ineffectively gone to gigs, for example, an execution at the Cheers club in Babylon, New York, gone to by somewhere in the range of 50 individuals. After the finish of Kill Them All for One toward the beginning of September, Metallica came back to El Cerrito to chip away at new material. Seven weeks after the visit finished, Metallica booked various exhibitions at Bay Area clubs, the initial a Halloween gig at the Keystone in Palo Alto. At the Country Club in Reseda, the gathering appeared "Battle Fire with Fire" and "Crawling Death", alongside an early form of "The Call of Ktulu", at that point titled "When pigs fly". After three days, at a gig at The Stone in San Francisco, Metallica debuted "Ride the Lightning", the title track from the up and coming collection. In December, Metallica went on a short visit in the Midwest and eastern United States with a three-man street group: Whitaker, guitar professional John Marshall, and drum specialist Dave Marrs. The January 14, 1984 show in Boston was dropped on the grounds that the band's gear was stolen the prior night.
