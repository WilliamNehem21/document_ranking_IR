Towards the finish of the amusement, Naija finds that the majority of the demolished civic establishments she has found all through the diversion were devastated by a divine being, "the Creator", who was desirous of the rising intensity of that human progress or of their divine beings. The amazing beasts she has found and vanquished in every district were before the divine forces of that human advancement. Every one of these developments had an interesting force, symbolized by the structure that Naija learns in the wake of crushing their previous divine beings. Alongside Li, a human jumper from the land she meets at the highest point of the sea, Naija then plummets to the base of the ocean to stand up to the god. There she finds that the Creator fell into the sea as a youngster, and reinforced with an antiquated soul to pick up god-like forces. He at that point made Aquaria, stringing a section of a children's song his mom had sung to him all through, the main piece of the tune he recollects. The tune of this tune, the "refrain", is the thing that permits Naija to sing tunes that influence her general surroundings; portions of the tune can be heard in various structures in the melodies inside the amusement's soundtrack.
