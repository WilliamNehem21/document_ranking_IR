The reason for marriage between the medieval elites was to verify land. Young ladies were hitched in their teenagers, yet young men did not wed until they grew up. There is a mainstream origination that ladies assumed a fringe job in the medieval stronghold family unit, and that it was commanded by the master himself. This gets from the picture of the chÃÂ¢teau as a military organization, yet most manors in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never engaged with clashes or attacks, so the residential life is an ignored aspect. The woman was given a dower of her better half's estatesÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ generally about a thirdÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ which was hers forever, and her significant other would acquire on her demise. It was her obligation to oversee them straightforwardly, as the ruler directed his own property. Notwithstanding for the most part being prohibited from military administration, a lady could be accountable for a mansion, either for her better half or on the off chance that she was bereaved. As a result of their impact inside the medieval family, ladies affected development and structure, now and then through direct support; antiquarian Charles Coulson stresses the job of ladies in applying "a refined privileged taste" to mansions because of their long haul home.
