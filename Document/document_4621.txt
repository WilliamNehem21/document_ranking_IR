With York 21st in the table after a nine-coordinate keep running without a class win, Wilcox was rejected in October 2015. He was prevailing in November 2015 by the previous Dundee United chief Jackie McNamara. York won just another five matches in 2015Ã¢ÂÂ 16, and were consigned to the National League in base spot. This proclaimed the finish of a four-year return in the Football League, and Dave Flett of "The Press" contended that McNamara would "dependably be considered most responsible for the second-most exceedingly awful battle, focuses insightful, in the club's 94-year history". In October 2016, Gary Mills returned as chief, soon after his rejection by Wrexham. York were nineteenth in the table, in the wake of beginning 2016Ã¢ÂÂ 17 with just three successes from 15 matches. They spent a great part of the coming a very long time in the transfer zone, before Mills' revamped squad went on a keep running of six successes from nine matches to be over the assignment zone with three apparatuses remaining. Be that as it may, York were consigned to the National League North out of the blue on the most recent day of the period, after a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 2 home draw with Forest Green Rovers. They completed in 21st spot, one point from security. In any case, York won the FA Trophy for the second time in 2016Ã¢ÂÂ 17, beating Macclesfield Town 3Ã¢ÂÂ 2 at Wembley Stadium in the 2017 last.
