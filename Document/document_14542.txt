Brigitte FranÃÂ§ois-Sappey calls attention to the recurrence with which Alkan has been contrasted with Berlioz, both by his peers and later. She specifies that Hans von BÃÂ¼low called him "the Berlioz of the piano", while Schumann, in reprimanding the Op. 15 "Sentiments", asserted that Alkan only "imitated Berlioz on the piano." She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni rehashed the examination with Berlioz in a draft (however unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji remarked that Alkan's Op. 61 "Sonatine" resembled "a Beethoven sonata composed by Berlioz". Berlioz was ten years more seasoned than Alkan, yet did not go to the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were familiar, and were maybe both impacted by the uncommon thoughts and style of Anton Reicha who educated at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the writers of the time of the French Revolution. They both made individual, to be sure, particular sound-universes in their music; there are, in any case, real contrasts between them. Alkan, in contrast to Berlioz, remained firmly devoted to the German melodic custom; his style and organization were vigorously controlled by his pianism, though Berlioz could barely play at the console and composed nothing for piano solo. Alkan's works accordingly additionally incorporate miniatures and (among his initial works) "salon" music, classes which Berlioz stayed away from.
