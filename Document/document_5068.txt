On 10 October 1872 at St Mary's Church, Balmain Selfe wedded Emily Ann Booth, the girl of John Booth, an outstanding shipbuilder and Balmain's first city hall leader (and some time ago the part for East Macquarie in the provincial parliament). They lived for a long time at "Rockleigh" in Donnelly Street, Balmain, a house that has since been crushed. In 1884 their first little girl Rhoda Jane was conceived, trailed by a stillborn little girl in 1886, and after that Norma Catherine in 1888. In 1885 Selfe purchased land in Ashfield and structured an excellent house called "Amesbury". Depicted at the time as having "a greater number of oddities both remotely and inside than some other house in the state" including earthenware lyrebird reliefs by craftsman Lucien Henry on the front divider, and a pinnacle reason worked for Selfe to seek after his pastime of stargazing. Worked around 1888 to respect the centennial of the province, "Amesbury" still stands at 78 Alt Street and was utilized by Brahma Kumaris from 1986 as its Australian home office until 2014 when it was sold for over $3.5 million. As kids, Rhoda and Norma went to their Aunt Maybanke's school in Dulwich Hill. As grown-ups, they prepared in Italy with instructor Maria Montessori and came back to Sydney to open their very own Montessori school in the structure known as "Warwick" on Bland Street, Ashfield.
