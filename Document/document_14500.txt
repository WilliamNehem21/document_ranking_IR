Prior to undertaking any moves against Constantinople, Vatatzes understood the need to settle issues with Thessalonica, and specifically with Theodore, whose aspiration, ability, and ruses he dreaded. In 1240 or 1241 he in this manner issued a welcome, with affirmations of safe-direct, to Theodore to visit Nicaea. Theodore acknowledged, and was treated with amazing privileges by Vatatzes, who conceded to him as his "uncle" and ate with him at a similar table. Truly, Theodore was a detainee in Nicaea; he was not permitted to leave, and all through his stay in the Nicaean court, arrangements were going all out for a battle against Thessalonica. In spring 1242, Vatatzes traversed into Europe at the leader of his military, with Theodore going with him as a privileged detainee. Confronting no opposition, the Nicaean armed force and armada landed before Thessalonica. The city's battalion and occupants opposed with progress and the Nicaean armed force, lacking substantial attack gear, needed to make due with a drawn-out barricade. Before long, be that as it may, news touched base of a Mongol intrusion of Asia Minor, which constrained Vatatzes to sever the battle and come back to Nicaea. By the by, the Nicaean sovereign kept this news a mystery, and sent Theodore to his child to arrange. John himself supposedly was happy to surrender the city inside and out, however his dad persuaded him to wait for better terms. At last, following 40 days of arrangements, John was permitted to keep control of Thessalonica, yet repudiated his royal title and acknowledged Nicaean suzerainty and the title of Despot. Theodore was additionally permitted to stay at Thessalonica at his child's side.
