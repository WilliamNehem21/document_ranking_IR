Ross at first observed the character as simple to play, calling her "everybody's closest companion, and the town specialist, and an extraordinary mother". The performer had an increasingly troublesome time when Eve started carrying on in ethically sketchy approaches to ensure mysteries about her past. She felt that the adjustment in Eve's character made the job testing on a passionate dimension, contrasting the involvement with "getting a correctional facility sentence and you're relied upon to oblige it with no clarification" or "the divine beings upsetting someone with no reason yet to disturb them". At the point when requested to depict Eve in three words, Ross reacted that she was an "inconsistency inside a puzzle". Playing Eve, she stated, was "as though someone came and disclosed to you that your dearest companion is doing evil things".

She later associated Eve's disgrace of her previous existence with Julian and failure to reveal to her family to Lavinia Kingsley's disappointments about her childhood in the 2002 parody film "The Banger Sisters".
