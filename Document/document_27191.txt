In November 2015, Night Dive Studios, after acquiring the rights to the "System Shock" franchise, stated they are considering developing a third title in the series. In December 2015, OtherSide Entertainment, a studio founded by former Looking Glass Studios designer Paul Neurath, announced they were developing "System Shock 3" with rights granted to them by Night Dive Studios. OtherSide had acquired rights to make sequels to "System Shock" some years before this point but did not have the rights to the series name, which Night Dive was able to provide. The sequel will feature Terri Brosius reprising her voice for SHODAN, and will include work from original "System Shock" concept artist Robb Waters. Warren Spector, the producer of the first "System Shock", announced in February 2016 that he has joined OtherSide Entertainment and will be working on "System Shock 3". According to Spector, the narrative will pick up immediately from the end of "System Shock 2", with SHODAN having taken over Rebecca's body. Starbreeze Studios is providing a $12 million "publishing-only" investment in "System Shock 3", allowing OtherSide to retain all rights while seeking a 120% return on investment followed by equal shares of revenue splitting. Starbreeze's investment will allow the game to be developed for consoles in addition to the planned personal computer versions. However, in the wake of several financial problems in late 2018, Starbreeze has given back the publishing rights to "System Shock 3" to OtherSide, and separated itself from the project. "System Shock 3" will use the Unity game engine, with a teaser shown during Unity's press event at the 2019 Game Developers Conference.
