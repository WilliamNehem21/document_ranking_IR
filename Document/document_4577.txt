Jeffrey Jerome Cohen recommends that the story is about racial contrast, and "permits William to compose at a slant about the Welsh": the green youngsters are a memory of England's past and the fierce triumph of the indigenous Britons by the Anglo-Saxons pursued by the Norman attack. William of Newburgh reluctantly incorporates the tale of the green kids in his record of a to a great extent brought together England, which Cohen compares with Geoffrey of Monmouth's "The History of the Kings of Britain", a book that as indicated by William is loaded with "spouting and unrestricted lying". Geoffrey's history offers records of past rulers and kingdoms of different racial personalities, though William's England is one in which all people groups are either acclimatized or pushed to the limits. As indicated by Cohen, the green youngsters speak to a double interruption into William's bound together vision of England. On one hand they are a notice of the racial and social contrasts among Normans and Anglo-Saxons, given the kids' case to have originated from St Martin's Land, named after Martin of Tours; the main other time William specifies that holy person is in reference to in Hastings, which recognizes the Norman triumph in 1066. In any case, the kids additionally typify the prior occupants of the British Isles, the "Welsh (and Irish and Scots) who [had been] coercively anglicizedÃÂ ... The Green Children restore another story that William had been unfit to advise, one in which English paninsular territory turns into a grieved presumption instead of an inevitable end product." The kid specifically, who bites the dust as opposed to progress toward becoming acclimatized, speaks to "an adjoining world that can't be annexedÃÂ ... an otherness that will die to persevere".
