The primary full account of "Rinaldo" (an "extracts" plate had gone before it by two years) was made in 1977 by CBS, with Carolyn Watkinson in the title job, Ileana CotrubaÃÂ as Almirena, and Jean-Claude Malgoire directing La Grande ÃÂcurie et la Chambre du Roy. The work, recorded in a Paris church, depended on the 1711 score; Alan Blyth in "Gramophone" lauded the standard of the singing, and regardless of doubts about the sound quality, called it a standout amongst the most agreeable of accessible Handel musical show chronicles. There was no further chronicle of "Rinaldo" accessible until 1990, when John Fisher's intensely cut rendition from La Fenice was issued. One more decade go before the presence of Christopher Hogwood's 1999 Decca recording, again dependent on the first score, with the countertenor David Daniels as Rinaldo, Cecilia Bartoli as Almirena and Catherine Bott in the little piece of First Mermaid. "Gramophone's" analyst called this issue "a treat for Handel sweethearts Ã¢ÂÂ an uncommon account of one of the writer's most extravagant musical shows, with a solid and starry cast". From that point forward a few additional forms have been influenced accessible: To harry Bicket's 2001 chronicle for Arthaus, which was later issued as a DVD; RenÃÂ© Jacobs with the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra for Harmonia Mundi in 2001; and an execution by the Aradia Ensemble under Kevin Mallon, recorded in 2004 and issued under the Naxos name in 2005.
