"Galerina marginata" may be mistaken for a few edible mushroom species. "Pholiota mutabilis" (Kuehneromyces mutabilis) produces fruit bodies roughly similar in appearance and also grows on wood, but may be distinguished from "G.Â marginata" by its stems bearing scales up to the level of the ring, and from growing in large clusters (which is not usual of "G.Â marginata"). However, the possibility of confusion is such that this good edible species is "not recommended to those lacking considerable experience in the identification of higher fungi." Furthermore, microscopic examination shows smooth spores in "Pholiota". "G.Â marginata" may be easily confused with other edibles such as "Armillaria mellea" and "Kuehneromyces mutabilis". Regarding the latter species, one source notes "Often, "G.Â marginata" bears an astonishing resemblance to this fungus, and it requires careful and acute powers of observation to distinguish the poisonous one from the edible one." "K.Â mutabilis" may be distinguished by the presence of scales on the stem below the ring, the larger cap, which may reach a diameter of , and spicy or aromatic odor of the flesh. The related "K.Â vernalis" is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to "G.Â marginata". Examination of microscopic characteristics is typically required to reliably distinguish between the two, revealing smooth spores with a germ pore.
