Looking into the Western Australian Art Society's display in 1906, the commentator for Perth's "Western Mail" believed Fuller's attempts to be the best on show, and that "the event gives another triumph to Miss Fuller". In 1914, it was accounted for that Fuller was spoken to in four open displaysÃ¢ÂÂthree in Australia and one in South AfricaÃ¢ÂÂa record for an Australian lady painter around then. However despite the fact that she encountered extensive accomplishment amid her initial life, Fuller thusly turned out to be practically undetectable. No tribute showed up in the papers in 1946. She isn't referenced at all in Janine Burke's "Australian Women Artists 1840Ã¢ÂÂ 1940", Max Germaine's "Word reference of Women Artists in Australia", nor Caroline Ambrus' "Australian Women Artists". Anyway her work visited with the Completing the image: ladies specialists and the Heidelberg period presentation in 1992-1993 and furthermore was examined in detail and represented in Janda Gooding's "Western Australian craftsmanship and craftsmen, 1900-1950" display and distribution. In 2013, Ann Gray depicted Fuller as "a vital Australian lady craftsman and seemingly Western Australia's most huge craftsman from the Federation time frame". Works by Fuller are held by the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the City of Perth, the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia's National Portrait Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the State Library of Victoria. Universally, her work is held by the Newport Museum and Art Gallery in South Wales.
