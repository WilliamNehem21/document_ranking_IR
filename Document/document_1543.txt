Developed on a regional limit in about 600ÃÂ BC, the primary slope fortress at Maiden Castle was a zone encompassed by a solitary dump. The slope it sits on is a piece of an edge on the north side of the South Winterborne valley, which bolsters the River Frome. At the eastern end of the edge and transcending ocean level, the site of the primary slope fortress was not the most elevated point along the edge. The most astounding point is the neighboring Hog Hill, which is just higher. The slope extends about over the encompassing farmland, which is about above ocean level. The safeguards were high and comprised of the V-formed discard and a defense. The defense would presumably have been timber-looked around simply the passageways. Expand timber confronting would have been utilized to inspire guests. The site could be gotten to by a passageway in the northwest and a twofold passage in the east. The twofold passage is one of a kind in slope strongholds in the British Isles. The explanation behind a twofold passageway is misty; be that as it may, excavator Niall Sharples has proposed that it was a type of isolation. Almost certainly, a few cultivating networks lived in the slope fortress and needed diverse passageways.
