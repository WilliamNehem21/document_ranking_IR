Dark colored missed determination for the visit opener against WorcestershireÃ¢ÂÂin which Australia generally handled its first-decision XIÃ¢ÂÂbefore making his introduction in the second match against Leicestershire. He made a century against Cambridge University in his second visit coordinate, making 105 in the center request. Batting at numberÃÂ 3 against Lancashire in the last visit coordinate before the Tests, Brown scored 119. Subsequent to aggregating 351 keeps running at 43.88 in the opening visit matches, he was chosen for the Test side. Playing in each of the five Tests, Brown made his introduction at Trent Bridge, Nottingham and scored 22 in his first innings. After Australia lost three early wickets in the second innings, Brown scored 73 to help secure a triumphant lead. Dark colored at that point made a century while opening the batting against Northamptonshire, and an unbeaten 62 in the second innings, directing Australia to an eight-wicket triumph over the Gentlemen of England. He was elevated to open in the Second Test at Lord's with Woodfull, after Ponsford was inaccessible because of disease. At the home of cricket, Brown made his lady Test century, scoring 105 in the primary innings. His innings was an unhurried one; he would in general trust that the ball will go onto the bat as opposed to assaulting the calfskin. Be that as it may, he was unfit to keep Australia from being compelled to pursue on and made two; the match finished in an innings rout. He was held as opener upon Ponsford's arrival for the Third Test, with Woodfull dropping down the request in a reshuffled batting line-up. Dark colored made 72 and a duck. The match finished in a draw after the two groups passed 490 in the main innings.
