A few productions did not concur with the positive gathering of the story; Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com noticed that while "Myst"s absence of communication and persistent plot fit the amusement, it helped introduce the passing of the experience diversion sort. "Edge" expressed the primary defect with the diversion was that the amusement motor was not even close as complex as the designs. Heidi Fournier of "Experience Gamers" noticed a couple of pundits griped about the trouble and absence of setting of the riddles, while others trusted these components added to the ongoing interaction.

In 1996 "People to come" called it "gaming's most depressing hour", saying the static illustrations and simply experimentation confounds typified poor amusement plan. They said "Myst"s business achievement, which they owed mainly to its ubiquity among non-gamers as a CD-ROM grandstand, had prompted numerous different amusements copying its negative angles. In a 2000 review audit, IGN announced that "Myst" had not matured well and that playing it "resembled watching hit TV appears from the 70s. 'Individuals watched that?,' you wonder with dismay."
