This species assembles its coasting home in the normally shallow water of open lakes. The home itself is moored to the lake by plants. It is worked by both the male and female and made out of plant matter. Its majority is submerged, with the base of the shallow glass more often than not being level with the water. Over the glass, there is a level circle. This grebe homes both in provinces and independent from anyone else. When it doesn't settle without anyone else's input, it will regularly settle in blended species states that are comprised of flying creatures, for example, dark headed gulls, ducks, and different waterbirds. The space between the homes in these settlements is regularly . Regardless of whether it settles in provinces or not affects the components of the home. At the point when the feathered creature isn't in a province, the home has a normal distance across of , despite the fact that this can fluctuate, with homes extending from going to over . This is contrasted with homes in states, which have a normal distance across of about . It is proposed that once in a while a few sets of this grebe will steward over various homes when in states.
