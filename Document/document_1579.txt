Kieswetter's sure and assaulting batting style was contrasted with that of Kevin Pietersen, another England batsman of South African starting point. In spite of the fact that Kieswetter favored the off-side, he was likewise solid behind square on the two sides, and remained with a regular South African position, his bat held high. He played with what "Wisden" depicted as an "alluring, uncomplicated front-foot system". He started his profession playing before his stumps, yet once bowlers had worked out his strategy, he moved his batting position to outside the leg stump to give himself more space to drive the ball. This move had some accomplishment on level subcontinental pitches, yet was less successful in England, where the ball would in general alter course more. Kieswetter conceded that the change had not worked, saying that "I wasn't generally moving my feet. I was staying leg-side and playing with my hands. My system simply wasn't sufficiently able to adapt." After being dropped by England, Kieswetter dealt with his batting, which had been portrayed by Steve James as a "free for all at the wrinkle, as hyper as an adolescent on a night out". He moved back before his stumps, and kept up a more settled attitude, intending to develop an innings.
