Choosing to return to the assault storyline in 2007, Carlivati composed a story in which Marty is tossed from a van amid a fender bender soon thereafter. The van detonates, and she is assumed dead. In June 2008, Todd finds her alive, and finds that she is harassed with amnesia and has been disabled since the accident. He begins to nurture her back to wellbeing, misleading her about her character and her significance to her loved ones, and he begins to create sentimental affections for her. ABC advanced the storyline via airing promotions that called it, "The story you thought you'd never observe". Carlivati safeguarded the storyline by guaranteeing the crowd, who was worried about and opposed the storyline, that it would not have been composed if Marty had not lost her recollections. He expressed that he knew about how genuine it was matching the characters impractically, yet did not feel like they were harming Marty's character. Carlivati was focused on having the storyline advance gradually, and to utilizing the performing artists' and characters' science. Inevitably, Todd and Marty engage in sexual relations; Todd demands that he has dependably been enamored with Marty and plots to take his girl's child (who is likewise Marty's grandkid), keep running off with Marty and the infant, and raise the infant with her.
