William Dickson Boyce (June 16, 1858ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ June 11, 1929) was an American paper man, business visionary, magazine distributer, and adventurer. He was the organizer of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and the fleeting Lone Scouts of America (LSA). Conceived in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, he gained an adoration for the outside right off the bat in his life. In the wake of filling in as a teacher and a coal digger, Boyce went to Wooster Academy in Ohio before moving to the Midwest and Canada. A sharp businessperson, Boyce effectively settled a few papers, for example, "The Commercial" in Winnipeg, Manitoba and the "Lisbon Clipper" in Lisbon, North Dakota. With his first spouse, Mary Jane Beacom, he moved to Chicago to seek after his innovative desire. There he built up the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company and the week after week "Saturday Blade", which obliged a country gathering of people and was disseminated by a great many paper young men. With his novel work of newsies to help paper deals, Boyce's namesake distributing organization kept up a course of 500,000ÃÂ copies every week by 1894. Boyce unequivocally upheld laborer rights, as shown by his organizations' help of trade guilds and his anxiety for his newsies' prosperity.
