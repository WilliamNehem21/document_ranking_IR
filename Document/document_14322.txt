While the enactment was all the while pending in Congress, on January 29, 1921, Senator Spencer kept in touch with Charles Moore, administrator of the Commission of Fine Arts, in regards to the bill. Moore answered on February 2, informing that one concerning the couple of American artists fit for planning a coin be contracted, and that the subsequent work be exposed to the neighborly analysis of different specialists. Spencer put James Montgomery, executive of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in contact with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made a few proposition for the plan, including a "prairie-schoonerÃÂ ... second, the heads of [pioneer Daniel] Boone and [early Missouri government official Thomas Hart] Benton; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westbound". The contracted stone carver could pick among these ideas, Moore proposed, and choose which could be utilized to best impact, with Montgomery's endorsement and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery answered on February 16, proposing a "standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin top, deer skin garments, with an Indian sitting at his feet, the Missouri River streaming in front, with the feigns on inverse side, with one star with the figures '24' in focal point of star. This would imply first, that the white man had superseded the Indian in Missouri Territory."
