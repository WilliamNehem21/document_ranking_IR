American paddlefish populaces have declined significantly, principally because of overfishing and living space annihilation. In 2004 they were recorded as Vulnerable (VU A3de ver 3.1) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They are as of now proposed for posting as VU 3de all through their range as the consequence of a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service appraisal. The appraisal presumed that "a general populace measure decrease of in any event 30% may happen inside the following 10 years or three ages because of genuine or potential dimensions of abuse and the impacts of presented taxa, contaminations, contenders or parasites." American paddlefish are channel bolstering pelagic fish that require vast, free-streaming waterways with plaited channels, backwater regions, oxbow lakes that are wealthy in zooplankton, and rock bars for bringing forth. Arrangement of dams on streams, for example, those built on the Missouri River have seized vast populaces of American paddlefish, and hindered their upstream relocation to bringing forth reefs. Channelization and crotches or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of waterways and adjusted stream, obliterating critical producing and nursery natural surroundings. Thus, most seized populaces are not self-supporting and should be loaded to keep up a feasible game fishery.
