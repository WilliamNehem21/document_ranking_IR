On 11 August 1910, American scientist Barnum Brown found the remaining parts of a substantial gathering of "Albertosaurus" at another quarry close by the Red Deer River. In light of the expansive number of bones and the restricted time accessible, Brown's gathering did not gather each example, yet made a point to gather stays from the majority of the people that they could distinguish in the bonebed. Among the bones kept in the American Museum of Natural History accumulations in New York City are seven arrangements of right metatarsals, alongside two detached toe bones that did not coordinate any of the metatarsals in size. This showed the nearness of no less than nine people in the quarry. Scientist Philip J. Currie of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and continued hands on work at the site, which is presently situated inside Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park. Further uncovering from 1997 to 2005 turned up the remaining parts of 13 additional people of different ages, including a humble two-year-old and an old individual evaluated at over long. None of these people are known from complete skeletons, and most are spoken to by stays in the two historical centers. Unearthings proceeded until 2008, when the base number of people present had been built up at 12, based on safeguarded components that happen just once in a skeleton, and at 26 whenever reflected components were included while contrasting in size because of ontogeny. An aggregate of 1,128 "Albertosaurus" bones had been verified, the biggest centralization of vast theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous.
