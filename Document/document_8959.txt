Doubleday was again called upon when, somewhere in the range of 1850 and 1855, the exhibition hall got dirt tablets from unearthings in Babylonia and Assyria. Some were ineffectively bundled and had created crystalline stores rendering the composition indecipherable. Under the heading of Samuel Birch, at that point the manager of the Department of Oriental Antiquities, Doubleday endeavored to expel the stores. The outcomes were depicted by E. A. Wallis Budge, previous attendant of Egyptian and Assyrian relics at the exhibition hall, as "grievous", yet by present day thinking as "perceptive", for however ineffective, the fundamental strategies were along these lines refined by others. Doubleday first endeavored to solidify the tablets by terminating them, yet this brought about the chipping of the surfaces, annihilating the engravings. His second endeavor, submerging the tablets in arrangements, likewise brought about deterioration, so, all in all Birch suspended the endeavors altogether. Later endeavors by different conservators in terminating comparable tablets were increasingly fruitful; standard acknowledgment today is more tempered by worries about reversibility than by worries about viability. Doubleday is viewed as the innovator of this strategy, and his disappointments may have been brought about by raising or bringing down the temperature too rapidly.
