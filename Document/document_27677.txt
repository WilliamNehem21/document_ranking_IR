"Xeromphalina setulipes" has smooth, ellipsoid to somewhat cylindrical spores that measure from 5.0 to 7.3 micrometres (Î¼m) by 2.9 to 3.7Â Î¼m. They are amyloid, meaning that they stain a dark colour in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution, and have thin cell walls. The four-spored (occasionally two-spored) basidia are shaped like narrow clubs, sometimes approaching cylindrical, and measure between 21 and 30Â Î¼m long by 4.5 to 5.5Â Î¼m wide. The sterigmata, the narrow prongs that connect the spores to the basidia, can measure up to 3Â Î¼m in length. The edge of the gill is primarily made up of cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) but there are also some basidia. The hyaline (translucent) cheilocystidia have an irregular, sometimes vaguely cylindrical shape, and measure between 30 and 80Â Î¼m by 3 to 7Â Î¼m. They are packed together, extending outwards from the gill in a manner reminiscent of coral, as is sometimes seen in members of the genus "Mycena". The abundant caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) project prominently, and are visible to the naked eye as the minute hairs on the stem. They measure between 30 and 60Â Î¼m by 5 to 10Â Î¼m. They are swollen in the middle, tapering at each end, but are irregular in shape and are often curved. The particularly thick cell walls can be as much as 2.5Â Î¼m wide. The caulocystidia are yellowish-brown. There are a large number of circumcystidia (cystidia found on the margin of the cap), which are similar to the cheilocystidia. They typically have thick cell walls, and numerous projections of various sorts grow from their sides. The circumcystidia form a mass reminiscent of coral.
