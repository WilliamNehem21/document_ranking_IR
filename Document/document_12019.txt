In January 1854, Douglas acquainted the KansasÃ¢ÂÂ Nebraska Act with sort out the Nebraska Territory. Southerners had upset his past endeavors to sort out the domain since Nebraska lay north of parallel 36ÃÂ°30' north, the line isolating slave and free region under the Missouri Compromise. They expected that the domain would be sorted out into new free expresses that would cast a ballot against the South on subjugation issues. The KansasÃ¢ÂÂ Nebraska Act enabled the region's pilgrims to choose whether or not to allow bondage, a verifiable nullification of the Missouri Compromise. Kentucky Senator Archibald Dixon's revision to make the annulment unequivocal infuriated northern Democrats, yet Breckinridge trusted it would move the servitude issue from national to nearby governmental issues, and he asked Pierce to help it. Breckinridge kept in touch with his uncle Robert that he "had more to do than any man here, in putting [the Act] in its present shape", yet Heck noticed that couple of surviving records bolster this case. The annulment change made the demonstration increasingly satisfactory toward the South; just 9 of 58 Southern congressmen casted a ballot against it. No Northern Whigs voted in favor of the measure, yet 44 of 86 Northern Democrats casted a ballot in the positive, enough to pass it. The Senate immediately agreed, and Pierce marked the demonstration into law on May 30, 1854.
