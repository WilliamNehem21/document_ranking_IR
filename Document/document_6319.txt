One of the general population to whom Jenner suggested his conversation starter was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton wound up distracted with the memory of this gathering for a while a while later and, the following year, turned into a submitted Christian. Stanton went on to establish the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner drew nearer Norrie Jeffs, who had quite recently come back from taking an interest in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his inquiry, Jeffs reacted that he was at that point a Christian. Jenner at that point welcomed Jeffs over to his home, where Jeffs met a few different guests, including the lady who might later turn into his significant other. In 1952, someone else Jenner hailed with his inquiry on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. Subsequent to having a concise discussion with Jenner, Boyden acknowledged Jenner's welcome to go to a chapel gathering at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he reacted to the lesson by focusing on living as a Christian thenceforward, which he accomplished for something like fifty years. Numerous other individuals who had a short experience with Jenner in the city in Sydney likewise progressed toward becoming Christians, yet Jenner did not understand that any of the general population he confronted had remained a Christian past their underlying calling of confidence until 1953, when Francis Dixon revealed to him the narratives of a few such individuals.
