Hemingway researchers think the work is more confused and imperative than a quick read recommends. With the production of "Valid at First Light" faultfinders saw a progressively others conscious and sympathetic Hemingway, and started to move their accentuation far from the picture of the "white man with a weapon." Robert Fleming considers "Valid at First Light" to be a piece of the Hemingway group announcing, "This is a more convoluted book than it has all the earmarks of being, and Hemingway merits unmistakably more credit for it than the commentators of the famous press have given it. Genuine faultfinders managing the late works would be prompted not to disregard it". Gadjusek acclaims the exposition style, which he says is another bearing in Hemingway's composition; he likewise accepts, in spite of the altering, the book is strong and entire with very much arranged topics. Burwell considers the alters to the composition for the most part well-done, however she regrets misfortunes that she supposes add to a portion of the subtexts in the book. Biographer Kenneth Lynn condemned Hemingway's children for altering the composition yet of Hemingway he says the "memoirist is by and large absolutely, without a doubt vulnerably legitimate," and Gray surrenders the production of the book "underscores Hemingway's strength as an author". In spite of what he thinks about poor workmanship in the book, Wood considers Hemingway even at the very least a convincing essayist and he says the artistic domain ought to be disregarded to spare the abstract impact.
