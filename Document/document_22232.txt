Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend BÃ©la BartÃ³k. The first piece BartÃ³k dedicated to him was the [[Rhapsody No. 1 (BartÃ³k)|First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra]] (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to [[ZoltÃ¡n SzÃ©kely]].) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist [[Benny Goodman]] teamed up to commission a trio from BartÃ³k: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78Â rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement "[[Contrasts (BartÃ³k)|Contrasts]]" for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and BartÃ³k had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, BartÃ³k's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience. Szigeti came to his friend's aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for BartÃ³k's medical treatment, and then, together with conductor and compatriot [[Fritz Reiner]], persuaded [[Serge Koussevitzky]] to commission from BartÃ³k what eventually became his much-beloved [[Concerto for Orchestra (BartÃ³k)|Concerto for Orchestra]]. The work's success brought BartÃ³k some measure of financial security and provided him with a much-needed emotional boost.
