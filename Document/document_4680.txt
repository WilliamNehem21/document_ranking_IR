Despite the fact that Sakic was a calm individual, he had the capacity to rouse his group to play at more elevated amounts, which earned him the regard of his friends and administrators. The primary indications of Sakic's authority started to appear while still an individual from the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the transport crash that murdered four of his partners, Sakic was viewed as the pioneer of the group, recognizing that the experience changed his point of view. From the get-go in his vocation with the Nordiques (when Mike Hough was still chief), with the group planning to revamp around their top draft pick Eric Lindros, and clutching Lindros' rights for the season when he would not sign, Sakic recommended that the group could advance without Lindros, saying, "We just need players here who have the energy to play the diversion. I'm worn out on hearing that name. He's not all over are a ton of others in this storage space who truly care about the amusement." Lindros was exchanged a year later, acquiring various quality players, which inconceivably improved the Nordiques. Sakic's administration characteristics drove him to be sought by different groups, for example, in the mid year of 1997, when the New York Rangers offered him a huge contract so as to supplant withdrew commander Mark Messier, however the Avalanche at last coordinated the offer and held Sakic.
