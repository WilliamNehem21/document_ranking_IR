Baradwaj Rangan, writing for "The Hindu", said without a human protagonist, only a villain and a heroine, the audience is "led through a story that's funny, sentimental, action-packed, romanticâthere's even a bit of the occult thrown in". Also for "The Hindu", Malathi Rangarajan wrote, "Let's celebrate the figment of [Rajamouli's] imagination that has made the housefly appear as invincible as any of our muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of "The Telegraph" called the film "a winner from the first frame to the last" and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept anything that he throws at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called "Eega" the "best, most insane, most inventive film of the year", and praised Rajamouli's scripting, the visual effects and Sudeep's performance, calling the latter "legitimately hilarious". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave "Eega" four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from Sify called "Eega" an "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" that "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".
