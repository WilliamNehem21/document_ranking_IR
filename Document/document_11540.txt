Anticipating that the Japanese should assault again that night, Edson guided his troops to improve their protections close by the edge. After a fizzled endeavor by two organizations to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to Kokusho the prior night, Edson repositioned his powers. He dismantled his front back going to a line that extended , beginning at the Lunga River and intersection the edge about south of Hill 123. Around and behind Hill 123 he set five organizations. Any Japanese assailants surmounting Hill 80 would need to progress over of open landscape to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123. With just a couple of hours to set up, the Marines had the capacity to develop just simple and shallow fortresses. They were low on ammo, with a couple of projectiles for every Marine. Vandegrift requested a save drive comprising of the second Battalion, fifth Marine Regiment (2/5) to move into a position just to the back of Edson's troops. Moreover, a battery of four 105mm howitzers from the third Battalion, eleventh Marine Regiment under Lieutenant colonel James J. Keating moved to an area from where it could give direct fire onto the edge, and a forward big guns eyewitness was put with Edson's bleeding edge units.
