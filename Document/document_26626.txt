Johannes Brahms, in his ' (A German Requiem), had already opened the way for the composition of a non-liturgical "Requiem", written in a language other than Latin while still addressing the traditional theme of rest ("requies") for the dead. In this tradition, Reger's 1915 "Requiem", , is also not a setting of the Requiem in Latin, but of Hebbel's poem. He composed it in Jena, a year before his own death, this time for a solo voice (alto or baritone), chorus and orchestra. The "Requiem", , was combined with ' (The Hermit), , a setting of a poem by Joseph von Eichendorff, as "" (Two songs for mixed chorus with orchestra), . Reger titled the autograph of the piano version: 
" / Requiem / (Hebbel)", and he wrote the dedication: "." (To the memory of the German heroes who fell in the War 1914/15).
Reger completed the composition on 25August 1915. He wrote to the publisher on : "I've finished two choral works ("Der Einsiedler" and "Requiem"). I think I can safely say that they're both among the most beautiful things I've ever written." ("Ich habe nun zwei Chorwerke (Der Einsiedler und Requiem) fertig. Ich glaube sagen zu dÃ¼rfen, daÃ diese beiden Chorwerke mit das SchÃ¶nste sind, was ich je geschrieben habe.") "Requiem" was first published by in 1916, edited by Ulrich Haverkampf, with the dedication "Dem Andenken der im groÃen Kriege gefallenen deutschen Helden" (To the memory of the German heroes who fell in the Great War). Simrock also published a vocal score as prepared by Reger himself.
