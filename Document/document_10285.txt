Sanford censured the Klan's techniques and requested the State Highway Patrol to help the metropolitan police in securing the congregation and looking after request. His staff discreetly expedited a trade off, persuading the neighborhood minister to suit the white volunteers in an inn rather than nearby dark occupants' homes, in this way maintaining a strategic distance from the racial blending of which the klansmen objected. State experts managed individuals from the Klan in a comparably pleasing way all through the remainder of Sanford's residency, enabling the association to fortify its situation in the area. In light of Sanford's analysis of their activities in Elm City, klansmen consumed a cross on the yard of the Governor's Mansion in mid-August. Sanford examined the cross, later remarking, "It is a symbol of respect to have such punks against you, yet it is a characteristic of disgrace for the province of North Carolina to have such puerile exercises going on." In December when the Klan undermined representatives who had supported interracial Christmas marches, he urged its individuals to "read the Christmas story and the message of altruism towards all men contained in the Bible" and announced that "If there are any illicit follows up on the piece of the Ku Klux Klan they will be arraigned."
