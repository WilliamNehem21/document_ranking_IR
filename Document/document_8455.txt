The magazine was, strangely for a mash, included by the editors of the yearly Year in Fiction collections, and was by and large respected with more regard than the majority of the pulps. This stayed genuine long after the magazine's previously run finished, as it turned into the fundamental wellspring of imagination short stories for anthologists for quite a few years. Weinberg contends that the dream pulps, of which, as he would see it, "Peculiar Tales" was the most compelling, shaped the cutting edge dream class, and that Wright, "on the off chance that he was not an ideal editorÃÂ ... was a phenomenal one, and a standout amongst the most compelling figures in present day American dream fiction", including that "Abnormal Tales" and its rivals "filled in as the bedrock whereupon a lot of current dream rests". Everett and Shanks concur, and respect "Peculiar Tales" as the setting where essayists, editors and a drew in readership "raised theorized fiction higher than ever" with impact that "resonates through present day mainstream culture". In Ashley's words, "some place in the creative ability repository of all U.S. (what's more, numerous non-U.S.) sort dream and repulsiveness authors is a piece of the soul of "Peculiar Tales"".
