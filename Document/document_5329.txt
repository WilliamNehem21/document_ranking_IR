On October 24, the Attorney General of New Jersey, Christopher Porrino, sued Mahwah and its committee, charging that by voting in favor of the parks boycott and for the summonses, they had abused the sacred privileges of Orthodox Jews. The case, documented in state court in Hackensack, looked for invalidation of the board's activities, statutory punishments, lawyer's expenses, and the arrival of $3.5 million in state-furnished Green Acres assets with which Mahwah had bought and looked after parks. Under the Green Acres program, parks profiting by the assets may not separate, including based on religion or residency. Porrino expressed, "To imagine that there are neighborhood governments here in New Jersey, in 2017, making laws based on some ancient, dread driven and unfair outlook, is profoundly baffling and stunning to many, however it is actually what we are charging for this situation. Obviously, for this situation we assert the objective of the little disapproved of predisposition isn't African-Americans, yet Orthodox Jews. In any case, the derisive message is the equivalent." Mayor Laforet blamed Council President Hermansen for dread mongering and feeding interests, "His despicable conduct is presently declined by the serious potential money related punishments confronting the township's citizen." In the metropolitan race on November 7, Mahwah voters effectively re-chose two enemy of eruv board individuals, overcoming challengers upheld by Laforet. The case was expelled from state to government court by Mahwah on November 22 as it brought up issues under the bureaucratic constitution. On December 1, the chamber casted a ballot collectively to designate $175,000 to battle the claims, which enhanced the $90,000 recently appropriated.
