Rearing is agreeable. Amid the home structure period of the reproducing season, dim jay rearing sets are joined by a third, adolescent fledgling. A 1991 field examine in Quebec and Ontario found that roughly 65% of dark jay trios incorporated a predominant adolescent from the pair's past reproducing season, and around 30% of trios included non-overwhelming adolescents who had left their folks' domain. Every so often, two nonbreeding adolescents go with a couple of grown-ups. The job of adolescents is in allofeeding (nourishment sharing) by recovering stores and bringing sustenance to more youthful kin; in any case, this is just permitted by the guardians amid the post-youngster period. Up to that point, guardians will push different winged creatures from the home. This may diminish the recurrence of predator-drawing in visits to the home when youthful are generally helpless. The advantages of adolescents taking an interest in resulting brood care may incorporate "easing the burden" for the reproducing pair, which may conceivably expand life span, diminishing the likelihood of starvation of nestlings, and recognizing and mobbing predators close to the home. Overwhelming adolescents may in the end acquire the natal domain and breed, while irrelevant adolescents may in the long run fill an opening close-by or structure another rearing pair on already empty ground.
