Churchill initially observed Chartwell in July 1921, without further ado before the house and bequest were to be unloaded. He restored that month with his better half Clementine, who was at first pulled in to the property, in spite of the fact that her excitement cooled amid ensuing visits. In September 1922, when the house had neglected to sell at closeout, he was offered it for ÃÂ£5,500. He paid ÃÂ£5,000, after his first idea of ÃÂ£4,800, made in light of the fact that "the house should be in all respects generally remade, and the nearness of dry decay is an intense antagonistic factor", was rejected. The vender was Captain Archibald John Campbell Colquhoun, who had acquired the house in June 1922 on the demise of his sibling. Campbell Colquhoun had been a contemporary of Churchill's at Harrow School during the 1880s. On finishing of the deal in September 1922, Churchill kept in touch with him; "I am exceptionally happy in reality to have turned into the owner of "Chartwell". I have been looking for a long time for a home in the nation and the site is the most lovely and enchanting I have ever observed". The deal was finished up on 11 November 1922.
