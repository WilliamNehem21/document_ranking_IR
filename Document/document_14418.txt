The Government acknowledged the RAAF's suggestion, and postponed its choice on a MirageÃÂ III substitution until late 1981. This allowed General Dynamics a chance to offer the improved F-16C to the RAAF. The capacity of these airplane was nearer to that of the F-18 as they were furnished with BVR rockets. Richardson and another RAAF pilot test-flew F-16Cs in May 1981. The F-18 configuration was likewise improved amid 1981, and was redesignated the F/A-18. At the point when RAAF aircraft testers flew these airplane amid 1981, they found that the lacks they had recognized in 1980 were currently tended to. Generally speaking, the RAAF presumed that while both airplane met its necessities and the F-16 was more affordable, the F/A-18 was the predominant plan as it was all the more mechanically develop, simpler to keep up amid operational arrangements, and liable to have a much lower wearing down rate. The Government acknowledged this counsel, and reported on 20 October 1981 that 75 F/A-18s would be requested. As a component of this declaration, Minister for Defense Jim Killen recognized that the F-16 would have been seven percent less expensive to buy, yet expressed that the F/A-18's lower running expenses and expected whittling down rate enormously decreased the contrast between the lifetime cost of the two plans.
