The initial consensus among reviewers was that it was "an unusual treatise on nature". The book was published soon after her poetry collection "Tickets for a Prayer Wheel" (1974, University of Missouri Press). Reviewing both volumes for "America", John Breslin noted the similarities between the two: "Even if her first book of poems had not been published simultaneously, the language she uses in "Pilgrim" would have given her away." The "Saturday Evening Post" also praised Dillard's poetic ability in "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek", noting that "the poet in her is everywhere evident in this prose-poem of hers: the reader's attention is caught not only by the freshness of her insights, but by the beauty of her descriptions as well." Melvin Maddocks, a reviewer for "Time", noted Dillard's intention of subtle influence: "Reader, beware of this deceptive girl, mouthing her piety about 'the secret of seeing' being 'the pearl of great price,' modestly insisting, 'I am no scientist. I explore the neighborhood.' Here is no gentle romantic twirling a buttercup, no graceful inscriber of 365 inspirational prose poems. As she guides the attention to a muskrat, to a monarch butterfly, a heron or a coot, Miss Dillard is stalking the reader as surely as any predator stalks its game."
