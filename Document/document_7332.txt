"Lion" rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet, again as Beatty's leader, on 19July. On the night of 18August the Grand Fleet put to ocean because of a message deciphered by Room 40 which showed that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would leave harbor that night. The German goal was to barrage Sunderland the next day, with broad surveillance given via aircrafts and submarines. The Grand Fleet cruised with 6battlecruisers. All through the nineteenth, Jellicoe and Scheer got clashing insight, with the outcome that having achieved its meeting in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet directed north in the incorrect conviction that it had entered a minefield before turning south once more. Scheer guided south-eastbound seeking after a solitary British fight squadron announced by a carrier, which was in certainty the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having understood their mix-up the Germans at that point turned for home. The main contact came at night when Tyrwhitt located the High Seas Fleet yet was unfit to accomplish a favorable assault position before dull, and severed contact. Both the British and the German armadas returned home, the British having lost two cruisers to submarine assaults and the Germans having a man of war vessel harmed by a torpedo.
