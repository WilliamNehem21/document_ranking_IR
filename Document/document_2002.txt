In January 1952, Air Marshal Jones was prevailing via Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman of the Royal Air Force. The choice by Prime Minister Robert Menzies to name a British officer as CAS caused contention in Australia, intensified by his expressed reason that there was "no RAAF officer of adequate age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff", which disregarded the wartime records of figures like McCauley. Hardman changed the structure of the Air Force from one dependent on geological region to one dependent on capacity, subsequently McCauley's Eastern Area Command advanced into Home Command (presently Air Command) in 1953. Elevated to air marshal, McCauley took over from Hardman as Chief of the Air Staff when the last's two-year arrangement finished in January 1954. As per official RAAF history specialist Alan Stephens, McCauley was "similarly as prepared to move toward becoming CAS in 1952 as he was in 1954", while a contemporary spectator pronounced that "only from time to time has a superior prepared officer driven a part of the Australian administrations". He was the first of four previous Duntroon cadets to progressively head up the Air Force somewhere in the range of 1954 and 1969, trailed via Air Marshals Frederick Scherger, Valston Hancock, and Alister Murdoch.
