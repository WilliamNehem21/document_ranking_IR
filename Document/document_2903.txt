Before the arrangement of Alice in Chains, at that point drummer Layne Staley handled his first gig as a vocalist when he tried out to sing for a nearby glitz metal band known as Sleze in the wake of accepting some support from his stepbrother Ken Elmer. Different individuals from this gathering around then were guitarists Johnny Bacolas and Zoli Semanate, drummer James Bergstrom, and bassist Byron Hansen. This band experienced a few lineup changes coming full circle with Nick Pollock as their sole guitarist and Bacolas changing to bass before dialogs emerged about changing their name to "Alice in Chains". This was incited by a discussion that Bacolas had with Russ Klatt, the lead vocalist of Slaughter Haus 5, about behind the stage passes. One of the passes said "Welcome to Wonderland", and they began discussing that being a reference to Alice in Wonderland, until Klatt stated, "Shouldn't something be said about Alice in Chains? Place her in subjugation and stuff that way." Bacolas thought the name "Alice in Chains" was cool and conveyed it up to his Sleze bandmates and everybody loved it, so they chose to change the name of the band. Because of worries over the reference to female servitude, the gathering eventually spelled it distinctively as Alice N' Chains to mollify any parental concerns, however Staley's mom Nancy McCallum has said she was as yet not content with this name at first. As per Bacolas, the choice to utilize the punctuation N blend in their name had nothing to do with the Los Angeles band Guns N' Roses. The name change occurred in 1986, a year prior to Guns N' Roses turned into an easily recognized name with their first collection "Craving for Destruction", discharged in July 1987.
