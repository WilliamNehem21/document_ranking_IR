Regardless of Brice's prior intrigue, it was not until Andrew de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 approving his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to look at the reasonableness of exchanging the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross played out the interpretation function on 19 July 1224. On 5 July, Alexander II ("Alaxandair macintosh Uilliam") had consented to the transference in an order that alluded to his having given the land beforehand for this reason. The land-concede originated before the Papal command and could demonstrate that take a shot at another congregation was at that point in progress before Brice's passing however this is thought impossible and that Bishop Andrew started the structure deals with an abandoned location.Construction of the house of prayer was finished after 1242. Writer John of Fordun recorded without clarification that in 1270 the basilica church and the ordinances' homes had burned to the ground. The house of God was remade in a bigger and more amazing style to frame most of the structure that is currently obvious, work that should have been finished by the flare-up of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. In spite of the fact that Edward I of England took a military to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the house of God was left sound, as it was by his grandson Edward III amid his strike on Moray in 1336.
