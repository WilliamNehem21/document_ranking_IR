Ten years after the beginnings of the first four lower level grammar / primary schools of the Baltimore City Public Schools system in 1829, two for boys and two for girls in the four quadrants of Baltimore, soon created a need for more further advanced opportunities for learning of swiftly increasing numbers of growing children. Public pressure and increasing needs of the trade and commercial classes induced several progressive farsighted political leaders to call for and introduce resolutions into the old City Hall structure on Holliday Street. This was at the former Rembrandt Peale museum, built 1812 as the first building constructed for use as a museum in the Western Hemisphere and acquired by the city government in 1830 for the few municipal offices then existing including two City Council chambers - later the site for the first public school for young African-Americans (then called "colored schools") in the late 1870s. Then it later served from 1931-1997 as a city history museum). Here was the action taken on resolutions introduced calling for the creation of a high school "in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively" was unanimously passed and authorized by the Baltimore City Council on March 7, 1839, and signed by the tenth Mayor, Shepard C. Leakin, who only served one two-year term, 1838-1840.
