Hindman moved his law practice to Helena, Arkansas after his term in the Mississippi House finished. He was chosen as the Democratic Representative from Arkansas' first congressional area in the Thirty-6th Congress from March 4, 1859 to March 4, 1861. He was re-chosen to the Thirty-seventh Congress, however declined to serve after the beginning of the Civil War and Arkansas' withdrawal from the Union. Rather, Hindman joined the military of the Confederacy. He was elevated to brigadier general on September 28, 1861, and to significant general on April 18, 1862. He instructed the Trans-Mississippi Department, and later raised and told "Hindman's Legion" for the Confederate States Army. After the war, Hindman stayed away from surrender to the government by escaping to Mexico City. He worked in Mexico as an espresso grower and endeavored to specialize in legal matters. After the execution of Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867, Hindman presented a request for an exoneration to President Andrew Johnson, yet it was denied. Hindman, regardless, came back to his previous life in Helena. He turned into the pioneer of the "Youthful Democracy", another political association that was eager to acknowledge the Reconstruction for the rebuilding of the Union. He was killed on September 27, 1868 at his Helena home.
