In September, the ship took part in the annual autumn maneuvers with the rest of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet). A special training unit consisting of reserve ships, training ships like "Prinz Adalbert", and a flotilla of torpedo boats was created in early 1905; "Prinz Adalbert" was the flagship of the unit from 1905 to 1907, flying the flag of "Konteradmiral" (Rear Admiral) Hugo Zeye. "Prinz Adalbert" and the light cruiser escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht "Hohenzollern" to Sweden for a visit to King Oscar II in July 1905. The following month, she joined the light cruisers and for training maneuvers off SwinemÃ¼nde; the exercises were to test the ships against a simulated night attack by torpedo boats. The tests were observed by "Konteradmiral" Ludwig SchrÃ¶der, the Inspector of Naval Weapons, aboard "Prinz Adalbert". Wilhelm II boarded "Prinz Adalbert" for the conclusion of the exercises, in which the ship towed an old torpedo boat filled with cork while the light cruisers and torpedo boats fired on it with live shells. "Prinz Adalbert" did not participate in the 1905 autumn maneuvers, though she was present for the naval review at the end of the exercises on 13 September. In February 1906, the tender was assigned to support "Prinz Adalbert". From 17 to 28 June, the cruiser served as the flagship of Prince Heinrich, then the commander of the Baltic Sea Naval Station. During this period the ship traveled to Norway to take part in the coronation festivities for King Haakon VII.
