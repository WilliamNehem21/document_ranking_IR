The first work now generally considered as an opera is Jacopo Peri's "Dafne" of 1597, closely followed by "Euridice" (1600), for which Peri and Giulio Caccini wrote separate musical settings. Ottavio Rinuccini was the librettist for both "Dafne" and "Euridice". In the new genre a complete story was told through characters, and in addition to choruses and ensembles, the vocal parts included recitative, aria and arioso. This was a development from various older forms of musical theatre that had existed since the earliest years of the Italian Renaissance; such forms included the "maschera" ("masque"), the "ballo" (a dance entertainment, often with sung passages), and particularly the "intermedio" or "intermezzo", a short dramatic musical episode inserted as a prologue or "entr'acte" between the acts of straight plays. Another format in the later renaissance period was the "torneo", or "tournament", a stylised dramatic spectacle in which the main singing was performed by a narrator. Sub-operatic forms of dramatic music continued to thrive as opera itself developed; the blurred boundaries that existed for many years between these forms and "opera" has led to debate about how to categorise some works. For example, the precise genre of Monteverdi's "Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda" (1624) has proved particularly difficult to define.
