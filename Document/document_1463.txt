The customary structure was a profoundly emblematic assortment of consecrated design. It was an incredibly expounded variation on the plan of an Egyptian house, mirroring its job as the god's home. In addition, the sanctuary spoke to a bit of the perfect domain on earth. The raised, encased haven was compared with the sacrosanct slope where the world was made in Egyptian fantasy and with the entombment council of a tomb, where the god's "ba", or soul, came to possess its clique picture similarly as a human "ba" came to occupy its mummy. This critical spot, the Egyptians accepted, must be protected from the debased outside world. Along these lines, as one pushed toward the asylum the measure of outside light diminished, and limitations on who could enter expanded. However the sanctuary could likewise speak to the world itself. The processional way could in this manner represent the way of the sun bridging the sky, and the haven for the Duat where it was accepted to set and to be reawakened during the evening. The space outside the structure was consequently likened with the waters of mayhem that lay outside the world, while the sanctuary spoke to the request of the universe and where that request was consistently recharged.
