On February 15 the session started at 6ÃÂ p.m. be that as it may, Dylan just sat in the studio chipping away at his verses while the artists played a game of cards, snoozed and visited. At last, at 4ÃÂ a.m., Dylan called the performers in and illustrated the structure of the melody. Dylan checked and the artists fell in, as he endeavored his epic organization "Pitiful Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey reviewed, "In the event that you see that record, that thing after like the second theme begins building and building like insane, and everyone's simply topping it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is itÃÂ ... This is going to be the last tune and we've gotta placed everything into it we can. Also, he played another harmonica solo and returned down to another section and the elements needed to drop down to a stanza sort of feelÃÂ ... After around ten minutes of this thing we're laughing out loud at one another, at what we were doing. That is to say, we topped five minutes back. What would be the best next step?" The completed tune checked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would possess the whole fourth side of the collection.
