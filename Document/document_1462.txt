In May, "ShÃÂkaku" and "Zuikaku" were appointed to a mission to counterattack the American hostile in the Aleutian Islands, yet this activity was dropped after the Allied triumph on Attu on 29 May 1943. The sister ships were moved to Truk in July. In light of the transporter attack on Tarawa on 18 September, the bearers and a great part of the armada sortied for Eniwetok to scan for the American powers before they came back to Truk on 23 September, having neglected to find them. The Japanese had captured some American radio traffic that proposed another assault on Wake Island, and on 17 October, "ShÃÂkaku" and "Zuikaku" and the greater part of the first Fleet cruised for Eniwetok to be in a situation to catch any such assault, however no assault happened and the armada came back to Truk. Toward the start of November, the majority of their air bunches were exchanged to Rabaul to reinforce the guards there, in the nick of time to help shield the port against the Allied assault a couple of days after the fact. They achieved little there, for the loss of over a large portion of their number, before coming back to Truk on the thirteenth. The sisters came back to Japan in December.
