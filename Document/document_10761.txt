Pitt was given a role as Billy Canton, a medication someone who is addicted who exploits a youthful runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC TV motion picture "Too Young to Even think about dieing?", the narrative of a manhandled youngster condemned to death for a homicide. Ken Tucker, TV commentator for "Amusement Weekly" stated: "Pitt is a superb scum bucket as her hoody beau; looking and seeming like a noxious John Cougar Mellencamp, he's extremely frightening." that year, Pitt co-featured in six scenes of the fleeting Fox dramatization "Brilliance Days" and played a supporting job in the HBO TV film "The Image". His next appearance came in the 1991 film "Over the Tracks"; Pitt depicted Joe Maloney, a secondary school sprinter with a criminal sibling, played by Rick Schroder. Following quite a while of supporting jobs in film and regular TV visitor appearances, Pitt pulled in more extensive acknowledgment in his supporting job in Ridley Scott's 1991 street film "Thelma and Louise". He played J.D., a little time criminal who gets to know Thelma (Geena Davis). His affection scene with Davis has been refered to as the occasion that characterized Pitt as a sex image. After "Thelma and Louise", Pitt featured in the 1991 film "Johnny Suede", a low-spending picture around a hopeful hero, and the 1992 real life/vivified dream film "Cool World", albeit neither facilitated his vocation, having poor audits and film industry execution.
