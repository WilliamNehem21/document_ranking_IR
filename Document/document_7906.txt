Michael swung to the domain's northern neighbor, Bulgaria, for help. The two states were bound by a 30-year settlement marked under Leo V, and the Bulgarian ruler, khan Omurtag (r. 814Ã¢ÂÂ 831), was upbeat to react to Michael's solicitation for help. A later custom, revealed by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, holds that Omurtag acted voluntarily and without wanting to, yet this is all around rejected as a variant began or if nothing else energized by Michael, who did not wish to be seen empowering "savages" to attack the domain. The Bulgarian armed force attacked Thrace, likely in November 822 (Bury trusts that the Bulgarian assault happened in spring 823), and progressed towards Constantinople. Thomas raised the attack, and walked to meet them with his military. The two militaries met at the plain of Kedouktos close Heraclea (thus known as the Battle of Kedouktos in the Byzantine sources) . The records of the consequent fight contrast: the later sources express that Thomas lost the fight, however the close contemporary George the Monk expresses that Thomas "slaughtered numerous Bulgarians". Given the absence of Bulgarian movement after the fight, most present day researchers (with the prominent special case of Bury) trust that Thomas won the fight.
