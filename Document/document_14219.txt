Apollo 11's goal was to arrive securely on the Moon, instead of to contact down at an exact area. Three minutes into the lunar drop, Armstrong noticed that cavities were going around two seconds too soon, which implied the LM "Falcon" would most likely touch down a few miles past the arranged landing zone. As the "Eagle"s landing radar procured the surface, a few PC mistake cautions sounded. The first was a code 1202 caution, and even with their broad preparing, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin comprehended what this code implied. They speedily gotten word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alerts were not a worry; the 1202 and 1201 cautions were brought about by official floods in the lunar module PC. As portrayed by Buzz Aldrin in the narrative "In the Shadow of the Moon", the floods were brought about by his own counter-agenda decision of leaving the docking radar on amid the arrival procedure, making the PC procedure pointless radar information. When it didn't have enough time to execute all undertakings, the PC dropped the lower-need ones, setting off the cautions. Aldrin said he chose to leave the radar on in the event that a prematurely end was fundamental when re-docking with the CM; he didn't understand it would cause the handling floods.
