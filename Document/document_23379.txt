Taft's initial commission from the trust was limited to the creation of a full-sized plaster model of "Fountain of Time", under a five-year $10,000 ($) annual installment contract signed on February 6, 1913. This would enable the model to be evaluated in 1918. Taft first created a quarter-scale model which received the Trustees' approval in May 1915. He eventually produced his full-scale plaster model, in width peaking in the center, with an equestrian warrior and a robed model of Father Time with a height of . The installation of this model near its intended location was delayed by Taft's World WarÂ I service with the Y.M.C.A. in France as part of a corps of entertainers and lecturers, but was completed in 1920. However, Taft's wider vision of a Chicago school of sculpture, analogous to other philosophical Chicago schools such as the contemporaneous Chicago school of architecture style, had lost momentum after the 1913 dedication of his "Fountain of the Great Lakes". The Beaux Arts style had become dated; instead of funding Taft's large-scale Midway Plaisance beautification plan, and providing the originally planned granite, bronze or Georgia marble materials, the trust only allocated sufficient funds and support for a concrete sculpture.
