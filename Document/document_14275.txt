Walter's family was from West Dereham in Norfolk, which is most likely where Walter was conceived. Walter initially shows up in Glanvill's family unit in a contract that has been dated to 1178, despite the fact that as it is undated it might have been composed as late as 1180. His sibling Theobald likewise served in their uncle's family unit. Walter's appreciation towards his auntie and uncle is appeared in the establishment contract of Walter's cloister in Dereham, where he approaches the establishment to petition God for the "spirits of Ranulf Glanvill and Bertha his significant other, who sustained us". Prior history specialists affirmed that Walter considered law at Bologna, in view of his name showing up in a rundown of those to be honored at a religious community in Bologna in which English understudies held up. Present day antiquarians have limited this, as the rundown likewise incorporates sponsors, not simply understudies; other proof focuses to the way that Walter had a poor handle of Latin, and did not believe himself to be an educated man. Nonetheless, this did not imply that he was ignorant, just that he was not "book-learned", or taught at a college. His contemporary, the medieval author Gerald of Wales said of Walter that the Exchequer was his school.
