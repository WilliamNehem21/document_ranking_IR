In his survey for "The Boston Globe", John Freeman sees that Clarke's dream, similar to that of Franz Kafka and Neil Gaiman, is pervaded with authenticity. He contends that the commentaries specifically loan a demeanor of believability to the story: for instance, they depict an anecdotal account of Jonathan Strange and list where specific sketches in Norrell's home are found. In a meeting, Clarke depicts how she makes this pragmatist dream: "One method for establishing the enchantment is by putting in heaps of stuff about road lights, carriages and that it is so hard to get great workers." To make this impact, the novel incorporates numerous references to genuine mid nineteenth century individuals and things, for example, craftsmen Francisco Goya, Cruikshank, and Rowlandson; authors Frances Burney, William Beckford, Monk Lewis, Lord Byron, and Ann Radcliffe; Maria Edgeworth's "Belinda" and Austen's "Emma"; distributer John Murray; legislators Lord Castlereagh and George Canning; "The Gentleman's Magazine" and "The Edinburgh Review"; Chippendale and Wedgwood goods; and the frenzy of King George III. Clarke has said that she trusts the enchantment is as reasonable as that in Le Guin's Earthsea set of three. This authenticity has driven different analysts, for example, Polly Shulman, to contend that Clarke's book is a greater amount of a chronicled fiction, similar to crafted by Patrick O'Brian. As she clarifies, "Both Clarke's and O'Brian's accounts are about a muddled connection between two men bound together by their calling; both are set amid the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, despairing mind and capricious story shape." Shulman sees dream and chronicled fiction as comparable in light of the fact that both must pursue unbending guidelines or hazard a breakdown of the story.
