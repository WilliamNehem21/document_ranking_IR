Growing up in eastern Sydney, Windle was trained by Frank Guthrie from the age of 12. Windle's first major swimming competition was the 1960 Australian Championships. Aged 15, his second-place finish in the 1650Â yd freestyle earned him a place on the team for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. However, the Australian coaches only took him along to gain experience and he did not compete. He won his first national title in 1961âthe 1650Â yd freestyleâand claimed the 220â440â1650Â yd treble in 1962. Windle made his international debut at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, winning gold in the 4Â ÃÂ 220Â yd freestyle and silver and bronze in the 1650 and 440Â yd freestyle respectively. In 1963, he won four individual national titles, adding the 880Â yd event to the successful defence of his three titles. He won three individual titles in 1964 and proceeded to the Tokyo Olympics where he was eliminated in the heats of the 400Â m freestyle after attempting to save energy for the final. In response, Windle took an aggressive approach in the 1500Â m and set Olympic records in the heats and final to win gold. He added a bronze in the 4Â ÃÂ 100Â m freestyle relay.
