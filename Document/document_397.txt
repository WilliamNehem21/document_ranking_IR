On 7ÃÂ October 1942, Walters took order of another arrangement, No.ÃÂ 1 (Fighter) Wing, at RAAF Station Richmond. Set up to lift the air protection capacity of Australia's North-Western Area, the wing included three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons that had been exchanged from Europe: No.ÃÂ 54 Squadron RAF, No.ÃÂ 452 Squadron RAAF and No.ÃÂ 457 Squadron RAAF. With Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying pro of the war, as his wing head, Walters started sending air ship and men to Darwin, Northern Territory, in December, giving a filip to resolve in the area. Gladly proclaiming himself Australia's most seasoned military pilot, Walters was accounted for as accepting each open door to join his men noticeable all around. He flew as Caldwell's wingman in No.ÃÂ 1 Wing's first real activity against the Japanese over Darwin on 2ÃÂ May 1943. Eight Spitfires slammed and a few others made constrained arrivals, for the devastation of one Japanese aircraft and five warriors. Walters himself barely abstaining from being shot down when he cautioned Caldwell of an assaulting adversary contender, to the disservice of his own security. After they landed, Caldwell criticized his officer, "You senseless old so-thus. You need to care for your very own skin as opposed to stressing over somebody else's!" On 20ÃÂ June, Walters took part in the wing's best battle against the Japanese to that time, expressly representing one of fourteen bandits asserted by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number. He posted out of Darwin a couple of days after the fact, having earned the esteem of Caldwell and the remainder of the wing's work force.
