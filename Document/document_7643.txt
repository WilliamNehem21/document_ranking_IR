In the late 1950s, Warner was nearly killed in an auto collision that left him in a state of insensibility for a few days. On August 5, 1958, after a night of baccarat at the Palm Beach Casino in Cannes, Warner's Alfa Romeo roadster swerved into the way of a coal truck on a stretch of street situated close to the shoreline estate of Prince Aly Khan. Warner was tossed from the vehicle, which burst into flares upon effect. Not long after the mishap, his child, Jack Jr., joined other relatives in France, where the oblivious studio head was hospitalized. In a meeting with correspondents, Jack Jr. proposed that his dad was kicking the bucket. At that point, amid a visit to his dad's clinic room, the young fellow annoyed Ann Warner, whom he to a great extent accused for his folks' separation. At the point when Warner recovered cognizance, he was incensed by reports of his child's conduct, and their "shaky" relationship arrived at an end. On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was educated, by Jack Sr's. legal advisor Arnold Grant, that the senior Warner had discharged him from the organization. When he endeavored to report for work, studio watches denied him section. The two men never accomplished a compromise, and Jack Jr. isn't referenced in his dad's 1964 self-portrayal.
