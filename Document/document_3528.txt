Bill Shankly started overseeing Liverpool in 1959, and it was under him that the group originally contended in European challenge in 1964Ã¢ÂÂ 65, fitting the bill for the European Cup by winning the First Division title the past season. The club's first rivals were KnattspyrnufÃÂ©lag ReykjavÃÂ­kur of Iceland, who they played in the starter round. Liverpool won 11Ã¢ÂÂ 1 on total. The following round, against Belgian club Anderlecht, was the first run through in Liverpool's history that they wore their now normal all-red strip. The choice was made to change from red shirts, white shorts and socks by Shankly, who needed his players to make even more a mental effect on adversaries. They beat Anderlecht and advanced to the semi-finals, where they met Italian group Internazionale. Before the primary leg at Anfield, Shankly requested that two harmed players march the FA Cup, which Liverpool had won the earlier week, to threaten the Italians. The group won the match 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1, yet Inter won the second leg 3Ã¢ÂÂ 0, verifying a 4Ã¢ÂÂ 3 total triumph. The second leg was questionable; Shankly depicted it as "a war". He felt that the official, Jose Maria Ortiz de Mendibel, had appeared towards Internazionale, and the Liverpool players felt tricked by his choices. The club's 1964Ã¢ÂÂ 65 FA Cup triumph guaranteed capability for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup the accompanying season, and in that challenge, they achieved their first European last. Borussia Dortmund, Liverpool's rivals, utilized counter-assaulting strategies that had paid profits in past rounds and did as such once more, with the West Germans beating Liverpool 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1 after additional time.
