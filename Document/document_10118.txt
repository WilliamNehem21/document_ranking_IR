On the other hand, the rest of the work, the Cello Concerto in E minor, had a lamentable debut, at the opening show of the London Symphony Orchestra's 1919Ã¢ÂÂ 20 season in October 1919. Aside from the Elgar work, which the arranger directed, the remainder of the program was led by Albert Coates, who overran his practice time to the detriment of Elgar's. Woman Elgar stated, "that severe childish discourteous bounder ... that animal Coates continued practicing." The pundit of "The Observer", Ernest Newman, expressed, "There have been bits of gossip about amid the seven day stretch of deficient practice. Whatever the clarification, the pitiful reality remains that never, most likely, has so extraordinary a symphony made so terrible a presentation of itself. ... The work itself is stunning stuff, straightforward Ã¢ÂÂ that pregnant effortlessness that has happened upon Elgar's music over the most recent few years Ã¢ÂÂ however with a significant knowledge and excellence fundamental its straightforwardness." Elgar connected no fault to his soloist, Felix Salmond, who played for him again later, including at the debut show of the City of Birmingham Orchestra (later City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra), which Elgar led. Interestingly with the First Symphony and its hundred exhibitions in a little more than a year, the Cello Concerto did not have a second act in London for over a year.
