The story pursued Roy Race, a striker for the anecdotal football crew Melchester Rovers, situated in a town of a similar name in an unspecified piece of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the primary scene, a teenaged Roy and his closest companion, Blackie Gray, marked for the Rovers in the wake of being spotted playing for a young club group. After eight months, Roy and Blackie made their first-group debuts against Elbury Wanderers in an amusement that finished in a 3Ã¢ÂÂ 3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He before long turned into a star, driving the group to either the Football League title or a glass pretty much every season. In January 1975 he was made player-director, a position he held for the vast majority of the following 20ÃÂ years. In spite of the fact that the strip finished the Rovers about 40ÃÂ seasons, Roy did not age at a similar rate and gave off an impression of being at most in his late thirties when the week after week comic finished. This unreasonable life span was never commented upon by the week by week comic, in spite of the fact that the month to month comic endeavored to address the abnormality by clarifying that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester throughout the years.
