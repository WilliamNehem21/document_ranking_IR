The motor for "Divine force of War III" was from the initial two portions. Santa Clause Monica senior maker Steve Caterson said that the advancement group ported "Divine force of War II"s motor to the PlayStation 3 and had the capacity to rapidly play the amusement. Everything that Kratos could do in past recreations, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which enabled the engineers to quickly start structuring new substance. As the diversion was being built up, the code division would swap out PlayStation 2 segments with PlayStation 3 parts. They supplanted the renderer, the molecule framework, and the impact framework. Feldman said that despite the fact that they were re-utilizing the motor from "Lord of War II", the center motor for "Divine force of War III" was fresh out of the plastic new. Between the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and the time the diversion delivered, morphological enemy of associating (MLAA) was included, which illustrations engineer Ben Diamand said "improved edges drastically and spared considerable measures of edge rate." MLAA is "now a well known edge-location process that can cost-viably expel spiked edges from each casing", which helped Santa Monica free up the preparing cycle and "enabled them to add to the exhibition in different ways." Diamand likewise said that "profundity of-field, movement obscure, crepuscular 'god' beams and refraction were either included or improved in quality and speed" amid that equivalent timespan.
