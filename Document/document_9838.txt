The coordination and regularized plan that the AHAC brought popularized novice ice hockey, which kept running against the soul of the common beginner ethic. As the significance of winning developed, AHAC clubs started selecting players from outside, and the divergence in expertise between groups of the AHAC and those of different alliances progressed toward becoming more clear. Since group proprietors in the AHAC needed to shield the Stanley Cup and keep up the association's respect, and arena proprietors needed senior hockey as their marquee fascination, AHAC clubs turned out to be progressively hesitant about conceding new groups into the class and the senior arrangement. At the point when the generally feeble Ottawa Capitals participated in 1898, the five unique clubs pulled back from the AHAC to frame the new Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL). In 1903, four new groups made the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL), and in 1904, the International Hockey League (IHL), situated in both Sault Ste. Maries, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and Pennsylvania, was made as the main completely proficient alliance. The IHL's capacity to pay compensations caused an "Athletic War" that depleted beginner clubs of top players, most observably in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA).
