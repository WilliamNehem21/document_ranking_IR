Aside from being a nearby relative of the Rodrigues rail, the connections of the red rail are unsure. The two are usually kept as discrete genera, "Aphanapteryx" and "Erythromachus", yet have additionally been joined as types of "Aphanapteryx" now and again. They were first conventionally synonymised by the British ornithologists Edward Newton and Albert GÃÂ¼nther in 1879, because of skeletal likenesses. In 1892, the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes portrayed Hawkins' rail, a wiped out types of rail from the Chatham Islands, as another types of "Aphanapteryx"; "A. hawkinsi". He found the Chatham Islands species more like the red rail than the last was to the Rodrigues rail, and recommended that the Mascarene Islands had once been associated with the Chatham Islands, as a feature of a lost mainland he called "Antipodea". Forbes moved the Chatham Islands winged creature to its own variety, "Diaphorapteryx", in 1893, on the proposal of Newton, however later returned to his more established name. The possibility that the Chatham Islands fledgling was firmly identified with the red rail and the possibility of an association between the Mascarenes and the Chatham Islands were later scrutinized by the British scientist Charles William Andrews because of no different species being shared between the islands, and the German ornithologist Hans F. Gadow clarified the similitude between the two rails as parallel advancement.
