In 2008, S.R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" listed "Anbe Sivam" among the "top five directorial ventures of SundarC." In a 2008 interview with "The Times of India", SundarC. stated that "Anbe Sivam" "changed [him] personally and professionally", making him a more confident person and altering his outlook towards life. He later contradicted his statement after revealing that the film's failure led him to become almost bankrupt and he remained unpaid for his work. The Income Tax Department froze his bank accounts for a year as he was not able to pay his taxes. He admitted that while he received praises for the film after its theatrical run, he would not make a film similar to "Anbe Sivam" anymore and that he chose to continue making commercial cinema, which he felt better matched his interests. In 2013, Haricharan Pudipeddi of the Indo-Asian News Service agency, included "Anbe Sivam" in his list of "Kamal's most underrated films". He believed the reason for the film's commercial failure was that audiences misunderstood the "sarcastic undertones associated with atheism". On Haasan's birthday, 7 November 2015, Latha Srinivasan of "Daily News and Analysis" considered "Anbe Sivam" to be one of the "films you must watch to grasp the breadth of Kamal Haasan's repertoire". The character of Nallasivam was ranked fourth in "The Times of India"'s list of "Kamal Haasan's top 10 mind-blowing avatars".
