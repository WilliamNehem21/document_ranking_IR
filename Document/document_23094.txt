At 02:00 on 19 May 1941, "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen" left Gotenhafen and proceeded through the Baltic Sea and out toward the Atlantic. Unknown to LÃ¼tjens, the British had intercepted enough signals to infer that a German naval operation might occur in the area. The German task force was first encountered by the Swedish seaplane-cruiser on 20 May heading north-west past Gothenburg. The British Admiralty was informed through a Norwegian officer in Stockholm who had learned of the sighting from a Swedish military intelligence source. Alerted by this report, British Admiralty requested air reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast. A Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft found and photographed the German task force in the Grimstad fjord (), near Bergen, at 13:15 on 21 May. On the evening of 23 May at 19:22, the German force was detected by the heavy cruisers and that had been patrolling the Denmark Strait in the expectation of a German breakout. The alarm was sounded and Lindemann announced at 20:30 over the intercom: "". (Enemy sighted to port. Engage!) "Bismarck" fired five salvos without scoring a direct hit. The heavily outgunned British cruisers retired to a safe distance and shadowed the enemy until their own heavy units could draw closer. However, "Bismarck"s forward radar had failed as a result of vibration from the heavy guns firing during this skirmish, and LÃ¼tjens was obliged to order "Prinz Eugen" to move ahead of "Bismarck" in order to provide the squadron with forward radar coverage.
