One of the most punctual records of Waterfall Gully originates from a "Mr Kent" who, alongside Captain Collet Barker and Barker's worker, Miles, climbed Mount Lofty in 1831. In making their rising the gathering evaded a gorgeÃ¢ÂÂdepicted by Mr Kent as having "smooth and verdant sides"Ã¢ÂÂ which is accepted by Anne Hardy to have been Waterfall Gully. Consequent to Barker's rising, the main pilgrims who were recorded as having climbed Mount Lofty were Bingham Hutchinson and his hireling, William Burt. The pair made three endeavors to scale the mount before succeeding, and for their first endeavor they endeavored to navigate Waterfall Gully. The endeavor was ineffective, yet in July 1837, Hutchinson expounded on the gorge through which they had voyage. Cascade Gully he composed, had demonstrated troublesome, as the plants were so thickly developed as to give a huge boundary to their advancement. Close to the point of surrender, Hutchinson depicted how they were "pleasingly amazed by observing a mass of shake around fifty or sixty feet [fifteen to eighteen metres] high, which extended over the gorge, and from its highest point jumped the rivulet which had for such a long time been [their] buddy". The rivulet was First Creek, and the cascade they located is today known as First Falls.
