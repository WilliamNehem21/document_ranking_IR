Affleck reunited with director Michael Bay for the critically derided war drama "Pearl Harbor" (2001). He later characterized it as a film he did "for moneyÂ â for the wrong reasons". A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale "do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars". But Todd McCarthy of "Variety" said, "the blandly handsome Affleck couldn't convince that he'd ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost the love of his life to his best friend". Affleck then parodied "Good Will Hunting" with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (2001), made a cameo in the comedy "Daddy and Them" (2001), and had a supporting role in the little-seen "The Third Wheel" (2002). He portrayed the CIA analyst Jack Ryan in the thriller "The Sum of All Fears" (2002). Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: "Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role." Affleck had an "amazing experience" making the thriller "Changing Lanes" (2002), and later cited Roger Michell as someone he learned from as a director. Robert Koehler of "Variety" described it as one of the actor's "most thoroughly wrought" performances: "The journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before."
