Amid World WarÃÂ II, the RAAF built up a few operational preparing units (OTUs) to change over as of late graduated pilots from cutting edge mentors to battle airplane, and to add battling systems to the flying abilities they had effectively learned. No.ÃÂ 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No.ÃÂ 2 OTU) was framed on 2 April 1942 at Port Pirie, South Australia. Its debut leader was Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, a warrior expert who had driven No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron in North Africa. Jeffrey had as of late expedited line Nos.ÃÂ 75 and 76 Squadrons, two of the initial three contender units raised to help shield northern Australia as the Japanese progressed toward New Guinea. His group of teachers at No.ÃÂ 2ÃÂ OTU included individual pros from the North African battle, Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur. Initially outfitted with CAC Wirraways and Fairey Battles, the unit's supplement was increased by P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords after it migrated to RAAF Station Mildura, Victoria, in May. By September 1942, its armada of airplane included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had close by at the time. Amid November, No.ÃÂ 2ÃÂ OTU led relative preliminaries that hollowed a Spitfire MkÃÂ V against a P-40E; the last report of these preliminaries made a decision about that in spite of the fact that the Spitfire had better execution concurring than most criteria, the P-40E was likewise a helpful plan.
