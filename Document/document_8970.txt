Eight subspecies are distinguished, of which two Ã¢ÂÂ "A. b. caama" and "A. b. lichtensteinii" Ã¢ÂÂ have been viewed as free species. Nonetheless, a 1999 hereditary investigation by P. Arctander of the University of Copenhagen and associates, which inspected the control locale of the mitochondrial DNA, found that these two shaped a clade inside "A. buselaphus", and that perceiving these as species would render "A. buselaphus" paraphyletic (an unnatural gathering). A similar report found "A. b. major" to be the most different, having expand before the ancestry part to give a joined "caama/lichtensteinii" genealogy and another that offered ascend to the staying surviving subspecies. On the other hand a 2001 phylogenetic investigation, in view of DÃ¢ÂÂ circle and cytochrome b examination by ÃÂystein Flagstad (of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, Trondheim) and associates, found that the southern ancestry of "A. b. caama" and "A. lichtensteinii" wandered most punctual. Investigation of skull structure bolsters parcel into three noteworthy divisions: "A. b. buselaphus" division (choose, likewise including "A. b. significant" division), "A. b. tora" division (likewise including "A. b. cokii" and "A. b. swaynei") and "A. b. lelwel" division. Another examination of cytochrome b and D-circle arrangement information demonstrates an eminent partiality between the "A. b. lelwel" and "A. b. tora " divisions.
