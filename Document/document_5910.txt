Joseph wedded Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, trusting he could guarantee the Bavarian electorate for his posterity. Following two years of troubled marriage, Maria Josepha kicked the bucket without issue. At the point when Max Joseph kicked the bucket ten years after the fact, Joseph could just present a frail legitimate case to Lower Bavaria through a questionable and antiquated concede made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor legitimate grounds, Joseph arranged a mystery concurrence with Charles Theodore soon after Max Joseph's demise. In this understanding (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore surrendered Lower Bavaria to Austria in return for uncontested progression to the rest of the duchy. Charles Theodore likewise would have liked to procure from Joseph some unhampered pieces of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Anterior Austria that he could give to his rats, yet this was not composed into the understanding and Joseph was not an especially liberal man. Moreover, the understanding altogether overlooked the interests of Charles Theodore's own beneficiary hypothetical, Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-ZweibrÃÂ¼cken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the hypothetical beneficiary of Charles Theodore's spaces and titles. He had a reasonable and direct enthusiasm for the aura of the Bavarian duchy, particularly in its regional respectability.
