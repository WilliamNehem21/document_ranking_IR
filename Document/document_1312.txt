Dylan researcher Michael Gray stated: "To have lined up one perfect work of art with another was Dylan's history making accomplishment hereÃÂ ... Where "Parkway 61 Revisited" has Dylan uncovering and going up against like a laser bar in medical procedure, plummeting from outside the affliction, "Blonde on Blonde" offers a persona flooded inside the chaosÃÂ ... We're hurled from tune to songÃÂ ... The vibe and the music are on an amazing scale, and the language and conveyance are a novel blend of the visionary and the casual." Critic Tim Riley expressed: "A rambling reflection of offbeat blues revisionism, "Blonde on Blonde" affirms Dylan's stature as the best American shake nearness since Elvis Presley." Biographer Robert Shelton saw the collection as "a trademark accumulation that finishes his first real shake cycle, which started with "Presenting to It All Back Home"". Summing up the collection's accomplishment, Shelton composed that "Blonde on Blonde" "starts with a joke and finishes with a song; in the middle of mind interchanges with a predominant topic of entanglement by conditions, love, society, and undiscovered hopeÃÂ ... There's a noteworthy marriage of astounding, soul-filled shake expressionism, and Rimbaud-like dreams of irregularity, confusion, vacancy, misfortune, being 'trapped'."
