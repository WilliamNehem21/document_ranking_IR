To one side are seen his lieutenants in the Communist takeover. In the first painting, the first line, which is requested by rank, comprised of (from left) General Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Madame Song Qingling (the widow of Sun Zhongshan), Li Jishen, Zhang Lan (with facial hair), and at far right, General Gao Gang. Zhou Enlai was uttermost left in the second column, and adjacent to him were Dong Biwu, two men whose personalities are dubious, and farthest right, Guo Moruo. Lin Boqu was uttermost left in the third line. The pioneers assemble near one another, while remaining an aware separation from Mao. This accentuates his supremacy, as does the way that he is delineated as taller than his lieutenants. The perspective of the eyewitness is well back on the overhang, from which a large portion of the square would be clouded by the floor. As opposed to demonstrate just Mao and sky, Dong controlled the point of view, raising the skyline and strengthening the foreshortening of the gallery. Essentially, just the authorities and not the group beneath are spoken to as people; workmanship history specialist Wu Hung composed that "the marching masses in the Square get quality from an aggregate namelessness. The mix of the twoÃ¢ÂÂabove and beneath, the pioneers and the general populationÃ¢ÂÂestablishes an extensive portrayal of New China."
