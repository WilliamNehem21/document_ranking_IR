Joseph increased her teaching commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She also continued in her role of the composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of "The Planets", on 29 September 1918 at the Queen's Hall, where Adrian Boult conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: "From the moment of MarsÂ ... to the last sound of Neptune, it was a big thing that will last all our lives, I think". She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the apocryphal work "The Acts of John" from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's "Hymn of Jesus" (1917); for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of William Byrd's "Mass for Three Voices", and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for Samuel Wesley's "Sing Aloud with Gladness". This latter work was prepared for the 1917 Whitsun musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of Thaxted, in later years at assorted venues including Dulwich, Chichester and Canterbury. Joseph became a key figure in these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: "Hymn" for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, "Barbara Noel's Morris", which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of Conrad Noel, Thaxted's vicar.
