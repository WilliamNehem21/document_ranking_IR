Monteux continued to play in the Concerts Colonne through the first decade of the century. In 1910 Colonne died and was succeeded as principal conductor by Gabriel PiernÃ©. As well as leading the violas, Monteux was assistant conductor, taking charge of early rehearsals and acting as chorus master for choral works. In 1910 the orchestra was engaged to play for a Paris season given by Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company, the Ballets Russes. Monteux played under PiernÃ© in the world premiere of Stravinsky's "The Firebird". In 1911 Diaghilev engaged Nikolai Tcherepnin to conduct the premiere of Stravinsky's "Petrushka". Monteux conducted the preliminary rehearsals before Tcherepnin arrived; Stravinsky was so impressed that he insisted that Monteux conduct the premiere.
"Petrushka" was part of a triple bill, all conducted by Monteux. The other two pieces were "Le Spectre de la Rose" and "Scheherazade", a balletic adaptation of Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite of the same name. The three works were choreographed by Fokine. In later years Monteux disapproved of the appropriation of symphonic music for ballets, but he made an exception for "Scheherazade", and, as his biographer John Canarina observes, at that stage in his career his views on the matter carried little weight. "Petrushka" was a success with the public and with all but the most diehard conservative critics.
