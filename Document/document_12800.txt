Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was conceived in Albany, New York, on 17 August 1896, the third child of four offspring of a minister, Leslie Richard Groves Sr., and his better half Gwen nÃÂ©e Griffith. He was half Welsh and half English, with some French Huguenot precursors who went to the United States in the seventeenth century. Leslie Groves Sr. surrendered as minister of the Sixth Presbyterian church in Albany in December 1896 to turn into a United States Army cleric. He was presented on the fourteenth Infantry at Vancouver Barracks in Washington in 1897. Following the flare-up of the SpanishÃ¢ÂÂ American War in 1898, Chaplain Groves was sent to Cuba with the eighth Infantry. On coming back to Vancouver Barracks, he was requested to rejoin the fourteenth Infantry in the Philippines; administration in the PhilippineÃ¢ÂÂ American War and the Boxer Rebellion pursued. The fourteenth Infantry came back to the United States in 1901 and moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The family migrated to there from Vancouver, at that point moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, and came back to Vancouver in 1905. Minister Groves was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He chose to settle in southern California and purchased a house in Altadena. His next presenting was on Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and came back to Altadena where the kids went to class.
