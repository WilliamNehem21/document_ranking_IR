By 1965, the six passenger cars of the DRR's "Retlaw 1" train, due to their slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the "Retlaw 1" passenger cars were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the "Grand Canyon" observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed "Lilly Belle" after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The "Lilly Belle" was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new interior, which included varnished mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the "Lilly Belle" after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled on the ends of the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other "Retlaw 1" passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former "Retlaw 1" passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the "Retlaw 1" combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the "Retlaw 1" combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.
