"A Song for Simeon" isn't considered by researchers and commentators to be one of Eliot's noteworthy ballads. It is in this manner eclipsed by his relatively better known works of the periodÃ¢ÂÂ"The Hollow Men" (1925), composed before his transformation; and "The Journey of the Magi" (1927), "Fiery remains Wednesday" (1930), and the later, progressively generous "Four Quartets" (1943), composed after his change. In any case, in "A Song for Simeon" and these lyrics, Eliot proceeds with the movement of his subjects of distance in an evolving world, and wires with this the precepts of his newly discovered confidence. Scofield states that the symbolism of "A Song for Simeon"Ã¢ÂÂ including the image of a plume, its setting in the midst of Roman hyacinths and the winter sunÃ¢ÂÂpasses on "a feeling of marvel and delicate new life". Robin Griffith-Jones draws an association between Eliot's picture of the plume to an announcement by Hildegard of Bingen looking at herself "to 'a quill which comes up short on all weight and quality and flies through the breeze'; so she was borne up by God. In any case, Eliot's speaker, as yet trusting that the breeze will blow, envisions just the passing wind that will bear him away".
