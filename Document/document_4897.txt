Others saw no deliberate censure of Colbert by the press. Reacting to an inquiry regarding why "The Washington Post"s article about the supper did not broadly expound on Colbert's discourse, Media Backtalk essayist Howard Kurtz reacted, "The issue to a limited extent is one of due date. The presses were at that point moving when Colbert went ahead at 10:30, so the story must be generally composed by at that point." Asked why TV news supported Bush's execution over Colbert's, Elizabeth Fishman, an associate dignitary at the Columbia School of Journalism and a previous "an hour" maker, disclosed to MTV that the "brisk hit" for TV news shows would have been to utilize film of Bush remaining next to his impersonator. "It's a simpler set up for enhanced visualization", she noted. Steve Scully, leader of the White House Correspondents' Association (which facilitated the supper) and political proofreader of C-SPAN (which communicate the supper), laughed at the entire thought of the press purposefully disregarding Colbert: "Shrubbery hit such a grand slam with Steve Bridges that he got the majority of the inclusion. I believe that surpassed desires. There was no conservative scheme or left-wing connivance." "Time" writer Ana Marie Cox expelled claims of a conscious media power outage, since Colbert's execution got inclusion in "The New York Times", "The Washington Post", and the significant wire administrations. Individual pundit Kurtz agreed, taking note of that the video was carried on C-SPAN and was unreservedly accessible on the web; he likewise played two clasps without anyone else appear. "Clearly I didn't get the notice," he said.
