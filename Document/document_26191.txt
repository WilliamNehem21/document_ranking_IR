In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; twoJ. Mahendran and K. Balachandernamed "Chandralekha". Mahendran said, "If anybody tries to remake this black-and-white film, they will make a mockery of it." According to Balachander, "Just like "Sivaji" today, people talked about "Chandralekha" in the past. Produced at a cost of 30 lakhs ([3 million], a huge sum at that time), it has grand sets. I have seen it 12 times." In December 2008, Muthiah said: "Given how spectacular it wasand the appreciation lavished on it from 1948 till well into the 1950s, which is when I caught up with itI'm sure that if re-released, it would do better at the box office than most Tamil films today." In a 2011 interview with Indo-Asian News Service (IANS), South Indian Bollywood actor Vyjayanthimala said that although people consider that she "paved the way" for other South Indian female actors in Hindi cinema, "the person who really opened the doors was S. S. Vasan ... When ["Chandralekha" was] released, it took the North by storm because by then they haven't seen that kind of lavish sets, costumes and splendour. So Vasan was the person who opened the door for Hindi films in the South."
