Amid February and March 1942, the RAAF shaped four transport units: Nos.ÃÂ 33, 34, 35 and 36ÃÂ Squadrons. No.ÃÂ 34 (Transport) Squadron was set up on 23ÃÂ February at RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, four days after the city was shelled out of the blue. Going under the control of North-Western Area Command, the squadron's underlying quality was six staff and two deÃÂ Havilland DH.84 Dragons. They were promptly entrusted with transport obligations in northern Australia. Just as conveying cargo, this included gathering the main Japanese wartime captive to be caught in Australia, a naval force military pilot who had crashlanded amid the attack on Darwin. One of the squadron's two officers, Flight Lieutenant J.W. Warwick, turned into the principal (acting) boss on 2ÃÂ March. The next day, one of the Dragons was decimated on the ground at Wyndham, Western Australia, by foe air assault. With its other air ship unserviceable, and settlement at Darwin's affable runway lacking, squadron base camp moved to Daly Waters Airfield on 5ÃÂ March. On 14ÃÂ March another Dragon was designated; this was joined by two Avro Ansons and two de Havilland Tiger Moths in mid-May, by which time the squadron had moved to Batchelor Airfield. Before the month's over, the squadron had thirty-four staff, including six officers. It lost one of the Tiger Moths to a bushfire on 1ÃÂ July, a couple of days after the plane crashlanded south of Katherine. The squadron moved again on 15ÃÂ July, this opportunity to Hughes Airfield. It stayed at Hughes until 27ÃÂ August, when it exchanged to Manbulloo Airfield; it worked from Manbulloo until it was briefly disbanded on 13ÃÂ December and its air ship exchanged to No.ÃÂ 6 Communications Flight.
