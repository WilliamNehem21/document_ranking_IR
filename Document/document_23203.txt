Priore reflected: "Actually, the [only] reason most people didn't care for "Smiley Smile" is that it came out in place of "Smile"." Richie Unterberger concurred, rating the album four out of five stars, and suggesting that media-hype of the collapsed "Smile" project was to blame for "Smiley Smile"s lackluster reception in the United States. He called it a "rather nifty, if rather slight, effort that's plenty weird". In a 2007 issue of "Rolling Stone", Robert Christgau and David Fricke named it one of the 40 essential albums of 1967; Christgau declared: "Towering it's not; some kind of hit it is." In 2001, Spencer Owen of "Pitchfork" awarded the album a 9.5/10 score, and wrote ""Smiley Smile" is a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of "Smile"'s existence, this album could have been a contemporary classicÂ ... and although the album isn't anywhere close to the sonic revolution that "Sgt. Pepper" had already brought, Wilson's innovative production and arrangements still bring out the best in every single track." Daniel Harrison compared Wilson to classical composers such as Schoenberg, with a key difference being that Wilson "required the services of a record company to mass produce and distribute his work", and lamented that the album was incompatible with the commercial demands of the music industry. Bruce Johnston called the album "a thousand times better than the [original "Smile"] ... It's just the most underrated album in the whole catalog for me."
