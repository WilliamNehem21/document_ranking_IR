Preceding its breakdown, Mazama was initially estimated to remain at a tallness of . Research by Howel Williams superimposed the Crater Lake caldera on other Cascade stratovolcanoes incorporating Mount Shasta in California and Mount Rainier in Washington state, and presumed that Mazama really remained at pre-breakdown, which has been acknowledged as the standard gauge by geologists. By the Holocene, the Mazama fountain of liquid magma was comprised of a few, bunched tops with Mount Scott on the eastern end and Hillman Peak on the far west side. The volcanoes likely rose in height from east to west, and they likewise highlighted volcanic cones and magma vaults on their southern flanks. Cold horns like the Watchman magma stream were additionally present, and the mountain could possibly have continued ice sheets near the summit. At the season of its breakdown, Mount Mazama included a region of and spoke to one of the major volcanoes in the High Cascades part of the more prominent Cascade Range. It was the biggest volcanic building between Mount Shasta in California and the Three Sisters complex in Oregon. Prior to the emission, it had been fundamentally changed by frigid disintegration, which cut U-molded valleys on its southern and southeastern inclines. The northern and western sides of the caldera don't display conspicuous proof of chilly disintegration, since they include magma streams that just experienced change by late Pleistocene age cold movement. Outside of the caldera, most slopes show proof of cold modification aside from those from the Holocene age and low height landforms including Pleistocene magma vaults and soot cones. Mount Scott has likewise been intensely dissolved by ice, and the Union Peak spring of gushing lava presently comprises just of a pyramidal horn.
