In October 2008, Hathaway hosted the NBC late-night sketch comedy "Saturday Night Live". She also starred in Peter Segal's film adaptation of Mel Brooks' television series "Get Smart," in which she played Agent 99, a role she describes as "narcissisticâdownright selfish". Considering the role to be "a childhood dream come true", Hathaway learned martial arts and dancing techniques in preparation. While filming an action sequence, Hathaway split the flesh of her shin to the bone, which led to her receiving 15 stitches. The film, centering on an analyst who dreams of becoming a real field agent and a better spy, was a financial success. Hathaway's following film, the American-Canadian mystery thriller "Passengers" alongside Patrick Wilson, was a critical and commercial failure. She then starred with Debra Winger in "Rachel Getting Married" as Kym, a young woman, who after being released from drug rehabilitation, returns home for her sister's wedding. "Rachel Getting Married" premiered at the 2008 Venice and Toronto International Film Festivals and Hathaway garnered widespread acclaim for her performance. Peter Travers called Hathaway "raw and riveting as Kym" and added that she "acts the hell out of it, achieving a state of sorrowful grace." Hathaway's performance garnered nominations for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress â Drama.
