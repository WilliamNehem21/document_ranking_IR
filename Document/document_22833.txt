Robert Bianco of the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" praised the show and said the decision to focus on fewer subplots might help. Bianco said, "Let's hope the changes work, because "Homicide" is too good to lose, and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside." "The Washington Post" television reviewer Tom Shales called "Homicide" "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." David Zurawik of "The Baltimore Sun" called it the best police drama ever made for television besides "Hill Street Blues". "Baltimore Sun" reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." Tom Jicha of "South Florida Sun-Sentinel" called it "an hour about as fine as there is on the tube" with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." Hal Boedeker, television critic with "The Miami Herald", strongly praised the series, particularly "Bop Gun", which he called "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting "first-rate" and declared "Homicide" the better choice over "NYPD Blue" because it did not resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.
