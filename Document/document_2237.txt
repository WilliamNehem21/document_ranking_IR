Like current elephants, Columbian mammoths were presumably social and lived in matriarchal (female-drove) family gatherings; a large portion of their other social conduct was likewise like that of present day elephants. This is bolstered by fossil gatherings, for example, the Dent Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas, where bunches comprising altogether of female and adolescent Columbian mammoths have been discovered (suggesting female-drove family gatherings). The last array incorporates 22 skeletons, with 15 people speaking to a group of females and adolescents that kicked the bucket in a solitary occasion. It was initially recommended that the crowd was executed by a blaze flood, and that the course of action of a portion of the skeletons proposes that the females may have shaped a guarded ring around the adolescents. In 2016, it was rather proposed that the crowd had passed on by dry spell almost a lessening watering opening; searching follows on the bones repudiates fast internment, and the nonattendance of calves and huge assorted variety of other creature species found accumulated at the site bolster this situation. Another gathering, comprising of a bull and six females, is found at a similar site; albeit the two gatherings kicked the bucket somewhere in the range of 64,000 and 73,000 years back, regardless of whether they passed on in a similar occasion is obscure. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where a few Columbian mammoth skeletons have been uncovered, a trackway like that left by present day elephants prompts one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it kicked the bucket, or another individual may have moved toward the dead or passing on creatureÃ¢ÂÂlike the manner in which present day elephants watch dead relatives for a few days.
