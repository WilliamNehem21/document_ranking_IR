Ottavio's marriage disturbed Alessandro; he battled with the weight of virtuousness and engaged dreams of wedding a princess. He disliked his more youthful sibling's game plan; amid the wedding service he "turned out to be more spooky pale than death itself, and, so they state, is unfit to hold up under this thing, that he, the principal conceived, should see himself denied of such amazing status and of the little girl of an Emperor." In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as ecclesiastical fiefs, a profoundly political move by the pope: in doing as such he gave titles and riches to Pier and named a master who was subservient and owed an obligation of appreciation, ensuring that the duchies would stay under ecclesiastical control. In the meantime, Ottavio was presented on the North of Italy to help Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years of age, wedded to Margaret of Austria and a cultivated and recognized person. In 1547 his dad was killed and Ottavio guaranteed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his dad in-law, and Paul. In doing as such, Ottavio acted contrary to the pope's craving to keep up the duchies as ecclesiastical fiefs, and to Charles, whom he accepted in charge of the plot to kill Pier Luigi.
