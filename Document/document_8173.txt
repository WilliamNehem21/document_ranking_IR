Females venture as much as a few kilometers in July to November to reach settling zones of dry, sandy coast. Home burrowing is a tiring and expand task which may take the female a few hours every day over numerous days to finish. It is completed aimlessly utilizing just the rear legs to burrow a - profound round and hollow opening, in which the tortoise at that point lays up to 16 circular, hard-shelled eggs going from in mass, and the extent of a billiard ball. A few perceptions propose that the normal grip estimate for domed populaces (9.6ÃÂ per grasp for "C. porteri" on Santa Cruz) is bigger than that of saddlebacks (4.6ÃÂ per grasp for "C. duncanensis" on PinzÃÂ³n). The female makes a sloppy fitting for the home opening out of soil blended with pee, seals the home by pushing down solidly with her plastron, and abandons them to be hatched by the sun. Females may lay one to four grips for every season. Temperature assumes a job in the sex of the hatchlings, with lower-temperature homes delivering more guys and higher-temperature homes creating more females. This is connected near hatching time, since grasps laid early brood amid the cool season and have longer hatching periods (delivering more guys), while eggs laid later brood for a shorter period in the hot season (creating more females).
