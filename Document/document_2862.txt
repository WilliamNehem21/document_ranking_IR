Amid the 1956 season, Weiss started to clue to the media that Martin was a poor impact on his kindred players, particularly on his flat mate, Mantle, with whom he frequently frolicked until the early hours of the morning. An honorable man, Weiss did not feel that Martin fit the picture he needed for the Yankees, and may have been irritated by the player's upheaval on being sent to the minors in 1950. By 1956, the Yankees were building up the following flood of infielders, including Bobby Richardson and Tony Kubek. Weiss would have gotten a kick out of the chance to exchange Martin, yet was hindered by the way that the second baseman was incredibly famous with Yankee fans and with the press covering the group. In spite of the fact that Martin showed up in the 1956 All-Star GameÃ¢ÂÂhis solitary All-Star appearance as a playerÃ¢ÂÂhis capacities as a player never completely returned subsequent to leaving the military. With Richardson advancing quickly through the Yankee homestead framework, Martin stressed that his days with the group were numbered. All things considered, he hit .264 with nine grand slams for the Yankees in 1956, and in the 1956 World Series against the Dodgers, Martin played well both in the field and at the plate, getting the hit that gave the Yankees the lead for good in Game Four to tie the Series, and hitting .296 with two homers as the Yankees won in seven diversions, hence completing his World Series vocation as a player with a .333 batting normal.
