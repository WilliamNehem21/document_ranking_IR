Tragically for James, arrangement with Spain demonstrated commonly disagreeable, both with general society and with James' court. The English Parliament was effectively antagonistic towards Spain and Catholicism, and in this way, when called by James in 1621, the individuals sought after an implementation of recusancy laws, a maritime battle against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales. James' Lord Chancellor, Francis Bacon, was arraigned before the House of Lords for debasement. The arraignment was the first since 1459 without the lord's legitimate assent as a bill of attainder. The episode set a critical point of reference as the procedure of reprimand would later be utilized against Charles and his supporters: the Duke of Buckingham, Archbishop William Laud, and the Earl of Strafford. James demanded that the House of Commons be concerned solely with household undertakings, while the individuals challenged that they had the benefit of free discourse inside the Commons' dividers, requesting war with Spain and a Protestant Princess of Wales. Charles, similar to his dad, considered the talk of his marriage in the Commons insolent and an encroachment of his dad's illustrious privilege. In January 1622, James broke down Parliament, furious at what he saw as the individuals' impudence and uncompromising nature.
