In 1992, Thomas Bolliger portrayed a few teeth of "Seorsumuscardinus" from the Swiss territory of TÃÂ¤gernaustrasse (MN 4; early Miocene, see MN zonation) as a vague dormouse (family Gliridae) maybe identified with "Eomuscardinus". After six years, Hans de Bruijn named the new variety and species "Seorsumuscardinus alpinus" based on material from Oberdorf in Austria (additionally MN 4) and included fossils from TÃÂ¤gernaustrasse and from Karydia in Greece (MN 4) in "Seorsumuscardinus". In 2007, Jerome Prieto and Madeleine BÃÂ¶hme named "Heissigia bolligeri" as another class and species from Affalterbach in Bavaria (MN 5, more youthful than MN 4), and alluded the TÃÂ¤gernaustrasse material to it, however neglected to contrast their new variety with "Seorsumuscardinus". After two years, Prieto distributed a note to think about the two and reasoned that they were referable to similar family, however extraordinary species. Accordingly, the class "Seorsumuscardinus" presently incorporates the species "Seorsumuscardinus alpinus" from MN 4 and "S.ÃÂ bolligeri" from MN 5. Prieto temporarily set the TÃÂ¤gernaustrasse material with "S.ÃÂ alpinus". He additionally referenced "Pentaglis fÃÂ¶ldvÃÂ¡ry", a name given to a solitary upper molar from the center Miocene of Hungary, which is currently lost. In spite of the fact that the example demonstrates a few similitudes with "Seorsumuscardinus", distributed outlines are too poor to even think about confirming the character of "Pentaglis", and Prieto believed the last name to be a unidentifiable "nomen dubium".
