"Triaenops menamena" is currently one of four living species in the genus "Triaenops"; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African "T.Â afer" and the Yemeni "T.Â parvus" from "T.Â persicus" and removed three other species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus "Paratriaenops". An extinct species, "Triaenops goodmani", is known from northwestern Madagascar. In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used phylogenetic and coalescent methodologies to investigate the history of the "Triaenops" group. They found that "T.Â menamena" (as "T.Â rufus") was closest to mainland African "Triaenops" (but did not study Middle Eastern bats) and concluded that "T.Â menamena" and the species of "Paratriaenops" (then still placed in "Triaenops") independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by "T.Â menamena" was dated to about 660,000 years ago. Benda and Vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in "Triaenops" and included Middle Eastern "T.Â persicus" and "T.Â parvus" in their analysis. They found little resolution of relationships within "Triaenops", but some evidence suggested that "T.Â menamena" is more closely related to the Middle Eastern species than to "T.Â afer" in mainland Africa; therefore, "T.Â menamena" may have reached Madagascar from the Middle East or northeastern Africa. They also placed the split between "T.Â menamena" and the other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.
