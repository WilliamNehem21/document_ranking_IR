While arrangements for Operation PBSUCCESS were in progress, Washington issued a progression of articulations censuring the Guatemalan government, charging that it had been invaded by socialists. The State Department likewise solicited the Organization from American States to alter the plan of the Inter-American Conference, which was booked to be held in Caracas in March 1954, mentioning the expansion of a thing titled "Mediation of International Communism in the American Republics", which was broadly observed as a move focusing on Guatemala. On 29 and 30 January 1954, the Guatemalan government distributed reports containing data spilled to it by an individual from Castillo Armas' group who had betrayed him. Ailing in unique records, the administration had occupied with poor fabrication to upgrade the data it had, undermining the believability of its charges. A spate of captures pursued of partners of Castillo Armas inside Guatemala, and the government provided articulations embroiling a "Legislature of the North" in a plot to topple ÃÂrbenz. Washington denied these claims, and the U.S. media consistently took the side of their legislature; even distributions which had up to that point given generally adjusted inclusion of Guatemala, for example, "The Christian Science Monitor", recommended that ÃÂrbenz had capitulated to socialist purposeful publicity. A few Congressmen likewise indicated the claims from the Guatemalan government as evidence that it had turned out to be socialist.
