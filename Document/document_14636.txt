The most punctual savant records of Coldrum Long Barrow were never distributed. There are claims that toward the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Reverend Mark Noble, Rector of Barming, arranged an arrangement of the site for "Courteous fellow's Magazine", albeit no duplicates have been delivered to confirm this. Somewhere in the range of 1842 and 1844, the Reverend Beale Post created "Druidical Remains at Coldrum", in which he portrayed the landmark, despite the fact that it stayed unpublished at the time. Partner the site with the druids of Britain's Iron Age, Post's proposal was that the name "Coldrum" got from the semantically Celtic "Gael-Dun", and that Belgic boss were buried there. He further revealed that in both 1804 and 1825, skulls had been found at the site. In 1844, a collector named Thomas Wright distributed a note on the Coldrum Stones and other Medway Megaliths in "The Archeological Journal". Wright had been alarmed to their reality by a nearby vicar, the Reverend Lambert B. Larking, and continued to visit them with him. Portraying the Coldrums, Wright referenced "a littler hover of stones" to the others in the territory, with "an underground cromlech in the center". He further included that "it is a convention of the working class that a consistent line of stones kept running from Coldrum direct to the notable landmark called Kit's Cotty [sic] House", crediting this conviction to different stone monuments dissipated all through the scene.
