The ocean mink was sought after by hide brokers because of its huge size; this made it more attractive than other mink species further inland. The unregulated exchange in the long run prompted its annihilation, which is thought to have happened somewhere in the range of 1860 and 1920. The ocean mink was only sometimes located after 1860. The last two recorded executes of an ocean mink were made in Maine in 1880 close Jonesport, Maine, and Campobello Island, New Brunswick in 1894, in spite of the fact that the 1894 slaughter is conjectured to be of huge American minks. Hide dealers made snares to get ocean minks and furthermore sought after them with puppies, despite the fact that they were once in a while caught. In the event that an ocean mink got away into a little opening on the rough edges, it was uncovered by seekers utilizing scoops and crowbars. On the off chance that it was far from the seekers, it was shot and afterward recovered utilizing an iron bar with a screw on the far end. On the off chance that it was concealing, it was smoked out and choked. The minks' nighttime conduct may have been caused from weight by hide merchants who chased them in light.
