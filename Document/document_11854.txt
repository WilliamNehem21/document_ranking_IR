Amid the wars against Napoleonic France, Gibraltar served first as a Royal Navy base from which barricades of the ports of CÃÂ¡diz, Cartagena and Toulon were mounted, at that point as an entryway for British powers and supplies in the Peninsular War somewhere in the range of 1807 and 1814. In July 1801 a French and Spanish maritime power battled the two Battles of Algeciras off Gibraltar, which finished in catastrophe for the Spanish when two of their biggest warships each confused the other with the adversary, connected one another, impacted, burst into flames and detonated, killing about 2,000 Spanish mariners. After two years Gibraltar filled in as a base for Lord Nelson in his endeavors to bring the French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve to fight, which finished in the Battle of Trafalgar in which Nelson was executed and Villeneuve caught. Nelson cruised to Gibraltar in June 1803 to dispatch the Trafalgar Campaign and manage the barricades against France and Spain, however he invested little energy shorewards. On 28 October 1805, seven days after the Battle of Trafalgar, the seriously harmed HMS "Triumph" came back to Gibraltar with Nelson's body on board; Admiral Collingwood's dispatch to General Fox, reporting the triumph and Nelson's passing, was imprinted in the pages of the "Gibraltar Chronicle". It in this way turned into the main paper on the planet to report the triumph at Trafalgar, two weeks in front of "The Times".
