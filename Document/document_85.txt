After his vanishing at Thurii, Alcibiades immediately reached the Spartans, "promising to render them help and administration more prominent than all the mischief he had recently done them as a foe" in the event that they would offer him asylum. The Spartans allowed this solicitation and got him among them. On account of this surrender, the Athenians sentenced him to death "in absentia" and reallocated his property. In the discussion at Sparta about whether to send a power to diminish Syracuse, Alcibiades talked and imparted dread of Athenian desire into the Spartan ephors by educating them that the Athenians would have liked to vanquish Sicily, Italy, and even Carthage. Yale student of history Donald Kagan trusts that Alcibiades purposely overstated the plans of the Athenians to persuade the Spartans of the advantage they remained to pick up from his assistance. Kagan affirms that Alcibiades had not yet obtained his "unbelievable" notoriety, and the Spartans considered him to be "a vanquished and chased man" whose approaches "delivered vital disappointments" and brought "no conclusive outcome". In the event that exact, this appraisal underscores one of Alcibiades' most noteworthy gifts, his very influential rhetoric. Subsequent to influencing the risk to appear to be fast approaching, Alcibiades exhorted the Spartans to send troops and in particular, a Spartan administrator to teach and help the Syracusans.
