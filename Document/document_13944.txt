The Spanish trusted that by squeezing ahead to Lake PetÃÂ©n ItzÃÂ¡ they would connect up with a concurrent undertaking headed by President Barrios himself, uninformed that Barrios had not achieved the locale. DÃÂ­az de Velasco conveyed an exploring gathering of 50 musketeers joined by local bowmen on 6 April. They before long discovered proof of late Itza camps in the zone, evaluated to be a month old. The scouts found a reasonable street traveling north to the Itza kingdom, and the military set off along it. The primary power stayed outdoors around ten associations (26ÃÂ miles or 42ÃÂ km) south of the lake, while a littler exploring party was sent off ahead; this comprised of two Spanish officers, two bowmen and two muleteers from Verapaz, with two ChÃÂ¼ol-talking local translators. The exploring party progressed to the savannah just toward the south of Lake PetÃÂ©n ItzÃÂ¡, where they experienced around 30 Itza seekers equipped with lances, shields and quits, chasing hounds. The seekers drew their weapons and arranged to battle, yet the Mopan translator was told to clarify that the Spanish party were dealers who came in harmony, joined by ministers. The Spanish started to presume that the translator was plotting against them with the Itza seekers, and one of the Verapaz bowmen hauled him out from among the seekers. The experience declined into a fight, and the Itzas by and by drew weapons. The Spanish terminated their black powder rifles, lethally injuring two seekers, and a Verapaz Indian accused the Itzas of a cleaver. The seekers fled, leaving the exploring party possessing the nourishment and bolts at the chasing camp.
