Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: an obsessive lover in "Darr", and a murderer in "Baazigar". "Darr" marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase "I love you, K-k-k-Kiran" were popular with audiences. For "Darr" he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for "Sir". "Baazigar", in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In "The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture", Sonal Khullar called the character "the consummate anti-hero". His performance in "Baazigar", which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the "Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema" stated that Khan "defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero". Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in "Maya Memsaab", although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification. The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.
