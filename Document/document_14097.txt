He likewise conveyed an envelope loaded with progressive materials that incorporated a guard sticker with the Thomas Jefferson motto, "When the administration fears the general population, there is freedom. At the point when the general population dread the administration, there is oppression." Underneath, McVeigh had stated, "Possibly now, there will be freedom!" with a hand-replicated quote by John Locke attesting that a man has a privilege to murder somebody who removes his freedom.
