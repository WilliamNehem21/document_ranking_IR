The spores are smooth, generally ellipsoid fit as a fiddle, inequilateral when seen in profile, and measure 7.6Ã¢ÂÂ 10 by 3Ã¢ÂÂ 3.4ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. They seem hyaline (translucent) to yellowish in a weaken arrangement of KOH, and cinnamon to pale ochraceous when recolored with Melzer's reagent. The basidia are to some degree fell, hyaline, and 5Ã¢ÂÂ 6ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m thick. The cystidia are dispersed, once in a while masterminded in groups (particularly on the gill edge), more often than not with an ochraceous-darker substance, however once in a while hyaline. They are club-formed to some degree cylindric and measure 34Ã¢ÂÂ 60 by 10Ã¢ÂÂ 13ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m. The fingernail skin of the top is an ixotrichodermiumÃ¢ÂÂa cell plan where the furthest hyphae are coagulated and rise generally parallel, similar to hairs, opposite to the top surface. These hyphae are hyaline and barely cylindric, estimating 1.4Ã¢ÂÂ 3ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m in distance across. The stem surface is made of dissipated packs of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are darker or in some cases hyaline in KOH, club-molded to subcylindrical groups mixed among hyaline cells. These groups are underlain by a layer of thick, hyaline, vertically arranged and parallel hyphae that are molded like tight barrels. Clip associations are missing from the hyphae.
