The remaining parts of Beringian wolves have been found in Alaska and as far eastbound as the Yukon in Canada. Examples that have been distinguished by their skull morphology and appendage morphology to be Beringian wolves have been found in the Natural Trap Cave at the base of the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, United States. These were radiocarbon dated to somewhere in the range of 25,800 and 14,300YBP, and this area is legitimately south of what might around then have been the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. This recommends an impermanent channel existed between the icy masses from 25,800YBP until the development of the ice sheets 16,000-13,000YBP. The movement of the Beringian wolf southwards is expected to have been the aftereffect of seeking after prey species, as this cavern additionally contained examples of steppe buffalo that had relocated from Beringia and would have been prey for wolves, and muskox that is known to be an imperative prey types of the Beringian wolf. Desperate wolves were missing north of 42ÃÂ°N scope in the Late Pleistocene; consequently, this district would have been accessible for Beringian wolves to grow southwards. There is no proof of extension past this locale.
