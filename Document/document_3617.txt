Following a night walk Derby assaulted the French camp on 21 October while they were at supper, shocking them and causing overwhelming beginning setbacks. The French revitalized and there was an extended hand-to-hand battle, which finished when the leader of the little English battalion in the chÃÂ¢teau sortied and fell upon the back of the French. They broke and fled. Derby's mounted men-at-arms sought after them tenaciously. French losses are dubious, yet were substantial. They are portrayed by present day students of history as "shocking", "amazingly high", "stunning", and "overwhelming". Many French nobles were taken prisoner; lower positioning men were, as was standard, put to the sword. The French authority, Louis of Poitiers, passed on of his injuries. Enduring detainees incorporated the second in direction, Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain, two checks, seven viscounts, three nobles, the seneschals of Clermont and Toulouse, a nephew of the Pope thus numerous knights that they were not tallied. The payments alone made a fortune for huge numbers of the officers in Derby's military, just as Derby himself, who was said to have made at any rate ÃÂ£50,000 (ÃÂ£ in 2019 terms) from the day's hostages. Over the next year Philip paid substantial sums from the imperial treasury as commitments towards the prisoners' payoffs.
