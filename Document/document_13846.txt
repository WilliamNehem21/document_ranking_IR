The rest of the spreads in the Apollo 15 space explorers' control (298 from the gathering of 400 and 61 more from Worden) were held by NASA in the midst of the examination; Worden said he surrendered them at Kraft's solicitation on the understanding they would be returned once the examination was finished, however the spreads were exchanged to the National Archives in August 1973. There was a Justice Department examination concerning the spreads. Its Criminal Division chose in 1974 that no arraignment was justified, yet the Civil Division the next year accepted the spreads would be held by the administration. Kraft expressed, "it was faulty that any law had been broken and [the Justice Department] understood that hauling space explorers into court would not be a prevalent diversion." In 1978, the division issued a report demonstrating that while the legislature may have some case to the Herrick covers because of the presence of having been made revenue driven, it presumably did not to the 298, which the space explorers had said were planned as blessings. In 1979, the division educated NASA that it had presumed that the legislature would almost certainly lose if the space explorers sued for the spreads. There was restriction among congresspersons to the spreads being returned, and in February 1980 a goals passed the Senate that the legislature should keep the spreads in light of the commercialization. It kicked the bucket in the House of Representatives. In 1983, Worden sued, and the administration consented to restore every one of the spreads to the three space travelers. The administration felt it couldn't effectively safeguard the claim, and that NASA either approved the spreads to be flown or knew about them.
