All through his governorship, al-Ikhshid was occupied with clashes with other local strongmen for authority over Syria, without which Egypt was defenseless against attack from the east, yet not at all like numerous other Egyptian pioneers, quite the Tulunids themselves, he was set up to stick around for his opportunity and bargain with his opponents. Despite the fact that he was at first responsible for the whole of Syria, he was compelled to surrender the northern half to Ibn Ra'iq somewhere in the range of 939 and 942. Following Ibn Ra'iq's homicide, al-Ikhshid reimposed his power over northern Syria, just to have it tested by the Hamdanids. In 944 al-Ikhshid met Caliph al-Muttaqi at Raqqa; the caliph had fled there from the different strongmen competing to grab him and control the caliphal government in Baghdad. Albeit fruitless in inducing the caliph to come to Egypt, he got acknowledgment of innate standard over Egypt, Syria and the Hejaz for a long time. Following his flight, the eager Hamdanid sovereign Sayf al-Dawla caught Aleppo and northern Syria in the fall of 944, and albeit crushed and driven out of Syria by Ibn Tughj himself in the following year, a bargain partitioning the district along the lines of the concurrence with Ibn Ra'iq was closed in October. Ibn Tughj kicked the bucket nine months after the fact, leaving his child Unujur as leader of his spaces, under the tutelage of the amazing dark eunuch Abu al-Misk Kafur.
