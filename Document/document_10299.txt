The division itself was considered to have been a military disappointment. Not one of its individuals was granted an Iron Cross while serving in it. Schmidhuber saw that, "[w]ith a light mortar you can essentially pursue him [the Albanian] around the globe. Amid the assault he goes just to the extent he discovers something to take or sack. For him, the war is over when he catches a goat, a plowshare or the wheel of a sewing machine." Professor Paul Mojzes composes that the division was better known for carrying out monstrosities against Serbs than it was for adding to the German war exertion. Its job in ousting Jews from Kosovo has been tested by the Albanian student of history Shaban Sinani, who asserts that the division did not take an interest in any extraditions for the Germans' benefit. David Patterson, a student of history gaining practical experience in hostile to Semitism and the Holocaust, composes that the division "assumed a noteworthy job in rendering the Balkans "Judenrein" in the winter of 1943Ã¢ÂÂ 1944." During the Kosovo War of 1998Ã¢ÂÂ 1999, the American columnist Chris Hedges affirmed that some Kosovo Liberation Army pioneers were straightforwardly slipped from individuals from the division and were ideologically impacted by it. Malcolm has tested this case.
