Yogi Berra was the Yankee chief for 1984, and the group completed third, 17 recreations behind the Tigers. At the point when, toward the beginning of the 1985 season, Steinbrenner swore that Berra would remain supervisor for the entire season, there was prompt theory that Martin would return, which he did, Berra being expelled after 16 recreations. Expressed Martin, "George and I have the best relationship I've at any point had with him." With a MVP season from Don Mattingly and a solid exertion from Rickey Henderson, who had been procured by the Yankees, the group played well all through the late spring, coming to inside a diversion and a half of the division-driving Toronto Blue Jays on September 12. They at that point lost eight of every a line, and as the Yankees dropped out of the race, as indicated by Pennington, "Martin appeared to liquefy down with it." On September 22, 1985, while at a lodging bar in Baltimore, Martin battled one of his pitchers, Ed Whitson, who was bigger, heavier and prepared in hand to hand fighting. Martin endured a broken arm. The Yankees recouped to win 97 recreations, however completed two diversions back of the Blue Jays, wiped out on the second to a day ago of the period. On October 27, 1985, Martin was terminated again as Yankee director, supplanted by long-term Yankee player Lou Piniella. By the by, Steinbrenner, trusting that Martin could again convey a title to the Yankees and, dreading he may do as such somewhere else, expanded Martin's pay; the four-time supervisor of the Yankees diverted down worthwhile ideas from the White Sox and Indians.
