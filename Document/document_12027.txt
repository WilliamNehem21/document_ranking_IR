The outer appearance of Holkham can best be portrayed as a colossal Roman royal residence. In any case, similarly as with most compositional structures, it is never entirely that basic. Holkham is a Palladian house, but then even by Palladian gauges the outside appearance is grave and without ornamentation. This can more likely than not be followed to Coke himself. The on location, managing engineer, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and requested "largeness", which can be translated as solace. Henceforth rooms that were enough lit by one window, had just one, as a second may have improved the outer appearance yet could have made a room cold or drafty. Thus, the couple of windows on the piano nobile, albeit symmetrically put and adjusted, seem lost in an ocean of brickwork; yet these yellow blocks were given a role as careful reproductions of antiquated Roman blocks explicitly for Holkham. Over the windows of the piano nobile, where on a genuine Palladian structure the windows of a mezzanine would be, there is nothing. The explanation behind this is the twofold stature of the state rooms on the piano nobile; in any case, not by any means a visually impaired window, for example, those regularly found in Palladio's very own work, is allowed to ease the seriousness of the exterior. On the ground floor, the rusticated dividers are penetrated by little windows more reminiscent of a jail than a great house. One compositional reporter, Nigel Nicolson, has depicted the house as showing up as useful as a Prussian riding school.
