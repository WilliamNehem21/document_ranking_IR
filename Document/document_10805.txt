Howard Browne, who had been on a time away from Ziff-Davis to compose fiction, took over as editorial manager and started by discarding 300,000 expressions of stock that Palmer had procured before he left. Browne had desire of moving "Astounding" upmarket, and his contention was reinforced by Street and Smith, one of the longest settled and most regarded distributers, who shut down the majority of their mash magazines in the late spring of 1949. The pulps were biting the dust, to a great extent because of the accomplishment of wallets, and Street and Smith chose to focus on their smooth magazines. A few pulps battled on for a couple of more years, yet Browne had the capacity to convince Ziff and Davis that what's to come was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction spending plan from one penny to a roof of five pennies for every word. Browne figured out how to get guarantees of new stories from some outstanding creators, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He delivered a fake issue in April 1950, and wanted to dispatch the new manifestation of "Stunning" in April 1951, the 25th commemoration of the principal issue. Nonetheless, the monetary effect of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, prompted spending cuts. The plans were dropped, and Ziff-Davis never restored the thought.
