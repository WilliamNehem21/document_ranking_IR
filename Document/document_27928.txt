In 1973, Roberts published "Tito, MihailoviÄ, and the Allies, 1941â1945" which included information about the GermanâPartisan negotiations of March 1943. The publishing of the book disturbed the Yugoslav government, which lodged a complaint with the US Department of State. The thrust of the Yugoslav complaint was that the book equated the Partisans with the Chetniks. Roberts denied this, stating that his book did not equate the two or accept the Partisan mythology of the Partisans as a "liberation movement" or the Chetniks as "traitorous collaborators". The book also identified Äilas as the main negotiator. In 1977, Äilas confirmed his involvement in his book "Wartime", but stated that he would not have disclosed the details of the negotiations if it had not already been known through Roberts' book. In 1978, Tito admitted that the negotiations occurred, but characterised their purpose as "solely to obtain German recognition of belligerent status for the Partisans". In 1985, after Tito's death, LekoviÄ was able to publish the results of his investigation that had started in 1967, in "Martovski pregovori 1943" (The March Negotiations 1943). In 1989, PopoviÄ gave his version of events in Aleksandar NenadoviÄ's "Razgovori s KoÄom" (Conversations with KoÄa), followed by Velebit in Mira Å uvar's "Vladimir Velebit: svjedok historije" (Vladimir Velebit: Witness to History) in 2001, and in his own "Tajne i zamke Drugog svjetskog rata" (Secrets and Traps of the Second World War) the following year.
