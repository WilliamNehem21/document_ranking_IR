The gathering at that point came back to Westminster toward the evening, and the rulers formally recognized that Edward II was never again to be King. A few discourses were made. Mortimer, talking in the interest of the masters, declared their choice. Edward II, he declared, would surrender and "...Sir EdwardÃÂ ... ought to have the legislature of the domain and be delegated lord". The French recorder Jean Le Bel portrayed how the rulers continued to report Edward II's "less than ideal deeds and activities" to make a lawful record which was appropriately displayed to parliament. This record announced "such a man was unfit ever to wear the crown or call himself King". This rundown of wrongdoingsÃ¢ÂÂmost likely drawn up by Orleton and Stratford actuallyÃ¢ÂÂwere known as the Articles of Accusation. The ministers gave messagesÃ¢ÂÂOrleton, for instance, discussed how "a stupid ruler will demolish his kin", and, report Dunham and Wood, he "abided weightily upon the imprudence and unwisdom of the lord, and upon his puerile doings". This, says Ian Mortimer, was "an enormous message, awakening those present in the manner in which he knew best, through the intensity of the expression of God". Orleton put together his message with respect to the scriptural content "Where there is no representative the general population will fall" from the Book of Proverbs, while the Archbishop of Canterbury took for his content "Vox Populi, Vox Dei".
