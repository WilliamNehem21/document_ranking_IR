Bannon pursued "Odd Girl Out" with "I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman Ã¢ÂÂ Must Society Reject Me?)" in 1959. "I Am a Woman" (the working and regular title) highlighted Laura after her issue with Beth, as she ends up in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and turns into his closest companion. Laura needs to pick between a straight lady with a wild and inquisitive streak, and an interesting new character that turned out to be her most famous of the arrangement, Beebo Brinker, who came to exemplify the depiction of a completely butch lesbian. Beebo was keen, attractive, gallant, and virile. By and by dependent on what Bannon knew, Beebo was about tall with an imposing voice and an impressive body. The identity notwithstanding, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer requirement for Beebo to exist. Subsequent to investing energy in Greenwich Village and not discovering anybody like her, Bannon rather made her. She recollected that, "I set up Beebo together similarly as I needed her, in my heart and mindÃÂ ... She was simply, truly, the butch I had always wanted." The goals to "I Am a Woman" totally mocked the patterns of hopeless lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a legend to numerous lesbians.
