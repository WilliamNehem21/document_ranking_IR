After Becket's homicide in December 1170 King Henry sent Barre to Rome, joined by the Archbishop of Rouen, the ministers of ÃÂvreux and Worcester, and other imperial agents, to argue the illustrious case with the papacy. The mission's goal was to make it obvious to Alexander that Henry had nothing to do with Becket's homicide and that the ruler was sickened that it had occurred. Barre was at first denied a gathering with Alexander, yet in the end the agents were permitted to meet with the pope. Despite the fact that the mission was not a total achievement, the regal commission managed to influence the papacy not to force a prohibit, or restriction on administrative ceremonies, on England or to banish the lord. In no time thereafter Barre was conceded the workplace of Archdeacon of Lisieux, presumably as a reward for his endeavors in Rome in 1171. In September he was named a regal equity. He was named chancellor to King Henry's oldest living child Henry for a concise period in 1172 and 1173, yet when the more youthful Henry defied his dad and looked for asylum at the French regal court, Barre would not go along with him estranged abroad and came back to the lord's administration. Barre took with him the more youthful Henry's seal.
