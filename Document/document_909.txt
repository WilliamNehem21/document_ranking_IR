The disclosure of "Iguanodon" has for some time been joined by a prevalent legend. The story goes that Gideon Mantell's better half, Mary Ann, found the main teeth of an "Iguanodon" in the strata of Tilgate Forest in Whitemans Green, Cuckfield, Sussex, England, in 1822 while her significant other was visiting a patient. In any case, there is no proof that Mantell took his significant other with him while seeing patients. Besides, he conceded in 1851 that he himself had discovered the teeth, in spite of the fact that he had recently expressed in 1827 that Mrs. Mantell had without a doubt discovered the first of the teeth later named Iguanodon. Other later creators concur that the story isn't surely false. It is known from his note pads that Mantell previously obtained vast fossil bones from the quarry at Whitemans Green in 1820. Since additionally theropod teeth were discovered, in this manner having a place with carnivores, he at first deciphered these bones, which he endeavored to consolidate into an incomplete skeleton, as those of a goliath crocodile. In 1821 Mantell referenced the find of herbivorous teeth and started to think about how conceivable it is that a vast herbivorous reptile was available in the strata. In any case, in his 1822 production "Fossils of the South Downs" he up 'til now did not set out to propose an association between the teeth and his exceptionally deficient skeleton, assuming that his finds introduced two substantial structures, one meat eating ("a creature of the Lizard Tribe of gigantic size"), the different herbivorous.
