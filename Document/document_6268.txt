"Alectroenas" blue pigeons are firmly interrelated and happen generally all through islands in the western Indian Ocean. They are allopatric and can along these lines be viewed as a superspecies. There are three surviving species: the Madagascar blue pigeon ("A. madagascariensis"), the Comoros blue pigeon ("A. sganzini"), and the Seychelles blue pigeon ("A. pulcherrima"). The three Mascarene islands were each home to an animal varieties, which are all wiped out: the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Rodrigues blue pigeon ("A. payandeei"), and the RÃÂ©union blue pigeon ("A." sp.). Contrasted and different pigeons, the blue pigeons are medium to substantial, stocky, and have longer wings and tails. Every one of the animal groups have particular versatile passion on the head and neck. The tibiotarsus is nearly long and the tarsometatarsus short. The blue pigeons may have colonized the Mascarenes, the Seychelles or a now submerged hotspot island by "island bouncing". They may have advanced into an unmistakable family there before achieving Madagascar. Their nearest hereditary relative is the cloven-feathered pigeon of New Caledonia ("Drepanoptila holosericea"), from which they isolated 8Ã¢ÂÂ 9 million years prior. Their genealogical gathering gives off an impression of being the natural product pigeons ("Ptilinopus") of Southeast Asia and Oceania.
