Soejima's first significant work for the arrangement was chipping away at side characters for "Persona 2" close by Kaneko. Kaneko place Soejima responsible for the arrangement's craft bearing after "Persona 2" as Kaneko did not have any desire to engrave his illustration style on the "Persona" arrangement, and furthermore needed Soejima to pick up involvement. Soejima felt a level of weight when he was given his new job, as the arrangement had collected a generous after amid Kaneko's residency. In a later meeting, Soejima said that despite the fact that he regarded and respected Kaneko, he never intentionally imitated the last's work, and in the long run subsided into the job of satisfying the devotees of the "Persona" arrangement, moving toward character plans with making something new instead of alluding back to Kaneko's work. For his character structures, Soejima utilizes genuine individuals he has met or seen, taking a gander at what their appearance says about their identity. On the off chance that his plans come excessively near the general population he has seen, he completes a harsh sketch while remembering the identity of the individual. For his work on "Persona Q", his first time working with a distorted Chibi style because of its connections with the "Etrian Odyssey" arrangement, Soejima considered what fans felt about the characters. A pivotal piece of his plan system was seeing what made a character emerge, at that point modifying those highlights so they stayed conspicuous even with the overhaul.
