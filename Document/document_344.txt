A few English and American works of art including "The Death of Major Pierson" by John Singleton Copley (1738Ã¢ÂÂ 1815)Ã¢ÂÂ likewise painted inside two years of the occasionÃ¢ÂÂhad set up a point of reference for a contemporary subject. Copley had likewise painted a few expansive and courageous delineations of debacles adrift which GÃÂ©ricault may have known from prints: "Watson and the Shark" (1778), in which a dark man is fundamental to the activity, and which, similar to "The Raft of the Medusa", focused on the performers of the show instead of the seascape; "The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782" (1791), which was an effect on both the style and topic of GÃÂ©ricault's work; and "" (1790s), which has a strikingly comparable organization. A further imperative point of reference for the political segment was crafted by Francisco Goya, especially his "The Disasters of War" arrangement of 1810Ã¢ÂÂ 12, and his 1814 artful culmination "The Third of May 1808". Goya likewise created a work of art of a fiasco adrift, called essentially "Wreck" (date obscure), yet in spite of the fact that the supposition is comparative, the arrangement and style share nothing for all intents and purpose with "The Raft of the Medusa". It is improbable that GÃÂ©ricault had seen the image.
