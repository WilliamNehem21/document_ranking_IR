On 15 March 1944, BÃÂ¤r, presently a "Noteworthy" and restored from the downgrade, was given order of II./"Jagdgeschwader" 1 (JGÃÂ 1). This was after the demise of Hauptmann Hermann Segatz on 8 March 1944. JGÃÂ 1 was entrusted with "Reichsverteidigung" (Defense of the Reich) and outfitted with the Focke Wulf 190 A-7 warrior. Spirit of the gathering took off after his arrangement. He was viewed as the informal pioneer of the gathering and the best officer in the whole "Geschwader". On 11 April 1944, BÃÂ¤r accomplished his 199th aeronautical triumph over a B-17 close Fallersleben. His 200th airborne triumph, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator, was guaranteed on 22 April joined by his normal wingman Warrant Officer ("Oberfeldwebel") Leo Schuhmacher, who might be granted the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 March 1945 as a military pilot in II./JGÃÂ 1. BÃÂ¤r had recently arrived at StÃÂ¶rmede landing strip from an II./JGÃÂ 1 catch when a smoking United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24 of the 458th Bombardment Group passed overhead. BÃÂ¤r and his wingman rapidly got into their air ship and caught the B-24. The plane's heavy armament specialists had just rescued of the flying machine, making it a simple aeronautical triumph. BÃÂ¤r came back to StÃÂ¶rmede runway to the congrats of his men. This twofold century triumph earned BÃÂ¤r his third and last reference in the "Wehrmachtbericht" on 24 April 1944. After Oesau's passing on 11 May 1944, BÃÂ¤r was made acting Wing Commander of JGÃÂ 1. In June, he was designated Wing Commander of "Jagdgeschwader" 3 (JGÃÂ 3) following the passing of Friedrich-Karl MÃÂ¼ller. Before the finish of 1944, BÃÂ¤r's score had ascended to 203.
