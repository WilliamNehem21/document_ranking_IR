Bryant got comfortable with the communist diary "The Masses" through Portland occupant and attorney C. E. S. Wood, who in the end wedded Field and who frequently added to the magazine. Energetic about its substance, especially articles by Portland local John Reed, Bryant started raising memberships for it. Emma Goldman, an outstanding rebel whom Wood had shielded in court, gave a discourse in Reed's respect at the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) lobby in Portland. She and other political activists, for example, Alexander Berkman, were among visitors engaged by Bryant and her better half. In 1914, Reed, a Harvard graduate and set up author who by then lived in Greenwich Village, got back home for a visit, amid which he talked at the University Club of Portland against the class framework. Precisely how or when or how frequently Bryant and Reed met is unsure, however close Christmas 1915 when Reed again got back home to visit his bereaved mother, the youthful couple declared their affection at an evening gathering. Reed came back to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, relinquishing her marriage, tailed him three days after the fact. Trullinger petitioned for legal separation, which was allowed in July 1916, on grounds of departure.
