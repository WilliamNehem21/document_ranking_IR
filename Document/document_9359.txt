He was cast in the number one spot job in Danny Boyle's blood and gore movie "28 Days Later" (2002). He depicted pandemic survivor Jim, who is "confounded to get himself alone in the ruined, dystopian world" in the wake of waking from a state of extreme lethargy in a London emergency clinic. Throwing executive Gail Stevens recommended that Boyle tryout Murphy for the job, having been inspired with his execution in "Disco Pigs". Stevens expressed that it was simply in the wake of seeing his slim physical make-up amid shooting that they chose to include him completely bare toward the start of the film. She reviewed that Murphy was modest on set with the inclination to look somewhat far from the camera, however enthused that he had a "marvelous, marginally de-invigorated, coasting quality that is incredible for the film." Released in the UK in late 2002, by the next July "28 Days Later" had turned into a sleeper hit in North America and a noteworthy achievement around the world, placing Murphy before a mass gathering of people out of the blue. His execution earned him a designation for Best Newcomer at the eighth Empire Awards and Breakthrough Male Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards. Murphy maintained that he believed the film to be a lot further than a zombie or thriller, communicating shock at the film's prosperity and that American gatherings of people reacted well to its substance and savagery.
