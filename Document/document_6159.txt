I heard rumorsÃÂ ... that I could never work again in light of the fact that nobody had ever taken a film 100 days over calendar." Spielberg himself was absent for the shooting of the last scene in which the shark detonates, as he trusted that the group were wanting to toss him in the water when the scene was finished.
