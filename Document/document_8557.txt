Bacon said that opportunity assumed a critical job in his work, and that he frequently moved toward a canvas without having a reasonable thought of what may rise. This was particularly the situation in the mid-to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking intensely and burning through most evenings in Soho gambling clubs and poker rooms. The next morning he would frequently approach his canvas "in a terrible state of mind of drinkingÃÂ ... under colossal headaches and drink; I now and then barely recognized what I was doing." He joined his craving for chance into his work: a picture frequently would transform halfway through into something very unique in relation to what he had first expected. He effectively searched out this opportunity and felt it significant to his movement as a craftsman. To him, way of life and workmanship were interwoven; he said that "maybe the beverage helped me to be somewhat more liberated." This is apparent in the 1949 arrangement, which started as a fairly dreary investigation of a crumbled head, yet advanced over the six enduring boards into a revising of VelÃÂ¡zquez magnum opuses, and landed at a picture that was to distract Bacon for the consequent 20 years.
