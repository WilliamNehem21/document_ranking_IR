History specialist George Herring contends that Adams was the most free disapproved of the Founders. In spite of the fact that he formally lined up with the Federalists, he was to some degree party unto himself, on occasion contradicting the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans. He was regularly depicted as "thorny", however his perseverance was sustained by great choices made even with general restriction. Adams was frequently contentious, which decreased presidential respectability, as he conceded in his seniority: "[As President] I would not endure peacefully. I murmured, cried, and moaned, and in some cases shrieked and shouted. What's more, I should admit to my disgrace and distress that I some of the time swore." Stubbornness was viewed as one of his characterizing attributes, a reality for which Adams made no expression of remorse. "Because of God that he gave me determination when I realize I am correct," he composed. His determination to propel harmony with France while keeping up a stance of protection diminished his prominence and added to his annihilation for re-appointment. Most students of history acclaim him for maintaining a strategic distance from a full scale war with France amid his administration. His marking of the Alien and Sedition Acts is quite often denounced.
