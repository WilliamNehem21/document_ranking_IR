Just eight sci-fi and dream magazines endure World War II. All were still in mash magazine position with the exception of "Surprising", which had changed to an overview group in 1943. "Bewildering" kept on distributing prominent stories, including "Vintage Season" by C. L. Moore, and "With Folded HandsÃÂ ..." by Jack Williamson. The nature of the fiction in different magazines improved throughout the decade: "Frightening Stories" and "Exciting Wonder" specifically distributed some brilliant material and tested "Amazing" for the administration of the field. A couple of more pulps were propelled in the late 1940s, yet practically all were proposed as vehicles to republish old works of art. One exemption, "Out of This World Adventures", was an examination by Avon, joining fiction with certain pages of funnies. It was a disappointment and kept going just two issues. Magazines in condensation design started to show up towards the decade's end, including "Different Worlds", altered by Raymond Palmer. In 1949, the principal issue of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" showed up, followed in October 1950 by the main issue of "Cosmic system Science Fiction"; both were digests, and between them before long commanded the field. Not many sci-fi or dream pulps were propelled after this date; the 1950s was the start of the time of review magazines, however the main pulps proceeded until the mid-1950s, and writers started pitching to standard magazines and extensive book distributers.
