Toward the finish of 1702, the Occasional Conformity Bill was acquainted with Parliament. The bill intended to preclude Protestant Dissenters from open office by shutting an escape clause in the Test Acts, enactment that limited open office to Anglican conventionalists. The current law allowed mavericks to get to work on the off chance that they took Anglican fellowship once per year. Anne was agreeable to the measure, and constrained George to vote in favor of the bill in the House of Lords, despite the fact that, being a rehearsing Lutheran, he was an incidental conventionalist himself. As he make his choice, he purportedly told an adversary of the bill, "My heart is vid you" . The bill did not accumulate adequate parliamentary help and was in the end dropped. The next year, the bill was resuscitated, however Anne retained help, dreading its reintroduction was a conscious misrepresentation to cause a fight between the two principle political gatherings: the Tories (who upheld the bill) and the Whigs (who restricted it). Indeed it fizzled. George never turned into an individual from the Church of England, which was going by his significant other all through her rule. He stayed Lutheran even after her increase, and had his very own sanctuary.
