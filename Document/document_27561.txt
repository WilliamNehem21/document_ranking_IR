The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800Â over the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. According to Susan M. Zacher, author of "The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide", the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500Â covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830Â and 1875. In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state, with 221Â remaining in 40Â of its 67Â counties.
Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction, but wood did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a load-bearing arch sandwiching multiple king posts, resulting in a stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone. Although there were 30Â covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2015Â only three remain: Forksville, Hillsgrove, and Sonestown.
