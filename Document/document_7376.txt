In February 1956 Terry-Thomas showed up on "Desert Island Disks", and picked two melodies from his "Specialized Hitch" normal as a feature of his choice. Soon thereafter he showed up in his first real movie jobs: Charles Boughtflower in "The Green Man", and Major Hitchcock, "a con artist military officer on the take", in "Private's Progress", coordinated by the Boulting siblings. Terry-Thomas just showed up in the last film quickly, with an absolute screen time of around ten minutes, however his biographer Graham McCann felt that the performing artist "verged on taking the show from the focal character", Windrush played by Ian Carmichael. Terry-Thomas' portrayal of the character was not how he wished to play it: his ideal decision was that of a "senseless ass" sergeant major, yet the job was composed as a severe, liquor and physician recommended sedate ward Army officer. He was at first frustrated with the job, and turned it down at the same time, subsequent to being convinced to acknowledge it by his operator, he grasped its conceivable outcomes. One of his lines, conveyed in his cut privileged voice, was "You're a flat out shower", which turned into a catchphrase for him. The Boulting siblings were so inspired with Terry-Thomas' execution that they marked him up to a five-film bargain.
