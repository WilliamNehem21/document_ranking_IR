In 1824, she was sent to the School for Young Ladies in Groton, on the exhortation of aunties and uncles, however she opposed the thought at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not keep running for re-appointment, so as to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential battle in 1824; he trusted Adams would give back where its due with a legislative arrangement. On June 17, 1825, Fuller went to the function at which the American Revolutionary War saint Marquis de Lafayette laid the foundation of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the fight. 15-year-old Fuller acquainted herself with Lafayette in a letter which closed: "Should we both live, and it is conceivable to a female, to entire the roads of greatness are only from time to time open, I will recal my name to your memory." Early on, Fuller detected herself to be a noteworthy individual and mastermind. Fuller left the Groton school following two years and returned home at 16. At home she considered the works of art and prepared herself in a few present day dialects and read world writing. At this point, she understood she didn't fit in with other young ladies her age. She stated, "I have felt that I was not destined to the regular womanly parcel."
