Alexander maybe undermined his own standard by exhibiting indications of arrogance. While using viable purposeful publicity, for example, the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he likewise endeavored to depict himself as a living god and child of Zeus following his visit to the prophet at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in current Egypt) in 331BC. His endeavor in 327BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in a demonstration of "proskynesis" acquired from the Persian rulers was dismissed as religious irreverence by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court history specialist Callisthenes would not play out this custom. At the point when Alexander had Parmenion killed at Ecbatana (close present day Hamadan, Iran) in 330BC, this was "symptomatic of the developing inlet between the lord's advantages and those of his nation and individuals", as indicated by Errington. His homicide of Cleitus the Black in 328BC is depicted as "wrathful and careless" before breakfast L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Proceeding with the polygamous propensities for his dad, Alexander urged his men to wed local ladies in Asia, showing others how its done when he marry Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He at that point wedded Stateira II, oldest little girl of DariusIII, and Parysatis II, most youthful little girl of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324BC.
