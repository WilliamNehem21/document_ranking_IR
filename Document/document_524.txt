The disclosure of the "Dormition of the Virgin" on Syros, a genuine and marked work from the painter's Cretan time frame, and the broad recorded research in the mid 1960s, added to the reviving and reassessment of these speculations. Albeit following numerous traditions of the Byzantine symbol, parts of the style unquestionably show Venetian impact, and the piece, demonstrating the passing of Mary, joins the diverse precepts of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin. Noteworthy academic works of the second 50% of the twentieth century committed to El Greco reappraise huge numbers of the understandings of his work, including his alleged Byzantinism. In view of the notes written in El Greco's very own hand, on his one of a kind style, and on the way that El Greco marked his name in Greek characters, they see a natural coherence between Byzantine painting and his craft. As indicated by Marina Lambraki-Plaka "a long way from the impact of Italy, in an unbiased spot which was mentally like his origin, Candia, the Byzantine components of his instruction developed and assumed a synergist job in the new origination of the picture which is exhibited to us in his develop work". In making this judgment, Lambraki-Plaka can't help contradicting Oxford University educators Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys, who declare that "in spite of cases actually, the main Byzantine component of his acclaimed sketches was his mark in Greek lettering". Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's work of art is "neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine yet Western European. The works he created in Italy have a place with the historical backdrop of the Italian workmanship, and those he delivered in Spain to the historical backdrop of Spanish craftsmanship".
