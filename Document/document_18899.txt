Writing for the "Hartford Courant", Malcolm Johnson stated, "Against all odds, this long-delayed film version turns out to be a labor of love for director Alan Parker and for his stars, the reborn Madonna, the new superstar Antonio Banderas, the protean veteran Jonathan Pryce." Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing "Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film we feel like we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has." On the syndicated television program "Siskel & Ebert & the Movies", Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a "two thumbs up" rating. Siskel, in his review for the "Chicago Tribune", wrote, "Director Alan Parker has mounted this production well, which is more successful as spectacle than anything else." According to "Time" magazine's Richard Corliss, "This "Evita" is not just a long, complex music video; it works and breathes like a real movie, with characters worthy of our affection and deepest suspicions." Critic Zach Conner commented, "It's a relief to say that "Evita" is pretty damn fine, well-cast, and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes."
