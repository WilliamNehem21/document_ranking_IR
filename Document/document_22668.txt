Starting at 09:30, "Enterprise" landed many of the damaged and fuel-depleted CAP fighters and returning scout aircraft from both carriers. However, with her flight deck full, and the second wave of incoming Japanese aircraft detected on radar at 09:30, "Enterprise" ceased landing operations at 10:00. Fuel-depleted aircraft then began ditching in the ocean, and the carrier's escorting destroyers rescued the aircrews. One of the ditching aircraft, a damaged TBF from "Enterprise"'s strike force that had been attacked earlier by "ZuihÅ" Zeros, crashed into the water near the destroyer . As "Porter" rescued the TBF's aircrew, she was struck by a torpedo, perhaps from the ditched aircraft, causing heavy damage and killing 15 crewmen. After the task force commander ordered the destroyer scuttled, the crew was rescued by the destroyer which then sank "Porter" with gunfire ().
As the first wave of Japanese strike aircraft began returning to their carriers from their attack on "Hornet", one of them spotted the "Enterprise" task force (which had just emerged from a rain squall) and reported the carrier's position. The second Japanese aircraft strike wave, believing "Hornet" to be sinking, directed their attacks on the "Enterprise" task force, beginning at 10:08. Again, the U.S. CAP had trouble intercepting the Japanese aircraft before they attacked "Enterprise", shooting down only two of the 19 dive bombers as they began their dives on the carrier. Attacking through the intense anti-aircraft fire put up by "Enterprise" and her escorting warships, the bombers hit the carrier with two bombs and near-missed with another. The bombs killed 44 men and wounded 75, and caused heavy damage to the carrier, including jamming her forward elevator in the "up" position. Twelve of the nineteen Japanese bombers were lost in this attack.
