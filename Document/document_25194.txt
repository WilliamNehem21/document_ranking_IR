By the early 1930s, "Orizaba"âs typical route had remained virtually the same, though Nassau and Tampico were dropped as ports of call. It was in this period that American poet Hart Crane leapt to his death from "Orizaba". At around noon on 27 April 1932, while the ship was headed to New Yorkâsome north of Havana and off the Florida coastâCrane, clad in pajamas and overcoat, climbed the rail at the stern of the ship and plunged into the ocean. The captain of "Orizaba" immediately stopped the ship and launched four lifeboats that searched in vain for two hours, but no trace of the poet was ever found. Before he jumped, Crane had been drinking and, the night before, had been the victim of violence after a unwanted pick-up attempt of a crewman ended with a severe beating.
In 1934, "Orizaba" was allocated the Code Letters WECX. In April 1934, American actress Katharine Hepburn sailed from New York on "Orizaba", eventually ending up in MÃ©rida, YucatÃ¡n. After her arrival there on 22 April, she filed for divorce from businessman Ludlow ("Luddy") Ogden Smith, whom she had married in December 1928. After the divorce was finalized she and her travel companion, Laura Harding, planned to spend a week in Havana and return to New York on the Ward Line ship . Other notable passengers on "Orizaba" in the 1930s included Ecuadorean diplomat Gonzalo Zaldumbide and Cuban president Fulgencio Batista. Zaldumbide, the Ecuadorean Minister to the United States, sailed to Mexico for his new posting as Minister to Mexico in August 1932. In February 1939, "Orizaba" carried Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista back to Havana after a two-week goodwill visit to Mexico.
