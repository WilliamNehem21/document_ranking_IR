Aristotle and Pliny relate the legend of a challenge among the winged creatures to see who ought to be their ruler, the title to be granted to the one that could fly most elevated. At first, it looked as if the falcon would win effectively, yet as he started to tire, a little winged animal which had covered up under the hawk's tail plumes rose to fly significantly higher and guaranteed the title. Following from this legend, in much European fables the wren has been portrayed as the "lord of the winged animals" or as a fire conveyor. Be that as it may, these terms were additionally connected to the "Regulus" species, the blazing crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them bound to be the first bearers of these titles, and, due to the legend's reference to the "littlest of winged animals" getting to be the best, the title was presumably exchanged to the similarly small wren. The perplexity was helped by the likeness and resulting compatibility of the Ancient Greek words for the wren (ÃÂ²ÃÂ±ÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂ»ÃÂµÃÂÃÂ "basileus", "ruler") and the peaks (ÃÂ²ÃÂ±ÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂ»ÃÂ¹ÃÂÃÂºÃÂ¿ÃÂ "basiliskos", "kinglet"). In English, the relationship between the firecrest and Eurasian wren was fortified by the kinglet's old name of "flame peaked wren".
