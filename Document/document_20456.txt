As of September 2016, the editorial succession at "Astounding" and "Analog" is as follows:
"Astounding" was published in pulp format until the January 1942 issue, when it switched to bedsheet. It reverted to pulp for six issues, starting in May 1943, and then became the first of the genre sf magazines to be published in digest format, beginning with the November 1943 issue. The format remained unchanged until CondÃ© Nast produced 25 bedsheet issues of "Analog" between March 1963 and March 1965, after which it returned to digest format. In May 1998, and again in December 2008, the format was changed to be slightly larger than the usual digest size: first to 8.25 x 5.25 in (210 x 135Â mm), and then to 8.5 x 5.75 in (217 x 148Â mm). The magazine was originally titled "Astounding Stories of Super-Science"; this was shortened to "Astounding Stories" from February 1931 to November 1932, and the longer title returned for the three Clayton issues at the start of 1933. The Street & Smith issues began as "Astounding Stories", and changed to "Astounding Science-Fiction" in March 1938. The hyphen disappeared in November 1946, and the title then remained unchanged until 1960, when the title "Analog Science Fact & Fiction" was phased in between February and October (i.e., the words "Astounding" and "Analog" both appeared on the cover, with "Analog" gradually increasing in prominence over the months, culminating in the name "Astounding" being completely dropped.) In April 1965 the subtitle was reversed, so that the magazine became "Analog Science Fiction & Fact", and it has remained unchanged since then, though it has undergone several stylistic and orthographic variations.
