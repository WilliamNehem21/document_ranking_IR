In the remaining wartime months Ferrier continued to travel throughout the country, to fulfil the growing demands for her services from concert promoters. At Leeds in November 1944 she sang the part of the Angel in Elgar's choral work "The Dream of Gerontius", her first performance in what became one of her best-known roles. In December she met John Barbirolli while working on another Elgar piece, "Sea Pictures"; the conductor later became one of her closest friends and strongest advocates. On 15 September 1945 Ferrier made her debut at the London Proms, when she sang "L'Air des Adieux" from Tchaikovsky's opera "The Maid of Orleans". Although she often sang individual arias, opera was not Ferrier's natural forte; she had not enjoyed singing the title role in a concert version of Bizet's "Carmen" at Stourbridge in March 1944, and generally avoided similar engagements. Nevertheless, Benjamin Britten, who had heard her Westminster Abbey "Messiah" performance, persuaded her to create the role of Lucretia in his new opera "The Rape of Lucretia", which was to open the first postwar Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. She would share the part with Nancy Evans. Despite her initial misgivings, by early July Ferrier was writing to her agent that she was "enjoying [the rehearsals] tremendously and I should think it's the best part one could possibly have".
