Bana's next project was the low-budget Australian film "The Nugget" (2002). A comedy, the film portrays the effect of instant wealth on three working class men and was released with moderate success in Australia. Bana read the script after filming "Chopper" in 2000 and was drawn to it because it reminded him of his childhood and because he found its characters amusing and likeable. While filming "The Nugget", Bana was offered the lead role of Bruce Banner in the film adaptation of the popular Marvel Comic book series "The Incredible Hulk". Only after learning of director Ang Lee's involvement in the project did he consider the role. Bana admired Lee for his work on the film "The Ice Storm" and agreed to work on the film before the final script was complete. He said he was drawn to the film because "the character of Bruce Banner had dramatic potential" and was "a fairly non-traditional superhero". "Hulk" (2003) received mixed reviews and a moderate success at the box office, but Bana's performance was praised: Jack Matthews of the "New York Daily News" felt that Bana played the role of Bruce Banner "with great conviction". Bana earned an Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nomination for "Cinescape Genre Face of the Future" for the film.
