As indicated by Karim biographer Sushila Anand, the Queen's own letters affirm that "her dialogs with the Munshi were wide-runningÃ¢ÂÂphilosophical, political and handy. Both head and heart were locked in. There is no uncertainty that the Queen found in Abdul Karim an association with a world that was fascinatingly outsider, and a friend who might not nourish her the official line." Karim was set accountable for the other Indian hirelings and made in charge of their records. Victoria commended him in her letters and diary. "I am so attached to him" she expressed, "He is so great and delicate and seeing all I need and is a genuine solace to me." She appreciated "her own Indian representative and Munshi, who is an incredible, smart, really p[i]ous and very refined delicate man, who says, 'God requested it'ÃÂ ... "God's Orders" is the thing that they certainly comply! Such confidence as theirs and such good faith set us a g[rea]t. precedent." At Balmoral Castle, the Queen's Scottish bequest, Karim was apportioned the room recently involved by John Brown, a most loved hireling of the Queen's who had kicked the bucket in 1883. Notwithstanding the genuine and stately way that Karim displayed to the outside world, the Queen composed that "he is in all respects benevolent and happy with the Queen's house keepers and snickers and even jokes nowÃ¢ÂÂand welcomed them to come and see all his fine things offering them nutty cake to eat".
