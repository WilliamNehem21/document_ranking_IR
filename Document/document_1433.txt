NIS specialists Robert Nigro and Goodman informed Miceli on their argument against Hartwig, disclosing to him that they trusted that Hartwig had exploded Turret Two with a Radio Shack clock, and gave him a duplicate of Smith's meeting. They didn't reveal to Miceli that Smith had abnegated his announcement or that the NIS had been unfit to discover any proof that Hartwig had ever bought any electronic gadget from Radio Shack. Miceli guided his group to start testing to check whether an electrical clock could have touched off the powder packs. Specialists at the Navy's metallurgical research center at Norfolk Naval Shipyard tried the copper-nickel-composite turning band from the middle firearm's shot, and expressed that they had discovered follow synthetic components, including barium, silicon, aluminum, and calcium, under the band, which demonstrated that an electronic clock had been utilized to cause the blast. Miceli requested that the FBI copy the test on the band. In the wake of testing the band, the FBI expressed that they didn't trust an electronic planning gadget had been available and that synthetic compounds found on the band likely originated from Break-Free dissolvable utilized by the Navy to separate the shot from the inside firearm barrel after the blast. As per Ken Nimmich of the FBI Laboratory, Miceli then unexpectedly ended the Navy's solicitation for help from the FBI lab.
