The improvement toolbox for the Motorola CPU incorporated a compiler for the C programming language, which the two developers knew about. After Atari had led execution assessments, it endorsed utilization of the language. Cerny and Flanagan's choice to program "Marble Madness" in the C language had positive and negative results. Atari diversions had recently been modified in low level computing construct. The C language was simpler to program, however was less proficient, so the amusement works at the slower speed of 30ÃÂ Hz rather than the typical 60ÃÂ Hz recurrence of arcade diversions at the time. Cerny chose to utilize a trackball framework (showcased by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the amusement a one of a kind control framework, and he picked a mechanized trackball for quicker turning and braking when the in-diversion ball voyaged downhill and tough, separately. As it was building the models, Atari's plan office educated Cerny that the mechanized trackball's structure had a characteristic imperfectionÃ¢ÂÂone of the four backings had poor contact with the ballÃ¢ÂÂand the utilization of a normal trackball was progressively doable. Moreover, Cerny had foreseen the utilization of amazing custom chips that would permit RAM-based sprites to be enlivened by the CPU, yet the accessible equipment was a less-propelled framework utilizing ROM-based, static sprites.
