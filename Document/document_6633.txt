Virginia Tech started the second quarter possessing the ball and driving down the field. Bryan Randall finished a 10-yard go for another first down, yet after Tech neglected to increase another, the Hokies were compelled to punt. Coppery responded by going three and out and punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. In its first full drive of the second quarter, the Hokies had their best drive of the primary half. After a holding punishment invalidated a long kickoff return, Tech started at its 24-yard line. Randall finished a nine-yard go to tight end Jeff King, at that point kept running for another nine yards on a quarterback scramble. He pursued the first-down kept running by finishing three sequential long goes of 16ÃÂ yards, 13ÃÂ yards, and 31ÃÂ yards, individually. The last go, to wide collector Josh Hyman, drove Virginia Tech inside the Auburn two-yard line. There, notwithstanding, the Tech offense vacillated. On three plays, Tech neglected to cross the objective line, increasing just a single yard all the while. Confronting fourth down and requiring only one yard for a touchdown, Virginia Tech head mentor Frank Beamer chose to endeavor to pick up the touchdown, as opposed to send in his kicker for a field objective endeavor. The endeavored touchdown go by Randall fell deficient, and Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs without scoring any focuses.
