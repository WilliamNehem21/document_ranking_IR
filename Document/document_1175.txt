Frusciante's chronic drug use intensified as the years advanced. An article distributed by the "New Times LA" portrayed him as "a skeleton canvassed in slender skin". He took an interest in a meeting with Dutch open communicate station VPROÃ¢ÂÂthe primary media appearance he made since leaving the Chili Peppers. In the meeting Frusciante talks about the constructive outcomes drugs have had at the forefront of his thoughts and gladly confesses to being an "addict". He proceeded to admit addictions to heroin and rocks, at the end of the day portrayed himself as being in the best wellbeing of his life. In 1997, Frusciante discharged his second solo collection "Grin From the Streets You Hold", fundamentally for medication cash. "Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt" was assessed to have sold just 45,000 duplicates when Frusciante requested it no longer available in 1998Ã¢ÂÂwhen Frusciante restored and rejoined the Chili Peppers. "Grin From the Streets You Hold" was pulled back from the market a year later. In 1999 "Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt" was re-discharged on American Recordings. In the mid 2000s, Frusciante said he intended to re-discharge "Grin From the Streets You Hold" at some point later on, yet did not give any sign regarding when. It was in the end re-discharged on American Records in Europe of 2006.
