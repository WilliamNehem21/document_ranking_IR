Onlookers consistently noted episodes of conjugal conflict among Anne and James. The purported Gowrie trick of 1600, in which the youthful Earl of Gowrie, John Ruthven, and his sibling Alexander Ruthven were killed by James' specialists for an alleged strike on the King, set off the rejection of their sisters Beatrix and Barbara Ruthven as women in-holding up to Anne, with whom they were "in chiefest credit." The Queen, who was five months pregnant, would not get up except if they were restored and remained there for two days, likewise declining to eat. At the point when James endeavored to order her, she cautioned him to take care how he treated her since she was not the Earl of Gowrie. James appeased her for the minute by paying a popular stunt-devil to engage her, yet she never surrendered, and her obstinate help for the Ruthvens throughout the following three years was paid attention to enough by the legislature to be viewed as a security issue. In 1602, subsequent to finding that Anne had pirated Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James completed an interrogation of the whole family unit; in 1603, he at last chose to allow Beatrix Ruthven a benefits of ÃÂ£200.
