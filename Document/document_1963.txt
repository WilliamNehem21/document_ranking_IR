Harm on Guam was heaviest from the focal district toward the northern coast, specifically to traveler regions and army installations. The Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station was closed down because of intensity blackouts and water harm to the generators. Two US Navy sends, the USS Niagara Falls (AFS-3) and the USS White Plains (AFS-4)Ã¢ÂÂ both maritime supply shipsÃ¢ÂÂwent on solid land because of unpleasant oceans and solid breezes, and the dry dock at Apra Harbor was washed shorewards. Omar wrecked many organizations on the island. High breezes thumped a crane into a condo constructing and brought down 400ÃÂ wooden and 20ÃÂ concrete power shafts crosswise over Tumon, leaving 70% of the island without power. All through Guam, Omar disturbed transportation and correspondence frameworks, and prompted the disappointment of water siphoning frameworks. Avalanches secured streets, and low-lying regions were overwhelmed. About 2,000ÃÂ homes were pulverized and another 2,200 were harmed to shifting degrees, dislodging almost 3,000ÃÂ people. Obliteration was heaviest to wooden structures; structures made of cement fared generally well amid the tempest. Island-wide, harm totaled $457ÃÂ million, split almost equitably between the army installations and regular citizen harm. One individual passed on Guam, and more than 200ÃÂ people required crisis treatmentÃ¢ÂÂincluding about 80ÃÂ injured by flying garbage.
