The series was filmed in the small town of Wilmington, North Carolina, where Williams relocated for the next six years. In a review of the first season for "The New York Times", Caryn James called it a soap opera that was "redeemed by intelligence and sharp writing" but thought that Williams was "too earnest to suit this otherwise shrewdly tongue-in-cheek cast". Ray Richmond of "Variety" labeled it "an addictive drama with considerable heart" and considered all four leads appealing. The series was a ratings success and raised Williams' profile. Her first film release since the start of "Dawson's Creek" was "" (1998), a slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis. The seventh installment in the "Halloween" film series, it featured Williams as one of several teenagers traumatized by a murderer. It earned $55Â million domestically against its $17Â million budget.
