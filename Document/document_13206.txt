Most age classifications of "Albertosaurus" are spoken to in the fossil record. Utilizing bone histology, the age of an individual creature at the season of death can regularly be resolved, permitting development rates to be assessed and contrasted and different species. The most youthful known "Albertosaurus" is a two-year-old found in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed around 50 kilograms (110ÃÂ lb) and estimated somewhat more than long. The example from a similar quarry is the most seasoned and biggest known, at 28 years old. At the point when examples of middle of the road age and size are plotted on a chart, a "S"- molded development bend results, with the most quick development happening in a four-year time span finishing around the sixteenth year of life, an example additionally observed in different tyrannosaurids. The development rate amid this stage was every year, in light of a grown-up 1.3ÃÂ tonnes. Different examinations have recommended higher grown-up loads; this would influence the extent of the development rate, yet not the general example. Tyrannosaurids comparable in size to "Albertosaurus" had comparative development rates, despite the fact that the a lot bigger "Tyrannosaurus rex" developed at just about multiple times this rate ( every year) at its pinnacle. The finish of the quick development stage recommends the beginning of sexual development in "Albertosaurus", in spite of the fact that development proceeded at a slower rate all through the creatures' lives. Sexual development while still effectively developing seems, by all accounts, to be a common quality among little and extensive dinosaurs just as in vast warm blooded animals, for example, people and elephants. This example of moderately early sexual development varies strikingly from the example in feathered creatures, which postpone their sexual development until after they have got done with developing.
