USÃÂ 141 begins at a trade with I-43 southeast of Green Bay in the suburb of Bellevue. From the end at exitÃÂ 178, USÃÂ 141 runs north to Main Street, and after that northwesterly along Main Street through town. Wisconsin HighwayÃÂ 29 (WISÃÂ 29) converges with USÃÂ 141 at a crossing point on the northwest side of Bellevue, and the two roadways run simultaneously through private subdivisions. Fundamental Street ignores I-43 and proceeds toward the north and into the city of Green Bay. USÃÂ 141/WISÃÂ 29 crosses Baird Creek and keeps running along the banks of the East River. At the convergence with Monroe Avenue, WISÃÂ 29 turns south, joining WISÃÂ 54/WISÃÂ 57 while USÃÂ 141 proceeds with westbound on Main Street to cross the Fox River on the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge. On the west side of the stream, the thruway pursues Dousman Street for a square before turning north along Broadway Avenue for four squares. From that point, the expressway pursues Mather Street west to Velp Avenue. USÃÂ 141 pursues that road northwesterly and parallel to I-43 on the north side of Green Bay. This zone is for the most part private with certain organizations promptly on either side. In the suburb of Howard, USÃÂ 141 proceeds onto the USÃÂ 41 road by means of the exchange at exitÃÂ 170. USÃÂ 41/USÃÂ 141 has an exchange for I-43 only south of the Duck Creek crossing.
