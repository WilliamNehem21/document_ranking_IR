The large size of "Deinosuchus" has generally been recognized despite the fragmentary nature of the fossils assigned to it. However, estimates of how large it really was have varied considerably over the years. The original estimate from 1954 for the type specimen of the then-named ""Phobosuchus riograndensis"" were based on a skull of and a lower jaw of long, reconstructed with similar proportions to the Cuban crocodile giving a total estimated length of . However, this reconstruction is currently considered to be inaccurate. Using more complete remains, it was estimated in 1999 that the size attained by specimens of "Deinosuchus" varied from with weights from . This was later corroborated when it was noted that most known specimens of "D. rugosus" usually had skulls of about with estimated total lengths of and weights of . A reasonably well-preserved skull specimen discovered in Texas indicated the animal's head measured about , and its body length was estimated at . However, the largest fragmentary remains of "D. riograndensis" were 1.5 times the size of those of the average "D. rugosus" and it was determined that the largest individuals of this species may have been up to in length and perhaps weighed as much as .
