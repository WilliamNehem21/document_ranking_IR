Scene 2: Mr. William Collins, a sycophantic moronic pastor, visits his cousins, the Bennets. He is the involved beneficiary of their home and domain, Longbourn, and plans to wed one of Mr. Bennet's girls. This is implied, on his part, as a demonstration of kindhearted generosity towards the Bennets, since Mrs. Bennet and her unwed girls will be rendered destitute once Mr. Bennet passes on and Mr. Collins acquires the bequest. He in this way welcomes himself for a fourteen day visit, to become acquainted with the Bennets better and select a spouse from among the little girls of the family. Be that as it may, the Bennet young ladies judge Mr. Collins to be a somewhat silly man, a "peculiarity" with numerous idiosyncrasies of discourse and deportment. They are all things considered considerate to him, and take him to balls and get-togethers in Meryton. At some point, while on a stroll around Meryton town, they meet individuals from a recently arrived local army, including a Mr George Wickham. At a get-together, Wickham becomes a close acquaintence with Elizabeth and reveals to her that his dad was the steward for Darcy's late dad, and that he initially wanted to join the ministry. He says that when Darcy has denied Wickham a living (a curacy), which had been guaranteed to him by Mr. Darcy's dad. At another get-together, Darcy shocks Elizabeth with a move offer at a ball at Netherfield, which she hesitantly yet pleasantly acknowledges. Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth the following day, yet she resoundingly rejects him. While Mrs Bennet differs about Elizabeth's choice, her dear companion Charlotte Lucas welcomes Mr Collins to remain at Lucas Lodge.
