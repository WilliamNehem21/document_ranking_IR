Thirteen years after his passing, the 1911 "EncyclopÃÂ¦dia Britannica" said of Bayard that "his tall noble individual, unfailing obligingness, and cleaned, if to some degree conscious, persuasiveness made him a man of imprint in all the best circles. He was considered without a doubt by numerous Americans to have turned out to be excessively inclined toward English ways; and, for the declaration of certain reactions viewed as horrible to his very own comrades, the House of Representatives ventured to such an extreme as to passÃÂ ... a vote of rebuke on him. The estimation of Bayard's discretion was, be that as it may, completely perceived in the United Kingdom where he commendably maintained the conventions of an acclaimed line of American pastors." In 1929, the Dictionary of American Biography portrayed Bayard, as a Senator, as being "recollected rather for his resistance to Republican policiesÃÂ ... than for useful enactment of the effective arrangement of incredible issues", and said that he had "the feelings of a prior dayÃÂ ... what's more, was never disposed, either politically or socially, to look for prevalence with the nation on the loose." Charles C. Tansill, a preservationist history specialist, discovered a lot to commend in Bayard; he distributed a volume on Bayard's conciliatory vocation in 1940 and another about his congressional profession in 1946, the main full-length histories to show up since Bayard's demise. Later antiquarians took a dimmer perspective on Bayard's political vocation; in a 1989 book, Henry E. Mattox numbered Bayard among the Gilded Age remote administration officers who were "obviously uncouth."
