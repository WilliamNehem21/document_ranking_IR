One mishap at the Mousetrap, a mind boggling exchange, had national repercussions. On August 1, 1984, a truck conveying six torpedoes for the U.S. Naval force toppled. The circumstance was exacerbated as nobody replied at the telephone number furnished with the payload, and an obscure fluid was spilling from one of the torpedoes. It took over three hours before any military faculty touched base on the scene, U.S. Armed force work force from an adjacent base. The occurrence left a great many vehicles stranded and Denver's transportation arrange incapacitated for around eight hours. Roughly 50 inhabitants in the region were emptied. Examinations later uncovered that the truck driver did not pursue a prescribed course given by state troopers, who explicitly cautioned the driver to maintain a strategic distance from the Mousetrap. The Navy guaranteed changes in the wake of being scrutinized for furnishing an unstaffed telephone number with an unsafe freight shipment, an infringement of government law, and neglecting to inform Denver authorities about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway framework, with certain structures worked in 1951. The occurrence furnished energy to remake the exchange with an increasingly present day and more secure structure. Development started in a few stages in 1987 and the last scaffold was committed in 2003.
