A youthful English admirer, Eric Fenby, discovering that Delius was attempting to create by managing to Jelka, volunteered his administrations as an unpaid amanuensis. For a long time, from 1928, he worked with Delius, bringing down his new structures from transcription, and helping him change prior works. Together they delivered "Cynara" (a setting of words by Ernest Dowson), "A Late Lark" (a setting of W. E. Henley), "A Song of Summer", a third violin sonata, the "Irmelin" prelude, and "Idyll" (1932), which reused music from Delius' short musical show "Margot la rouge", made thirty years sooner. McVeagh rates their most noteworthy joint creation as "The Songs of Farewell", settings of Whitman sonnets for ensemble and symphony, which were committed to Jelka. Different works created in this period incorporate an "Impulse and Elegy" for cello and symphony composed for the recognized British cellist Beatrice Harrison, and a short instrumental piece, "Phenomenal Dance", which Delius devoted to Fenby. The violin sonata fuses the primary, limitless, tune that Delius had endeavored to direct to Fenby before their "usual way of doing things" had been worked out. Fenby's underlying inability to get the tune drove Delius to the view that "[the] kid is no goodÃÂ ... he can't bring down a straightforward song". Fenby later composed a book about his encounters of working with Delius. Among different subtleties, Fenby uncovers Delius' adoration for cricket. The pair pursued the 1930 Test arrangement among England and Australia with incredible intrigue, and entertained a bewildered Jelka with records of their childhood misuses in the amusement.
