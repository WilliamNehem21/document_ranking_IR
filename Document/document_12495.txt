The raven's bosom is set apart by Beta Corvi (the correct name is Kraz), a star of greatness 2.7 found 146 ÃÂ± 1 light-years from Earth. About 206 million years of age and 3.7 ÃÂ± multiple times as enormous as the Sun, it has depleted its center hydrogen and extended and cooled to a surface temperature of around 5,100ÃÂ K and is currently a yellow brilliant mammoth star of ghastly sort G5II. It likely burned through a large portion of its reality as a blue-white primary arrangement star of ghastly sort B7V. Bearing the correct name of Minkar and denoting the raven's nose is Epsilon Corvi, found somewhere in the range of 318 ÃÂ± 5 light-years from Earth. It is a red goliath of ghostly kind K2III that is around multiple times the Sun's sweep and multiple times its radiance. Around multiple times as monstrous as the Sun, it went through quite a bit of its time on earth as a fundamental succession star of unearthly kind B5V. Misleading the south of the quadrilateral among Beta and Epsilon Corvi is the orange-shaded 6 Corvi, a maturing monster star of unearthly kind K1III that is around multiple times as radiant as the Sun. It is 331 ÃÂ± 10 light-years from Earth.
