The result of the attack was of extensive macrohistorical significance. The Byzantine capital's survival protected the Empire as a defense against Islamic venture into Europe until the fifteenth century, when it tumbled to the Ottoman Turks. Alongside the Battle of Tours in 732, the fruitful barrier of Constantinople has been viewed as instrumental in ceasing Muslim venture into Europe. History specialist Ekkehard Eickhoff composes that "had a triumphant Caliph made Constantinople as of now toward the start of the Middle Ages into the political capital of Islam, as occurred toward the finish of the Middle Ages by the OttomansÃ¢ÂÂthe ramifications for Christian Europe [...] would have been limitless", as the Mediterranean would have turned into an Arab lake, and the Germanic successor states in Western Europe would have been cut off from the Mediterranean underlying foundations of their way of life. Military history specialist Paul K. Davis summed up the attack's significance as pursues: "By turning back the Moslem intrusion, Europe stayed in Christian hands, and no genuine Moslem danger to Europe existed until the fifteenth century. This triumph, correspondent with the Frankish triumph at Tours (732), constrained Islam's western development toward the southern Mediterranean world." Thus the student of history John B. Cover called 718 "an ecumenical date", while the Greek student of history Spyridon Lambros compared the attack to the Battle of Marathon and Leo III to Miltiades. Thusly, military antiquarians regularly incorporate the attack in arrangements of the "conclusive fights" of world history.
