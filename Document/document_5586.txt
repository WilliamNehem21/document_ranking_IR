Throwing chief Bill Shepard was responsible for filling extra jobs. He sifted through beginning tryouts with promising on-screen characters, at that point exhibited his decisions to Shatner. The two men got back to the on-screen characters upwards of a few times before every job was thrown. Extra players incorporate Todd Bryant as Klingon Captain Klaa, with Spice Williams-Crosby as Vixis, Klaa's lieutenant. Bryant was playing ping pong at a shoreline party when a throwing chief offered him the job. Bryant played out his tryout twice, as Shatner mentioned that he rehash his execution talking in Klingon. Williams-Crosby thought Vixis was Kirk's sweetheart when she touched base for her tryout, yet reviewed a short time later that it was "fun" to play a reprobate. David Warner, Charles Cooper, and Cynthia Gouw play the Federation, Klingon, and Romulan diplomats to Nimbus III. Warner did not try out, however consented to the job after Shatner swore that his character would endure the film. The executive initially proposed George Murdock to play the Klingon ambassador Korrd, yet altered his opinion on observing Cooper's execution. Murdock was recast as the "God" element. Bill Quinn played McCoy's dad in one of his last jobs. Maker Harve Bennett made an appearance as a Starfleet chief of naval operations.
