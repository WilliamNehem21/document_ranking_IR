A huge number of Flying Eagle pennies had been issued in return for the old American coppers and little Spanish silver. The Spanish silver was all the while streaming into the Mint in mid 1859 and, at Snowden's encouraging, Congress on March 3 of that year broadened the reclamation of these remote coins, lawful delicate in the US until 1857, for an additional two years. Neil Carothers, in his work on little category cash, tested this choice as pointlessÃ¢ÂÂdenied of legitimate delicate status, the staying Spanish silver would have been dispensed with through deals to banks for their bullion. The individuals who conveyed the old coins to the Mint got pennies for them, at first Flying Eagle, and after that Indian Head. In the year following the reestablishment, somewhere in the range of forty million Indian Head pennies were issued, which means about a hundred million copper-nickel pennies had entered business since 1857. As the coin did not flow in the South and West because of bias against base-metal cash, they gagged business. Nobody needed to take them; no law made them legitimate delicate. At Snowden's encouraging Congress in June 1860 finished the trade. By the by, as Snowden conceded in his yearly report that year, there were such a large number of pennies available for use. In October 1860, "The Bankers' Magazine and Statistical Register" revealed that there were ten million pennies in business in New York City above what was required, and in the event that anybody wished to arrange in mass, they could be obtained at a rebate.
