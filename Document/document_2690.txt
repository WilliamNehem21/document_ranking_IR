The Cycle Center has helped Chicago to end up known as a cycling-accommodating city. As per an article in "The Washington Post" in view of choices by the Adventure Cycling Association and "Bicycling" magazine, Chicago is one of the ten most cycling-accommodating urban areas in the U.S. due to the Cycle Center and the Chicago Department of Transportation's Bicycle Program. The Cycle Center was highlighted in the Federal Transit Administration's April 2009 report to the United States Congress on another age of creative travel frameworks entitled "Rehashing Transit: American people group finding more astute, cleaner, quicker transportation arrangements". Urban areas as far away as Melbourne, Australia, point to Chicago for instance of a city with cycling-accommodating highlights in light of the Cycle Center (they likewise utilized European urban communities, for example, Amsterdam and Lyon, France, just as U.S. urban communities, for example, Davis, California and Portland, Oregon as models). The Chicago Architecture Foundation granted its 2004 Stein Ray and Harris Patron of the Year grant in the administrative classification to Millennium Park, explicitly referencing the bicycle station, Commissioner d'Escoto and the City of Chicago Department of Transportation, alongside a few different pioneers in charge of the advancement of other park highlights.
