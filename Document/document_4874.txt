The Army of the Potomac, having developed boat connects over the Rappahannock, started the Battle of Fredericksburg on the morning of December 13, 1862. The Confederate armed force involved the city of Fredericksburg and a high edge behind the city known as Marye's Heights. By late morning, Union powers had taken the city and started the strike on Marye's Heights. At roughly 3:30 toward the evening the 22nd Massachusetts, with the remainder of Colonel James Barnes' detachment, crossed one of the boat connects and traveled through a railroad slice to the edges of the city. The regiment numbered around 200 men. Barnes' detachment was requested to mitigate a unit of the IX Corps which had made a charge on the stone divider along Marye's Heights and become bound by Confederate flame. When they shaped up fight lines on the open slant before Marye's Heights, the 22nd was under extreme big guns discharge from the Confederates. As indicated by the regimental history specialist, "the men intuitively turned their sides to the tempest" of projectiles, shot and shell as they progressed and losses were substantial. Their unit achieved Nagle's detachment and the 22nd soothed the twelfth Rhode Island, taking sanctuary on ground secured by that regiment's setbacks. Here the 22nd terminated in inclined position, depleting their ammo, shouting and perking to keep up their fearlessness.
