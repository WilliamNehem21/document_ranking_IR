A century preceding the beginning of the amusement, the Kushan, humanoid occupants of the desert planet Kharak, found a spaceship covered in the sands, which holds a stone guide checking Kharak and another planet over the cosmic system named "Hiigara", signifying "home". The disclosure joined the families of Kharak, who realized they were not indigenous to Kharak and needed to illuminate the riddle of how they resulted in these present circumstances unfriendly planet. Together, they spent the following century creating and assembling a monster mothership that would convey 600,000 individuals to Hiigara, with neuroscientist Karan S'jet neurally wired into the ship as Fleet Command to supplant an unsustainably vast group. The amusement opens with the first journey of the mothership, testing the hyperspace drive which transports the armada to another goal. Rather than the help transport that was relied upon to be there, the mothership finds an antagonistic outsider armada. In the wake of vanquishing them, the mothership comes back to Kharak, to find that the planet has been annihilated by another outsider armada, and that just the 600,000 vagrants in suspended activity have endure. A caught adversary chief cases that the Kharak destruction was the result of their infringement of a 4,000-year-old settlement between the interstellar Taiidan Empire and the Kushan, which prohibits the last's from creating hyperspace innovation.
