Ralston, who considered the "Venture" revolting and the model hard to shoot, thoroughly enjoyed crushing the ship. A few shots were consolidated together for the total pulverization grouping; while Ralston would have liked to take a hammer to the first $150,000 display, an assortment of less expensive models were utilized. The initial segment of the ship to be annihilated was the extension, a different scaled down with stars added to the foundation. The shot changes to the Bird of Prey moving endlessly as the highest point of the saucer consumes, where blasts (recorded topsy turvy to reenact the nonappearance of gravity) were superimposed over a movement control go of the ship. The camera slices to a closeup of the ship's enlistment number being consumed by inward blasts. George made a light Styrofoam display that was broken down by CH3)2CO dribbled on the saucer from above. By shooting at short of what one edge for every second and keeping light off the model, the dribbles were not unmistakable in the print. Consuming steel fleece within the saucer made a sparkling ash impact from the ship's internal decks being wrecked. The saucer blast was reenacted by exploding a baby powder-covered mortar dish. Two-and four-ounce bombs and gas were utilized as fireworks in cutting edge scenes of the scaffold being devastated. Stand-ins utilized spring-stacked stages to dispatch themselves noticeable all around.
