Proof of early learning about Belgrade's geological area originates from old fantasies and legends. The stone sitting above the conjunction of the Sava and Danube waterways has been distinguished as one of the spots in the account of Jason and the Argonauts. Paleo-Balkan clans of Thracians and Dacians ruled this region preceding the Roman success. Belgrade was occupied by a Thraco-Dacian clan "Singi"; after the Celtic attack in 279 BC, the Scordisci took the city, naming it "SingidÃÂ«n" ("dÃÂ«n", fortification). In 34Ã¢ÂÂ 33 BC, the Roman armed force, driven by Silanus, achieved Belgrade. It turned into the romanised "Singidunum" in the first century AD and, by the mid-second century, the city was announced a "municipium" by the Roman experts, advancing into an undeniable "colonia" (most noteworthy city class) before the century's over. While the main Christian Emperor of Rome Ã¢ÂÂ Constantine I, otherwise called Constantine the GreatÃ¢ÂÂwas conceived in the domain of Naissus in southern Serbia, Roman Christianity's boss, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was conceived in Singidunum. Jovian restored Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, finishing the concise recovery of customary Roman religions under his antecedent Julian the Apostate. In 395ÃÂ AD, the site go toward the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Over the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were associated with a scaffold all through Roman and Byzantine occasions.
