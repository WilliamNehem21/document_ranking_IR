"Baby Boy" attained a positioning on the commercial charts before its physical release in the United States. The track led to a higher "Billboard" 200 chart placing for "Dangerously in Love", and helped the album to attain multi-platinum certification in the United States. The single debuted on the "Billboard" Hot 100, at number fifty-seven, while its predecessor "Crazy in Love" was still on the top spot. "Baby Boy" dominated the airplays in the United States, ultimately reaching the top of the "Billboard" Hot 100. It reached the chart's top spot eight weeks after its debut, and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. The single stayed number one for a week longer than "Crazy in Love" had, becoming BeyoncÃ©'s longest-charting number-one single. The feat was not broken until her single "Irreplaceable" (2006), from her second album "B'Day" (2006), spent ten weeks at the top spot from late 2006 until early 2007 due to heavy airplay. "Baby Boy" stayed on the HotÂ 100 for twenty-nine weeks, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 6, 2006. "Baby Boy" achieved success on "Billboard" crossover and mainstream radio charts, appearing on the Top 40 Tracks, Rhythmic and Mainstream Top 40, as well as peaking atop the Radio Songs and Dance/Mix Show Airplay, and at number two on Dance Club Songs. As of October 6, 2010, "Baby Boy" had sold 600,000 physical units in the United States.
