Many reviewers felt that the high level of skill required to play the game was part of its appeal. In 1996, "Next Generation" ranked the arcade version of "Marble Madness" as number 15 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", explaining that "The Genesis conversion was cool, but ultimately the "Marble Madness" experience just doesn't happen with a joypad. This ... is a game that has to be played in the arcade to be appreciated." In 2008, Levi Buchanan of IGN listed "Marble Madness" as one of several titles in his "dream arcade", citing the game's difficulty and the fond memories he had playing it. Author John Sellers wrote that difficulty was a major reason that players were attracted. Other engaging factors included the graphics, visual design, and the soundtrack. "Retro Gamer"s Craig Grannell, in referring to the game as one of the most distinctive arcade games ever made, praised its visuals as "pure and timeless". In 2008, "Guinness World Records" listed it as the number seventy-nine arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact. "Marble Madness" was one of the first games to use true stereo sound and have a recognizable musical score. British composer Paul Weir commented that the music had character and helped give the game a unique identity. A common complaint about the arcade cabinet was that the track ball controls frequently broke from repeated use.
