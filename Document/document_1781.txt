Starting as ahead of schedule as 1973, just seven years after the start of generation, the French started an exploration program for a future adjustment of the tank. The venture was to result in a " AMX 30 ValorisÃÂ©" ("overhauled AMX-30"). In June 1979, the French Army chose to both form new and modernize existing AMX-30s with an improved flame control framework and another transmission, and assigned them AMX-30B2s. The principal new generation vehicles were taken into administration in January 1982. Enhancements to the COTAC APX M-508 flame control framework incorporated the establishment of a laser rangefinder and a low-light TV (LLTV). The principle firearm's lethality was improved with the presentation of another protection puncturing blade balanced out disposing of sabot (APFSDS). The first motor was traded for an improved variation, known as the HS-110.2, delivering . Poor people transmission was supplanted with the self-loader SESM ENC200 transmission (presently RENK France), with a torque converter. The suspension was improved by embracing new torsion bars and stuns, which expanded the vertical redirection scope of the street wheels, along these lines improving the tank's rough terrain versatility. From 1998, the French armed force began to supplant the motors of its remaining AMX-30 tanks and variations with 500 Renault Mack E9 750ÃÂ hp motors.
