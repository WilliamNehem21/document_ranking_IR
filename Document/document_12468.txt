"Singin' and Swingin"' opens not long after Angelou's past collection of memoirs, "Assemble in My Name". Marguerite, or Maya, a single parent with a youthful child, is in her mid twenties, attempting to bring home the bacon. Angelou writes in this book, similar to her past works, about the full scope of her own encounters. As researcher Dolly McPherson states, "When one experiences Maya Angelou in her story, one experiences the cleverness, the torment, the extravagance, the trustworthiness, and the assurance of an individual who has encountered life completely and held her solid feeling of self". Numerous individuals around Angelou impact her development andÃ¢ÂÂas commentator Lyman B. Hagen statesÃ¢ÂÂ"impel Angelou ever forward". The book's opening sections discover Maya worried about, as Hagen declares, "misgiving about her child, a longing for a home, and confronting racial clashes, and looking for a vocation". Maya is offered a vocation as a salesgirl in a record shop on Fillmore Street in San Francisco. At first she welcomes her white manager's ideas of liberality and companionship with doubt, yet following two months of scanning for proof of prejudice, Maya starts to "unwind and appreciate a universe of music". The activity enables her to move once more into her mom's home and to invest more energy with her child.
