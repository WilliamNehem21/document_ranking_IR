It is misty when Kujau created his first Hitler journal. Stiefel says Kujau gave him a journal on advance in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he started in 1978, following a month's work on writing in the old German gothic content Hitler had utilized. Kujau utilized one of a heap of journals he had purchased inexpensively in East Berlin, and endeavored to put the letters "AH" in gold on the frontÃ¢ÂÂobtaining plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a retail chain, he incidentally utilized "FH" instead of "AH". He took the dark strip from a certifiable SS archive and appended it to the spread utilizing a German armed force wax seal. For the ink, he purchased two containers of Pelikan inkÃ¢ÂÂone dark, one blueÃ¢ÂÂand blended them with water so it would stream all the more effectively from the modest current pen he utilized. At last, he sprinkled tea over the pages and slammed the journals against his work area to give them a matured look. Kujau demonstrated the principal volume to Stiefel, who was awed and thought it a certified Hitler journal; Stiefel needed to get it, in any case, when the falsifier cannot, the pair concurred that the authority could have it on credit.
