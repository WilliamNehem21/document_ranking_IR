Lana Tisdel's potential contribution in the assault and murder of Brandon Teena was additionally featured. Different individuals engaged with the case, especially Brandon's family, have asserted that Tisdel was by one way or another required with the killings, or had in any event set them up in a demonstration of retaliation. Maybe the most outstanding confirmation about Tisdel's intentions originated from Tom Nissen, who scandalously admitted that Tisdel was available at the season of the killings in the vehicle and had even taken a stab at thumping on the entryway of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were remaining. At the point when no one addressed the entryway, Nissen affirms that Lotter broke in while Tisdel held up in the vehicle while the homicides were done. Tisdel denied this and an absence of proof implied that it couldn't be enthusiastically sought after in the procedure court caseÃ¢ÂÂthe managing judge thought about the greater part of Nissen's cases as simply noise. Not exclusively did Tisdel energetically deny any inclusion in Brandon's homicide, she denied regularly being available at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was killed. Not at all like Tisdel's very own proof and the affirmations displayed in court, "Young men Don't Cry" ventured to put Tisdel at the wrongdoing scene, but with no expectation of setting Brandon up.
