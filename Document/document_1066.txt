On July 12 a supercell rainstorm created over eastern New Jersey in relationship with a surface low-weight region in southwestern Ontario. Daytime warming in the Tri-State Region prompted moderate unsteadiness, a key factor in the advancement of showers and tempests.

That equivalent tempest escalated and formed into a supercell as it crossed into New York. About 15ÃÂ minutes later, a tornado cautioning was issued for southern Rockland and Westchester regions which would stay as a result until 4:15ÃÂ p.m.ÃÂ EDT (21:15ÃÂ UTC).
