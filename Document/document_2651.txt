In the south, two Soviet divisions were joined on the northern side of the Lake Ladoga waterfront street. As previously, these divisions were caught as the more versatile Finnish units counterattacked from the north to flank the Soviet segments. On 19 December, the Finns briefly stopped their strikes because of weariness. It was not until the time of 6Ã¢ÂÂ 16 January 1940 that the Finns continued their hostile, partitioning Soviet divisions into littler "mottis." Contrary to Finnish desires, the encompassed Soviet divisions did not attempt to get through toward the east but rather dug in. They were anticipating that fortifications and supplies should land via air. As the Finns did not have the important substantial big guns gear and were shy of men, they frequently did not legitimately assault the "mottis" they had made; rather, they attempted to wipe out just the most hazardous dangers. Regularly the "motti" strategy was not connected as a system, however as a Finnish adjustment to the conduct of Soviet troops enduring an onslaught. Disregarding the cold and craving, the Soviet troops did not surrender effectively but rather battled valiantly, regularly settling in their tanks to be utilized as pillboxes and building timber burrows. Some authority Finnish troopers were brought in to assault the "mottis"; the most celebrated of them was Major Matti Aarnio, or "Motti-Matti" as he wound up known.
