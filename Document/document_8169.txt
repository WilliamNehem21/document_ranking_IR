Amid the rest of the 1930s Gibbons delivered five additional books, just as two verse accumulations, a youngsters' book, and various short stories. From November 1936 the family home was in Oakshott Avenue, on the Holly Lodge Estate off Highgate West Hill, where Gibbons consistently worked in the mornings from ten until noon. Her books were commonly generally welcomed by commentators and people in general, however none earned the awards or consideration that had been given to "Limited consolidation Farm"; perusers of "The Times" were explicitly cautioned not to anticipate Gibbons' second novel, "Bassett" (1934), to be a reiteration of the prior perfect work of art. "Enbury Heath" (1935) is a generally reliable record of her youth and early grown-up existence with, as indicated by Oliver, "just the most slender cloak of anecdotal cloth cover[ing] crude experience". "Miss Linsey and Pa" (1936) was thought by Nicola Beauman, in her examination of ladies authors from 1914 to 1939, to spoof Radclyffe Hall's 1928 lesbian novel "The Well of Loneliness". Gibbons' last prewar books were "Songbird Wood" (1935)Ã¢ÂÂ "Cinderella conveyed straight state-of-the-art"Ã¢ÂÂ and "My American" (1939), which Oliver thinks about her most idealist novel, "a variation of Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen"."
