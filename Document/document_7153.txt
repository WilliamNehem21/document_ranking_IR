Proof of rivalry between the landed privileged and the city-based white collar classes in the political, monetary and social circles has been bore witness to since the eleventh century, yet the size of the contention that ejected in 1341 was extraordinary. This class struggle was reflected in the breakaway Byzantine Empire of Trebizond also, where an expert supreme and genius Constantinopolitan urban group stood up to the common landholding nobility somewhere in the range of 1340 and 1349 (cf. Trapezuntine Civil War). The more traditionalist and hostile to Western inclinations of the nobles, and their connections to the staunchly Orthodox and against Catholic religious communities, additionally disclose their expanded connection to the otherworldly Hesychasm development supported by Gregory Palamas, whose sees were for the most part restricted in the urban communities. Albeit a few noteworthy special cases leave the issue open to address among present day researchers, in the contemporary prevalent personality (and in conventional historiography), the supporters of "Palamism" and of "Kantakouzenism" were normally compared. Kantakouzenos' inevitable triumph additionally implied the triumph of Hesychasm, affirmed in a synod in Constantinople in 1351. Hesychasm in the long run turned into a sign of the Orthodox church convention, in spite of the fact that it was dismissed by the Catholics as a sin.
