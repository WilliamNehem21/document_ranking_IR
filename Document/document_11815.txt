Stigand may have been responsible for the regal organization. He may likewise have been behind the push to find Edward the Atheling and his sibling Edmund after 1052, potentially to verify an increasingly satisfactory beneficiary to King Edward. His landholdings were spread crosswise over ten regions, and in a portion of those districts, his territories were bigger than the ruler's property. Albeit Norman advocates guaranteed that as ahead of schedule as 1051 or 1052 King Edward guaranteed the position of royalty of England to Duke William of Normandy, who later moved toward becoming King William the Conqueror, there is minimal contemporary proof of such a guarantee from non-Norman sources. By 1053, Edward most likely understood that he would not have a child from his marriage, and he and his guides started to scan for a beneficiary. Edward the Atheling, the child of King Edmund Ironside (ruled 1016), had been banished from England in 1017, after his dad's passing. Despite the fact that Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, went to the Continent looking for Edward the Exile, Ian Walker, the biographer of King Harold Godwinson, feels that Stigand was behind the exertion. At last, in spite of the fact that Edward returned to England, he kicked the bucket not long after his arrival, leaving a youthful child Edgar the ÃÂtheling.
