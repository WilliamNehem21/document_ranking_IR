Coming back to Australia in November 1949, Eaton progressed toward becoming Deputy Director of Training at the Department of Air, Canberra, where he stayed until 1951. Soon thereafter, he was named Officer Commanding No.ÃÂ 78 (Fighter) Wing at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales. He had returned to a substantive position of wing administrator since leaving Japan, as the RAAF shrank significantly with retirement and numerous senior officers lost the brief or acting positions they had picked up in wartime. On 15ÃÂ September, he handled a Vampire fly warrior at Point Cook with one punctured tire and one wheel withdrawn, after its undercarriage had turned out to be stuck. The plane slipped off the runway yet Eaton had the capacity to leave, apparently commenting "Great, I didn't wreck it". He wedded Josephine Rumbles at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 10ÃÂ May 1952; the couple later had a child and two little girls. Following Britain's solicitation to the Australian government for a Commonwealth battalion in the Mediterranean, in July 1952 Eaton drove No.ÃÂ 78 Wing on sending to RAF Hal Far close Valletta, Malta, where its battle squadrons, Nos.ÃÂ 75 and 76, were furnished with rented Vampire FB9s. As the abroad posting was for at least two years, his new lady of the hour and the groups of other staff were allowed to make the adventure too. The Australian pilots partook in numerous NATO practices while positioned at Malta, and one year took first and second spot in the Middle Eastern Gunnery Contest for the "Imshi" Mason Cup. Elevated to the substantive position of gathering commander on 1ÃÂ January 1953, Eaton was allowed direction of RAF Ta'Kali when the wing exchanged there from Hal Far in June.
