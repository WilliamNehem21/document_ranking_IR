Different analysts have advised against the end that "The Oceanides" is either a case of impressionism or by one way or another elaborately obligated to Debussy. Tawaststjerna, for instance, trusts that the piece's "dock in the significant minor agreement and the moderately saving utilization of modular and entire tone formulae" shows that the tone sonnet "has a place with the universe recently sentimentalism", the impressionistic character of its surface, consonant vocabulary, and cadenced examples in any case. Hurwitz has in like manner scrutinized the "thundering waterfall of drivel in the Sibelius writing" about the impact of the French impressionists on the writer. "Comparative melodic issues regularly produce comparative arrangements", Hurwitz notes. "For this situation, any symphonic representation of the sea will undoubtedly depend more on surface and shading than on vocal song, for the basic reason that the sea isn't an individual and does not singÃÂ ... nor does it loan itself toÃÂ ... [an] human approachÃÂ ...". Layton recognizes the nearness of "typical Sibelian systems and procedures" in "The Oceanides", rejecting any genuine obligation to Debussy. "Its development from the opening bars forward is significantly natural", Layton composes. "What's more, its evident freedom from the remainder of Sibelius' work is show just at a shallow dimension".
