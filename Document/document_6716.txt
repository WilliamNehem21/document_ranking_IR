The Mitford family dates from the Norman time, when Sir John de Mitford held the Castle of Mitford in Northumberland. A later Sir John held a few critical open workplaces amid the late fourteenth and mid fifteenth hundreds of years, and the family kept up a convention of open administration for some ages. In the eighteenth century William Mitford was a main traditional antiquarian, in charge of the conclusive history of antiquated Greece. His incredible grandson Algernon Bertram Mitford, conceived in 1837 and known as "Bertie", was a representative and explorer who held minor office in Disraeli's second service, from 1874 to 1880. In 1874 he wedded Clementina, the second little girl of David Ogilvy, tenth Earl of Airlie, an association that connected the Mitfords to a portion of Britain's most conspicuous blue-blooded families. Blanche Ogilvy, Clementina's senior sister, turned into the spouse of Sir Henry Montague Hozier, a warrior turned representative. Their four kids included little girls Clementine ("Clemmie"), who in 1908 wedded the future British leader Winston Churchill, and Nellie who wedded Bertram Romilly. Both Hozier and Blanche were wanton, and it is commonly acknowledged by antiquarians and relatives that Hozier was not Clemmie's dad, in spite of the fact that he was enlisted all things considered. Blanche revealed to her companion Lady Londonderry, in no time before Clemmie's introduction to the world, that the dad of the normal kid was her own brother by marriage, Bertie Mitford; most students of history trust that different contender for the paternity are more probable.
