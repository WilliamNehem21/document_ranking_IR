France had as of late attacked the Duchy of Aquitaine, at that point an English regal belonging. Accordingly, King Edward sent Isabella to Paris, joined by their thirteen-year-old child, Edward, to arrange a settlement. Peers trusted she had sworn, on leaving, never to come back to England with the Despensers in power. Not long after her entry, correspondence among Isabella and her better half, also among them and her sibling King Charles IV of France and Pope John XXII, successfully revealed the regal couple's expanding antagonism to the world. A contemporary recorder reports how Isabella and Edward turned out to be progressively blistering of one another, compounding relations. By December 1325 she had gone into a perhaps sexual relationship in Paris with the well off banished aristocrat Roger Mortimer. This was open information in England by March 1326, and the King straightforwardly thought about a separation. He requested that Isabella and Edward come back to England, which they would not do: "she sent back a significant number of her entourage yet gave insignificant reasons for not returning herself" noticed her biographer, John Parsons. Their child's inability to break with his mom irritated the King further. Isabella turned out to be progressively strident in her reactions of Edward's legislature, especially against Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, a nearby partner of the King and Despenser. Ruler Edward distanced his child by putting the sovereign's homes under illustrious organization in January 1326, and the next month the King requested that both he and his mom be captured on arriving in England.
