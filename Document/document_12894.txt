It would be practically 20ÃÂ years before Vargas Llosa composed another real work: "The Feast of the Goat" ("La holiday del chivo"), a political spine chiller, was distributed in 2000 (and in English in 2001). As indicated by Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most finished and most aggressive novel since "The War of the End of the World". Pundit Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his prior books, for example, "ConversaciÃÂ³n en la catedral" portraying the impacts of dictatorship, savagery and the maltreatment of intensity on the person. In light of the fascism of Rafael Trujillo, who represented the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his death in 1961, the novel has three fundamental strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the little girl of a previous legislator and Trujillo follower, who returns out of the blue since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's death 30ÃÂ years prior; the second focuses on the death itself, the schemers who complete it, and its results; and the third and last strand manages Trujillo himself in scenes from the finish of his routine. The book immediately gotten positive audits in Spain and Latin America, and has had a noteworthy effect in Latin America, being viewed as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.
