At the season of her passing, Eberhardt's assets incorporated a few of her unpublished original copies. Lyautey educated his officers to scan for every last bit of her papers in the result of the flood, and posted those that could be found to Barrucand. In the wake of remaking them, substituting his very own words where the firsts were missing or too harmed to even consider deciphering, he started to distribute her work. Some of what he distributed is viewed as a larger number of his work than Eberhardt's. Barrucand likewise gotten analysis for posting himself as the co-creator of a portion of the distributions, and for not clearing up which segments of content were his own. The primary after death story, ""Dans l'Ombre Chaude de l'Islam"" (In the Warm Shadow of Islam) got basic recognition when it was distributed in 1906. The book's prosperity attracted incredible regard for Eberhardt's composition and built up her as among the best journalists of writing propelled by Africa. A road was named after Eberhardt in BÃÂ©char and another in Algiers. The road in Algiers is in the edges; one essayist at the time remarked there was a miserable imagery in the reality the road "starts in an occupied quarter and subsides into a no man's land". She was after death seen as a backer of woman's rights and decolonisation; as indicated by Hedi Abdel-Jaouad in "Yale French Studies", her work may have started the decolonisation of North Africa. Eberhardt's association with Lyautey has activated discourse by present day antiquarians about her complicity in expansionism.
