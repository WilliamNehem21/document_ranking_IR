The 1936 rupture was never fixed and shows a noteworthy hole in the trench's course. On the Salford arm, despite the fact that in great condition, the main three locks at Prestolee are neglected; the last three have been expelled. The waterway is in water from the base of the lock trip through to Ringley Locks. Ringley Bridge is infilled, just like the trench through Ringley Village and Giants Seat Locks. Kilcoby Bridge is missing and from that point the trench is out of reach until it achieves the M60 motorway. Congested, Rhodes Lock is still in sensible condition. At least one power arches straddle the infilled trench between Rhodes Lock and the motorway, which has been worked over the line of the channel. A slop tidal pond worked amid the motorway's development obstructs a short segment toward Clifton Aqueduct. The waterway does not take water again until past Clifton Aqueduct, where a short length exists between the previous Pilkington manufacturing plant and the Enersys production line. Lumn's Lane Aqueduct is missing however the waterway is in water among there and Holland Street. Past this point the channel is infilled and in parts worked over, particularly through Pendleton. Its intersection with the River Irwell in Salford has as of late been reestablished and made traversable.
