USÂ 113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware state line in three sections starting in 1998. The first section was constructed on a new alignment from north of MDÂ 818 to south of MDÂ 589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MDÂ 90 interchange 24 years after it was partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of USÂ 113 reconstruction, from south of MDÂ 589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MDÂ 589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of USÂ 113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MDÂ 575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special Recognition of a Small Project Award to the Maryland Department of Transportation for the department's use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce the time needed to complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin.
