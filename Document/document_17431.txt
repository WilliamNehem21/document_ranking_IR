Barrymore spent the second half of 1915 making three films, including "The Red Widow", which he called "the worst film I ever made" in his 1926 autobiography. In April 1916, he starred in John Galsworthy's prison drama "Justice", again at the instigation of Sheldon. The play was a critical success, and "The New York Times" thought the audience saw "Barrymore play as he had never played before, and so, by his work as the wretched prisoner in "Justice", step forward into a new position on the American stage." The critic went on to say that Barrymore gave "an extraordinary performance in every detail of appearance and manner, in every note of deep feelingÂ ... a superb performance."
From early 1916, Barrymore had been living apart from Katherine, and she sued for divorce in November 1916. By the time the divorce was finalized in December 1917, he had taken the lead role in the film "Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman". He had also tried to enlist in the U.S. Army following the country's entry into World WarÂ I, but Army doctors revealed that he had varicose veins, and he was not accepted for military service. For over a year beginning in April 1917, he appeared together with Lionel in a stage version of George du Maurier's 1891 novel "Peter Ibbetson". The play and the two Barrymores were warmly regarded by the critics. Around this time, Barrymore began a relationship with a married mother of two, Blanche Oelrichs, a suffragist from an elite Rhode Island family with what Peters calls "anarchistic self-confidence". Oelrichs also published poetry under the name Michael Strange. While their relationship began in secret, it became more open after Oelrichs' husband was commissioned into the army and then posted to France.
