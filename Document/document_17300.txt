In "The New Yorker", "The Ecstatic" was hailed as Mos Def's "most conceptually knotty and ambitious work", while Aaron wrote in "Spin" that the "internationalist return to form" was also "perhaps his liveliest work". For "The Irish Times", Jim Carroll said the rapper had not performed this engagingly or skillfully since his career beginnings, highlighting especially "Supermagic" and "Life in Marvelous Times". Mick Middles from "The Quietus" appraised it as "the joyful sound of a rampant artist, unrestrained by expectation or commercialism", with free-flowing music that escaped the boundaries his previous albums had merely pushed. Thompson believed the diverse range of samples made it "a crate-digger's wet dream" and "a thrillingly accessible demonstration of hip-hop's limitless creative possibilities" to a layperson. Writing in "MSN Music", Christgau felt the songs were "devoid of hooks but full of sounds you want to hear again", along with "thoughtfully slurred" yet intelligible lyrics by Mos Def, whose creative vision warranted the introductory Malcolm X sample. In the opinion of "Time"s Josh Tyrangiel, his political meditations may not appeal to conservatives but are rich in "the rhythm, exuberance and wit Mos Def showed on his early records". Steve Jones of "USA Today" said his reflections on politics, love, religion, and societal conditions were full of insight and sincerity while calling the album his strongest effort.
