Vergne was the quickest driver not to progress into the last session; his best lap time of one moment and 34.984 seconds was two seconds off Rosberg's pace in the second session. Since his group had changed his motor, he got a ten-place network punishment, his 6th of the period. This advanced the Force India of Sergio PÃÂ©rez to eleventh position; the Mexican driver had experienced slower vehicles entering the last chicane, which constrained him to diminish his speed and lose brake and tire temperature. Kvyat's last coordinated lap was upset by slower vehicles; when he entered the main corner his tires had not achieved their ideal temperature, bargaining his run and abandoning him twelfth. Nico HÃÂ¼lkenberg qualified thirteenth in the other Force India after he bolted his tires at the last chicane. Adrian Sutil advanced to the second passing session subsequent to making balance set-up changes, and took fourteenth in its end seconds; his Sauber partner, GutiÃÂ©rrez, battled with tire temperature and was postponed by traffic on his out-lap, abandoning him fifteenth. Minister Maldonado neglected to progress past the principal qualifying session, however Lotus introduced another motor (his 6th of the year) in his E22 frame on Friday morning. Like Vergne, he brought about a ten-place lattice punishment (persisted to the following race since he qualified inside the best ten base positions). His colleague, Romain Grosjean, took over sixteenth position and meant to qualify higher; in any case, an adjustment in wind course kept him from account a quicker lap time. Ericsson and Jules Bianchi began from seventeenth and eighteenth, with Kobayashi nineteenth and Vergne twentieth. Chilton lost control of his Marussia's back, making him begin 21st.
