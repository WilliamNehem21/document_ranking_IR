Fouroux was prevailing by Daniel Dubroca, who instructed the group to the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's residency as mentor did not keep going long, in any case, as he surrendered after fiercely defying official David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-last against England. Dubroca was supplanted by Pierre Berbizier, who instructed the group until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's substitution, Jean-Claude Skrela, instructed France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 preceding they came toward the end in the competition in 1999. He formally surrendered following France's misfortune to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup last. Bernard Laporte was named as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before venturing down to progress toward becoming Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-AndrÃÂ© turned down the idea to supplant Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset designated Marc LiÃÂ¨vremont to control France to the 2011 World Cup. LiÃÂ¨vremont's residency as mentor was set apart by conflicting and bewildering squad choice decisions, and player discontent. There were some brilliant minutes, prominently wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. Yet, there was likewise a 59Ã¢ÂÂ 16 misfortune to Australia in Paris, a 22Ã¢ÂÂ 21 misfortune to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19Ã¢ÂÂ 14 misfortune to Tonga amid the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, preceding the World Cup, it was reported that Philippe Saint-AndrÃÂ© would supplant LiÃÂ¨vremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This did not shock LiÃÂ¨vremont, as he had declared as ahead of schedule as May 2010 that he would not proceed as the mentor of France after the World Cup.
