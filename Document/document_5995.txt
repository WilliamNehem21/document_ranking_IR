The report on the catastrophe showed that it was vital, with the signs concerned being on the right-hand side of the train and due to the restricted perceivability from the left-hand side of a steam train, for either the fire fighter to watch those signs (yet with the driver being in charge of requesting that he do as such) or for the driver to traverse the footplate from his left-hand driving position to watch them from the opposite side. In the occasion, the driver did not one or the other, and neither driver nor fire fighter paid special mind to the part of the signs. The report credited fault to the driver, yet suggested that the class be fitted with more extensive windscreens to improve perceivability, taking note of that, in mist with under 80 yards of perceivability, the three signs included would not be noticeable at all from the driver's side of the footplate; notwithstanding, it noticed that, even from a Schools class train with its a lot littler evaporator, it was far-fetched that these signs could have been seen from the driver's side in the thick foggy states of the episode. The report did not propose that poor lifting of smoke discouraged perceivability.
