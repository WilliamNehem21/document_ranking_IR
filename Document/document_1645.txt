Juster says the book was protected from the leftovers table when Emily Maxwell composed a solid survey of it in "The New Yorker". Maxwell expressed, "As "Traveler's Progress" is worried about the enlivening of the sluggardly soul, "The Phantom Tollbooth" is worried about the enlivening of the languid personality." Hers was a long way from the main constructive piece; youngsters' writer Ann McGovern surveyed it for "The New York Times", stating "Norton Juster's astonishing dream has something awesome for anybody mature enough to savor the symbolic insight of "Alice in Wonderland" and the pointed eccentricity of "The Wizard of Oz"ÃÂ ". John Crosby composed for the "New York Herald Tribune", "In a world which in some cases appears to have gone distraught, it is reviving to delay and consider for a minute a book for kids which contains a character called 'Faintly Macabre, the not really insidious Which.' The name of the book is "The Phantom Tollbooth" and it was composed by a whiskery mythical person named Norton Juster and outlined by Jules Feiffer, who is the cleverest of the youthful depressed people". Disagreeing was the "Notice of the Center for Children's Books", which in March 1962 esteemed the book an "escalated and broad dream, intensely loaded with invention and eccentricity".
