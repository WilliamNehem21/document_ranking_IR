At 07:00 on 21 September, the mounted guns batteries of the two rifle regiments and the twentieth Brigade started shooting from the southern bank of the Niemen, obliterating the primary Polish strongpointsÃ¢ÂÂgarisson huts, places of worship, and channelsÃ¢ÂÂon the northern bank of the Niemen. The 119th Regiment at that point crossed toward the north bank and revamped an extension for the tanks to utilize. Subsequent to overcoming a gathering of Polish officers in the PoniemuÃÂ locale, the regiment caught the eastern piece of the city. In the interim, the 101st Regiment and a tank organization from the 27th Brigade, which crossed the stream behind the 119th, annihilated a gathering of around 250 officers shielding the lush slopes east of the city, at that point propelled upper east and caught the railroad station before the day's over. The twentieth Brigade caught the southwestern piece of the city, however was unfit to propel northward in light of solid Polish obstruction in the houses and channels close to the extension and the tobacco manufacturing plant. The Soviet advances on 21 September brought about the concealment of vast pockets of obstruction, and amid the night, remainders of the Polish protectors withdrew toward Sapotskin and SuwaÃÂki.
