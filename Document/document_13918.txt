The dodo had around nineteen presynsacral vertebrae (those of the neck and thorax, including three combined into a notarium), sixteen synsacral vertebrae (those of the lumbar area and sacrum), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a pygostyle. The neck had all around created zones for muscle and tendon connection, presumably to help the substantial skull and mouth. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which verbalized with the sternum through sternal ribs. The sternum was substantial, however little in connection to the body contrasted with those of a lot littler pigeons that can fly. The sternum was very pneumatic, expansive, and moderately thick in cross-segment. The bones of the pectoral support, shoulder bones, and wing bones were decreased in size contrasted with those of flighted pigeon, and were progressively gracile contrasted with those of the Rodrigues solitaire, however none of the individual skeletal segments had vanished. The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more vigorous than that of the solitaire, in any case. The pelvis was more extensive than that of the solitaire and different relatives, yet was practically identical to the extents in some littler, flighted pigeons. A large portion of the leg bones were more vigorous than those of surviving pigeons and the solitaire, however the length extents were minimal unique.
