A reunion episode was speculated after the fifth series ended; in the 2003 documentary "Cold Feet: The Final Call", executive producer Andy Harries stated, "By killing a character, you are truly saying 'this series is over' â¦ until, of course, in 10 years time when money is running a bit short for all of us, we bring it back. What we do with Rachel, I don't know yetâbut I have got a few theories." In an interview published in October 2003, Harries told "The Daily Telegraph" that ITV would "probably" bring back "Cold Feet" ten years after it ended, and said, "There's a tacit understanding with the actors that we will re-visit it again at the appropriate time." In 2007, a tabloid newspaper quoted an ITV "insider" as saying that a reunion episode would be broadcast to mark ten years since the pilot aired. The report turned out to be a fabrication. At the 2010 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Harries stated that discussions about the series' return were "ongoing", but highlighted a number of factors that would prevent a reunion in the near future. The following day, Harries told Kate Silverton that he had held discussions with Mike Bullen about the series returning, but that it would not be back on television screens in 2011 or 2012.
