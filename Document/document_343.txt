After his interpretation to Canterbury, Stigand discharged Elmham to his sibling ÃÂthelmÃÂ¦r yet held the ward of Winchester. Canterbury and Winchester were the two most extravagant finds in England, and keeping in mind that point of reference permitted the holding of a rich see alongside a poor one, there was no point of reference for holding two rich sees simultaneously. He may have held Winchester out of covetousness, or his hang on Canterbury might not have been secure. Other than these, he held the monastery of Gloucester and the convent of Ely and maybe different nunneries too. Whatever his reasons, the maintenance of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one benefice in the meantime. This was a training that was focused for disposal by the developing change development in the congregation. Five progressive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II and Alexander II) expelled Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury in the meantime. It has been proposed by the student of history Emma Mason that Edward wouldn't expel Stigand in light of the fact that this would have undermined the illustrious right to select religious administrators and ecclesiastical overseers without ecclesiastical information. Further harming Stigand's position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 proclaimed pluralism to be uncanonical except if affirmed by the pope.
