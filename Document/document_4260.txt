The first of Crane's boards portrayed the Union Street fire. It is an admired picture portraying Ayres as the protected as opposed to the rescuer, mixing religious symbolism with customary nineteenth century images of British bravery, and bears no relationship to real occasions. Ayres, in a long and streaming unadulterated white outfit, remains at a first floor window, encompassed on fire and holding a little kid. A fire fighter remains on a stepping stool and connects with Ayres and the youngster; in the mean time, a mariner in full Royal Navy uniform holds a second kid.

Crane's image in the Red Cross Hall was itself referenced in , a fringe anthem by National Trust author Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley distributed in his 1896 "Numbers of Brave Deeds", for which George Frederic Watts composed the prelude.
