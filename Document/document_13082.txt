In 1905, three years after the Apperson siblings split from Haynes, Haynes-Apperson was renamed the Haynes Automobile Company and Haynes propelled a progression of exposure crusades. A motorcade of 2,000 autos was sorted out in New York City amid 1908 and Haynes, whom many perceived as the designer of the American vehicle, drove the procession down Broadway riding in the "Pioneer". He was trailed by ten Haynes autos, a model from every year to show the progression in innovation. On his way to the procession, Haynes was ignorant of the city's recently settled speeding laws and was captured for driving excessively quickÃ¢ÂÂin a vehicle with a top speed of 15ÃÂ mph (17ÃÂ km/h)Ã¢ÂÂ and taken to imprison. He was soon ready to see a judge who discharged him subsequent to discovering that he was Elwood Haynes and had come to lead the motorcade. The festival was expected to be a ten-year recognition of the innovation of the car, albeit prior self-vehicles dated back about twenty years in Europe. Haynes gave the "Pioneer" to the United States Government in 1910 to be set in the Smithsonian Institution where it is still in plain view in the National Museum of American History as the second most established mechanized vehicle in the United States.
