On 6 September 1937, Captain FÃ©lix Verdeja, commanding the maintenance company of the Nationalist "BatallÃ³n de Carros de Combate" ("Tank Battalion"), began to privately develop a new light tank. His position, with direct access to Panzer Is and T-26s, gave Verdeja direct evidence of the shortcomings of current tank models in terms of combat ability and maintenance issues. Verdeja established a future tank requiring the 45Â millimetre (1.77Â in) gun fitted in the T-26; two coaxial light machine guns; a low profile, all-around armor greater than 15Â millimetres (0.6Â in), with a turret mantlet plate of at least 30Â millimetres (1.2Â in); road speed of , combat range of , and a capable suspension and new track system. This latter requirement was based on experiences with existing light tanks, which frequently lost their tracks in combat. These requirements and solutions were presented in October 1938 to Colonel DÃ­az de la Lastra, commanding officer of the "AgrupaciÃ³n de Carros de Combate". Although the project was approved, the program had to use scrap to build the first prototype due to a lack of resources and money. Despite early obstacles, including criticism from von Thoma, the program continued and Verdeja was awarded a warehouse in Zaragoza to continue with the construction of the prototype.Â
