Unable to adequately rehabilitate his hamstring, Wheatley retired from the NFL and returned to Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the University of Michigan, in 2005, he volunteered as a track coach while finishing his Bachelor's degree in sport management. In November 2006, Wheatley was hired at his alma mater, Robichaud High School, as the track coach. After taking Robichaud to their first conference title he was also hired as the football coach. To prepare for his coaching duties he partook in Jon Gruden's NFL minority coaching internship by working with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a NFL Minority coaching fellow during the 2006 training camp. As football coach in 2007, Wheatley started with a 6â1 record before facing the team's rival, the undefeated Inkster High School. Despite losing on the field to Inkster, the team was credited with a forfeit victory and compiled an 8â1 regular season record. The team achieved its first berth in 13Â years in the MHSAA Class B playoffs, one year after going 0â9. The team won its first round playoff match against Dearborn Heights Annapolis High School and lost its second to Milan High School to finish with a 9â2 record. The team last won the MHSAA title in 1990 during Wheatley's senior season with a 12â1 record. During Wheatley's absence the team was a state semifinalist in 1991 with a 10â2 record and made a playoff appearance in 1994. In addition to coaching, Wheatley has worked as an athletic trainer to about 30Â clients.
