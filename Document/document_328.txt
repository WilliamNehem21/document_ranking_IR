Researcher Andrea Loewenstein distributed the first top to bottom survey of Bannon's books in 1980, and noticed that they were "astoundingly great mash" that caused startling solid sentiments of bitterness or outrage among lesbians when they were perused twenty years subsequent to being distributed. Bannon delineates severe jobs of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as pointless, closeted, neurotic, and alcoholic. Loewenstein comments that perusers in 1980 tended to dismiss that sort of reality in Bannon's accounts. "Since quite a bit of our past is so harsh, [we]ÃÂ ... imagine away our latest history". Loewenstein recommends the battles Bannon's characters suffered were ones that Bannon probably confronted herself. At the point when Laura announces her satisfaction in her affection for Beth in "Odd Girl Out" while at the same time addressing in the event that it is correct, Loewenstein states "one hears unmistakably the voice of Ann Bannon, scrutinizing her own entitlement to joy". Also, commenting on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in "Ladies in the Shadows" by making her rough, drunkard and foolish, Loewenstein notes, "she needs to mortify Beebo so gravely that she influences her to vanish". Loewenstein comments Bannon's characters are profoundly tangled by getting a charge out of connections they feel are ethically wrong, and they are carrying on cycles of self-loathing, however what stays toward the end is "surprisinglyÃÂ ... energetic, delicate, and sensual".
