From the mid 1920s Poulenc was generally welcomed abroad, especially in Britain, both as an entertainer and a writer. In 1921 Ernest Newman wrote in "The Manchester Guardian", "I watch out for Francis Poulenc, a young fellow who has just barely touched base at his twenties. He should form into a farceur of the primary request." Newman said that he had once in a while heard anything so scrumptiously foolish as parts of Poulenc's tune cycle "Cocardes", with its backup played by the strange blend of cornet, trombone, violin and percussion. In 1922 Poulenc and Milhaud headed out to Vienna to meet Alban Berg, Anton Webern and Arnold SchÃÂ¶nberg. Neither of the French authors was affected by their Austrian associates' progressive twelve-tone framework, yet they respected the three as its driving advocates. The next year Poulenc got a commission from Sergei Diaghilev for a full-length expressive dance score. He chose that the subject would be a cutting edge adaptation of the established French "fÃÂªte galante". This work, "Les biches", was a quick achievement, first in Monte Carlo in January 1924 and afterward in Paris in May, under the course of AndrÃÂ© Messager; it has stayed a standout amongst Poulenc's best-known scores. Poulenc's new big name after the accomplishment of the expressive dance was the sudden reason for his offense from Satie: among the new companions Poulenc made was Louis Laloy, an author whom Satie respected with intractable ill will. Auric, who had quite recently delighted in a comparable triumph with a Diaghilev expressive dance, "Les FÃÂ¢cheux", was likewise disavowed by Satie for turning into a companion of Laloy.
