The situation of Chief of Staff for a general was normally held by a progressively junior officer, yet Garfield's impact with Rosecrans was more prominent than expected, with obligations stretching out past minor correspondence of requests to obligations that included genuine administration of his Army of the Cumberland. Rosecrans had an unquenchable hunger for discussion, particularly when he was unfit to rest; in Garfield, he found "the principal well perused individual in the Army" and the perfect contender for talks that ran profound into the night. The two turned out to be close disregarding Garfield's being twelve years junior to Rosecrans, and their discussions secured all themes, particularly religion; Rosecrans, who had changed over from Methodism to Roman Catholicism, prevailing with regards to relaxing Garfield's perspective on his confidence. Garfield prescribed that Rosecrans supplant wing administrators Alexander McCook and Thomas Crittenden, whom he accepted inadequate, yet Rosecrans overlooked the recommendations. With Rosecrans, Garfield formulated the Tullahoma Campaign to seek after and trap Confederate General Braxton Bragg in Tullahoma. After beginning Union achievement, Bragg withdrew toward Chattanooga, where Rosecrans slowed down and mentioned more troops and supplies. Garfield contended for a prompt development, in accordance with requests from Halleck and Lincoln. After a gathering of war and extensive thoughts, Rosecrans consented to assault.
