The likelihood of Japan exploiting a war in Europe was anticipated. In June 1939, the Tientsin Incident showed another plausibility: that Germany may endeavor to exploit a war in the Far East. In case of a most dire outcome imaginable of concurrent war with Germany, Italy and Japan, two methodologies were considered. The first was to lessen the war to one against Germany and Japan just by thumping Italy out of the contention as fast as could be allowed. The previous First Sea Lord, Sir Reginald Drax, who was brought out of retirement to exhort on system, required a "flying squadron" of four or five war vessels, alongside a plane carrying warship, a few cruisers and destroyers, to be sent to Singapore. Such a power would be too little to even think about fighting the Japanese principle armada, however could secure British exchange the Indian Ocean against trade marauders. Drax contended that a little, quick power would be preferred in this job over a substantial, moderate one. At the point when more ships wound up accessible, it could turn into the core of a full-sized fight armada. Chatfield, presently Minister for Coordination of Defense, couldn't help contradicting this idea. He felt that the flying squadron would turn out to be simply an objective for the Japanese armada. Rather, he set forward a second methodology, specifically that the Mediterranean be deserted and the armada sent to Singapore.
