For a later audit of Saurischia, Huene in 1932 reassigned the species "Ornithopsis" "greppini", which he had named in 1922, to the variety "Cetiosauriscus". The known material, found in Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) stores in the Reuchenette Formation of Switzerland, incorporates dorsal and caudal vertebrae, forelimb bones and a hindlimb and incomplete pes, from no less than two people. The long humerus was fabricated like "Cetiosauriscus leedsii", and the two species were initially recognized from "Cetiosaurus" by having shorter dorsal vertebrae, a shorter forelimb, and a more drawn out lower leg. "Cetiosauriscus greppini" contrasts from "Cetiosauriscus leedsii" by having caudal transverse procedures that are antero-posteriorly level and have an unmistakable wing-like upward development. It additionally contrasts in having back lamina anticipating downwards from the foremost caudal transverse procedures, a coracoid with an adjusted blueprint and with an indent underneath the glenoid joint, astoundingly straight shafts of humerus and femur, a distal end of the humerus with an internal condyle higher than the external condyle, an all the more proximally put fourth trochanter, and a more drawn out and straighter ischium. These characters recommended that both taxa contrast on the nonexclusive dimension, a position upheld by Upchurch and John Martin in 2003, David Weishampel and partners in 2004, and John Whitlock in 2011, who considered "C. greppini" to be Eusauropoda "incertae sedis". The likenesses like the life structures of the caudal vertebrae were recommended by Christian Meyer and Basil ThÃÂ¼ring in 2003 to rather bolster the two species being isolated, however in similar class.
