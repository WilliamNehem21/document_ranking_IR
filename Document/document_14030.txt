William Etty was conceived in 1787, the child of a York bread cook and mill operator. He started as an understudy printer in Hull. On finishing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at 18 years old to London "with a couple of bits of chalk colored pencils", with the goal of turning into a history painter in the convention of the Old Masters. He enlisted at the Royal Academy, and following a year spent examining under prestigious picture painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty came back to the Royal Academy, drawing at the existence class and duplicating different works of art. A supporter of John Opie, who advanced the unfashionable painting style of Titian and Rubens over the then-predominant formal style of Joshua Reynolds, Etty was fruitless in all the Academy's rivalries and each work he submitted to the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition during the 1810s was rejected. In 1821 the Royal Academy acknowledged and showed one of Etty's works in the Summer Exhibition, "The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia" (otherwise called "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). This composition was very generally welcomed, and a considerable lot of Etty's kindred specialists extraordinarily respected him. He turned out to be all around regarded for his capacity to catch substance tones precisely in painting, and for his interest with complexities in skin tones. Following the presentation of "Cleopatra", throughout the following decade Etty attempted to repeat its prosperity by painting naked figures in scriptural, scholarly and legendary settings.
