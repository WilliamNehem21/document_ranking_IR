At the point when displayed in 1821, "Cleopatra" was commonly very generally welcomed, and considered among the best sketches of its sort, and its prosperity enlivened Etty to paint more works in a comparable vein. The presentation of "Cleopatra", combined with the display in January 1822 of "A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)" which likewise portrayed bare figures on a watercraft, drew analysis of Etty for his treatment of female nudes. "The Times" in mid 1822 scolded Etty, commenting that "We accept this open door of exhorting Mr. Etty, who got some notoriety for painting "Cleopatra's Galley", not to be lured into a style which can delight just the most horrible taste. Exposed figures, when painted with the virtue of Raphael, might be suffered: however exposure without immaculateness is hostile and profane, and on Mr.ÃÂ Etty's is unimportant messy tissue." Unlike naked examinations by different craftsmen of the period, Etty made no endeavor to admire the female nudes in "Cleopatra", yet rather painted them in practical stances and reasonable substance tones. Potentially frightened by the analysis, Freeling convinced Etty to paint garments onto a portion of the figures in "Cleopatra", in spite of the fact that in 1829 he permitted Etty to restore the figures to the state in which he had initially painted them.
