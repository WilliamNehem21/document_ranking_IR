"Banksia attenuata" was first gathered by Robert Brown from King George Sound in December 1801, and distributed by him in 1810. The particular appellation is the Latin descriptive word "attenuatus" "limited", and alludes to the leaves narrowing towards the base. The species has had a genuinely uneventful ordered history. It has just two equivalent words, and no subspecies or assortments have been distributed; Australian botanist Alex George explored the variety in structure in the species, and felt that the tree and bush structures contrasted just in size and subsequently were not sufficiently unmistakable to speak to isolate taxa. In 1840, John Lindley distributed a putative new animal groups, "Banksia cylindrostachya", in his "A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony"; this has now be appeared to be an ordered equivalent word of "B.ÃÂ attenuata". In 1891, Otto Kuntze made a fizzled endeavor to exchange "Banksia" to the new conventional name "Sirmuellera". In the process he distributed the name "Sirmuellera attenuata", which is currently considered a nomenclatural equivalent word of "B.ÃÂ attenuata". Normal names incorporate slim banksia, flame banksia and candle banksia. "Piara" (on the other hand spelled "biara") is a native name from the Melville area of Perth.
