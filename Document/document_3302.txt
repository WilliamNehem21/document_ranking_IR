The primary tempest of the period was Tropical Storm Tapah, which shaped on JanuaryÃÂ 9 close Palau. It created from the rainstorm trough and was first seen by the JTWC two days before its arrangement. The framework at first comprised of a region of convection with a feeble dissemination, situated in a region of frail breeze shear. On JanuaryÃÂ 10, the JMA arranged the framework as a tropical gloom, that day that the JTWC started warnings on Tropical Depression 01W and PAGASA characterized it as "Agaton". The tempest moved west-northwestward because of an edge toward the north, and the framework step by step turned out to be better composed. On JanuaryÃÂ 12, the JMA updated the gloom to Tropical Storm Tapah, and soon thereafter assessed pinnacle winds of 75ÃÂ km/h (45ÃÂ mph). Around that time, Tapah built up an eye highlight underneath its convection, provoking both the JTWC and PAGASA to appraise crest winds of 95ÃÂ km/h (60ÃÂ mph). A moving toward trough debilitated the edge, which turned the tempest toward the northwest. Because of expanding wind shear, convection bit by bit debilitated, and the JMA minimized Tapah to a tropical sadness on JanuaryÃÂ 13; in any case, different offices kept up the framework as a hurricane. The following day, Tapah disseminated along the eastern shore of Luzon in the Philippines.
