On 3 June 1993, CPP pioneers Chea Sim and Hun Sen met with Sihanouk and influenced him to head a break government with the CPP and FUNCINPEC as joint alliance accomplices. That night, Sihanouk declared the arrangement of the break government over national radio. Ranariddh, who had not been counseled, communicated shock. In the meantime, the United States and China pronounced their restriction to the arrangement, provoking Sihanouk to cancel his declaration the next day. On 10 June 1993, CPP pioneers driven by General Sin Song and Chakrapong took steps to withdraw eight eastern territories from Cambodia. Ranariddh dreaded a common war with the CPP, which had an a lot bigger armed force than the ANS. As needs be, he acknowledged the possibility of FUNCINPEC working with the CPP, and the two gatherings consented to a double PM game plan in the new government. On 14 June, Ranariddh directed a parliamentary gathering which made Sihanouk the Head of State, with Hun Sen and Ranariddh filling in as co-Prime Ministers in a break government. Another constitution was drafted throughout the following three months, and was received toward the beginning of September. On 24 September 1993, Sihanouk surrendered as the head of state and was restored as King of Cambodia. In the new government, Ranariddh and Hun Sen were designated as the First Prime Minister and Second Prime Minister, individually.
