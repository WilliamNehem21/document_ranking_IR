Bits of gossip about Anastasia's survival were adorned with different contemporary reports of trains and houses being hunt down "Anastasia Romanov" by Bolshevik troopers and mystery police. When she was quickly detained at Perm in 1918, Princess Helena Petrovna, the spouse of Anastasia's inaccessible cousin, Prince John Constantinovich of Russia, announced that a watchman brought a young lady who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her phone and inquired as to whether the young lady was the little girl of the Tsar. Helena Petrovna said she didn't perceive the young lady and the gatekeeper removed her. Albeit different observers in Perm later detailed that they saw Anastasia, her mom and sisters in Perm after the killings, this story is presently broadly disparaged. Bits of gossip that they were alive were powered by conscious deception intended to shroud the way that the family was dead. A couple of days after they had been killed, the German government sent a few wires to Russia requesting "the wellbeing of the princesses of German blood". Russia had as of late marked a harmony settlement with the Germans, and did not have any desire to annoy them by telling them the ladies were dead, so they disclosed to them they had been moved to a more secure area.
