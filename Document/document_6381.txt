Of Grainger the piano player, "The New York Times" faultfinder Harold C. Schonberg composed that his novel style was communicated with "astonishing expertise, identity and force". The early eagerness which had welcomed his show appearances ended up quieted in later years, and surveys of his exhibitions amid the last ten years of his life were frequently cruel. Notwithstanding, Britten respected Grainger's late chronicle of the Grieg concerto, from a live act at Aarhus in 1957, as "one of the noblest at any point resolved to record" Ã¢ÂÂ regardless of the concealment of the circle for a long time, in light of the expansion of wrong notes and different issues. Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, alluding to Grainger's initial showcases of masterful abilities, has guessed that had John Grainger's impact not been expelled, "Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be recognized as one of Australia's driving painters and fashioners, who coincidentally had an inert ability as a piano player and arranger". The ethnomusicologist John Blacking, while at the same time recognizing Grainger's commitment to social and social parts of music, by and by composes that if the mainland establishment of Grainger's melodic instruction had not been "undermined by dilettantism and the tragic impact of his mom, I am certain that his definitive commitment to the universe of music would have been a lot more prominent".
