The Dan (æ¦) refers to any female role in Beijing opera. Dan roles were originally divided into five subtypes. Old women were played by "laodan", martial women were "wudan", young female warriors were "daomadan", virtuous and elite women were "qingyi", and vivacious and unmarried women were "huadan". One of Mei Lanfang's most important contributions to Beijing opera was in pioneering a sixth type of role, the "huashan". This role type combines the status of the "qingyi" with the sensuality of the "huadan". A troupe will have a young Dan to play main roles, as well as an older Dan for secondary parts. Four examples of famous Dans are Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Shang Xiaoyun, and Xun Huisheng. In the early years of Beijing opera, all Dan roles were played by men. Wei Changsheng, a male Dan performer in the Qing court, developed the "cai ciao", or "false foot" technique, to simulate the bound feet of women and the characteristic gait that resulted from the practice. The ban on female performers also led to a controversial form of brothel, known as the "xianggong tangzi", in which men paid to have sex with young boys dressed as females. Ironically, the performing skills taught to the youths employed in these brothels led many of them to become professional Dan later in life.
