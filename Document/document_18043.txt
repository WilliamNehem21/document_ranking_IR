"Slava" was held back during the initial stages of the German landings (Operation Albion) on Saaremaa (Oesel) Island guarding the mouth of the Gulf of Riga in October 1917 to defend Kassar Wiek (Inlet), which separates the outer islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa (DagÃ¶). She intermittently fired at German torpedo boats as they fought Russian light forces in Kassar Wiek on 15 and 16 October, but scored no hits from her position near Kesselaid (Schildau) Island in Moon Sound Strait. On the morning of 17 October the Germans attempted to sweep the Russian mines placed at the southern entrance to Moon Sound Strait.

"Grazhdanin", whose turrets had not been modified for extra elevation, remained behind with "Bayan" and continued to engage the minesweepers. The German ships returned fire, but their shells fell short at a range of . "Slava" continued to fire on the Germans, but scored no hits, although some shells impacted only from "KÃ¶nig". The German ships were at a severe disadvantage as they were sailing in a narrow swept channel and could not maneuver, so they reversed course to get out of range.
