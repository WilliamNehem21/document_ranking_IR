Astraeus hygrometricus, usually known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the indicator earthstar, or the bogus earthstar, is a types of organism in the family Diplocystaceae. Youthful examples look like a puffball when unopened. In development, the mushroom shows the trademark earthstar shape that is a consequence of the external layer of organic product body tissue part open in a star-like way. The bogus earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that develops in relationship with different trees, particularly in sandy soils. "A.ÃÂ hygrometricus" was recently thought to have a cosmopolitan dispersion, however it is currently thought to be limited to Southern Europe, and "Astraeus" are normal in mild and tropical locales. Its basic names allude to the way that it is hygroscopic (water-retaining), and can open up its beams to uncover the spore sac because of expanded mugginess, and close them up again in drier conditions. The beams have an unpredictably split surface, while the spore case is pale dark colored and smooth with a sporadic cut or tear at the top. The gleba is white at first, yet turns darker and fine when the spores develop. The spores are ruddy dark colored, generally round with moment moles, estimating 7.5Ã¢ÂÂ 11 micrometers in distance across.
