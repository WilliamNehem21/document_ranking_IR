In 2018, Padukone portrayed Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen who commits "jauhar" (self-immolation) to protect herself from the Muslim invader Alauddin Khilji, in the period drama "Padmaavat"; it marked her third collaboration with Bhansali and Singh. She was challenged by the need to convey her character's courage through silence and considered it to be the most emotionally exhausting role of her career. She read history books on the era and researched the various historical depictions of Padmavati. Right-wing Hindu groups speculated that the film portrayed a romantic liaison between Padmavati and Khilji; they protested violently and placed a bounty to behead Padukone and Bhansali. Following a deferment in release, the film was cleared for exhibition after several modifications were made to it. Anna M. M. Vetticad of "Firstpost" criticised the film's glorification of "jauhar", but credited Padukone for managing to "eke something out of the stereotype-ridden writing".
