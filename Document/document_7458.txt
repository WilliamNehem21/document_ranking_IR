Gerard likewise had an uneasy association with his house of prayer part, in the wake of endeavoring to change his basilica pastorate by constraining them to surrender their spouses and courtesans and become appointed ministers. He kept in touch with Anselm in 1103 grumbling of the uncompromising nature of his church and begrudging Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's section, which was made out of priests rather than the mainstream ordinances who made up York Minster's part. In this correspondence, Gerard griped that a portion of the York standards would not be appointed as ministers, along these lines planning to abstain from taking the promise of abstinence. He additionally blamed them for tolerating prebends yet declining to live or work at the house of prayer, and of concentrating on a limited lawful meaning of abstinence without really being chaste. The standards' contention was that they were just required not to keep up ladies in their own homes, however they were not illegal to visit or engage ladies in houses having a place with others. It was not just Gerard who grumbled about the connection among him and his groups; the last blamed Gerard for devastating York by making blessings of grounds to other people.
