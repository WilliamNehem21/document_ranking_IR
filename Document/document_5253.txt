On 9 May 1885, at 15 years old, Lloyd made her expert solo stage dÃÂ©but at the Grecian music corridor (in indistinguishable premises from the Eagle Tavern), under the name "Matilda Wood". She performed "In the Good Old Days" and "My Soldier Laddie", which demonstrated fruitful, and earned her a booking at the Sir John Falstaff music lobby in Old Street where she sang a progression of sentimental numbers. Not long after this, she picked the stage name Bella Delmere and showed up in front of an audience in ensembles structured by her mom. Her exhibitions were a triumph, in spite of her singing other craftsmen's tunes without their consent, a training which brought her a risk of a directive from one of the first entertainers. Updates on her demonstration voyaged; that October, she showed up at the Collins music corridor in Islington in an uncommon exhibition to praise the theater's renovation, the first occasion when she had showed up outside Hoxton, and after two months, she was locked in at the Hammersmith Temple of Varieties and the Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane. On 3 February 1886, she showed up at the lofty Sebright Music Hall in Bethnal Green, where she met George Ware, a productive writer of music corridor melodies. Product turned into her operator and, following half a month, she started performing tunes obtained from little-known arrangers. As her notoriety developed, Ware proposed that she change her name. "Marie" was picked for its "rich" and "marginally French" sound, and "Lloyd" was taken from a release of "Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper".
