By the end of April 1942, Waddy had scored four-and-a-half victories over enemy aircraft. Promoted flying officer, he achieved four "kills" in a single sortie on 12Â May 1942, destroying two Junkers JuÂ 52 cargo planes and two escorting BfÂ 110s from a German air transport convoy operating between Crete and North Africa. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for this action, gazetted on 2Â October. The citation praised his "masterly airmanship as a fighter pilot" and his "great courage and devotion to duty". Shortly after claiming a victory over a Messerschmitt BfÂ 109 on 22Â May, Waddy was posted to another RAF unit, No.Â 260 Squadron, flying Kittyhawks. He accounted for two enemy aircraft in June, before being assigned to No. 4 Squadron, South African Air Force, with which he destroyed a BfÂ 109 in September. In October, Waddy began flying SpitfireÂ Vs in No.Â 92 Squadron RAF. He claimed a further three victories with his latest unit before being posted back to Australia on 19Â November 1942. His final tally of fifteen-and-a-half victories made him one of the most successful Allied fighter pilots in the Desert War, and second only to Caldwell among the RAAF contingent.
