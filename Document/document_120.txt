In 2013, subsequent to defeating a respiratory infection from the get-go in the year, he ran two races on the east coast, completing third the multiple times, and after that was sent right on time to Santa Anita Park to get ready for that year's Breeders' Cup. He won a preliminary race, the Awesome Again Stakes, his seventh win in general and his first Grade I win. This certified him for the 2013 Breeders' Cup Classic, which he won, barely crushing Will Take Charge and Declaration of War. His prosperity earned him the Secretariat Vox Populi Award and the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year just as two Eclipse Award designations and 2013 Florida-reproduced Horse of the Year. Sportswriter Steve Haskin, who pursued the pony's vocation for "The Blood-Horse", expressed that the adventure "if enough elevating human intrigue stories to fill a book". Mucho Macho Man came back to the track in January 2014 with an unequivocal success in the Sunshine Millions Classic, however completed fourth in the Santa Anita Handicap. He stayed in preparing, still basically solid, yet following the disclosure of wounding on his fetlocks and different indications of "mileage", he was resigned in July 2014.
