A phylogenetic investigation of "Cetiosauriscus" was directed in 2003 by Julia Heathcote and Upchurch, in view of the two most comprehensive grids of the time, those of Jeffrey A. Wilson (2002) and Upchurch (1995), neither of which had incorporated the taxon before. Added to the examination of Upchurch, "Cetiosauriscus" set as the sister taxon of "Tehuelchesaurus", in a gathering including "Mamenchisaurus", "Omeisaurus" and "Euhelopus", and an arrangement inside a gathering of "Omeisaurus" and "Mamenchisaurus" was likewise found by utilizing the Wilson network. In light of these two outcomes, Heathcote and Upchurch closed "Cetiosauriscus" was not a diplodocid or even inside Diplodocoidea, rather being a progressively basal sauropod outside Neosauropoda. The phylogenetic examination of Rauhut "et al." (2005) settled "Cetiosauriscus" in a clade with "Omeisaurus", itself in a gathering with "Losillasaurus" and "Mamenchisaurus", outside of Neosauropoda. The phylogenetic connections of "Cetiosauriscus" were likewise tried in 2015 by Tschopp "et al.", as a potential diplodocid. Despite the fact that the family was observed to be inside Diplodocimorpha with one examination technique, it was likewise found outside Neosauropoda. In both, "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" was observed to be in a clade alone with "Barosaurus affinis", a questionable species known just from foot bones. Tschopp "et al." reasoned that "Cetiosauriscus" was not a diplodocid or a diplodocoid, as compelling it to be outside Neosauropoda was more stingy than constraining it to be inside Diplodocoidea in all examinations. As the paper was just to test connections inside Diplodocidae, increasingly strong ends in regards to the situation of "Cetiosauriscus" couldn't be made. The consequences of the favored cladogram of Tschopp "et al." is appeared as follows:
