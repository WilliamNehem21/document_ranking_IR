The majority of what is thought about their marriage originates from a record Mao provided for the American columnist Edgar Snow in 1936, which Snow incorporated into his book "Red Star Over China". As indicated by Mao, he and Luo Yixiu were the subject of a masterminded marriage sorted out by their particular dads, Mao Yichang and Luo Helou. Luo was eighteen and Mao only fourteen years of age at the season of their prearranged engagement. Despite the fact that Mao partook in the wedding service, he later expressed that he was discontent with the marriage, never fulfilling it and declining to live with his significant other. Socially disrespected, she lived with Mao's folks for a long time until she passed on of looseness of the bowels, while he moved out of the town to proceed with his investigations somewhere else, in the end turning into an establishing individual from the Communist Party of China. Different biographers have proposed that Mao's understanding of this marriage influenced his later perspectives, driving him to turn into a faultfinder of orchestrated marriage and a vocal women's activist. He would wed three additional occasions, to Yang Kaihui, He Zizhen and Jiang Qing, the remainder of whom was otherwise called Madame Mao.
