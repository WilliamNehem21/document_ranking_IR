"Miniopterus aelleni" is a small, brown "Miniopterus" species. The head may be slightly lighter in color than the body. Some hairs on the underparts have buff tips. "Miniopterus griveaudi" is similar in color, but "M.Â manavi" is darker and "M.Â brachytragos" and "M.Â mahafaliensis" are lighter. The tragus (a projection on the inner side of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In "M.Â manavi" and "M.Â griveaudi", in contrast, the base is narrower, in "M.Â mahafaliensis", the sides of the tragus are parallel, and "M.Â brachytragus" has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, "M.Â manavi", "M.Â mahafaliensis", and "M.Â brachytragos" have densely covered uropatagia and that of "M.Â griveaudi" is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.
