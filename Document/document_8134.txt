In 1823, Heliade met Maria Alexandrescu, with whom he fell enthusiastically infatuated, and whom he later wedded. By 1830, the Heliades' two kids, a child named Virgiliu and a little girl named Virgilia, kicked the bucket in early stages; in this way, their marriage entered an extensive stretch of emergency, set apart by Maria's incessant upheavals of envy. Particle Heliade most likely had various extramarital illicit relationships: a Wallachian Militia officer named Zalic, who ended up known amid the 1840s, is thought by a few, including the artistic pundit George CÃÂlinescu, to have been the essayist's ill-conceived child. Prior to the demise of her first kid, Maria Heliade invited into her home Grigore Alexandrescu, himself a commended author, whom Ion suspected had turned into her darling. Thusly, the two creators turned out to be harsh adversaries: Ion Heliade alluded to Alexandrescu as "that thankless rapscallion", and, in a 1838 letter to George BariÃÂ£, made light of his verse and character (trusting that, in one of his tales, Alexandrescu had delineated himself as a songbird, he remarked that, in all actuality, he was "a sad rook wearing remote plumes"). In spite of these family unit clashes, Maria Heliade brought forth five other kids, four little girls and one child (Ion, brought into the world 1846).
