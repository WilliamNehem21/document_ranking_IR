The military's inward examination was finished up in June. In spite of the fact that Bargewell found no proof of a concealment, his report truly condemned the Marine Corps for what he depicted as "heedlessness and carelessness" just as "a reluctance, verging on forswearing" by officers, particularly senior officers, to research non military personnel passings. MEF authority General Stephen Johnson later said that non military personnel passings happened "constantly", and did not locate the high number of passings to be especially surprising. He alluded to the passings as "the expense of working together on that specific commitment." On 21 December 2006, the US military charged eight Marines regarding the Haditha occurrence. Four of the eight, including Wuterich, were blamed for unpremeditated homicide. On 3 October 2007, the primer hearing exploring officer suggested that charges of homicide be dropped and that Wuterich be striven for careless manslaughter. Six litigants in this manner had their cases dropped and one was found not blameworthy. In 2012, Wuterich confessed to careless desolation of obligation in return for every single other charge against him being dropped. Somewhere around three officers, including force leader Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Chessani, were authoritatively upbraided for neglecting to appropriately report and research the killings.
