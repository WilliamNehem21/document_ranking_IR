There the officers, including Chief Coiner Franklin Peale, were generally the companions and relations of Director Patterson. The pariah in their middle was Chief Engraver James B. Longacre, successor to Gobrecht (who had kicked the bucket in 1844). A previous copper-plate etcher, Longacre had been selected through the political impact of South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun.

The vast majority of Peale's formal obligations were performed by his ancestor, Adam Eckfeldt, who kept on taking the necessary steps of boss coiner in spite of his retirement. Peale invested the subsequent free energy maintaining a private award business taking commissions from people in general and utilizing the administration's offices, including its Contamin representation machine.

Insofar as no new coin plans were required, bites the dust could be replicated precisely, without utilizing the Contamin gadget. In spite of the fact that it had a place with his area of expertise, Longacre did not utilize the Contamin machine much until Congress requested that the two new coins be struck.
