For a considerable length of time after its revelation, no skeletal survives from a Steller's ocean dairy animals were found. This may have been because of rising and falling ocean levels through the span of the Quaternary time frame, which could have left numerous ocean cow bones covered up. The main bones of a Steller's ocean dairy animals were uncovered in around 1840, more than 70 years after it was assumed wiped out. The primary incomplete ocean dairy animals skull was found in 1844 by Ilya Voznesensky while on the Commander Islands, and the principal skeleton was found in 1855 on northern Bering Island. These examples were sent to Saint Petersburg in 1857, and another about total skeleton landed in Moscow around 1860. As of not long ago, all the full skeletons were found amid the nineteenth century, being the most gainful period regarding uncovered skeletal stays, from 1878 to 1883. Amid this time, 12 of the 22 skeletons having known dates of accumulation were found. A few creators did not trust conceivable the recuperation of further critical skeletal material from the Commander Islands after this period, however a skeleton was found in 1983, and two zoologists gathered around 90 bones in 1991. Just two to four skeletons of the ocean cow showed in various exhibition halls of the world start from a solitary person. It is realized that Adolf Erik NordenskiÃÂ¶ld, Benedykt Dybowski, and Leonhard Hess Stejneger uncovered numerous skeletal stays from various people in the late 1800s, from which composite skeletons were collected. Starting at 2006, 27 almost total skeletons and 62 complete skulls have been found, yet the vast majority of them are arrays of bones from two to 16 unique people.
