The inside of the congregation, which is basically as revamped in 1900-1902, faces east and has a raised chancel and asylum (the last set inside an apse with gold mosaic semi-vault) with marble and mosaic ground surface, flanked by the organ and choir. The chancel is isolated from the fundamental body of the congregation by a fashioned iron and metal screen with marble base on which stand the cedar platform and metal podium. The western display, marble remembrances and cedar framing are portions of the nineteenth century inside held in the later work. The seats are open cedar seats and the deck is of cleaned timber obstructs with white marble paths with a dark key outskirt. The recolored glass windows are fundamentally English and of twentieth century date with some 1890s hued and painted glass, including inner entryways and fanlights. The squeezed metal roof (introduced in 1894-1895) has been adjusted to improve ventilation and to oblige current pendant lights. The text style is on a brought marble stage up in the baptistery at the base of the pinnacle. The tokens of St James the Great are consolidated in different brightening components of the inside including recolored and painted glass, seat closures and mosaic ground surface. The dividers of the Chapel of the Holy Spirit (the southern colonnade), introduced in 1988, are a noteworthy contemporary glasswork which the house of prayer's furnishings and fittings were uncommonly intended to supplement.
