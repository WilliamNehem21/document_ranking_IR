In June 1796, FÃÂ¼rstenberg told a division of four infantry brigades, 13 mounted guns pieces, and the "Freikorps" (Volunteers) "Gyulay" and verified the Rhine passage among Kehl and Rastatt. On 26 June 1796, the French troops of the Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle crossed the Rhine and pursued the Swabian Circle's military unexpected out of Kehl. In June 1796, Archduke Charles added the unforeseen to FÃÂ¼rstenberg's order, making him the Swabian's "Feldzeugmeister", or General of Infantry. FÃÂ¼rstenberg's troops guarded the royal line at the town of Rastatt until help troops arrived, and they could make an organized withdrawal into the Upper Danube Valley. The Swabian unforeseen was grounded in July, and FÃÂ¼rstenberg came back to the direction of Austrian regulars amid the Austrian counter-hostile. At the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October 1796, his initiative was again instrumental in an Austrian triumph. General Jean Victor Marie Moreau's Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle looked to hold a decent footing on the eastern side of the Rhine, following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest. FÃÂ¼rstenberg held Kenzingen, north of Riegel on the Elz River. Karl Aloys zu FÃÂ¼rstenberg was requested to bluff against Riegel, to secure the essential Austrian positions at Rust and Kappel.
