On 8ÃÂ March 1944, Jeffrey desperately dispatched two of his squadrons to the region of Perth, Western Australia, in light of worries that a Japanese maritime power would strike the territory, yet it ended up being a failed foray; no assault resulted, and the squadrons were coordinated to profit to Darwin for 20ÃÂ March. He drove the wing in its first hostile strafing task on 18ÃÂ April, assaulting Japanese positions in the Babar Islands. The following month, he sent his home office and two squadrons to Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia to secure offices that had been set up to refuel the British Eastern Fleet preceding Operation Transom. On 5ÃÂ September 1944, Jeffrey drove No.ÃÂ 1 Wing to the Tanimbar Islands and strafed focuses in Selaru. Later he talked about the mission with Caldwell, who was then ordering No.ÃÂ 80 (Fighter) Wing and had followed along to decide whether such long-go tasks may be beneficial for his squadrons. Jeffrey proclaimed that the excursion was a squandered exertion and he had just attempted it to avert, in Caldwell's words, "the assurance of his pilots going totally down the channel". The next month, Jeffrey was prescribed to be referenced in despatches for "courageous and recognized administration" in North-Western Area; the honor was gazetted on 9ÃÂ March 1945. Withdrawing No.ÃÂ 1 Wing, in November he came back to the direction of No.ÃÂ 2 OTU, in which job he saw out the remainder of the war.
