The raid was commemorated in Norway after the war. A monument to the aircrew killed in the battle was dedicated in the town of FÃ¸rde on 8Â May 1985, the 40th anniversary of Norway's liberation. This monument was later moved to Bergen Airport. The Air Combat Museum in the town of Naustdal also houses photos, maps, aircraft parts and other artifacts relating to the battle.
Two of the Focke-Wulf FwÂ 190 fighters of JG 5 that flew against the RAF Beaufighters and Mustangs survive to this day â one, an F-model airframe with factory serial number, or "Werknummer" of 931Â 862, that crashed as a result of the "Black Friday" aerial engagements was found and recovered as a salvageable aircraft wreck in September 1983. It currently resides in Stow, Massachusetts, and had been under restoration by the "White 1 Foundation" of Kissimmee, Florida towards a resumption of full flightworthy status, until its 2012 transfer to the Collings Foundation's facilities in the Bay State to complete the work towards full flightworthy status. While still in Florida, in 2005 its last pilot, the former "Luftwaffe" "Unteroffizier" Heinz Orlowski visited it and sat one final time in the cockpit of his "under-restoration" FwÂ 190F-8, some sixty years after he last flew it and five years before his death in 2010. The other example, an FwÂ 190A-8 bearing the "Werknummer" 732Â 183 was flown by Luftwaffe 70-victory ace Rudi Linz in the engagement. His FwÂ 190A-8 is displayed in the Cottbus Hangar of the Military Aviation Museum in Pungo, Virginia, United States as of 2014.
