For fifteen-thousand years or more before the landing of Europeans in the Americas, traveler pigeons and Native Americans existed together in the timberlands of what might later turn into the eastern piece of the mainland United States. An examination distributed in 2008 found that, all through a large portion of the Holocene, Native American land-use rehearses enormously impacted woodland creation. The customary utilization of recommended fire, the supporting of undesirable trees, and the planting and tending of favored trees stifled the populaces of various tree species that did not create nuts, oak seeds, or organic product, while expanding the populaces of various tree species that did. Furthermore, the consuming with extreme heat of timberland floor litter made these nourishments simpler to discover, when they had tumbled from the trees. Some have contended that such Native American land-use rehearses expanded the populaces of different creature species, including the traveler pigeon, by expanding the nourishment accessible to them, while somewhere else it has been asserted that, by chasing traveler pigeons and rivaling them for certain sorts of nuts and oak seeds, Native Americans stifled their populace estimate. Hereditary research may reveal some insight into this inquiry. A 2017 investigation of traveler pigeon DNA found that the traveler pigeon populace measure had been steady for a long time before its nineteenth century decrease and resulting termination, while a 2016 investigation of old Native-American DNA found that the Native-American populace experienced a time of fast development, expanding 60-crease, beginning around 13-16 thousand years prior. In the event that both of these investigations are right, at that point an incredible change in the span of the Native-American populace had no obvious effect on the measure of the traveler pigeon populace. This recommends the net impact of Native-American exercises on traveler pigeon populace measure was nonpartisan.
