Lila Villanueva, otherwise called the Bearded Lady of Brussels, is the admirer of Lodz and the dressmaker of the festival. Lila's unique life story states she was naturally introduced to the Villanueva bazaar family in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana in 1890. The family ventured to every part of the global circuit as the "Flying Villalobos" until disaster struck. One of Lila's two more established siblings kicked the bucket in Copenhagen in 1905, and her dad ended it all in 1908. At age sixteen, Lila as of now wore a whiskers and wedded out of the blue. The marriage did not keep going long, and Lila would wed more than nineteen additional occasions throughout her life. Lodz would be her solitary intimate romance. Lila's circular segment of the principal season is restricted to being with Lodz until she sees his developing contact with Management. His abrupt vanishing toward the start of season 2 anyway makes her suspicious. Samson's consequent shifty conduct proposes outside powers, yet Lila gets herself unfit to acquire evidence. Ruthie over and over methodologies Lila during the evening, apparently controlled by Lodz, and abandons her pieces of information. At the point when Lila at long last learns of the conditions encompassing Lodz's demise, she suborns the fair group to a rebellion that nearly keeps the troupe from meeting with Brother Justin in California.
