Weaver's work for the gathering drove numerous to help his designation to speak to Iowa's sixth congressional locale in the government House of Representatives in 1874. Many gathering insiders, be that as it may, were careful about Weaver's relationship with the Prohibition development and wanted to stay uncertain on the troublesome issue. At the tradition, Weaver drove on the principal ticket, at the end of the day lost the designation by one vote to EzekielÃÂ S. Sampson, a neighborhood judge. Weaver's partners ascribed his misfortune to "the meanest sort of wire pulling", yet Weaver disregarded the thrashing and pointed rather at the gubernatorial designation in 1875. He propelled an enthusiastic exertion, sought delegates around the state, and unequivocally supported Prohibition and more noteworthy state control of railroad rates. Weaver pulled in numerous representatives' help, yet estranged the individuals who were inviting to the railways and wished to maintain a strategic distance from the alcohol issue. Restriction was dispersed among a few lesser-known applicants, for the most part individuals from Senator WilliamÃÂ B. Allison's preservationist wing of the gathering. They joined at the tradition when a representative suddenly designated previous senator Kirkwood. The assignment conveyed effectively and, after Allison's partners induced him to acknowledge it, Kirkwood was named, and proceeded to win the race. In a further thrashing, the representatives would not support Prohibition in the gathering stage. Weaver had little relief in a selection to the state Senate, yet he lost to his Democratic adversary in the race that fall.
