"Tiger" stayed in administration with the Royal Navy after the Armistice with Germany and she had a taking off stage included 'B' turret's rooftop in 1919. The ship slammed into the warship in late 1920 while allocated to the Atlantic Fleet. "Tiger" endure the winnowing of more established capital boats following the Washington Naval Treaty, in spite of the fact that she was put in on 22 August 1921. The ship was refitted in March 1922 with a rangefinder fitted on 'X' turret, her unique pair of 3-inch AA weapons supplanted by four firearms, and the taking off stage on 'Q' turret was evacuated. On 14 February 1924, "Tiger" was recommissioned and turned into a seagoing preparing ship, a job she served in all through the 1920s. Her last real time of movement came in 1929, when went into dockyard hands for refit. While "Hood" was out for the count, "Tiger" came back to dynamic administration to keep the Royal Navy's three-dispatch Battlecruiser Squadron (ordinarily made up of "Hood" in addition to the littler and ) up to quality. Despite the fact that by the 1930s "Tiger" was still in sensible condition, the choice was taken to dispose of her following the London Naval Conference of 1930 as a major aspect of a general decrease in world war vessel armadas. Under the order of Captain Kenneth Dewar from 1928 to 1929, her last administrator was Arthur Bedford, and she stayed in administration with the armada until "Hood" left refit in mid 1931, at which time she was removed from commission as per the terms of the London Naval Treaty.
