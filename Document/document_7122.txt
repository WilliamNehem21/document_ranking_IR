It later gone by a beneficiary of Cranmer, to Sir John Molyneux, Baronet, who sold it to the Marquis of Dorchester, and in 1792 was claimed by the delegate of the Duke of Kingston. A record stone to one of his relatives in Whatton Church, close Aslockton is engraved as pursues: "Hic jacet Thomas Cranmer, Armiger, qui obiit vicesimo septimo pass on mensis Maii, anno d(omi)ni. MD centesimo primo, cui(us) a(n)i(ma)e p(ro)p(i)cietur Deus Amen" ("here untruths Thomas Cranmer, Esquire, who kicked the bucket on the 27th day of May in the time of our ruler 1601, on whose spirit may God view with benevolence"). The arms on it are: "A chevron between three cranes" (Cranmer) and "Argent, five fusils in fesse gules each accused of an escallop or" (Aslacton). The figure is that of a man in streaming hair and outfit, and a satchel at his correct side. Their most established child, John Cranmer, acquired the family bequest, though Thomas and his more youthful sibling Edmund were put on the way to an administrative vocation.
