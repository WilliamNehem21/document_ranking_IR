Sooner or later while the mission was in transit to the Moon, the 400 spreads were moved into the lunar lander "Bird of prey"; in his declaration, Scott concurred this abused the guidelines. He expressed he didn't review how the exchange occurred, and that he was just sure that the envelopes went to the lunar surface since they were clinched of things removed from the "Hawk" in anticipation of the arrival to Earth. Worden expressed in his declaration that they knew about the nearness of the spreads in the Command Module after the mission's dispatch, yet he didn't review if the spreads had been among the numerous things moved into the "Bird of prey" in anticipation of the lunar landing; he didn't trust the make a difference had been examined amid the flight. He wrote in his life account that the night he had consented to the arrangement with Eiermann "was the last I heard or considered the spreads until after the flightÃÂ ... What courses of action Dave [Scott], Eiermann, and Sieger made to get the spreads onto the flight, I never knew until some other time. Dave later told a congressional board of trustees that he had put them in a pocket of his spacesuit, yet he never imparted that data to me". He showed that the spreads he had orchestrated to have ready, including those from Herrick, stayed in his PPK in the Command Module all through the flight. The declaration before Congress, from numerous people including Apollo 15 space travelers, was that conveying the spreads did not meddle with the mission at all.
