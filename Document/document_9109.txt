The show's eponymous signature tune is sung by Ward, joined by a ukulele. It is first heard in the pilot scene; in that adaptation Ward is joined by an acoustic guitar. For the form utilized in the arrangement, Ward sung in a higher register to coordinate with the higher scope of the ukulele. The finished rendition of the signature tune was initially expected to be an impermanent form. Ward stated, "I recorded the verses for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little horrendous receiver just with the goal that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the system. Afterward, we attempted re-recording it and I didn't care for itÃÂ ... I just enjoyed the temp one!" Because the arrangement's settled signature melody was initially recorded as a temp track, encompassing commotions can be heard all through. For example, the sound of Derek Drymon composing can be heard while Jake is strolling through the Ice Kingdom. As indicated by Ward, a significant part of the arrangement's music has comparative "murmur and coarseness" since one of the show's unique authors, Casey James Basichis, "lives in a privateer transport he's worked within a condo [and] you can hear wood planks squeak and heaps of other strange sounds". As the show advanced, Basichis' companion Tim Kiefer joined the show as an extra writer. The two presently cooperate on its music.
