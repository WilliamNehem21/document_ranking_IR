Stoddard needed to ensure that Jason seemed human dislike a beast. Stoddard's vision of Jason incorporates balding, skin rashes, and the conventional deformations in his face, yet he endeavored to make Jason's look in a way that would take into account a progressively human side to be seen. Stoddard took motivation from the third and fourth movies when planning Jason's hockey cover. The make-up craftsman figured out how to gain a unique set piece, which he examined and later etched. In spite of the fact that he had a model of one of the first veils, Stoddard did not have any desire to recreate it completely. As Stoddard clarifies, "In light of the fact that I would not like to take something that previously existed, there were things I thought were extraordinary, yet there were things I needed to change a bit. Make it custom, yet keep all the key plans. Particularly the markings on the brow and cheeks. Age them down a bit, split them up." In the end, Stoddard made six adaptations of the veil, each with shifting degrees of wear.
