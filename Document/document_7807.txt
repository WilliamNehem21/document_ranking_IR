The Chicago bunch was kept by Charles Otis Whitman, whose accumulation started with traveler pigeons purchased from Whittaker starting in 1896. He had an enthusiasm for considering pigeons, and kept his traveler pigeons with other pigeon species. Whitman carried his pigeons with him from Chicago to Massachusetts by railcar each late spring. By 1897, Whitman had purchased the majority of Whittaker's feathered creatures, and after achieving a limit of 19 people, he gave seven back to Whittaker in 1898. Around this time, a progression of photos were taken of these feathered creatures; 24 of the photographs endure. A portion of these pictures have been replicated in different media, duplicates of which are currently kept at the Wisconsin Historical Society. It is vague precisely where, when, and by whom these photographs were taken, yet some seem to have been taken in Chicago in 1896, others in Massachusetts in 1898, the last by a J.ÃÂ G. Hubbard. By 1902, Whitman claimed sixteen winged animals. Numerous eggs were laid by his pigeons, yet few brought forth, and numerous hatchlings passed on. A paper request was distributed that mentioned "new blood" to the herd which had now stopped rearing. By 1907, he was down to two female traveler pigeons that kicked the bucket that winter, and was left with two fruitless male cross breeds, whose ensuing destiny is obscure. At this point, just four (all guys) of the fowls Whitman had come back to Whittaker were alive, and these kicked the bucket between November 1908 and February 1909.
