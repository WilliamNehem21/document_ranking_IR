Flowering has been recorded between January and October, with a peak in autumn and early winter (April to June). The inflorescences, or flower spikes, arise from the end of 1 to 5Â year old branchlets, and often have a whorl of branchlets arising from the node or base. Measuring high and wide, the yellow spikes often have blue-grey tinged limbs in bud, though occasionally pinkish, mauve or mauve-blue limbs are seen. Opening to a pale yellow after anthesis, the spikes lose their flowers with age and swell to up to high and wide, with up to 80 follicles. Covered with fine fur but becoming smooth with age, the oval-shaped follicles measure long by 0.2â0.7Â cm high (0.1â0.3Â in) and wide. The bare swollen spike, now known as an infructescence, is patterned with short spiky persistent bracts on its surface where follicles have not developed. Each follicle contains one or two obovate dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwiching a woody separator. Measuring long, they are made up of an oblong to semi-elliptic smooth or slightly ridged seed body, long by wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. Seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons long and wide, which sit on a stalk, or 1Â mm diameter finely hairy seedling stem, known as the hypocotyl, which is less than 1Â cm high. The first seedling leaves to emerge are paired (oppositely arranged) and lanceolate with fine-toothed margins, measuring 2.5â3Â cm long and 0.4â0.5Â cm wide. Subsequent leaves are more oblanceolate, elliptic (oval-shaped) or linear. Young plants develop a lignotuber in their first year.
