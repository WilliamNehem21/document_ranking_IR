Aubrey disposed of many employments when he moved corporate central command from New York City to Culver City to be nearer to generation offices, a move which was declared on April 29, 1970. Aubrey requested the clearance of MGM's memorable gathering of ensembles and props, for example, the Ruby Slippers worn by Judy Garland in "The Wizard of Oz", Vivien Leigh's dresses from "Run with the Wind" and the suit Spencer Tracy wore in "Acquire the Wind". (It was purchased by one of the resistance lawyers safeguarding Charles Manson, who routinely wore it to court.) The studio's camera office was unloaded. The greater part of the studio's Culver City backlot and its 2,000 section of land (8ÃÂ kmÃÂ²) farm in the Conejo Valley were sold to designers, moves officially arranged under Polk. Aubrey actually tossed the organization's important chronicles into the junk and conveyed creation to a stop. Writer and conductor AndrÃÂ© Previn, in his diary, "No Minor Chords. My Days in Hollywood", depicts how Aubrey had MGM's accumulation of film music compositions disposed of into the trash.[citation needed] Aubrey was reprimanded for these activities. In 1986, he reviewed, "the buck needed to stop some place, and it was with me. Wistfulness runs solid over here, so we were condemned for selling Judy Garland's red shoes. To us they had no esteem, and they had no inborn esteem."
