In the early 850s Ãthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome. According to Abels: "Ãthelwulf was at the height of his power and prestige. It was a propitious time for the West Saxon king to claim a place of honour among the kings and emperors of christendom." His eldest surviving sons Ãthelbald and Ãthelberht were then adults, while Ãthelred and Alfred were still young children. In 853 Ãthelwulf sent his younger sons to Rome, perhaps accompanying envoys in connection with his own forthcoming visit. Alfred, and possibly Ãthelred as well, were invested with the "belt of consulship". Ãthelred's part in the journey is only known from a contemporary record in the "liber vitae" of San Salvatore, Brescia, as later records such as the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" were only interested in recording the honour paid to Alfred. Abels sees the embassy as paving the way for Ãthelwulf's pilgrimage, and the presence of Alfred, his youngest and therefore most expendable son, as a gesture of goodwill to the papacy; confirmation by Pope Leo IV made Alfred his spiritual son, and thus created a spiritual link between the two "fathers". Kirby argues that the journey may indicate that Alfred was intended for the church, while Nelson on the contrary sees Ãthelwulf's purpose as affirming his younger sons' throneworthiness, thus protecting them against being tonsured by their elder brothers, which would have rendered them ineligible for kingship.
