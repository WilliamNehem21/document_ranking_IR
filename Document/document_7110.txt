The "Nativity's" dating has for quite some time been a wellspring of discussion among researchers. Estimations go from the mid-1440s to the mid-1450s; right off the bat in Christus' profession to about the time van der Weyden painted his c. 1455 "Special raised area of St John". For the most part the mid-1450s appears the most acknowledged. Ainsworth thinks about it, alongside Christus' "Heavenly Family" (as of now in Kansas City), a standout amongst the most critical ascribed to him and trusts it has a place in his later oeuvre, conceivably as late as the mid-1460s. Proof, for example, when Christus joined the Confraternity of the Dry Tree (c. mid 1460s) indicates it as a later work alongside the "Representation of a Young Girl". Its utilization of point of view and digestion of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's prior impacts likewise propose a later date. Besides, the milder facial sorts used in the "Nativity" are common of Christus' later work, and propose a date around the mid-1450s. Specialized investigation (dendrochronological proof) recommends a date of c. 1458, in light of the tree felling date. Christus painted two different variants of the Nativity: one in Bruges and the other in Berlin. The Bruges "Nativity" is dated 1452ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ whether the date was included by Christus or amid a rebuilding is unknownÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and specialized examination of the brushstrokes recommends it to be sooner than the Washington "Nativity".
