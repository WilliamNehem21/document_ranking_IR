At the point when the mysterious businessperson lost enthusiasm for the venture Palmer got him out, financed by the clearance of his half offer in Clark Publications, which had distributed "Different Worlds" and "Destiny". He established Palmer Publications and assumed control over the new magazines with "Universe's" third issue and "Science Stories"' second issue, and deserted the nom de plume. He propelled "Spiritualist Magazine", which, similar to "Destiny", distributed mysterious material, both truth and fiction. "Science Stories" neglected to sell well, and stopped to show up after the April 1954 issue, yet "Universe" kept, going every other month after the March 1954 issue. An aggregate of ten issues showed up under the title "Universe Science Fiction", and with the May 1955 issue the title "Different Worlds Science Fiction" returned. The new form of "Different Worlds" at first conveyed both "Universe's" numbering and the issue numbering from the first keep running of "Different Worlds". Palmer shut the workplaces in Evanston, Illinois, and altered the magazine from his home in Wisconsin; Mahaffey kept on chipping away at the magazine via mail from Cincinnati. From November 1955 the configuration changed to mash measure: this was against the overall market twists, as practically every one of the pulps had vanished at this point. In 1956 a startling assessment bill constrained Palmer to let Mahaffey go, and he ran the magazine without anyone else starting there on.
