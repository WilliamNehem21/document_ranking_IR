Other "retiarius" traps were to whip the net at his adversary's eyes to dazzle him and at his legs to trip him. The head protector of the "secutor" was smooth and round to abstain from catching the net. Much of the time, the "secutor" knew to anticipate the net-man's strategies and endeavored to capture and clutch the weapon, potentially unsteadying his adversary by yanking on the net. In such risk, the "retiarius" could separate the drawstring from his wrist with his knife. The "secutor" remained by a lost net and left minimal opportunity to recoup it.

The disparity may essentially be an instance of creative permit; different kinds of warrior are regularly appeared without their weapons however can be thought to hold them because of their position, and a net is an especially troublesome weapon to delineate. The absence of nets in "retiarius" pictures may demonstrate warriors who have effectively lost the weapon in the battle. Another probability is that some "retiarii" essentially did not utilize nets.
