The fundamental Soviet heavily clad arrangement engaged with the fight was the fifth Guards Tank Army, which controlled five corps, two of which were Guards units, by 12 July: the second Guards, second, fifth Guards Mechanized, eighteenth and 29th Tank Corps. Through and through they handled 793 tanks and 37 to 57 self-impelled weapons for an aggregate of around 840 shielded battling vehicles. Around 66% of these tanks were T-34s, while the rest of T-70 light tanks, with somewhere in the range of 31 to 35 Churchill substantial tanks also. Not the majority of the fifth Guards Tank Army was available in the Prokhorovka region amid the fight, as a component of the arrangement had been sent south to check the development of the III Panzer Corps. The Soviet reinforcement of the fifth Guards Tank Army Ã¢ÂÂ including the recently connected second Guards Tank Corps and second Tank Corps, just as the fifth Guards Mechanized Corps held available for later Ã¢ÂÂ that confronted the II SS-Panzer Corps on 12 July was around 616 tanks and self-pushed weapons. Likewise, five mounted guns regiments, one big guns detachment, and one enemy of flying machine cannons division were joined to the fifth Guards Tank Army for the attack.
