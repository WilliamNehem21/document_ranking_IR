"New York Dolls" nonetheless received widespread acclaim from contemporary reviewers. In a rave review for "NME", Nick Kent said the band's raunchy style of rock and roll was vividly recorded by Rundgren on an album that, besides Iggy and the Stooges' "Raw Power" (1973), served as the only one "so far to fully define just exactly where 1970s rock should be coming from". "Trouser Press" founder and editor Ira Robbins viewed "New York Dolls" as an innovative record, brilliantly chaotic, and well produced by Rundgren. Ellen Willis, writing for "The New Yorker", said it was by far the year's most compelling hard rock album and that at least half of its songs were immediate classics, particularly "Personality Crisis" and "Trash", which she called "transcendent". In "Newsday", Christgau hailed the New York Dolls as "the best hard rock band in the country and maybe the world right now", writing that their "special genius" was combining the shrewd songwriting savvy of early-1960s popular music with the anarchic sound of late-1960s heavy metal. He claimed the record's frenzied approach, various emotions, and wild noise conveyed Manhattan's harsh, deviant thrill better than the Velvet Underground. "Rolling Stone" critic Tony Glover believed the band's impressive live sound was mostly preserved on the album, but he was slightly critical of production flourishes and overdubs, feeling they made some lyrics incomprehensible and some choruses too sonorous. Although he was surprised Rundgren's production worked well with the group's raunchy sound on most of the songs, Glover ultimately asked whether or not "the record alone will impress as much as seeing them live (they're a highly "watchable" group)."
