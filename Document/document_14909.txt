After the fight, "St Vincent" and "Collingwood" joined "Vanguard" in the fourth BS. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to snare the High Seas Fleet while it progressed into the southern North Sea, yet a progression of correspondence disappointments and mix-ups kept Jellicoe from capturing the German armada before it came back to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-water crafts amid the activity, inciting Jellicoe to choose not to chance the real units of the armada to German submarines and mines south of 55ÃÂ° 30' North. The Admiralty agreed and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not foray except if the German armada was endeavoring an intrusion of Britain or there was a solid probability it could be constrained into a commitment under appropriate conditions. The Admiralty request implied that the Grand Fleet invested far less energy adrift. In late February 1917, the fourth BS led strategic activities for a couple of days. In January 1918, "Collingwood" and a portion of the more established battleships traveled off the bank of Norway for a few days, conceivably to give far off spread to an escort to Norway. Alongside the remainder of the Grand Fleet, she sortied on the evening of 23 April when radio transmissions uncovered that the High Seas Fleet was adrift, after a fizzled endeavor to capture the ordinary British caravan to Norway. The Germans were excessively a long ways in front of the British to be gotten and no shots were discharged. "St Vincent" was under fix at Invergordon, Scotland, and couldn't fight, yet was available at Rosyth when the German armada surrendered on 21 November; "Collingwood" was refitting in Invergordon.
