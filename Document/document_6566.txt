Notwithstanding her live exhibitions of "History repeating itself" in honors services and broadcast appears, the tune was incorporated on the set rundown for her visits The BeyoncÃÂ© Experience and I Am... World Tour. John Aizlewood of "Every day Mail" depicted the execution of the melody amid The BeyoncÃÂ© Experience as "head-turning". Amid BeyoncÃÂ©'s execution of "History repeating itself" at a show in Toronto on August 25, 2007, she had a closet breakdown as her dress flew over her head and was conjectured to uncover her bosom. In any case, a representative for the artist denied theories saying, "She's wearing a tissue tone bra! Do you truly think BeyoncÃÂ© would go in front of an audience like that?". The video which was transferred to YouTube became a web sensation. Ann Powers of "Los Angeles Times" examined about the breakdown, saying: "As a pop ruler, BeyoncÃÂ© is excessively immaculate... [a] 'closet glitch' in Toronto accumulated unmistakably more consideration than was justified incompletely on the grounds that these slip-ups repudiated her savagely athletic style." During the I Am... World Tour, BeyoncÃÂ© did not play out the entire melody; she sang a few of the opening lines of "History repeating itself" after her passageway in front of an audience. Amid the revue I Am... Yours which was a piece of the visit, BeyoncÃÂ© played out a jazz mixture of "History repeating itself", "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" and "Bootylicious" and proceeded with a full form of the main tune. Show exhibitions of "History repeating itself" were incorporated on her live collections "The BeyoncÃÂ© Experience Live" (2007), "" (2009) and "I Am... World Tour" (2010).
