In April 1941, Gibbes was posted to the Middle East as adjutant of No.Â 450 Squadron. The following month he transferred to No.Â 3 Squadron, which was flying Hawker Hurricanes. In June, after converting to P-40 Tomahawks, the squadron commenced operations in the SyriaâLebanon Campaign. Gibbes was credited with a probable victory over a Junkers JuÂ 88 near Bierut on 13Â June. On 11Â July he claimed his first "kill", a Dewoitine D.520 fighter of the Vichy French air force, over Aleppo. He shared in its destruction with John Jackson, after which the pair tossed a coin to take full credit for it, and Gibbes won. In September, No.Â 3 Squadron transferred to the Western Desert Campaign, where it saw action against German and Italian forces. On 20Â November, during Operation Crusader, Gibbes took part in the destruction of a Messerschmitt BfÂ 110 with three other pilots, crash landing back at base with damage to his own aircraft. He had a particularly successful day on 25Â November, when he shot down two Fiat G.50s and damaged three more, as well as a Messerschmitt BfÂ 109. Five days later he destroyed a G.50 over Tobruk. On 22Â January 1942, he brought down a Junkers JuÂ 87 and damaged two G.50s. He was promoted to acting flight lieutenant the same month.
