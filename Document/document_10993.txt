The design of the more brilliant stars of Tucana has been compared to a kite. Inside the heavenly body's limits are around 80 stars more brilliant than a clear greatness of 7. At an evident extent of 2.86, Alpha Tucanae is the most splendid star in the heavenly body and denotes the toucan's head. It is an orange subgiant of ghostly kind K3III around 199 light-years removed from the Solar System. A cool star with a surface temperature of 4300 K, it is multiple times as iridescent as the sun and multiple times its breadth. It is 2.5 to multiple times as gigantic. Alpha Tucanae is a spectroscopic parallel, which implies that the two stars have not been independently settled utilizing a telescope, however the nearness of the friend has been surmised from estimating changes in the range of the essential. The orbital time of the twofold framework is 4197.7ÃÂ days (11.5 years). Nothing is thought about the partner. Two degrees southeast of Alpha is the red-shaded Nu Tucanae, of ghastly sort M4III and lying around 290 light-years far off. It is delegated a semiregular variable star and its brilliance shifts from size +4.75 to +4.93. Portrayed by Richard Hinckley Allen as somewhat blue, Gamma Tucanae is a yellow-white arrangement star of phantom sort F4V and an obvious greatness of 4.00 situated around 75 light-years from Earth. It likewise denotes the toucan's snout.
