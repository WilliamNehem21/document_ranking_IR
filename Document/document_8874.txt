Key to this grouping is the Codex Amiatinus, a practically total Bible for which we have an exceptionally exact "end bet quem", and inside which, on account of its size, advancements in style can be found in a solitary original copy. The Codex Amiatinus can be definitely situated as leaving Wearmouth-Jarrow with a gathering driven by Abbot Ceolfrith on 4 June 716, headed for Rome. The codex was to be displayed to Pope Gregory II, a choice just declared by Ceolfrith in all respects right away before the flight, permitting the commitment page to be dated with certainty to around May 716, however the remainder of the original copy was presumably officially a few years of age, yet just started after Ceolfrith prevailing as abbot in 689. The content of the commitment page contrasts somewhat from that of the fundamental content, however is by a similar hand and in the equivalent "expounded content uncial" style as certain pages at Durham (MS An II 17, section ii, ff 103-11). Toward the finish of the succession, it might be conceivable to date the Saint Petersburg Bede to 746 at the most punctual, from references in "memoranda" in the content, despite the fact that this remaining parts a matter of debate.
