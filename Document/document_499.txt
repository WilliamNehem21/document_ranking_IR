The holotype skeleton comprises of the correct humerus (upper arm bone), the correct femur (thigh bone), the correct ilium (a hip bone), the privilege coracoid (a shoulder bone), the sacrum (melded vertebrae of the hip), the last seven thoracic (trunk) and two caudal (tail) vertebrae, and a few ribs. Riggs depicted the coracoid as from the left half of the body, however restudy has appeared at be a privilege coracoid. At the season of disclosure, the lower end of the humerus, the underside of the sacrum, the ilium and the saved caudal vertebrae were presented to the air and hence halfway harmed by enduring. The vertebrae were just marginally moved out of their unique anatomical position; they were found with their top sides coordinated descending. The ribs, humerus, and coracoid, in any case, were uprooted to one side of the vertebral segment, showing transportation by a water ebb and flow. This is additionally prove by a segregated ilium of "Diplodocus" that clearly had floated against the vertebral section, just as by an adjustment in structure of the encompassing rocks. While the example itself was implanted in fine-grained earth, demonstrating low-vitality conditions at the season of testimony, it was cut off at the seventh vertebra by a thick layer of a lot coarser residue comprising of stones at its base and sandstone further up, showing affidavit under more grounded flows. In view of this proof, Riggs in 1904 recommended that the missing front piece of the skeleton was washed away by a water ebb and flow, while the rear part was at that point secured by dregs and in this way got saved.
