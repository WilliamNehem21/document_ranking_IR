Before "Trial by Jury", W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan had collaborated on one previous opera, "Thespis; or, The Gods Grown Old", in 1871. Although reasonably successful, it was a Christmas entertainment, and such works were not expected to endure. Between "Thespis" and "Trial by Jury", Gilbert and Sullivan did not collaborate on any further operas, and each man separately produced works that further built his reputation in his own field. Gilbert wrote several short stories, edited the second volume of his comic "Bab Ballads", and created a dozen theatrical works, including "Happy Arcadia" in 1872; "The Wicked World", "The Happy Land" and "The Realm of Joy" in 1873; "Charity", "Topsyturveydom" and "Sweethearts" in 1874. At the same time, Sullivan wrote various pieces of religious music, including the "Festival Te Deum" (1872) and an oratorio, "The Light of the World" (1873), and edited "Church Hymns, with Tunes" (1874), which included 45 of his own hymns and arrangements. Two of his most famous hymn tunes from this period are settings of "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and "Nearer, my God, to Thee" (both in 1872). He also wrote a suite of incidental music to "The Merry Wives of Windsor" (1874) and many parlour ballads and other songs, including three in 1874â75 with words by Gilbert: "The Distant Shore", "Sweethearts" (inspired by Gilbert's play) and "The Love that Loves Me Not".
