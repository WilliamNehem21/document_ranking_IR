The sketches were frequently made on wood, yet now and again on the more affordable canvas. The wood was typically oak, frequently imported from the Baltic area, with the inclination for radially cut sheets which are more averse to twist. Regularly the sap was evacuated and the board all around prepared before use. Wood bolsters take into consideration dendrochronological dating, and the specific utilization of Baltic oak gives pieces of information with regards to the craftsman's area. The boards by and large show extremely high degrees of craftsmanship. Lorne Campbell takes note of that most are "perfectly made and completed articles. It tends to be very hard to discover the joins". Numerous works of art's casings were changed, repainted or overlaid in the eighteenth and mid nineteenth hundreds of years when it was normal practice to break separated pivoted Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as class pieces. Many enduring boards are painted on the two sides or with the switch bearing family tokens, peaks or auxiliary diagram portrays. On account of single boards, the markings on the turn around are regularly completely disconnected to the front-side and might be later augmentations, or as Campbell estimates, "accomplished for the craftsman's diversion". Painting each side of a board was viable since it kept the wood from distorting. Normally the casings of pivoted works were built before the individual boards were dealt with.
