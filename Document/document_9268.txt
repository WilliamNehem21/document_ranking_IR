The State Department made a group of ambassadors who might bolster PBSUCCESS. It was driven by John Peurifoy, who took over as Ambassador to Guatemala in October 1953. Another individual from the group was William D. Pawley, a well off businessperson and representative with broad learning of the flight business. Peurifoy was an activist enemy of socialist, and had demonstrated his readiness to work with the CIA amid his time as United States Ambassador to Greece. Under Peurifoy's residency, relations with the Guatemalan government soured further, in spite of the fact that those with the Guatemalan military improved. In a report to John Dulles, Peurifoy expressed that he was "unquestionably persuaded that in the event that [ÃÂ¡rbenz] is certifiably not a socialist, at that point he will absolutely do until one goes along". Inside the CIA, the activity was going by Deputy Director of Plans Frank Wisner. The field authority chosen by Wisner was previous U.S. Armed force Colonel Albert Haney, at that point head of the CIA station in South Korea. Haney detailed straightforwardly to Wisner, in this manner isolating PBSUCCESS from the CIA's Latin American division, a choice which made some strain inside the organization. Haney chose to set up home office in a disguised office complex in Opa-locka, Florida. Codenamed "Lincoln", it turned into the operational hub of activity PBSUCCESS.
