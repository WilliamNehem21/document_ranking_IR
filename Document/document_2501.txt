Meanwhile, conditions were breaking down on "KÃÂ¶nigsberg". There were deficiencies of coal, ammo, sustenance, and restorative supplies. Albeit safe from the British, the group was assaulted by jungle fever and other tropical afflictions. For the most part cut off from the outside world, the spirit of the mariners fell. Be that as it may, the circumstance was imperceptibly improved with a plan to resupply the ship and give her a battling opportunity to return home. A caught British vendor send, "Rubens", was renamed "Kronborg". It was given a Danish banner, papers, and a group of German mariners chose for their capacity to speak Danish. It was then stuffed with coal, field weapons, ammo, little arms, and different supplies. As the tanker moved toward East Africa, "KÃÂ¶nigsberg" arranged to foray to meet the ship and endeavor to break out and come back to Germany. Rather, "KÃÂ¶nigsberg" was caught in the stream by two cruisers and a few littler vessels. "Hyacinth" caught "Kronborg" as she drew closer, and pursued her to Manza Bay. The caught ship was constrained on solid land and set ablaze, however the Germans rescued a lot of her load and put it to utilize later in the East Africa Campaign.
