On September 1, the regiment, presently numbering 400, walked northwest from Centreville with the remainder of Ferrero's unit. In spite of the fact that the men did not know it, they were among the bunch of detachments picked by Pope to avoid Jackson's flanking development. Framing fight lines in a field not a long way from Chantilly Plantation, the 21st viewed the 51st New York advance into thick woods to test the adversary lines. Requests were before long given to Col. Clark to lead the 21st into the forested areas to help the 51st. The forested areas were thick and the development was muddled. Exacerbating the situation, an amazing tempest burst out as the 21st entered the forest. Unconsciously, the regiment obliqued far to one side and lost contact with the 51st New York. Experiencing an assemblage of troops in their front and unfit to distinguish them through the exuberant downpour, Col. Clark assumed he had discovered the 51st, requested the 21st to rest set up and sent officer Lt. Colonel Joseph Parker Rice forward to reach. The troops were, indeed, men of Jubal Early's unit and, before this could be learned, the Confederates released an overwhelming volley on the clueless 21st. "In the abrupt anguish and give up all hope existing apart from everything else," composed Capt. Walcott, "the entire regiment appeared to lie seeping on the ground." Col. Clark quickly requested a withdrawal and the 21st left in excess of 100 dead or injured in the forested areas.
