There were four windmill destinations on the dimensions. The Eastbridge Windpump was a frock factory worked in the mid-nineteenth century, most likely by the millwright Robert Martin of Beccles. It stood north of the New Cut. The plant worked a three toss siphon with square cylinders. The windpump was working until 1939 and fell in February 1977. The remaining parts were safeguarded by the Suffolk Mills Group in July 1977 and the factory was revamped at the Museum of East Anglian Life in Stowmarket in the mid 1980s. The Sea Wall Mill stood north of the New Cut however nearer to the coast than the Eastbridge Windpump. It was a coverall factory worked in the mid nineteenth century. The factory worked by wind until it was tailwinded in January 1935, breaking the windshaft and rendering the plant cruise less. The scoopwheel was accordingly worked by a Hupmobile petroleum motor, and later by a diesel motor. The plant crumbled in the mid year of 1976. A third coverall plant stood south of the New Cut and offshore of the remnants of the house of prayer. Worked by the millwright Collins of Melton, it was blown down during the 1920s and a Titt windpump was raised on the site to drive the scoopwheel. This windpump had sails breadth. Another Titt windpump, with sails measurement stood 1.6ÃÂ km (a mile) south of this. Both Titt windpumps were remaining in 1938.
