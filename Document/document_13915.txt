Tresham experienced a strangury brought about by an irritation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his wellbeing started to decrease. Lieutenant of the Tower William Waad, thinking about whether Tresham would live sufficiently long for equity to follow through to its logical end, portrayed his condition as "more terrible and more awful". Tresham favored the administrations of a Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower's ordinary specialist Matthew Gwinne; obviously Foster comprehended his case, demonstrating that it was not the primary event on which he had treated him. Amid his last days he was gone to by three additional specialists and an attendant, alongside William Vavasour, a supposed ill-conceived offspring of Thomas Tresham and potentially Francis' relative. As Tresham's significant other, Anne, was clearly excessively vexed, Vavasour composed Tresham's deathbed admission and furthermore a record of his last hours. Tresham apologized to the Jesuit cleric Henry Garnet for embroiling him in the Spanish Treason, and utilized the remainder of his deathbed admission to challenge his honesty. Anne and William read petitions at his bedside; he kicked the bucket at 2:00ÃÂ am on 23ÃÂ December. In spite of not being attempted, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy in plain view at Northampton, while his body was tossed into an opening at Tower Hill. His homes go to his sibling Lewis. Tresham's expression of remorse never achieved its expected target, and his letter, alongside the revelation of Garnet's "Of Equivocation", found among the "shocking, treasonable and abhorrent books" at Tresham's chamber in the Inner Temple, was utilized to extraordinary impact by Sir Edward Coke in Garnet's preliminary. The cleric was executed in May 1606.
