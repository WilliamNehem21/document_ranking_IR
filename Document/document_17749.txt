In the late 19th century, several Chancellors of the Exchequer had questioned the wisdom of having much of Britain's stock of gold used in coinage. Lord Randolph Churchill proposed relying less on gold coinage and moving to high-value silver coins, and the short-lived double florin or four-shilling piece is a legacy of his views. Churchill's successor, George Goschen, urged the issuance of banknotes to replace the gold coinage, and stated that he would prefer to have Â£20 million in gold in the Bank of England than 30 million sovereigns in the hands of the public. Fears that widespread forgery of banknotes would shake confidence in the pound put paid to his proposal. In March 1914, John Maynard Keynes noted that the large quantities of gold arriving from South Africa were making the sovereign even more important, "The combination of the demand for sovereigns in India and Egypt with London's situation as the distributing centre of the South African gold is rapidly establishing the sovereign as the predominant gold coin of the world. Possibly it may be destined to hold in the future the same kind of international position as was held for several centuries, in the days of a silver standard, by the Mexican dollar."
