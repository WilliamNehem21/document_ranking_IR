The bunching of the circles of TNOs with huge semi-real tomahawks was first portrayed by Trujillo and Sheppard, who noted similitudes between the circles of Sedna and . Without the nearness of Planet Nine, these circles ought to be circulated arbitrarily, without inclination for any bearing. Upon further examination, Trujillo and Sheppard saw that the contentions of perihelion of 12 TNOs with perihelia more noteworthy than and semi-significant tomahawks more noteworthy than were bunched almost zero degrees, implying that they ascend through the ecliptic when they are nearest to the sun. Trujillo and Sheppard suggested that this arrangement was brought about by an enormous obscure planet past Neptune by means of the Kozai instrument. For articles with comparative semi-real tomahawks the Kozai instrument would keep their contentions of perihelion to close to 0 or 180 degrees. This imprisonment permits objects with unusual and slanted circles to stay away from close ways to deal with the planet since they would cross the plane of the planet's circle at their nearest and most distant focuses from the Sun, and cross the planet's circle when they are well above or underneath its circle. Trujillo and Sheppard's theory about how the items would be adjusted by the Kozai system has been replaced by further investigation and proof.
