A bizarre component of the skull was the diverse molded teeth (heterodonty) for which the sort is named, which is generally fundamentally known from well evolved creatures. Most dinosaurs (and without a doubt most reptiles) have a solitary kind of tooth in their jaws, yet "Heterodontosaurus" had three. The curved tip of the nose was toothless, while the rear piece of the premaxilla in the upper jaw had three teeth on each side. The initial two upper teeth were little and cone-molded (equivalent to incisors), while the third on each side was highly extended, shaping unmistakable, canine-like tusks. These first teeth were presumably mostly encased by the upper nose. The initial two teeth in the lower jaw additionally shaped canines, yet were a lot greater than the upper reciprocals. The canines had fine serrations along the back edge, yet just the lower ones were serrated at the front. Eleven tall and etch like cheek-teeth lined each side of the back pieces of the upper jaw, which were isolated from the canines by an expansive diastema (hole). The cheek-teeth expanded step by step in size, with the center teeth being biggest, and diminished in size after this point. These teeth had a substantial layer of finish on the inwards side, and were adjusted for wear (hypsodonty), and they had long roots, immovably inserted in their attachments. The tusks in the lower jaw fit into a space inside the diastema of the upper jaw. The cheek-teeth in the lower jaw commonly coordinated those in the upper jaw, however the lacquer surface of these were on the outwards side. The upper and lower teeth lines were inset, which made a "cheek-break" likewise observed in different ornithischians.
