"1UP.com's" Jeremy Parish expressed that the 32X "spoiled pretty much all that it contacted." "GamesRadar+" likewise panned the framework, setting it as their ninth-most noticeably bad reassure with commentator Mikel Reparaz censuring that "it was a stopgap framework that would be tossed under the transport when the Sega Saturn turned out a half year later, and everybody appeared to realize it aside beyond words Sega fans and the organization itself." "<nowiki>Retro Gamer'</nowiki>"s Damien McFerran offered some acclaim for the power increment of the 32X to offer ports of "Room Harrier", "Max engine propulsion", and "Virtua Fighter" that were exact to the first arcade renditions, just as the extra's value point, expressing, "On the off chance that you didn't have sufficiently profound pockets to bear the cost of a Saturn, at that point the 32X was a practical alternative; it's only a disgrace that it sold so ineffectively on the grounds that the potential was there for genuine enormity." Levi Buchanan, composing for "IGN", saw some sense in the move for Sega to make the 32X however condemned its usage. As indicated by Buchanan, "I really thought the 32X was a superior thought than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, in any event propelled the ball. Perhaps it just picked up a couple of crawls in no little part because of a frail library, however in any event the thought was the correct one."
