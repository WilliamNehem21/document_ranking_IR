With the score 2Ã¢ÂÂ 0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death tossed the ball to one side back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday remaining close to one side hand corner of the contradicting punishment territory. Subsides passed high and corner to corner over the pitch towards his forward, who bounced into the air and utilized his chest to pad the ball and thump it into the air with his back to objective, about 25Ã¢ÂÂ 30 yards from the net. As Friday landed, he brutally fueled the ball towards objective, kicking behind him and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the upper right-hand corner of the net, shocking the group, players and Thomas, the official, who put his hands over his head in dismay. "I'll always remember it", Thomas reviewed. "It was the sheer savagery of the shot on the volley ... behind him. ... On the off chance that it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Indeed, even facing any semblance of PelÃÂ© and Cruyff, that rates as the best objective I have ever observed." Reading proceeded to win 5Ã¢ÂÂ 0. When Thomas told Friday after the diversion that he had never observed a superior objective, the Londoner answered, "Truly? You should descend here more regularly, I do that consistently."
