Zwingli again led the pack in the controversy. His adversary was the previously mentioned ordinance, Konrad Hofmann, who had at first upheld Zwingli's decision. Additionally partaking was a gathering of young fellows requesting an a lot quicker pace of renewal, who in addition to other things argued for supplanting newborn child immersion with grown-up submersion. This gathering was driven by Conrad Grebel, one of the initiators of the Anabaptist development. Amid the initial three days of debate, in spite of the fact that the contention of pictures and the mass were talked about, the contentions prompted the subject of whether the city committee or the religious government had the specialist to settle on these issues. Now, Konrad Schmid, a cleric from Aargau and adherent of Zwingli, made a practical proposal. As pictures were not yet viewed as valueless by everybody, he recommended that ministers lecture regarding this matter under risk of discipline. He trusted the suppositions of the general population would slowly change and the deliberate expulsion of pictures would pursue. Henceforth, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, however bolstered Zwingli's position. In November the chamber passed statutes in help of Schmid's movement. Zwingli composed a booklet on the zealous obligations of a pastor, "Kurze, christliche Einleitung" (Short Christian Introduction), and the board sent it out to the church and the individuals from the Confederation.
