The prelude to act 1 joins three repetitive topics: the section of the matadors from act 4, the forgo the Toreador Song from act 2, and the theme that, in two somewhat varying structures, speaks to both Carmen herself and the destiny that she exemplifies. This theme, played on clarinet, bassoon, cornet and cellos over tremolo strings, finishes up the prelude with an unexpected crescendo. At the point when the drape rises a light and bright climate is before long settled, and infests the opening scenes. The counterfeit solemnities of the changing of the watchman, and the coy trades between the townsfolk and the processing plant young ladies, go before a state of mind change when a short expression from the destiny theme reports Carmen's passage. After her provocative habanera, with its persevering guileful cadence and changes of key, the destiny theme sounds in full when Carmen tosses her blossom to JosÃÂ© before leaving. This activity inspires from JosÃÂ© an energetic A noteworthy solo that Dean recommends is the defining moment in his melodic characterisation. The gentler vein returns quickly, as MicaÃÂ«la returns and unites with JosÃÂ© in a two part harmony to a warm clarinet and strings backup. The peacefulness is broken by the ladies' boisterous fight, Carmen's emotional reentry and her insubordinate connection with Zuniga. After her bewildering "Seguidilla" incites JosÃÂ© to an exasperated high A sharp yell, Carmen's departure is gone before by the brief however unsettling repeat of a piece from the habanera. Bizet amended this finale a few times to expand its sensational impact.
