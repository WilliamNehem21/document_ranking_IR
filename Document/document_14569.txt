From 1864 to 1874, Greece had 21 governments, the longest of which kept going eighteen months. In July 1874, Charilaos Trikoupis, an individual from the Greek Parliament, composed an unknown article in the paper "Kairoi" accusing King George and his consultants for the proceeding with political emergency brought about by the absence of stable governments. In the article, he blamed the King for acting like a flat out ruler by forcing minority governments on the general population. In the event that the King demanded, he contended, that just a lawmaker directing a greater part in the "Vouli" could be named head administrator, at that point legislators would be compelled to cooperate all the more agreeably so as to build an alliance government. Such an arrangement, he composed, would end the political unsteadiness and decrease the substantial number of littler gatherings. Trikoupis confessed to composing the article after a man assumed by the experts to be the writer was captured, whereupon he was arrested himself. After an open clamor, he was discharged and in this way vindicated of the charge of "undermining the protected request". The next year, the King asked Trikoupis to frame an administration (without a lion's share) and afterward read a discourse from the royal position proclaiming that in future the pioneer of the lion's share party in parliament would be selected head administrator.
