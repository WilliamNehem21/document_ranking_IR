As the video opens, Rihanna is hauled into a question and answer session, where she is secured with cling wrap and taped to a divider. Mouthpieces and choked correspondents encompass her. In an open air scene, she wears a cream-hued latex dress and leads a choked Perez Hilton around by a canine chain. Rihanna is then appeared and encompassed by CCTV reconnaissance cameras; her seat starts to turn, and she stands and starts to whip columnists, who are taped to the mass of the room. She at that point moves on the floor, her hands and feet bound with rope. As the scaffold of the tune approaches, Rihanna wears a white latex swimsuit and rabbit ears, while pictures of features are anticipated against her body and the divider behind her. After the theme, she shows up in a newsroom. Journalists take photos of her while she spreads over a work area wearing a pink latex dress. Scenes of Rihanna and others in servitude gear are sprinkled with pictures of the vocalist wearing a quill boa and a cylinder top with "controlled" printed crosswise over it. The video at that point shifts back and forth between past scenes and pictures in which Rihanna eats bananas, strawberries and cream, and gem secured dessert. In the last scene, she lies on a newsroom work area, with a smiley face image more than one eye and a Rolling Stones tongue logo over her mouth. Drag rulers Willam Belli, Detox Icunt, and Morgan McMichaels show up in the video.
