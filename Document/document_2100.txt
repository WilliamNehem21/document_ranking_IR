The hot, dry atmosphere makes it troublesome for soil to frame. Mass squandering, the down-slant development of free shake, is thusly the overwhelming erosive power in rugged territory, bringing about "skeletonized" ranges (mountains with next to no dirt on them). Sand hills in the recreation center, while renowned, are not so far reaching as their distinction or the dryness of the territory may recommend. The Mesquite Flat rise field is the most effectively available from the cleared street only east of Stovepipe Wells in the north-focal piece of the valley and is principally made of quartz sand. Another ridge field is simply toward the north however is rather for the most part made out of travertine sand. The most astounding ridges in the recreation center, and probably the most astounding in North America, are situated in the Eureka Valley going toward the north of Stovepipe Wells, while the Panamint Valley rises and the Saline Valley rises are found west and northwest of the town, individually. The Ibex ridge field is close to the sometimes visited Ibex Hill in the southernmost piece of the recreation center, only south of the Saratoga Springs marshland. The majority of the last four ridge fields are open just by means of unpaved streets. Winning breezes in the winter originate from the north, and winning breezes in the late spring originate from the south. In this manner the general position of the ridge fields stays pretty much fixed.
