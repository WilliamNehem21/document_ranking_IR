Apollonius' concern can likewise be detailed as the issue of finding at least one points with the end goal that the "distinctions" of its separations to three given focuses rise to three known qualities. Consider an answer hover of range "r" and three given circles of radii "r", "r" and "r". In the event that the arrangement circle is remotely digression to each of the three given circles, the separations between the focal point of the arrangement circle and the focuses of the given circles measure up to , and , individually. In this manner, contrasts in these separations are constants, for example, ; they depend just on the known radii of the given circles and not on the sweep "r" of the arrangement circle, which counteracts. This second definition of Apollonius' concern can be summed up to inside digression arrangement hovers (for which the middle focus remove squares with the distinction of radii), by changing the comparing contrasts of separations to wholes of separations, so the arrangement circle range "r" again offsets. The re-definition regarding focus separations is helpful in the arrangements beneath of Adriaan van Roomen and Isaac Newton, and furthermore in hyperbolic situating or trilateration, which is the errand of finding a situation from contrasts in separations to three known focuses. For instance, route frameworks, for example, LORAN distinguish a collector's situation from the distinctions in entry times of signs from three fixed positions, which relate to the distinctions in separations to those transmitters.
