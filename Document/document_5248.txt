On 7 April 1939, five months before the flare-up of World War II, the Kingdom of Italy attacked Albania. The nation was overwhelm in five days, and Italian King Victor Emmanuel III acknowledged the crown offered by the Parliament of Albania. The Royal Albanian Army was consolidated into the Royal Italian Army and an emissary was selected to manage the nation as a protectorate. Following the Axis attack of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, Italian Albania was extended to incorporate nearby pieces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia fused for the most part from the Yugoslav "banovinas" (territorial subdivisions) of Vardar and Morava. A large portion of Kosovo was added to Albania, and in the first place, Albanians living there eagerly respected the Italian occupation. Some Kosovo Albanians even proposed that Albanians were "Aryans of Illyrian legacy". Albeit authoritatively under Italian principle, the Albanians in Kosovo were given control of the locale and urged to open Albanian-language schools, which had been prohibited by the Yugoslav government. The Italians additionally gave the occupants Albanian citizenship and enabled them to fly the banner of Albania. The Royal Italian Army removed the vast majority of the Serbs and Montenegrins that had settled Kosovo amid the interwar period. The Kosovo Albanians detested the Serbs for the mistreatment they had encountered at their hands amid the Balkan Wars, World War I, and under Yugoslav standard. They exploited their changed conditions, assaulted their Serb neighbors, and consumed the homes of upwards of 30,000 Serb and Montenegrin pioneers.
