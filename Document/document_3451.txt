"Easy routes" was one of a trio of progressive film appearances that helped Moore's notoriety. It was followed in 1994 with "Vanya on 42nd Street", a recorded form of her continuous "Uncle Vanya" workshop generation, coordinated by Louis Malle. Moore's execution of Yelena was depicted as "essentially exceptional" by "Time Out", and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics grant for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first driving job, playing a despondent rural housewife who builds up numerous compound affectability in Todd Haynes' low-spending film "Safe" (1995). She needed to lose a generous measure of weight for the job, which made her evil, and she promised never to change her body for a film again. In their survey, "Domain" magazine composes that "Sheltered" "first settled [Moore's] certifications as maybe the best performer of her age". The film antiquarian David Thomson later portrayed it as "a standout amongst the most capturing, unique and achieved movies of the 1990s", and the execution earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award assignment for Best Actress. Pondering these three jobs, Moore has stated, "They all turned out without a moment's delay, and I all of a sudden had this profile. It was astonishing."
