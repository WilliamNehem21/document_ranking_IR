In the 5th century CE, the Indian astronomical text "Surya Siddhanta" estimated the angular size of Mars as 2Â arc-minutes (1/30 of a degree) and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000Â km (1,296,600Â yojana, where one yojana is equivalent to eightÂ km in the "Surya Siddhanta"). From this the diameter of Mars is deduced to be 6,070Â km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788Â km. However, this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet's angular size. The result may have been influenced by the work of Ptolemy, who listed a value of 1.57 arc-minutes. Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope.
In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published a heliocentric model in his work "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium". This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the "Prutenic Tables" by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.
