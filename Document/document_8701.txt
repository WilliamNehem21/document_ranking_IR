In 1960, Branham lectured a progression of messages on the seven church ages dependent on sections two and three of the Book of Revelation. The lessons firmly lined up with the lessons of C. I. Scofield and Clarence Larkin, the main advocates of dispensationalism in the former age. Like Larkin and Scofield, Branham said each congregation speaks to a chronicled age, and instructed that the heavenly attendant of each age was a huge church figure. The message incorporated the depiction of a flag-bearer to the Laodicean Church age, which Branham accepted would promptly go before the bliss. Branham clarified the Laodicean age would be unethical in a route tantamount to Sodom and Gomorrah, and it would be a period in which Christian divisions rejected Christ. As depicted by Branham, the qualities of the Laodicean age look like those of the cutting edge time. Branham portrayed the attributes of the Laodicean delegate by contrasting his qualities with Elijah and John the Baptist. He declared the envoy would be a compelling prophet who put the Word of God first, that he would be an admirer of the wild, that he would despise evil ladies, and be an uneducated individual. Branham guaranteed the ambassador to this last age would come in the soul of Elijah the prophet and refered to the Book of Malachi 4:5Ã¢ÂÂ 6 as the reason for asserting the Elijah soul would return. His confidence in a "seventh church age dispatcher" originated from his understanding of the Book of Revelation 3:14Ã¢ÂÂ 22.
