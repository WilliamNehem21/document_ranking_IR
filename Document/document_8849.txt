One of the critical inquiries raised by the novel is whether Maria is hoodwinked in her association with Darnford. Maria composes a personal history for her little girl in which she concedes that she was misdirected by Venables, yet faultfinders differ over the degree to which she is additionally deceived by Darnford. Some recommend that Maria rehashes her misstep and envisions Darnford as a saint, refering to as proof Maria's refusal to leave the crazy house, when she is allowed to do as such, on the grounds that she needs to stay with him, just as her fixation on Rousseau's tale "Julie, or the New Heloise". She envisions Darnford as its "saint", St. Preux, the at some point sweetheart yet not spouse of Julie. Maria's perusing and the plots she summons in her creative energy because of that perusing are the reason for her ruin in this understanding: incapable or reluctant to isolate fiction from the real world, she joins Darnford into her sentimental dreams. Different commentators, while concurring that Maria is driven off track by Darnford, contend that it isn't her sexuality and suggestion that are the issue, yet her decision of accomplice. They contend that Wollstonecraft isn't depicting female sexuality as innately hindering, as she had in "Mary" and the "Privileges of Woman", rather she is reprimanding the headings it frequently takes.
