Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Yusuf ibn Nasr (1195ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ 22 January 1273), otherwise called Ibn al-AÃ¡Â¸Â¥mar () and by his designation al-Ghalib billah ("The Victor by the Grace of God"), was the main leader of the Emirate of Granada, the keep going autonomous Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula, and the organizer of its decision Nasrid administration. He lived amid when Iberia's Christian kingdomsÃ¢ÂÂparticularly Portugal, Castile and AragonÃ¢ÂÂwere growing to the detriment of the Islamic region in Iberia, called Al-Andalus. Muhammad ibn Yusuf took control in his local Arjona in 1232 when he defied the "accepted" pioneer of Al-Andalus, Ibn Hud. Amid this defiance, he had the capacity to assume responsibility for CÃÂ³rdoba and Seville quickly, before he lost the two urban communities to Ibn Hud. Compelled to recognize Ibn Hud's suzerainty, Muhammad had the capacity to hold Arjona and JaÃÂ©n. In 1236, he double-crossed Ibn Hud by helping Ferdinand III of Castile take CÃÂ³rdoba. In the years that pursued, Muhammad had the capacity to oversee the southern urban communities, including Granada (1237), AlmerÃÂ­a (1238) and MÃÂ¡laga (1239). In 1244, he lost Arjona to Castile. After two years, in 1246, he consented to surrender JaÃÂ©n and acknowledge Ferdinand's overlordship in return for harmony.
