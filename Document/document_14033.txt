At the turn of the twentieth century, the American Historical Association (AHA) attempted an across the country exertion to analyze storehouses of original copies and chronicled records, and make explicit proposals for their future conservation. The activity was mostly affected by Ames' promotion of German chronicled strategy, picked up amid his year in Europe, which put exceptional accentuation on essential narrative sources. At the command of the AHA, Ames went through half a month in Harrisburg in 1899, looking at Pennsylvania's state records, which were ineffectively composed and to a great extent dispersed crosswise over different state workplaces. He co-wrote, with history specialist Lewis Slifer Shimmel, a report on their status, and in 1900 documented a different report on the condition of the Philadelphia metropolitan chronicles. Their report presumed that throughout the years Pennsylvania's open records had been in part pillaged by government authorities with some state archives known to be held by libraries in New York and Boston, and others likely once bearing the first signature of William Penn had since had their mark lines removed, maybe for gift keeping. Ames proceeded with his endeavors to stock Pennsylvania open records pair with his showing obligations at the University of Pennsylvania, despite the fact that his endeavors were hampered by the convention that all state government workplaces shut expeditiously at 3 o'clock toward the evening.
