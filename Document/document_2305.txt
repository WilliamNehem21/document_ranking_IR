A long-running question between the Archbishops of Canterbury and York erupted under Anselm's successor, Ralph d'Escures. Canterbury, generally the senior of the two foundations, had since a long time ago contended that the Archbishop of York ought to formally guarantee to comply with their Archbishop, however York contended that the two episcopates were free inside the English Church and that no such guarantee was essential. Henry upheld the power of Canterbury, to guarantee that England stayed under a solitary religious organization, however the Pope favored the instance of York. The issue was entangled by Henry's own companionship with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, and the King's craving that the case ought not finish up in an ecclesiastical court, outside imperial ability to control. Henry severely required the help of the Papacy in his battle with Louis of France, be that as it may, and subsequently permitted Thurstan to go to the Council of Rheims in 1119, where Thurstan was then sanctified by the Pope with no notice of any obligation towards Canterbury. Henry trusted this conflicted with affirmations Thurstan had recently made and banished him from England until the King and Archbishop went to an arranged arrangement the next year.
