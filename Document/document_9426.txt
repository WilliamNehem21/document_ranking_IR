In her survey for "The New York Times", Eudora Welty noticed "Pioneer's" storyteller being "the main individual in [Dillard's] book, considerably the just a single in her reality . ... Talking about the universe frequently, she is yet self-encompassed". Dillard apparently alludes to the possibility of an "imperceptible storyteller" in the 6th part of "Traveler at Tinker Creek"; while alluding to the "unending force" of God, the storyteller takes note of that "intangibility is the untouched incredible 'spread'". Nancy C. Parrish, writer of the 1998 book "Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers", noticed that regardless of its having been written in the primary individual, "Pioneer" isn't really personal. The storyteller, "Annie Dillard", along these lines turns into a persona through which the writer can involvement and portray "considerations and occasions that the genuine Annie Dillard had just found out about or examined or envisioned." Critic Suzanne Clark additionally indicates the "particular shiftiness" of Dillard-the-writer, noticing that "when we read Annie Dillard, we don't have the foggiest idea who is composing. There is a quiet in where there may be a picture of the social selfÃ¢ÂÂof identity, character, or sense of self". While most commentators expect that the storyteller is female, generally because of the self-portraying components of the book and the supposition that the storyteller is Dillard herself, Clark addresses whether the storyteller is male. Expressing that Dillard utilizes "an assortment of male voices, male styles" all through the book, Clark asks, "When Dillard quit stating "Traveler at Tinker Creek" in the persona of a multi year elderly person, did she at that point start to compose as a lady?"
