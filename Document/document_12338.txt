Toward the start of the ninth century, England was totally under the control of the Anglo-Saxons, with Mercia and Wessex the most critical southern kingdoms. Mercia was predominant until the 820s, and it practiced overlordship over East Anglia and Kent, yet Wessex had the capacity to keep up its freedom from its all the more dominant neighbor. Offa, King of Mercia from 757 to 796, was the predominant figure of the second 50% of the eighth century. Lord Beorhtric of Wessex (786Ã¢ÂÂ 802), wedded Offa's girl in 789. Beorhtric and Offa drove ÃÂthelwulf's dad Egbert into outcast, and he went through quite a long while at the court of Charlemagne in Francia. Egbert was the child of Ealhmund, who had quickly been King of Kent in 784. Following Offa's demise, King Coenwulf of Mercia (796Ã¢ÂÂ 821) kept up Mercian strength, yet it is questionable whether Beorhtric ever acknowledged political subjection, and when he kicked the bucket in 802 Egbert moved toward becoming ruler, maybe with the help of Charlemagne. For two hundred years three kindreds had battled for the West Saxon position of authority, and no child had pursued his dad as lord. Egbert's best case was that he was the extraordinary incredible grandson of Ingild, sibling of King Ine (688Ã¢ÂÂ 726), and in 802 it would have appeared to be all around impossible that he would set up an enduring line.
