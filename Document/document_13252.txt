The "thought variation" arrangement may have been presented for exposure, instead of as a genuine endeavor to characterize the kind of fiction Tremaine was searching for; the early "thought variation" stories were not in every case unique or top notch. Ashley depicts the first, Nat Schachner's "Hereditary Voices", as "not among Schachner's ideal"; the second, "Monster", by Donald Wandrei, was not another thought, however was vigorously composed. Over the succeeding issues, it ended up clear that Tremaine was truly ready to distribute material that would have fallen foul of publication taboos somewhere else. He serialized Charles Fort's "Lo!", a true to life work about unusual and baffling marvels, in eight sections among April and November 1934, trying to invigorate new thoughts for stories. The best-recalled story of 1934 is presumably Jack Williamson's "The Legion of Space", which started serialization in April, however other eminent stories incorporate Murray Leinster's "Sidewise in Time", which was the primary classification sci-fi story to utilize substitute history; "The Bright Illusion", by C.L. Moore, and "Nightfall", by John W. Campbell, composing as Don A. Stuart. "Dusk", which was written in a more artistic and lovely style than Campbell's prior space musical show stories, was especially compelling, and Tremaine urged different essayists to create comparative stories. One such was Raymond Z. Gallun's "Old Faithful", which showed up in the December 1934 issue and was adequately prominent that Gallun composed a spin-off, "Child of Old Faithful", distributed the next July. Space musical drama kept on being well known, however, and two covering space musical drama books were running in "Shocking" late in the year: "The Skylark of Valeron" by E.E. Smith, and "The Mightiest Machine", by Campbell. Before the year's over, "Amazing" was the unmistakable pioneer of the little field of sf magazines.
