Philip I's situation on the position of royalty was uncertain: Cleopatra Selene stowed away in Syria with Antiochus XIII, her child by Antiochus X, trusting that an open door will recapture the royal position, while Antiochus XII supplanted Demetrius III in Damascus, however there is no proof that he tried to rival his sibling for Antioch. As indicated by Josephus, Philip I exploited Antiochus XII's nonappearance in a crusade against Nabataea to catch Damascus. The legislative leader of the cityÃ¢ÂÂMilesius, who paved the way for the Philip IÃ¢ÂÂwas not given a reasonable reward by his new ace, driving him to hold up until Philip I left the city; he at that point shut the doors, bolting the lord out until Antiochus XII returned. In the Seleucid administration, money struck amid crusades against an adversary (or usurper) demonstrated the ruler with a facial hair. Antiochus XII was appeared for the initial two years of his rule; in 228 SE (85/84 BC), he showed up with a whiskers, perhaps identified with Philip I's assault on Damascus. Yet, since Antiochus XII did not walk north against his sibling, the speculation about an association between Antiochus XII' facial hair and Philip I's endeavor to take Damascus debilitates; no coins of Philip I were struck in Damascus, showing that his control of the city was brief.
