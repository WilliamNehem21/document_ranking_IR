"B.ÃÂ cuneata" is surprising in evidently enduring no seed misfortune due to granivory. In almost all different species, tunneling creepy crawly hatchlings eat a substantial extent of seeds, and winged creatures bring about additional misfortunes in tearing open cones looking for hatchlings to eat. The seed-eating bugs are generally species-explicit, and it gives the idea that no bug species has adjusted to "B.ÃÂ cuneata". Conceivable purposes behind this are the exceptionally low seed tallies, and the uncommonness of the species, the two of which offer minimal motivating force for adjustment to the species. There is additionally no proof of granivores benefiting from seed after it has fallen. Subsequently, this species has the most elevated rate of seed suitability recorded for a "Banksia" animal categories: in one investigation, 74% of all seed created in the past 12 years was feasible. This was to a great extent represented by seed under 9 years of age, about 90% of which is feasible. After the ninth year, feasibility is lost quickly as the follicles rot and senescence sets in. Seed generation itself begins in all respects gradually. All things considered, plants matured somewhere in the range of 5 and 12 years have around 18 seeds put away in their shade. Capacity increments exponentially, notwithstanding, and 25-year-old plants frequently have a huge number of seeds. Seed creation presumably never levels. Truth be told, when a plant is twenty years of age it has amassed such an incredible load of cones that significant branches start to split away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches usually. As plants age, branch breakage progressively prompts plant passing, and it is improbable that any plants live to over 45 years.
