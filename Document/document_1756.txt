Other than his bronchitis, Rutherford created diabetes in later years. His better half observed his sugar admission, however when they were separated Rutherford now and then took less consideration than she would have enjoyed him to. In 1938, perhaps because of diabetes, he endured a stroke that left him deadened and quiet. He figured out how to walk again and with the assistance of an evaluation one peruser recovered his discourse. September 13, 1940, Mattie Rutherford kicked the bucket of disease. Not exactly a year later, June 11, 1941, Rutherford endured a deadly heart assault while in medical clinic for insulin treatment. He was 84 years of age. Alexander Rutherford was covered in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton, close by his family. His name was connected to numerous organizations both amid his life and after: Rutherford Elementary School in Edmonton was built up in 1911 and the University of Alberta's Rutherford Library in 1951. In 1954, a mountain in Jasper National Park was named Mount Rutherford. In 1980, the administration of Alberta made the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship, which grants more than $20 million every year to secondary school understudies chose based on at least a 75% normal. The best ten understudies accepting Alexander Rutherford grants are perceived as 'Rutherford Scholars', and are given an extra grant and plaque.
