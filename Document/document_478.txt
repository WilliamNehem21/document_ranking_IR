Kira Schlechter in "The Patriot-News" proclaims "The Body" "one of the best scenes of any arrangement consistently", expressing that the quietness and novel cinematography are "exceptional and the composing is splendid". Buffy and Dawn's discussion at her school, Schlechter says, is "emphatically twisting". At the point when the arrangement finished in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the "Boston Herald" and Siona LaFrance of the "New Orleans Times-Picayune" both evaluated the best "Buffy" scenes giving "The Body" measure up to charging at the top with "Quiet" and "Afresh, with Feeling", LaFrance assigning the scene a "moment exemplary". Jonathan Last in "The Weekly Standard" records "The Body" eighth out of the ten best "Buffy" scenes, composing that it is "the arrangement's most troublesome scene since it's genuineÃ¢ÂÂand not genuine in the way "ER" or "The Practice" or "Law and Order", all hyper-renditions of the truth, are genuine. Sooner or later, a large portion of us will encounter multi day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the scholars have gotten about everything about that dayÃ¢ÂÂdirectly down to the nonattendance of a melodic scoreÃ¢ÂÂappropriate." In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray likewise discovers little subtleties convincing, for example, the camera's emphasis on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the regurgitation on the floor covering. He does, notwithstanding, compose that a portion of the shots "fall off somewhat gimmicky, yet the ones that work are effective to the point that it appears to be negligible to gripe that Whedon tries too hard now and again. (Plus, various minutes are probably going to move diverse individuals.)"
