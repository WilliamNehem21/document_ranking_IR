Under the Jennisons, the principle needs for Belle Vue were the zoological and professional flowerbeds; entertainments were given only as a diversion. The Jennisons spread out formal gardens in different styles somewhere in the range of 1836 and 1898, including labyrinths, grottoes, an Italian patio nursery, "billiard-table yards" and built Tropical Plant Houses. There were likewise colorful developments like the Indian sanctuary and cave, planned by George Danson, Belle Vue's picturesque craftsman. Worked to look like a destroyed sanctuary, it housed snakes and crocodiles just as blossoms. Toward the finish of the nineteenth century, ""the retreat depended for the most part for its fascination on its brilliant patio nurseries"", however by 1931 the formalism had altogether vanished. The patio nurseries were likewise used to organize huge political revives for a wide range of feeling, for example, the "Incomparable Liberal Demonstration" of 1924, at which Lloyd George tended to a horde of 50,000, the main political gathering at which amplifiers were utilized. The British Union of Fascists, famously known as the Blackshirts, likewise held a gathering there, in September 1934. One contemporary reporter saw that "maybe the Ku Klux Klan will be found in session there one day, for Belle Vue is nothing if not catholic".
