Brought up in a poor Xhosa family, Biko experienced childhood in Ginsberg township in the Eastern Cape. In 1966, he started considering drug at the University of Natal, where he joined the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). Unequivocally contradicted to the politically-sanctioned racial segregation arrangement of racial isolation and white-minority rule in South Africa, Biko was baffled that NUSAS and other enemy of politically-sanctioned racial segregation bunches were ruled by white nonconformists, instead of by the blacks who were most influenced by politically-sanctioned racial segregation. He trusted that notwithstanding when good natured, white dissidents neglected to understand the dark experience and regularly acted in a paternalistic way. He built up the view that to maintain a strategic distance from white control, dark individuals needed to arrange autonomously, and to this end he turned into a main figure in the making of the South African Students' Organization (SASO) in 1968. Participation was open just to "blacks", a term that Biko utilized in reference to Bantu-speaking Africans as well as to Coloreds and Indians. He was mindful so as to keep his development autonomous of white dissidents, yet contradicted enemy of white bigotry and had different white companions and sweethearts. The white-minority National Party government were at first steady, seeing SASO's creation as a triumph for politically-sanctioned racial segregation's ethos of racial nonconformity.
