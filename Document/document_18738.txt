His character took on a more sinister direction on the November 27 episode of "SmackDown" when Punk revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted members of the audience to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form The Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of "NXT" rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved. On the December 14 episode of "Raw", Punk competed in a tournament to crown the 2009 Superstar of the Year, but he lost to John Cena by submission in the first round.
