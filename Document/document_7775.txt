"L'Arianna" was made as a bubbly piece for the wedding of the beneficiary to the duchy, Francesco Gonzaga, to Margherita of Savoy, in May 1608. Monteverdi got the commission following "L'Orfeo"s effective debut at the court in February 1607. The lyrics for "L'Arianna" was by Rinuccini, whose artistic abilities had before awed Duke Vincenzo I of Mantua after an act of "Euridice". The arrangement of "L'Arianna" turned into a full undertaking for Monteverdi, being just a single of three works that the duke required from him for the weddingÃ¢ÂÂhe had likewise to form a melodic introduction for Giovanni Battista Guarini's play "L'idropica", and compose the music for a sensational move, "Il ballo delle opportunist". His life had been upset by the deadly ailment of his significant other Claudia; she passed on 10 September 1607, however Monteverdi was given no reprieve by the duke. "L'Arianna" was to a great extent made over the most recent two months of 1607, an effort that Monteverdi's biographer Hans Redlich depicts as "superhuman". Monteverdi felt insulted by the absence of affirmation from the duke for his endeavors; about 20 years after the fact, in a letter to the Mantua court secretary Alessandro Striggio the Younger, he composed that he had nearly slaughtered himself when stating "L'Arianna" in such a rush.
