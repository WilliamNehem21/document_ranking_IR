Auriga is home to a few less conspicuous parallel and twofold stars. Theta Aurigae (Bogardus, Mahasim) is a blue-white A0p class parallel star of greatness 2.62 with a radiance of . It has a flat out size of 0.1 and is 165 light-years from Earth. The auxiliary is a yellow star of extent 7.1, which requires a telescope of in opening to determine; the two stars are isolated by 3.6 arcseconds. It is the eastern vertex of the star grouping's pentagon. Theta Aurigae is moving far from Earth at a rate of every second. Theta Aurigae also has a second optical partner, found by Otto Wilhelm von Struve in 1852. The detachment was at 52 arcseconds in 1978 and has been expanding from that point forward in view of the best possible movement of Theta Aurigae, 0.1 arcseconds every year. The partition of this size 9.2 segment was 2.2 arcminutes (130.7 arcseconds) in 2007 with a point of 350ÃÂ°. 4 Aurigae is a twofold star at a separation of 159 light-years. The essential is of size 5.0 and the auxiliary is of extent 8.1. 14 Aurigae is a white optical parallel star. The essential is of size 5.0 and is at a separation of 270 light-years; the optional is of size 7.9 and is at a separation of 82 light-years. HD 30453 is spectroscopic twofold of greatness 5.9, with a ghostly kind evaluated as either A8m or F0m, and a time of seven days.
