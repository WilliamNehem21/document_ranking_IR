On 13ÃÂ April, Lim stood up. He kept up that he was the sole culprit of the violations. He denied that he assaulted Lucy Lau or Ng, guaranteeing that he owned the before expressions just to fulfill his investigators. Lim was specific in responding to the inquiries the court tossed at him; he verbosely addressed those that concurred with his position, and would not remark on the others. At the point when tested on the veracity of his most recent admission, he guaranteed that he was bound by religious and good obligation to come clean. Knight, in any case, countered that Lim was intrinsically an untrustworthy man who had no regard for promises. Lim had deceived his significant other, his customers, the police, and specialists. Knight asserted Lim's position in court was an open confirmation that he enthusiastically lied in his before articulations. Tan and Hoe were increasingly helpful, responding to the inquiries presented by the court. They denied Lim's story, and vouched for the veracity of the announcements they had given to the police. They told how they had lived in consistent dread and wonder of Lim; trusting he had heavenly powers, they pursued his each request and had no unrestrained choice of their own. Under Knight's scrutinizing, notwithstanding, Tan conceded that Lim had been cheating his clients, and that she had intentionally helped him to do as such. Knight at that point got Hoe to concur that she was aware of her activities at the season of the homicides.
