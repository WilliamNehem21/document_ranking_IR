In 2000, Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), a federal effort to restore the Everglades with the objectives of "restoration, preservation and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region", and claiming to be the largest environmental restoration in history. It was a controversial plan; detractors worried that it "relies on uncertain technologies, overlooks water quality, subsidizes damaging growth and delays its environmental benefits". Supporters of the plan included the National Audubon Society, who were accused by Friends of the Everglades and the Biodiversity Legal Foundation of prioritizing agricultural and business interests.
CERP projects are designed to capture of fresh water every day, store it in underground reservoirs, and release the water to areas within 16Â counties in South Florida. Approximately of man-made wetlands are to be constructed to confine contaminated water before it is released to the Everglades, and of canals that divert water away from the Everglades are to be destroyed. During the first five years of implementation, CERP was responsible for the purchase of of land at a cost of $1Â billion. The plan aims to spend $10.5Â billion over 30Â years, combining 50 different projects and giving them 5-year timelines.
