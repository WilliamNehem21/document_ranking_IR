Intensification continued throughout the day on AprilÂ 9, with the appearance of concentric eyewalls on satellite imagery; such a feature is indicative of an intense tropical cyclone. Early on AprilÂ 10, the JTWC estimated that Sudal attained peak winds of 240Â km/h (150Â mph ), making the cyclone a super typhoon. At the same time, the JMA estimated peak winds of 165Â km/h (105Â mph ), as well as a barometric pressure of 940Â mbar (27.76Â inHg). Also on that day, Sudal entered the area of warning responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which provided the name "Cosme" for local advisories. For several days, the typhoon continued to the northwest, fluctuating in intensity but remaining powerful. On AprilÂ 12, Sudal turned toward the north and northeast through a weakness in the ridge, and its eye increased to a diameter of about . The next day, the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 230Â km/h (145Â mph ), although it gradually weakened subsequently due to a combination of increasing upper-level wind shear and cooler water temperatures.
Early on AprilÂ 15, Sudal passed very near the uninhabited Japanese island of Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on AprilÂ 15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on AprilÂ 18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.
