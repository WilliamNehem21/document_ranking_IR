The quantity of coins bearing the 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 is dubious. Swiatek and Breen composed that 5,000 were struck and were sold, implying that 15,400 of the plain ones were issued. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, clung to these figures. Coin vendor David Bullowa wrote in 1937 that 10,000 of the 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 were issued, with which numismatic essayist Q. David Bowers agreed, taking note of that the two assortments are about equivalent in irregularity. The select version of R. S. Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins", distributed in 2018, gauges that 9,400 of the 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 were issued, and 11,400 of the plain. The two assortments sold at a higher cost than normal over the issue cost by 1925, and at the tallness of the main memorial coin blast in 1936, the 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 sold for $25 and the plain for $28. By 1940, the 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 sold for more than the plain, and at the stature of the second blast in 1980, the 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 conveyed $2,600 to the plain's $2,400. Yeoman's book records the 2Ã¢ÂÂ4 for somewhere in the range of $625 and $7,250, and the plain for somewhere in the range of $400 and $6,650, each relying upon condition. An excellent example of the plain assortment sold at sale in 2015 for $70,500. Something like one example in verification condition is known, sold at closeout in 1992.
