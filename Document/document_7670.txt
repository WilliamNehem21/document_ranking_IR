Mendelssohn started taking piano exercises from his mom when he was six, and at seven was guided by Marie Bigot in Paris. Later in Berlin, each of the four Mendelssohn youngsters contemplated piano with Ludwig Berger, who was himself a previous understudy of Muzio Clementi. From in any event May 1819 Mendelssohn (at first with his sister Fanny) contemplated contradiction and organization with Carl Friedrich Zelter in Berlin. This was a vital effect on his future vocation. Zelter had more likely than not been prescribed as an educator by his auntie Sarah Levy, who had been an understudy of W. F. Bach and a benefactor of C. P. E. Bach. Sarah Levy showed some ability as a console player, and frequently played with Zelter's ensemble at the Berliner Singakademie; she and the Mendelssohn family were among its driving benefactors. Sarah had shaped an imperative accumulation of Bach family original copies which she granted to the Singakademie; Zelter, whose preferences for music were traditionalist, was additionally an admirer of the Bach convention. This without a doubt had a critical impact in framing Felix Mendelssohn's melodic tastes, as his works mirror this investigation of Baroque and early traditional music. His fugues and chorales particularly mirror a tonal lucidity and utilization of contradiction reminiscent of Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music impacted him profoundly.
