The position of the Inaccessible Island rail in the larger rail family (Rallidae) has long been a source of uncertainty. Lowe thought that its closest relatives may have been black crake of Africa, or perhaps an early offshoot of the genus "Porphyrio" (swamphens), a conclusion based mostly on similarities of plumage. He did concede that it was difficult to assign the rail to any relatives. American paleontologist Storrs Olson suggested in 1973 that it was related to the ""Rallus" assemblage", which included the genera "Rallus" and "Hypotaenidia" (now lumped with "Gallirallus"), based on the structure of the skeleton. In particular he suggested it was part of a pro-"Rallus" group that included the Indian Ocean genus "Dryolimnas", and the Australasian "Lewinia". Olson suggested the pro-"Rallus" rails have a relict distribution and would have been present in Africa and South America, where the ancestors of the Inaccessible Island rail came from. The most recent comparative morphological study to include the genus, in 1998, placed it in a subtribe Crecina of the crakes. Its exact position could not be determined, but it was suggested to perhaps be the sister taxon to the genus "Laterallus", a genus of small crakes found mostly in South America.
