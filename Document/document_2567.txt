By the last quarter of the eleventh century, the Byzantine naval force was a sad remnant of its previous self, having declined through disregard, the inadequacy of its officers, and absence of assets. Kekaumenos, writing in c. 1078, mourns that "on the appearance of sensible watches, [the Byzantine ships] are doing nothing else except for shipping wheat, grain, beat, cheddar, wine, meat, olive oil, a lot of cash, and whatever else" from the islands and banks of the Aegean, while they "escape [the enemy] before they have even gotten a quick look at them, and along these lines become a shame to the Romans". When Kekaumenos composed, new and ground-breaking foes had risen. In the West, the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, which had ousted the Byzantines from Southern Italy and had vanquished Sicily, was currently taking a gander at its eye on the Byzantine Adriatic coasts and past. In the East, the terrible Battle of Manzikert in 1071 had brought about the loss of Asia Minor, the Empire's military and financial heartland, to the Seljuk Turks, who by 1081 had set up their capital at Nicaea, scarcely a hundred miles south of Constantinople. Before long, Turkish just as Christian privateers showed up in the Aegean. The Byzantine topical armadas, which once policed the oceans, were by then so drained by disregard and the progressive common wars that they were unequipped for reacting adequately.
