Fries himself declined to keep the genus separate, instead classifying "Gomphus" as a "tribus" (subgenus) within the genus "Cantharellus" in his 1821 work "Systema Mycologicum", the species becoming "Cantharellus clavatus". He recognized four varieties: "violaceo-spadiceus", "carneus", "purpurascens" and "umbrinus". Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan described three taxaâ"Merulius clavatus carneus", "M.Â clavatus violaceus" and "M.Â clavatus purpurascens"âin his 1833 work "Mycographie Suisse". Many of his names have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently. Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum", placing it in a seriesâ"Deformes"âin the genus "Craterellus".
Paul Kummer raised many of Fries' "tribi" (subgenera) to genus rank in his 1871 work "Der FÃ¼hrer in die Pilzkunde", classifying the violet chanterelle in the genus "Thelephora". Jacques Emile Doassans and Narcisse ThÃ©ophile Patouillard placed it in the genus "Neurophyllum" (also spelt "Nevrophyllum") in 1886, removing it from "Cantharellus" on account of its orange spores. Charles Horton Peck discarded the name in 1887 and returned "G.Â clavatus" to "Cantharellus". In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published "Revisio generum plantarum", his response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice. He coined the genus "Trombetta" to incorporate the violet chanterelle, hence giving it the name "Trombetta clavata". However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists.
