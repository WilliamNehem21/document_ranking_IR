As they read, the relatives' most exceedingly awful feelings of trepidation are before long acknowledged; Buoso has for sure handed down his fortune to the cloister. They break out in trouble and anger and swing to Simone, the most established present and a previous city hall leader of Fucecchio, yet he can offer no assistance. Rinuccio proposes that just Gianni Schicchi can encourage them what to do, yet this is despised by Zita and the rest, who jeer at Schicchi's unassuming roots and now express that marriage to the little girl of such a laborer is impossible. Rinuccio safeguards Schicchi in an aria "Avete torto" (You're mixed up), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi rapidly gets a handle on the circumstance, and Rinuccio beseeches him for help, however Schicchi is discourteously advised by Zita to "be off" and take his little girl with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta tune in misery as Schicchi reports that he will have nothing to do with such individuals. Lauretta makes a last request to him with "O mio babbino caro" (Oh, my dear dad), and he consents to take a gander at the will. After twice examining it and inferring that there is no hope, a thought strikes him. He sends his girl outside with the goal that she will be guiltless of what is to pursue.
