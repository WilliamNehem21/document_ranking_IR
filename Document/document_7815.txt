Palairet's college exhibitions were adequate to procure him choice for the Gentlemen against the Players in the renowned matches at Lord's and The Oval. Coming back to Somerset, he struck a century against Gloucestershire toward the beginning of July, In late August, playing Yorkshire, Palairet scored 132 out of an organization of 346 with Hewett, building up a record for the main wicket in top of the line cricket, outperforming W. G. Beauty and Bransby Cooper's 1869 aggregate of 283. In spite of the fact that their record has since been beaten in top of the line cricket, it remains Somerset's record association for the primary wicket. Their association was portrayed as "Unadulterated beauty toward one side, sheer power at the other", in H.S. Altham and E. W. Swanton's "A History of Cricket". At the time, "The Daily Telegraph" detailed that the pair stayed together for three and a half hours, amid which Palairet scored one six and nineteen fours. Toward the finish of the period, he was chosen in two delegate sides: showing up for the West against the East, and by and by for the Gentlemen against the Players, on this event at Hastings. In all top notch coordinates that year, he scored 1,343 runs, the third a large portion of any cricketer. He was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by the "Wisden Cricketers' Almanac" in 1893, which noticed that "there can be little uncertainty that much more prominent qualification anticipates him in the cricket world."
