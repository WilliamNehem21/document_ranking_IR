In 2010, Opeth composed and recorded the new track, "The Throat of Winter", which showed up on the computerized EP soundtrack of the computer game, "Divine force of War III". ÃÂkerfeldt depicted the melody as "odd" and "not metal." To praise their twentieth commemoration, Opeth played out a six-appear, overall visit called "Development XX: An Opeth Anthology", from March 30 through April 9, 2010. "Blackwater Park" was performed completely, alongside a few tunes at no other time performed. The show of April 5, 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England was taped for a DVD and live collection bundle titled "In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall". The set was discharged on September 21, 2010, in 2-DVD and 2-DVD/3-CD designs. For the DVD the show was part into two sets. The primary set comprises of the whole "Blackwater Park" collection, while the second set contains one melody from each collection barring "Blackwater Park", in sequential request speaking to the twenty years of "advancement" in their music. ÃÂkerfeldt expressed, "I can barely handle it, at the same time, fuck, we're commending 20 years. I've been in this band as far back as I was 16. It's crazy." An exceptional version of "Blackwater Park" was discharged in March 2010 to harmonize with the visit.
