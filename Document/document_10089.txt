In the wake of the mishaps of the 1980s, substitution of Clackline Bridge appeared to be unavoidable; be that as it may, both Main Roads and the Shire of Northam got letters from inhabitants requesting the scaffold to be kept. In 1988, the Shire mentioned that Main Roads note the conservation estimation of the extension, and hold it in any designs for street realignment. After 10 years, in 1998, the extension was put on the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory, in categoryÃÂ C Ã¢ÂÂ "moderate if conceivable". In that equivalent year, it was incorporated into an Institute of Engineers study of the state's substantial timber structures, as a present structure with "exceptionally high legacy esteem". At this point Great Eastern Highway's detour of Clackline was being arranged, yet support works kept on being embraced as required. The detour was in the long run built, with works starting in January 2007, and the undertaking finished in February 2008. The Clackline people group respected the detour, however there were still worries that the notable Clackline Bridge would be lost. The scaffold has since gotten a changeless section on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008. The new roadway arrangement crosses Clackline Brook on a huge box duct, giving vehicles a more secure intersection than Clackline Bridge.
