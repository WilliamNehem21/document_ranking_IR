The 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the holiday season that year. As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace. Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up with orders for the new system. Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995. Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch. Despite Sega's initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including "Doom", "Star Wars Arcade", "Virtua Racing Deluxe", and "Cosmic Carnage". Although "Virtua Racing" was considered a "strong" title, "Cosmic Carnage" "looked and played so poorly that reporters made jokes about it." Games were available at a retail price of $69.95. Advertising for the system included images of the 32X being connected to a Genesis console to create an "arcade system". Japan received the 32X on December 3, 1994, at a cost of JPÂ¥16,800. The system's PAL release came in January 1995, at a price of GBÂ£169.99, and also experienced initial high demand.
