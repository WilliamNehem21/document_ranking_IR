Doran's organization had some expertise in the works of art, essentially Shakespeare. Following two years of period ensembles Richardson wanted to act in a cutting edge work. He left Doran in 1923 and visited in another play, "Outward Bound" by Sutton Vane. He came back to the works of art in August 1924, in Nigel Playfair's visiting creation of "The Way of the World", playing Fainall. While on that visit he wedded Muriel Hewitt, a youthful individual from Doran's organization, referred to him as "Unit". To his incredible satisfaction, the two had the capacity to cooperate for the majority of 1925, both being locked in by Sir Barry Jackson of the Birmingham Repertory Theater for a visiting creation of "The Farmer's Wife". From December of that year they were individuals from the primary repertory organization in Birmingham. Through Jackson's central chief, the veteran slave driver H K Ayliff, Richardson "retained the impact of more seasoned peers like Gerald du Maurier, Charles Hawtrey and Mrs Patrick Campbell." Hewitt was viewed as a rising star yet Richardson's abilities were not yet so obvious; he was distributed supporting jobs, for example, Lane in "The Importance of Being Earnest" and Albert Prossor in "Hobson's Choice".
