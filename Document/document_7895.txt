In 1736 the last Madurai Nayak ruler, Meenakshi, ended it all, and Tiruchirappalli was vanquished by Chanda Sahib. He administered the kingdom from 1736 to 1741, when he was caught and detained by the Marathas in the attack of Tiruchirappalli (1741) driven by general Raghuji Bhonsle compelled of Chhattrapati Shahu. Chanda Sahib remained detainee for around eight years before making his departure from the Maratha Empire. Tiruchirappalli was directed by the Maratha general Murari Rao from 1741 to 1743, when it was obtained by the Nizam of Hyderabad, who paid off Rao to hand over the city. Nizam delegated Khwaja Abdullah as the ruler and came back to Golkonda. At the point when the Nawab of the Carnatic Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah was ousted by Chanda Sahib after the Battle of Ambur (1749), the previous fled to Tiruchirappalli, where he set up his base. The ensuing attack of Tiruchirappalli (1751Ã¢ÂÂ 1752) by Chanda Sahib occurred amid the Second Carnatic War between the British East India Company and Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah on one side and Chanda Sahib and the French East India Company on the other. The British were successful and Wallajah was reestablished to the position of royalty. Amid his rule he proposed renaming the city Natharnagar after the Sufi holy person Nathar Vali, who is thought to have lived there in the twelfth century AD. Tiruchirappalli was attacked by Nanjaraja Wodeyar in 1753 and Hyder Ali of the Mysore kingdom in 1780, the two assaults rebuffed by the troops of the British East India Company. A third intrusion endeavor, by Tipu SultanÃ¢ÂÂchild of Hyder AliÃ¢ÂÂin 1793, was likewise fruitless; he was sought after by British powers driven by William Medows, who impeded the assault.
