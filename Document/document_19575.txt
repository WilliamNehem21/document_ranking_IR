Poe chose a raven as the central symbol in the story because he wanted a "non-reasoning" creature capable of speech. He decided on a raven, which he considered "equally capable of speech" as a parrot, because it matched the intended tone of the poem. Poe said the raven is meant to symbolize ""Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance"". He was also inspired by Grip, the raven in "" by Charles Dickens. One scene in particular bears a resemblance to "The Raven": at the end of the fifth chapter of Dickens's novel, Grip makes a noise and someone says, "What was thatÂ â him tapping at the door?" The response is, "'Tis someone knocking softly at the shutter."<ref name="Staford Cremains / Ravens"></ref> Dickens's raven could speak many words and had many comic turns, including the popping of a champagne cork, but Poe emphasized the bird's more dramatic qualities. Poe had written a review of "Barnaby Rudge" for "Graham's Magazine" saying, among other things, that the raven should have served a more symbolic, prophetic purpose. The similarity did not go unnoticed: James Russell Lowell in his "A Fable for Critics" wrote the verse, "Here comes Poe with his raven, like "Barnaby Rudge" / Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge." The Free Library of Philadelphia has on display a taxidermied raven that is reputed to be the very one that Dickens owned and that helped inspire Poe's poem.
