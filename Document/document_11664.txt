In Joseph's "Hallucination" tune cycle of 1921 (five tunes with string group of four backup), a Holstian impact is apparent close by her very own unmistakable compositional voice. Gibbs features the first in the cycle, "Melody", which at first echoes "To Varuna" from Holst's "Apparatus Veda" songs, yet develops into "an alternate creation, recognized by its very own uncluttered group of four writing in which the viola has an extraordinary part to play". The last tune, "Reverberation", shares as much for all intents and purpose with Brahms as with Holst. Joseph's "Celebration Venite" from 1922 is a case of her utilization of the Modern Dorian mode (a rising scale from D to the following D on the white piano keys), which turned into a component of a portion of her later works. Scowcroft and Gibbs both point to Tudor impacts in the "Venite" in which additionally, says Gibbs, "the suitable impact of Vaughan Williams in song and congruity is felt". The symphonic score for this work lost, yet an organ backup has been conceived. Joseph's unaccompanied choral "Psalm for Whitsuntide" likewise utilizes the Dorian Mode in what Holst depicted as an "immaculate little motet"; this was first work of Joseph's to be communicated, in 1968. A "Short String Quartet" in A minor was performed by the Winifred Smith Quartet in December 1922 and was acknowledged for production by J.B. Cramer and Co. Be that as it may, it was not distributed, and therefore vanished.
