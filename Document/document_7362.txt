Hiraga's plan for the ship mirrored the most recent battle understanding just as fusing progresses in evaporator innovation. It included an additional twin fundamental firearm turret, utilizing space and weight made accessible by the decrease of the quantity of boilers from 21 to 12 while the power continued as before. He diminished the auxiliary deadly implement from 20 firearms to 16; they were climbed a deck to improve their bends of flame and their capacity to shoot amid substantial climate. To build the ship's security he proposed to point the belt protective layer outwards to improve its protection from flat flame, and to thicken the lower deck covering and the torpedo bulkhead. Hiraga additionally wanted to add hostile to torpedo lumps to improve the ship's submerged security. He assessed that his ship would dislodge as much as "Nagato", in spite of the fact that it would cost around a million yen more. These progressions would have significantly postponed the ship's finishing and were dismissed by the Navy Ministry. The rejected plan shaped the reason for an a lot bigger war vessel, assigned as A-127, with almost twice as much shield weight as the "Nagato"s. It was intended to accomplish a similar speed as the more established boats, to enable them to move together as a strategic development. This plan was acknowledged on 27 March 1918 and turned into the "Tosa" class.
