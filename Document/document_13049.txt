The Admiralty chose to recommission "Inexhaustible" for use as a preparation dispatch in mid-1949. Commander Henry Fancourt accepted direction on 22 August to get ready for ocean. The ship touched base at Devonport to start the important changes on 30 August and the next day Fancourt turned over order to the dockyard. Chief John Grindle was designated to order on 24 March 1950 and the ship was recommissioned on 28 May. After two days Captain Robert Sherbrooke, VC, eased Grindle and "Tireless" started her ocean preliminaries on 28 June. She was investigated by Rear Admiral St John Micklethwaithe, Flag Officer Training Squadron, on 3 July and got her first students in a matter of seconds thereafter. She partook in activities with the Home Fleet and went along with it in Gibraltar in September and October. On 12 March 1951 she sortied from Portland, flying Micklethwaite's banner, to practice with the Home Fleet before starting a concise refit at Devonport in May. Skipper John Grant calmed Sherbrooke on 6 June and the ship was opened to guests as a feature of the Festival of Britain on 17 July. After five days the guests were stranded on board dispatch medium-term when a tempest came up and constrained "Inexhaustible" to put to ocean. The oceans directed the following day and the guests withdrew in security. Back Admiral Royer Dick raised his banner on board the bearer in September until she started a short refit at Devonport in January 1952.
