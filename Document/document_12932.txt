Other Coward works created in the mid-to-late 1920s incorporated the plays "Simple Virtue" (1926), a dramatization about a divorced person's conflict with her gaudy in-laws; "The Queen Was in the Parlor", a Ruritanian sentiment; "This Was a Man" (1926), a satire about double-crossing blue-bloods; "The Marquise" (1927), an eighteenth-century outfit show; "Home Chat" (1927), a parody about a wedded lady's loyalty; and the revues "On with the Dance" (1925) and "This Year of Grace" (1928). None of these shows has entered the ordinary collection, yet the last presented a standout amongst Coward's best-known melodies, "A Room with a View". His greatest disappointment in this period was the play "Sirocco" (1927), which concerns free love among the affluent. It featured Ivor Novello, of whom Coward stated, "the two most excellent things on the planet are Ivor's profile and my brain". Theatergoers despised the play, indicating savage dissatisfaction at the blind calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theater. Weakling later said of this lemon, "My first intuition was to leave England promptly, yet this appeared to be too fainthearted a move, and furthermore excessively satisfying to my adversaries, whose numbers had by then swollen in our brains to for all intents and purposes the whole populace of the British Isles."
