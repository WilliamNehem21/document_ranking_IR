Prior to "Pepper", it was difficult to utilize Parliamentary talks as proof in court cases; William Blackstone wrote in the eighteenth century that to permit legal audit of "absurd" enactment was to "set the legal power over that of the lawmaking body, which would be incendiary of all legislature". Generally, the courts had been progressively merciful; while this recommendation initially shows up in the fourteenth century, with the aim that enactment was best deciphered by the individuals who had composed it, the guideline was not emphatically pursued. In the 1678 instance of "Fiery remains v Abdy", Lord Nottingham alluded to the parliamentary history of the Statute of Frauds, and in "Millar v Taylor", in 1769, the primary case to unequivocally express this standard (as "The sense and significance of an Act of Parliament must be gathered from what it says when gone into law, and not from the historical backdrop of changes it experienced in the House where it took its ascent"), the court withdrew from it. The guideline was most utilized amid the nineteenth and twentieth hundreds of years, with a prominent precedent being "Beswick v Beswick", where Lord Reid kept up that it would be badly arranged and costly for attorneys to need to allude to "Hansard" while planning cases. Both the English and Scottish Law Commissions concurred with the standard in their 1969 "Report on the Interpretation of Statutes".
