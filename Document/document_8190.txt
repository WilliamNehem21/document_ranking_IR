There are no verbatim translations of Henry's discourse contrary to the Stamp Act. Writings are recreations, generally dependent on memories decades later by which time both the discourse and Henry had turned out to be acclaimed. For instance, Jefferson, still in his examinations at the adjacent College of William and Mary, reviewed the magnificence of Henry's speech. No endeavor was made to recreate Henry's words until 1790, when James Madison kept in touch with previous burgess Edmund Pendleton, yet Madison discovered that Pendleton had not been available; a second endeavor did not happen until Wirt started deal with his life story of Henry in 1805. A French voyager, whose name isn't known, and whose diary was found in 1921, recorded at the season of Henry's discourse that "one of the individuals stood up and said that he had perused that in previous occasions Tarquin and Julius had their Brutus, Charles had his Cromwell, and he didn't question yet some great American would stand up, for his nation". As Henry had apparently required the murdering of King George III, there were cries of "Conspiracy!" in the chamber, including by the Speaker, John Robinson. John Tyler Sr. (father of things to come president), who was remaining with Jefferson as they viewed the session, called this one of "the attempting minutes which is conclusive of character", and both reviewed that Henry did not falter: "If this be treachery, take advantage of it!".
