A second, possibly pre-12th-century allusion to the CÃ¦dmon story is found in two Latin texts associated with the Old Saxon "Heliand" poem. These texts, the "Praefatio" (Preface) and "Versus de Poeta" (Lines about the poet), explain the origins of an Old Saxon biblical translation (for which the "Heliand" is the only known candidate) in language strongly reminiscent of, and indeed at times identical to, Bede's account of CÃ¦dmon's career. According to the prose "Praefatio", the Old Saxon poem was composed by a renowned vernacular poet at the command of the emperor Louis the Pious; the text then adds that this poet had known nothing of vernacular composition until he was ordered to translate the precepts of sacred law into vernacular song in a dream. The "Versus de Poeta" contain an expanded account of the dream itself, adding that the poet had been a herdsman before his inspiration and that the inspiration itself had come through the medium of a heavenly voice when he fell asleep after pasturing his cattle. While our knowledge of these texts is based entirely on a 16th-century edition by Flacius Illyricus, both are usually assumed on semantic and grammatical grounds to be of medieval composition. This apparent debt to the CÃ¦dmon story agrees with semantic evidence attested to by Green demonstrating the influence of Anglo Saxon biblical poetry and terminology on early continental Germanic literatures.
