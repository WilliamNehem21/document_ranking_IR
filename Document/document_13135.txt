Affleck rejoined with executive Michael Bay for the basically ridiculed war show "Pearl Harbor" (2001). He later described it as a film he did "for moneyÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ for the wrong reasons". A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" felt Affleck and Kate Beckinsale "do what they can with their lines, and gleam with the silken sparkle of genuine film stars". In any case, Todd McCarthy of "Assortment" stated, "the tastelessly attractive Affleck couldn't persuade that he'd quite a lot as been turned down for a date, significantly less lost the affection for his life to his closest companion". Affleck then ridiculed "Cooperative attitude Hunting" with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (2001), made an appearance in the satire "Daddy and Them" (2001), and had a supporting job in the little-seen "The Third Wheel" (2002). He depicted the CIA investigator Jack Ryan in the spine chiller "The Sum of All Fears" (2002). Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" felt he was miscast in a job recently played by both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin: "In spite of the fact that Mr. Affleck can be engaging when playing sincere young fellows grabbing toward development, he just comes up short on the gravitas for the job." Affleck had an "astonishing knowledge" making the spine chiller "Switching to another lane" (2002), and later refered to Roger Michell as somebody he gained from as a chief. Robert Koehler of "Assortment" portrayed it as one of the on-screen character's "most altogether created" exhibitions: "The voyage into an ethical haze urges him to play more internally and mindfully than he ever has previously."
