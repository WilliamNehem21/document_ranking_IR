Subsequent to finishing the remaking, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was alloted to the Reserve Formation of the Baltic, going through the greater part of the year out of administration. She was reactivated for the yearly armada moves in August and September 1910 with what had since been revamped as the "Hochseeflotte" (High Seas Fleet). The ship was recommissioned on 2 August and appointed to the III Battle Squadron, filling in as the leader of "Vizeadmiral" Max Rollmann, who got on four days after the fact. The squadron was disbanded after the moves on 8 September, and "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned again on 15 September. The ship burned through a large portion of 1911 available for later also, being initiated just for the yearly armada moves. In the wake of recommissioning on 31 July, she quickly filled in as the leader of the agent administrator of the III Squadron, "Konteradmiral" Heinrich SaÃÂ. The boats at first prepared separately before joining the remainder of the armada on 17 August. The moves kept going until 11 September, after which "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned once more. This turned out to be the last time the ship would be actuated before the episode of World War I in July 1914. She and her sister ships were expelled from the Reserve Formation in May 1912, having been supplanted by the "Wittelsbach"- class vessels.
