The submerged scenes shot from the shark's perspective have been contrasted and entries in two 1950s blood and gore movies, "Animal from the Black Lagoon" and "The Monster That Challenged the World". Gottlieb named two sci-fi preparations from a similar period as impacts on how the shark was portrayed, or not: "The Thing from Another World", which Gottlieb depicted as "an extraordinary blood and guts movie where you just observe the beast in the last reel"; and "It Came From Outer Space", where "the anticipation was developed in light of the fact that the animal was constantly off-camera". Those points of reference helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to "focus on demonstrating the 'impacts' of the shark as opposed to the shark itself". Researchers, for example, Thomas Schatz portrayed how "Jaws" merges different classes while basically being an activity film and a spine chiller. Most is taken from loathsomeness, with the center of a nature-based beast motion picture while including components of a slasher film. The second half gives a pal film in the collaboration between the team of the "Orca", and an otherworldly loathsomeness dependent on the shark's portrayal of an about Satanic threat. Ian Freer depicts "Jaws" as an oceanic beast motion picture, refering to the impact of prior beast movies, for example, "Lord Kong" and "Godzilla". Charles Derry, in 1977, additionally looked at "Jaws" to "Godzilla"; and Spielberg refered to "Godzilla, King of the Monsters!" (1956) as a developmental impact growing up, due to the "mind blowing" manner by which "it influenced you to trust it was truly occurring."
