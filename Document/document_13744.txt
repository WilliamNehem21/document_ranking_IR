In JanuaryÃÂ 1987, the Santee City Council casted a ballot to start an investigation of a progressively northern course, despite the fact that nearby inhabitants and laborers questioned this would defer development. In March, the examination, done by BSI Inc., bolstered the Caltrans choice to surrender plans for the northern way because of the expanded expense from the "precipitous, undeveloped" territory. The gathering casted a ballot to help a southern arrangement through the town, with both the Prospect Avenue and San Diego River choices still feasible. Around the same time, the city hall leader of La Mesa, Fred Nagel, began an appeal drive supporting the expansion of the turnpike because of the repetitive traffic on I-8. The Caltrans ecological effect report showed that the Prospect Avenue course would cost $89ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars), contrasted with the stream course's $121ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars). The city gathering of El Cajon freely upheld the Prospect Avenue directing; in any case, a few representatives of the City of Santee, including some city organizers and specialists, were worried that parts of the report were "obsolete." The petitions were given to the CTC in May, when San Diego authorities made a few contentions in help of the development.
