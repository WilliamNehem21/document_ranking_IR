In 1868, Proctor was worked as an organization town amidst the timber required for the tannery (Barbours had at first been considered for the site). The second town on Plunketts Creek was initially named "Proctorville" for Thomas E. Delegate of Boston, who created cowhide for the soles of shoes there. Delegate was conveyed to the region by William Stone of Standing Stone Township in Bradford County, who realized the zone was "one immense tract of hemlock timber". The Proctor tannery utilized "a few hundred" at wages between 50 pennies and $1.75 every day, the representatives living in one hundred twenty organization houses, each leasing for $2 per month. Hemlock bark, utilized in the tanning procedure, was pulled to the tannery from up to 8ÃÂ miles (13ÃÂ km) away in both summer and winter, utilizing wagons and sleds. The shrouds which were tanned to make calfskin originated from the United States, and as far away as Mexico, Argentina, and China. In 1892, Proctor had a hairstyling salon, two metal forgers, stogie stand, I.O.O.F corridor, cowhide shop, news stand, a mail station (set up in 1885), a two-room school, two stores, and a wagon shop. Completed sole cowhide was pulled by steed drawn wagon south about 8ÃÂ miles (13ÃÂ km) to Little Bear Creek, where it was traded for "green" covers up and different supplies brought north from Montoursville.
