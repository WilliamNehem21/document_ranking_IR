Current authors regularly think about Black's job in a greater number of terms than only endeavoring to even out. Rowson composes that "Dark endeavoring to 'balance' is faulty. I think it has restricted application to a couple of openings, instead of being an opening solution for Black as a rule." Evans composed that after one of his recreations against Fischer, "Fischer trusted his 'mystery' to me: in contrast to different experts, he looked to win with the Black pieces from the begin. The disclosure that Black has dynamic shots and need not be happy with minor fairness was the defining moment in his vocation, he said." Likewise, Watson construed that Kasparov, when playing Black, sidesteps the subject of whether White has an opening preferred standpoint "by speculation regarding the solid idea of the dynamic irregularity on the board, and trying to catch the activity at whatever point conceivable". Watson sees that "enthusiastic opening play by Black may ... lead to a position so mind boggling and hazy that to talk about fairness is good for nothing. Once in a while we state 'powerfully adjusted' rather than 'square with' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to rise up out of complexities with preference. This style of opening play has turned out to be common in present day chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most obvious specialists."
