Sweet Nothing in my Ear is a play in two acts for 4 men, 5 women, and 1 boy. "This is not a "deaf" play. It's a play with deaf and hearing characters. In performance, it must be accessible to both a deaf and hearing audience at the same time. It requires a seamless blend of American Sign Language and spoken English. The two happen simultaneously through the performance of the play. The role of Dan requires a hearing actor who signs well. As a hearing man in a deaf family, he is called upon to interpret speech into sign language, "voice" ASL into speech, or switch his voice off completely and purely sign. Whenever Dan is alone with any member of his deaf family, he would only sign and not use his voice (unless indicated). All the deaf characters of the play - Laura, Max, Sally, Adam, Dr. Walters - use only American Sign Language. They are simultaneously "voiced" or "voice acted" from the side of the stage by a member of the company. When Dan switches off his voice and purely signs, he is simultaneously "voiced" by a company member. The company must be four hearing actors who sign. They sit on the periphery of the stage, never leaving, throughout the play. They perform three functions: to "voice" the actors who sign, to sign the actors who speak and to step forward as the supporting players. Deaf audience member experience this play signed entirely in their language. Hearing audience members - most who know nothing about sign language - have the experience of watching the play in sign language while hearing it acted at the same time. Two languages become one." - Stephen Sachs
