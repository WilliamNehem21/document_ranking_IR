Waugh chipped away at the Pinfold tale discontinuously amid the following two years. After his arrival from Jamaica he put the book aside, limiting his composition to reporting and incidental introductionsÃ¢ÂÂ"slick minimal abstract employments". There is no notice of "Pinfold" in his journal or in letters. Waugh's biographer Martin Stannard portrays Waugh as of now as physically lethargic, unfit to tackle his still extensive mental energiesÃ¢ÂÂthe journal section for 12 July 1955 notes the example of his days: "the morning post, the paper, the crossword, gin". Waugh's longstanding quarrel with the Beaverbrook press engrossed him, especially after an excluded visit to Piers Court by the "Day by day Express" columnist Nancy Spain in June, that left Waugh "tremulous with anger". In March 1956 Spain assaulted Waugh in an "Express" article, after which he started a defamation activity against her and her paper. In the interim, arrangements for his little girl Teresa's turning out ball gave a further prevention to advance on the novel. It isn't until 11 September 1956 that his journal records: "I have continued work on "Pinfold"". Before long, he was composing 1,000 words every dayÃ¢ÂÂon 26 September he told his companion Ann Fleming that "the distraught book will be entertaining I accept". After seven days he approached his companion Daphne Fielding for authorization to devote the book to her.
