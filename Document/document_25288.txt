The Kylfings have also been identified with the Votic people. Carl Christian Rafn, Edgar V. Saks, B. Briem and SigurÃ°ur Nordal have proposed Kylfings to have been the Norse name for the Votes. The reason is that the ethnonym "Vadja(laiset)" can be associated with the word "vadja" (modern Estonian "vai"') which means "stake", "wedge" or "staff", which corresponds to Old Norse "kolfr". "Vadjalaiset" would consequently be translated into Old East Norse as "kolfingar", which in Old West Norse (Old Icelandic) would be umlauted as "kylfingar". Whereas some native names were Scandinavized, as "Rostov" into "RÃ¡Ã°stofa", the Norse learned of the meaning of other names and translated them, which they did at Volkhov, and in the case of some of the Dniepr rapids. The theory that the Kylfings were Votes has been opposed by Max Vasmer and Stender-Petersen, whereas Holm finds it likely. Holm considers it apparent that the Varangians and the Finnic tribes were able to cooperate well, and he points to the relative ease and stability with which Finland was later integrated as a part of the Swedish kingdom. Jorma Koivulehto, a Finnish linguist, disagrees with the Vote theory and maintains that the Votic name or any other Finnic ethnonym is not etymologically connected with the name Kylfingar.
