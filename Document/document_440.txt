A post-Norman Conquest convention, starting with Goscelin, gives Deusdedit's unique name as "Frithona", potentially a debasement of Frithuwine. He was blessed by Ithamar, Bishop of Rochester, on 26 March or maybe 12ÃÂ March 655. He was the 6th diocese supervisor after the entry of the Gregorian evangelists, and the first to be a local of the island of Great Britain instead of an Italian, having been brought into the world a West Saxon. One explanation behind the significant lot between the Christianization of the Kentish kingdom from Anglo-Saxon agnosticism in around 600 and the arrangement of the main local diocese supervisor may have been the requirement for the schools built up by the Gregorian preachers to instruct the locals to an adequately exclusive expectation for them to take religious office. Deusdedit likely owed his arrangement to the see of Canterbury to a coordinated effort between Eorcenberht of Kent and Cenwalh of Wessex. The name Deusdedit signifies "God has given" in Latin, and had been the name of an ongoing pope, Deusdedit, in office from 615 to 618; it was the act of a significant number of the early medieval Saxon religious administrators to take an embraced name, frequently from later ecclesiastical names. It is vague when Deusdedit received his new name, in spite of the fact that the history specialist Richard Sharpe thinks of it as liable to have been the point at which he was blessed as a diocese supervisor, as opposed to when he entered religious life.
