St Helen's Church has a most extreme length of and is adjusted at 25ÃÂ° north of east. Most of English places of worship include an arrangement inside a couple of degrees of east, so this is an extraordinarily vast deviation from the standard. The sandstone church has an expansive, principally fifteenth century west pinnacle bolstered by corner supports and finished with bulwarks and zeniths. The pinnacle has a four-light window and west entryway, and contains a winding stairway to the chime and clock chambers and the rooftop. The chancel is appended by the previous north house of prayer (presently the vestry) on one side and the Hastings Chapel, set transept-wise on the other; it has three sedilia and a piscina on its northern divider. The nave is essentially more extensive than it is long, and has four inlets with medieval internal north and south walkways and nineteenth century external paths. The Hastings Chapel, chancel and clerestory are troubled, and the previous north house of prayer is English Perpendicular, with a window of a similar style. The wharfs in the nave were redesigned in the fifteenth century, and have chiseled boards, as do a portion of the curves. This component is of an irregular style and is likewise observed at Sherborne Abbey in Dorset and at St Peter and St Paul, Syston, Leicestershire.
