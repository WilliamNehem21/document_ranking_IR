Eggs are laid from early May to mid-June and chicks fledge between mid-June and July, in spite of the fact that the laying date is getting later in light of environmental change. At the point when the eggs are laid is impacted by scope, age of the female, and wing length of the female, which enables it to rummage all the more effectively. By and large, feathered creatures in the southern piece of the rearing reach breed sooner than those in the northern bit. The female's wing length and age are both conversely corresponded with the planning of reproducing. It for the most part lays when the temperature and the wealth of nourishment (that the female can get) are adequate for females to begin laying eggs. These perceptions bolster the hypothesis that the tree swallow is a salary raiser (reproducing dependent on sustenance conditions amid the laying season). This species is commonly socially monogamous, yet up to 8% of rearing guys are polygynous. Polygyny is affected by an area: guys having domains with nestboxes in any event separated are bound to be polygynous. It is proposed that this polygyny relies upon the conditions amid the laying season: better conditions, for example, a wealth of sustenance, permit females in polygyny who don't get help in scrounging to lay more eggs.
