The upper jaw of "T. sethi" was essentially made out of premaxillae and maxillae; the suture which framed the fringe between these bones isn't unmistakable. As in all individuals from its clade, the jaws were edentulous (toothless). The platform (nose) was long from the tip of the premaxilla to the joint where the quadrate bone of the skull associated with the articular bone of the lower jaw. The front of the premaxillae had sharp upper and lower edges, one of a kind to this animal groups. As in related genera, the nasoantorbital fenestra was relatively huge; it was long and high, which was 71 percent of the skull length (barring the peak). The lacrimal bone, which isolated the circle from the nasoantorbital fenestra, was vertically prolonged and higher than the upper surface of the circle (as opposed to the condition seen in pterodactyloids with littler nasoantorbital fenestrae). The circle was slim and compacted from front to back contrasted with "Tupuxuara" and tapejarids, however like some of them in being the greater part the tallness of the nasoantorbital fenestra. The circle was situated lower than the upper edge of the nasoantorbital fenestra, and along these lines low on the skull. In spite of the fact that the bones circumscribing the lower worldly fenestra (an opening behind the circle) were deficient, it seems to have been stretched and cut like (as in "Tupuxuara" and "Tapejara").
