Veldmeijer and colleagues assigned the front part of a mandible collected from the same formation to "T. sethi" in 2005. They concluded that although the two specimens differed in several details, the differences were not significant enough to base a new species on the mandible, and that the new specimen filled in the gap of Kellner and Campos' "T. sethi" skull reconstruction. Palaeontologists Jaime A. Headden and Herbert B. N. Campos coined the new binomial "Banguela oberlii", based on their reinterpretation of the jaw tip as belonging to a toothless member of the family Dsungaripteridae, in 2014. The generic name is Portuguese for "toothless" and the specific name honours private collector Urs Oberli, who had donated the specimen to the Naturmuseum St. Gallen (where it is catalogued as NMSG SAO 25109). Headden and Campos interpreted the tip of "T. sethi" lower jaw as downturned; this and other features distinguished it from "Banguela". In their 2018 re-description of the further-prepared "T. sethi" holotype skull, palaeontologists Rodrigo V. PÃªgas, Fabiana R. Costa, and Kellner assigned "B. oberlii" back to "Thalassodromeus" while recognising it as a distinct species, and thereby created the new combination "T. oberlii". PÃªgas and colleagues also rejected the theory that the lower jaw of "T. sethi" was downturned, and reinterpreted the frontmost piece of the lower jaw to have connected directly with the subsequent piece (with no gap).
