Equipped with Sopwith Camel fighters, No.Â 4 Squadron deployed to Bruay, France, in December 1917, and commenced operations on 9Â January 1918. That same day Malley, nicknamed "Garnie" (or "George", by No.Â 4 Squadron's leading ace, Harry Cobby), was promoted lieutenant. On 16Â March, he achieved his first aerial victory, sending a fighter belonging to Manfred von Richthofen's Red Circus out of control above Annoeullin, near Douai. Early reports identified the German plane as an Albatros, but later sources record it as a Pfalz D.III. Malley claimed two Albatroses on 23Â March 1918, during an attack on German positions in Vaulx-Vraucourt, near Bapaume. Three days later he was promoted captain and appointed a flight commander.
The official history of Australia in the war credits Malley with the destruction of a Pfalz over Wytschaete on 10Â May, though it does not appear in other accounts of his final tally. Four days later, he and Lieutenant Roy King each claimed a German two-seater spotting for artillery between Ypres and Bailleul. On 30Â May, Malley and Cobby led their flights on a bombing mission in the Lys region, after which they each destroyed a German observation balloon over Estaires. Malley's final victory, over the Lys on 1Â June, was a Pfalz D.III. His official tally was six German aircraft destroyedâfour fighters, an observation balloon, and an unidentified observation planeâand he was wounded in action twice, by a bullet through the leg in March, and by shrapnel from anti-aircraft fire in May. He was awarded the Military Cross on 22Â June. The citation was promulgated in "The London Gazette":
