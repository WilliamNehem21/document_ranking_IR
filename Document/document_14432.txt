In March 1829 structure a branch railroad line from the Oldfield Road end in Salford to the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway was mooted, however nothing was manufactured. In 1830 the waterway organization, driven by executive Sir John Tobin, started to elevate a proposition to assemble a railroad along the line of the channel, from Salford to Bolton. Alexander Nimmo was utilized to provide details regarding the proposition and told that it was conceivable "so far as he conveyed what needs be fit for making a decision from his present careless perspective on the channel". The investors at that point looked for a bill for a railroad from Bolton to Manchester and on 23 August 1831 got an Act of Parliament to turn into the "Organization of Proprietors of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company". They were enabled to manufacture a line from Manchester to Bolton and Bury, "upon or close to the line ofÃÂ ...ÃÂ the Canal", and a branch from Clifton Aqueduct through to Great Lever. In 1832 this organization acquired an Act that enabled it to assemble the railroad. Due for the most part to the protests of nearby mine proprietors who might have lost access to the waterway and supplies, and would not have had branch railroads worked for them, the organization consented to a changing bill which would keep the channel and enable the new rail route to be built close by it. Because of specialized and budgetary requirements the branch to Bury was never manufactured. The trench along these lines endure, despite the fact that secures 4 and 5 Salford were moved and joined into a two-ascent staircase, with a second passage worked underneath the line which wound up known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway.
