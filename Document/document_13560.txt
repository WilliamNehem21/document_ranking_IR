Religious establishments were once bounteous in Dorset, yet all stopped to exist at the Dissolution. The Reformation and the political and religious disturbance that resulted to a great extent checked the structure of new holy places until the turn of the eighteenth century. Eminent instances of Early Georgian holy places incorporate the Bastard siblings' Church of St. Dwindle and St. Paul in Blandford Forum, and St George's Church on the Isle of Portland, which has a steeple and tower enlivened by crafted by Christopher Wren. From the late eighteenth century onwards, holy places in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style. An eminent exemption to this pattern, in any case, is the Church of St Mary in East LulworthÃ¢ÂÂthe principal unsupported Roman Catholic church worked in England after the Reformation. George III offered consent to erect the structure relying on the prerequisite that it looked like a greenery enclosure tomb as opposed to a congregation. It was finished in 1789. Bournemouth, established in 1810, has an abundance of nineteenth century chapels including St Peter's and St Stephen's. St Dunstan's Church (once in the past St Osmund's) in Poole is one of few twentieth century places of worship in Dorset. The last significant work of Edward Schroeder Prior, it is one of the last instances of the Neo Byzantine style. The Church of St Nicholas and St Magnus in Moreton is noted for its expound engraved glass windows planned by Laurence Whistler. Seriously harmed by a stray German bomb in 1940, the congregation accordingly experienced broad redesign and Whistler had supplanted each window by 1984.
