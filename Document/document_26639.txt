"The Raft of the Medusa" was first shown at the 1819 Paris Salon, under the title "ScÃ¨ne de Naufrage" ("Shipwreck Scene"), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers. The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. GÃ©ricault's canvas was the star at the exhibition: "It strikes and attracts all eyes" ("Le Journal de Paris"). Louis XVIII visited three days before the opening and said: """", or "Monsieur GÃ©ricault, you've painted a shipwreck, but it's not one for you". The critics were divided: the horror and "terribilitÃ " of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a "pile of corpses", whose realism they considered a far cry from the "ideal beauty" represented by Girodet's "Pygmalion and Galatea", which triumphed the same year. GÃ©ricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of GÃ©ricault, provided one answer: "Monsieur GÃ©ricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel." The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal, who praised its political theme, its liberal positionâits advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalismâand its modernity. The historian Jules Michelet approved: "our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa".
