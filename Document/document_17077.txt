Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and her sisters. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" first went to Hamburg, where her crew was reduced on 5 March. She was moved to Kiel on 30 April, where the rest of her crew were removed. She was disarmed and thereafter used as a depot ship. The following year, the ship was used as a torpedo target ship. In November 1918, Germany surrendered and signed the Armistice at CompiÃ¨gne that ended the fighting. According to of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, that formally ended the war, Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the ""Deutschland" or types". On 6 December 1919, the vessel was struck from the naval list and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Berlin. The following year, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was broken up for scrap metal in Kiel-Nordmole.
