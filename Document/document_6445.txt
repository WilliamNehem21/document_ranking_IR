The Director of Naval Construction started primer plan work even before the ship was acquired and presented a framework structure on 8ÃÂ February 1918. This plan had a full-length flight deck and its most particular highlights were the two islands isolated by the flight deck. Every island was to be long, containing two channels and a tripod pole. Despite the fact that they were stumbled to make it increasingly troublesome for a foe ship to evaluate the ship's course, they were to be associated with one another with substantial propping. The extension was to be mounted over this supporting which left an unmistakable stature of for the air ship on the flight deck. There was to be a wide space between the islands where the air ship were to be amassed before taking off. Air ship would be transported between the shelter and the flight deck by two flying machine (lifts). A crane was to be situated at the toward the back end of every island to lift flying machine on board and to recuperate seaplanes. Mass oil stockpiling comprised of in tins stowed on the forecastle deck and secured by plating. Two prepared use tanks close to the islands would permit flying machine on the flight deck to refuel. The ship's arranged combat hardware comprised of nine 6-inch weapons and four enemy of air ship firearms mounted on the stage between the islands. "Hawk" held the war vessel's blend of coal and fuel oil, however the amounts were expanded to of coal and of oil, as the forward and back 14-inch magazines and shell rooms were changed over to be utilized as oil tanks.
