On 28 October, Baker was credited with the demolition of a further three German flying machine from two separate watches into Belgium that day. Amid the second journey, he brought one Fokker down crazy, before shooting the other down over Ath. He was airborne again on a hostile watch the following day. Fifteen Snipes from No.ÃÂ 4 Squadron were nitty gritty for the watch, and as the gathering gravitated toward Tournai they experienced roughly 60 Fokker planes effectively connected with a few British air ship. Bread cook drove five of the Snipes into the strike, however perplexity ruled for a few minutes before the men could pick up their heading in the battle. Pastry specialist assaulted two Fokkers that had been seeking after another Snipe, and had the capacity to crush one of the flying machine. On 30 October, "impressive action" was seen at the German aerodrome in Rebaix, and an arrangement of flying machine from No.ÃÂ 2 Squadron were definite to bomb the region; an escort of eleven SnipesÃ¢ÂÂincluding BakerÃ¢ÂÂfrom No.ÃÂ 4 Squadron was given. As the bombarding was occurring, a few Fokker airplane showed up and were caught by the Snipes. In the following fight, Baker fundamentally harmed one of the Fokkers, bringing about the air ship dropping towards the ground tail-first on its back. The Fokker turned out to be Baker's twelfth, and last, elevated triumph of the war; he had scored his last five triumphs in a time of three days.
