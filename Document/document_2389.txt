The program necessitates that the turn around of the dollar delineate another plan each year. So as to figure out which configuration to delineate on the coins, authorities from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Native American Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the counseling associations for the program, name a contact to the United States Mint. Somewhere in the range of twelve and fifteen subjects are chosen after interview with the National Museum of the American Indian and the Smithsonian Institution. Now, the counseling associations supply the Mint with composed remarks in regards to the topics. The proposals are then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a topic is prescribed. In the wake of evaluating the suggestions and contribution from the contributing associations, the chose subject is concluded, so, all things considered plans are delivered that speak to the topic. When structures are made, the counseling associations and the National Museum of the Native American are counseled, and the plans are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for endorsement. In light all things considered and suggestions got, the Mint chooses a last structure that is prescribed to the Secretary of the Treasury for endorsement.
