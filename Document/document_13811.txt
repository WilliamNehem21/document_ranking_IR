The tradition at that point continued to think about a constitution for Virginia's administration. Henry was delegated to a board under the authority of Archibald Cary. A great part of the work tumbled to the last representative to the board of trustees, George Mason of Fairfax County, who did not land in Williamsburg until May 18, postponed by disease. Bricklayer originally drafted a Declaration of Rights; it was talked about in the Cary Committee on May 25. Artisan's draft, more than the last announcement, would be very compelling, utilized by Jefferson recorded as a hard copy the Declaration of Independence, and by authors of numerous eighteenth and nineteenth century state constitutions. At the point when the draft was discussed, Henry, in line with a youthful agent from Orange County, James Madison, created a correction changing Mason's call for religious resilience to one requiring full opportunity of love. This was viewed as a risk to Virginia's set up religion, Anglicanism, and did not pass. Madison adjusted it and had another agent present it, likely Edmund Randolph, and it passed. Bricklayer's draft required a restriction on bills of attainder. Henry got it expelled by telling the agents that some high wrongdoer may be come to by no different methods. The tradition endorsed the Declaration of Rights on June 12.
