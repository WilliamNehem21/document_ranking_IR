This was much more extensive than her earlier refit as all of her boilers were replaced or overhauled: she received six oil-fired du Temple boilers that had been built for the scrapped battleship "Normandie" and sixteen coal-fired boilers from "Normandie"s sister "Flandre". The ship was only able to reach at a displacement of during her sea trials afterwards. "Courbet"s fire-control systems were comprehensively upgraded with the installation of a Saint-Chamond-Granat system in a director-control tower (DCT) on the top of the tripod mast and all of her original rangefinders were replaced with the exception of the rangefinders in each turret. The DCT was fitted with a 4.57-metre coincidence rangefinder and a stereo rangefinder was added to the DCT to measure the distance between the target and shell splashes. Additional 4.57-metre rangefinders were added in a duplex mounting atop the conning tower and another at the base of the mainmast. The Barr & Stroud 7.6-metre instrument was removed and a traversable rangefinder was fitted to the roof of the forward superfiring turret. Directors with 2-metre rangefinders were also added to control the secondary guns. The ship's Mle 1918 AA guns were exchanged for seven Canon de 75 mm modÃ¨le 1922 guns and they were provided with a pair of high-angle rangefinders, one on top of the duplex unit on the conning tower and one in the aft superstructure.
