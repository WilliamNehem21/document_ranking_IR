These contentions are exhibited by the differing loyalties of the primary characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's demise that Estraven served humankind in general, similarly as Ai did. Amid the fringe debate with Orgoreyn, Estraven attempts to end the question by moving Karhidish ranchers out of the debated region. Estraven trusts that by averting war he was sparing Karhidish lives and being faithful to his nation, while King Argaven considers it to be a double-crossing. Toward the finish of the novel Ai considers his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels clashed at the same time since he had guaranteed Estraven that he would demonstrate Estraven's innocence before calling his ship down. His choice is a case of Le Guin's depiction of dedication and selling out as reciprocal instead of opposing, in light of the fact that in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was satisfying the bigger reason that he imparted to Estraven. Donna White composed that a large number of Le Guin's books delineate a battle between close to home loyalties and open obligations, best exemplified in "The Left Hand of Darkness", where Ai is bound by an individual attach to Estraven, yet should subordinate that to his main goal for the Ekumen and mankind.
