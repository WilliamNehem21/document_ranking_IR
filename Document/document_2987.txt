Jocelin and his family presumably originated from the south-east of Scotland. The names of neither his dad nor his mom are known, however he had two known siblings, with the names Helia and Henry, and a cousin, additionally called Helia. The names recommend that his family were of French, or if nothing else Anglo-Norman cause, instead of being a Scot or local Anglo-Saxon. There are a few signs that his family held land in South Lanarkshire, specifically on the grounds that they appear to have had rights in the congregation of Dunsyre. It is impossible that he would have thought of himself as "Scottish". For Jocelin's contemporary and individual local of the Borders, Adam of Dryburgh, this piece of Britain was still solidly viewed as "land Anglorum" (the "Place where there is English"), in spite of the fact that it was situated inside the "regnum Scottorum" (the "Kingdom of the Scots"). This would be no deterrent to Jocelin, notwithstanding. His Anglo-French social foundation was in certainty most likely essential for the support of the King of Scots. As Walter of Coventry composed of King William's time, "the cutting edge rulers of Scotland consider themselves Frenchmen, in race, habits, language and culture; they keep just Frenchmen in their family and following, and have decreased the Scots to absolute bondage".
