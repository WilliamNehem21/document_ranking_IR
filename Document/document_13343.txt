In the "chest eat" scene, Dr. Copper endeavors to resuscitate Norris with a defibrillator. Uncovering himself as the Thing, Norris-Thing's chest changes into an expansive mouth that separates Copper's arms. Bottin achieved this scene by enrolling a twofold amputee and fitting him with prosthetic arms loaded up with wax bones, elastic veins and Jell-O. The arms were then set into the viable stomach mouth where the mechanical jaws clipped down on them, so, all things considered the performing artist pulled away, separating the bogus arms. The impact of the Norris-Thing's head isolating from the body to spare itself took numerous long periods of testing before Bottin was sufficiently fulfilled to film it. The scene included a flame impact, however the team were ignorant that exhaust from the elastic froth synthetics inside the manikin were combustible. The flame touched off the exhaust, making a huge fireball that inundated the manikin. It endured just insignificant harm after the flame had been put out, and the team effectively recorded the scene. Stop-movement master Randall William Cook built up a grouping for the finish of the film where MacReady is gone up against by the massive Blair-Thing. Cook made a smaller than usual model of the set and recorded wide-edge shots of the beast in stop movement, yet Carpenter was not persuaded by the impact and utilized just a couple of moments of it. It took 50 individuals to work the genuine Blair-Thing manikin.
