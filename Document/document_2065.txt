In 1849, the Royal Society of Arts chose to arrange a review display of Etty's work, the first since the minor York show of 1836. Etty concurred just on condition that every one of the nine of his substantial works were incorporated. The three "Joan of Arc" artistic creations were in London and effectively open, and the Royal Scottish Academy was cheerful to loan "The Combat", "Benaiah" and the "Judith" triptych, however the Royal Manchester Institution was profoundly hesitant to loan "The Sirens and Ulysses" in light of worries that moving it would harm the delicate paintwork further. They were in the end influenced to loan the piece after Etty and a portion of his companions visited Manchester to actually demand they discharge it. The presentation proceeded from 9ÃÂ June to 25ÃÂ August 1849, uniting 133 Etty works of art out of the blue; Etty trusted that it would raise open familiarity with his capacities, keeping in touch with his companion Rev. Isaac Spencer "Please God, I will give them a sample of my quality". The show was generally welcomed and very much visited; even Etty's old enemies at the "Morning Chronicle" suggesting that perusers "lose no time in visiting this accumulation". It was a monetary calamity for the Royal Society of Arts, looked with the expense of transporting vast quantities of sensitive craftsmanships from around the nation.
