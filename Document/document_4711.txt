On 13 January 1907, "Connecticut" ran onto a reef while entering the harbor at Culebra Island. The Navy did not discharge any data about the establishing until press dispatches from San Juan, conveying updates on the episode achieved the terrain on 23 January. And still, at the end of the day, Navy experts in San Juan professed to be unmindful of the circumstance, and, that equivalent day, the Navy Department itself said that they just realized that Captain Swift idea she had contacted base and that an examination of the ship's base by jumpers had uncovered no harm. The Navy changed this the following day, discharging an explanation that "Connecticut" had been just somewhat harmed and had come back to her squeeze journey. Notwithstanding, harm to the ship was substantially more genuine than the Navy conceded; as opposed to an official articulation saying that "Connecticut" had just "contacted" the stones, she really had run full upon the reef while crossing "a course all around set apart with floats" "visible to everyone" and did what's necessary harm to presumably require a dry docking. This evident endeavor at a concealment was sufficient for the United States Congress to think about an official investigation into the issue.
