The social history specialist James Hammerton characterizes "Pooterism" as "the reliant shortcoming and expanded social demand of clerical laborers, built in the working environment yet communicated similarly as capably at home". Jon Wilde of "The Guardian" watches this trademark in various British TV satire manifestations of the late twentieth and mid 21st hundreds of years: Captain Mainwaring, Victor Meldrew, and "Peep Show"s Mark Corrigan are largely instances of characters "whose blinkered perspective on themselves is perpetually in sharp differentiation to how they are seen by the world". Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was an allegory for lower working class claim, pretentiousness and pomposity, set up for joke by the "elites". Be that as it may, by the mid-twentieth century changes in the impression of manly jobs in lower white collar class society had smothered the joke, as men progressively grasped family life. Hammerton comments that the Grossmiths "would doubtlessly value the incongruity in observing highlights of the lower white collar class presence they derided so pitilessly turning into the more widespread model for twentieth century family life". Bailey comments on how the writer John Betjeman displayed the Pooters "not as objects of criticism but rather of jealousy, cozy and secure in their rural retreat".
