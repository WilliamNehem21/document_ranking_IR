Willis subjectively wouldn't print crafted by his sister Sara Willis ("Fanny Fern") after 1854, however she recently had contributed mysterious book audits to the "Home Journal". She had as of late been bereaved, ended up desperate, and was openly impugned by her harsh second spouse. Censuring what he saw as her eagerness, Willis once made her the subject of his lyric "To My Wild Sis". As Fanny Fern, she had distributed "Greenery Leaves", which sold more than 100,000 duplicates the prior year. Willis, be that as it may, did not energize his sister's compositions. "You overstrain the pitiful, and your cleverness keeps running into awful foulness sometimesÃÂ ... I am sorry that any editorial manager realizes that a sister of mine thought of a portion of these which you sent me", he composed. In 1854 she distributed "Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present Time", a scarcely disguised semi-self-portraying record of her own challenges in the abstract world. Nathaniel Willis was spoken to as "Hyacinth Ellet", a feminine, self-serving manager who plans to demolish his sister's prospects as an essayist. Willis did not freely dissent but rather in private he affirmed that, in spite of his invented equal, he had done his best to help his sister amid her troublesome occasions, particularly after the passing of her first spouse.
