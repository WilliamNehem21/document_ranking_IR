Preliminaries proceeded into 1894, and keeping in mind that directing constrained draft tests in Strander Bucht on 16 February 1894, the ship endured the most noticeably awful hardware mishap in the historical backdrop of the "Kaiserliche Marine". One of the fundamental steam valves from the starboard boilers detonated, slaughtering forty-four men in the engine compartment and harming another seven. The reason for the blast was a deformity in the development of the valve. Ruler Henry, on board the close-by transport dispatch "Pelikan", promptly requested the ship to come to "Brandenburg"s help, and removed the dead and injured men. "Brandenburg" at that point put into Wiker Bucht, and was later towed to Kiel, where she entered the "Kaiserliche Werft" (Imperial Shipyard) for fixes. The mishap caused a minor political episode after the press scrutinized Wilhelm II for neglecting to send Prince Henry to the memorial services for the mariners. Also, "Vizeadmiral" Friedrich von Hollmann, the State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt" (Imperial Naval Office) expressed before the "Reichstag" (Imperial Diet) that "such mishaps could happen over and over", which expanded parliamentary protection from further increments in maritime spending plans; this prompted an underlying dismissal of assets for the main defensively covered cruiser, . Chiefs of naval operations Eduard von Knorr and Hans von Koester censured the remark, compelling Hollmann to openly apologize.
