The hit "Far and wide", which harkens back to the Chili Peppers' funk-affected sound, was built by Frusciante at his home. The cadence and beat, in any case, are multifaceted; this expected him to play the melody with the remainder of the band as opposed to alone for them to get it. The bass lick was formed in "perhaps 15 minutes," as indicated by Frusciante: "Bug is the best bass player on the planet. His feeling of timing and the manner in which he supposes is so insane." The title track of the collection was among the most troublesome for the band to finish. Frusciante felt constrained to compose a suitable guitar group that would fittingly supplement the impactful melodious substance, yet experienced trouble. The tune was scarcely gaining ground, and would have been rejected had it not been for Kiedis' criticalness to incorporate it on the collection. Frusciante finished the last riff two days before account, in the wake of illustration motivation from The Cure's soundtrack tune to "Gore Visors". The title track was expected to speak to Californian ways of life and, all the more explicitly, the "phony" nature which is related with quite a bit of Hollywood. It references Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and utilizations impressive symbolism to catch the suggestive idea of California.
