John Harold Wilson contends that the broadly virile stage nearness of Hart as Horner must be considered when deciphering the play. As embodied by Hart, Horner will have won ladies less through astute cunning but rather more "as it was done in the good 'ol days", by being "hazardously appealing", and it is just tricks like Sir Jaspar Fidget who truly trust him innocuous. Harcourt/Kynaston, in spite of the fact that by 1675 an all around respected and skilful on-screen character of male jobs, would obviously have been dominated by Horner/Hart. The on-screen characters related with every saint should likewise have would in general make the Horner plot more striking on the phase than the intimate romance plot. Horner's essential courtesan Lady Fidget, representative for "the temperate group" of furtively eager for sex town spouses, was played by the dynamic Elizabeth Knepp, who Samuel Pepys pronounced "the most astounding, frantic humored thing, and sings the noblest I've at any point heard", gifts that the renowned savoring scene Horner's hotel appears to be intended to do equity to. On the other hand, the decision of the bit-part on-screen character Elizabeth James as Alithea would have de-underlined the Harcourt-Alithea plot. Such recorded contemplations have made present day pundits distrustful of Norman Holland's great 1959 "right way/incorrect way" understanding of the play, which positions the genuine romance plot as the most essential one.
