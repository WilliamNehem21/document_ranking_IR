Expansion of a content can successfully change the automatic purpose of a structure, likewise with the two choral orchestras of Franz Liszt. Both the "Faust" and "Dante" orchestras were considered as absolutely instrumental works and just later ended up choral ensembles. In any case, while Liszt specialist Humphrey Searle states that Liszt's later incorporation of a melody successfully totals up "Faust" and makes it complete, another Liszt master, Reeves Shulstad, proposes that Liszt changed the work's sensational concentration to the point of justifying an alternate translation of the work itself. As indicated by Shulstad, "Liszt's unique form of 1854 finished with a last short lived reference to Gretchen and a ... instrumental discourse in C major, in light of the most lofty of subjects from the opening development. One may state that this end stays inside the persona of Faust and his creative energy". At the point when Liszt reexamined the piece three years after the fact, he included a "Tune mysticus", the male theme singing the last words from Goethe's "Faust". The tenor soloist, joined by the melody, sings the last two lines of the content. "With the expansion of the 'Ensemble Mysticus' content", Shulstad states, "the Gretchen subject has been changed and she never again shows up as a covered Faust. With this immediate relationship to the last scene of the dramatization we have gotten away from Faust's imaginings and are hearing another voice remarking on his endeavoring and reclamation".
