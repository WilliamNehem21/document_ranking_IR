While seeking after her graduate degree, Vidya was given a role as the female lead in the Malayalam film "Chakram", inverse Mohanlal and was in this manner marked on for 12 other Malayalam language films. Notwithstanding, because of generation troubles, "Chakram" was retired. The delay of a film featuring Mohanlal was an unheard event in Malayalam film and makers accused Vidya for bringing "misfortune" to the undertaking; marked her as a "curse"; and supplanted her in the movies that she had been contracted for. She moved concentration to Tamil film. In 2001, she was given a role as the female lead in N. Linguswamy's "Run" (2002). In any case, subsequent to finishing the main shooting plan, she was unceremoniously dropped and supplanted by Meera Jasmine. She was joined under misrepresentations for a sex satire, a classification she was awkward with, and chose to leave the task. From that point, she marked on for a third Tamil movie, "Manasellam" (2003), however was supplanted by Trisha as the chief was disappointed with her work. "Kalari Vikraman", another Malayalam film that she finished work for in 2003, neglected to get a dramatic discharge. In the wake of neglecting to begin a movie vocation, Vidya showed up in around 60 TV advertisements and in music recordings for Euphoria and Shubha Mudgal; a larger part of these were coordinated by Pradeep Sarkar.
