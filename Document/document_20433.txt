Rilke uses the images of love and of lovers as a way of showing mankind's potential and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes that "Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air." () He depicts "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" and contrasts a feminine form of "sublime love" and a masculine "blind animal passion." At the time the first elegies were written, Rilke often "expressed a longing for human companionship and affection, and then, often immediately afterwards, asking whether he could really respond to such companionship if it were offered to himÂ ..." He notices a "decline in the lives of loversÂ ... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." Later, during World War I, he would lament that "the world has fallen into the hands of men." In the face of death, life and love is not cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unityâthat "the nature of every ultimate loveÂ ... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite."
In a 1923 letter to Nanny von Escher, Rilke confided:
Two inner experiences were necessary for the creation of these books ("The Sonnets to Orpheus" and "The Duino Elegies"). One is the increasingly conscious decision to hold life open to death. The other is the spiritual imperative to present, in this wider context, the transformations of love that are not possible in a narrower circle where Death is simply excluded as The Other.
