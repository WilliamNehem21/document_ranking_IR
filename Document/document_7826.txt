After Cosimo's triumphant come back to Florence, instead of rejecting the undertaking, in May 1436 the Medici routine procured Uccello to supplant the Gaddi and Pesello fresco. Hugh Hudson recommends that it would have been unreasonably dangerous for the Medici to drop the Albizzi venture, so they rather cleverly adjusted it to accommodate their interests. There is, obviously, some shortcoming to crediting the charging and recommissioning of the landmark to Albizzi or Medici interests, as just two (perhaps three) of the eight "operai" on July 13, 1433 were individuals from the Albizzi group and just a single was a Medici when it was continued on May 18, 1436; yet the impacts of the two groups surely did not require blood connection. Around this time, archives bear witness to numerous fixes of a close-by window, opening the likelihood that the first fresco had encountered water harm, and would have should have been reestablished regardless. Others have recommended that the recommissioning was a piece of the "restoring" of the house of God related with its rededication as Santa Maria del Fiore by Pope Eugene IV in March 1436. However, Borsi presumes that "without a doubt under strain from the Medici" the "operai" disposed of their arrangements for a direct rebuilding of the Gaddi fresco and selected a totally new landmark.
