Poulenc was among the composers who recognised in the 1920s the important role that the gramophone would play in the promotion of music. The first recording of his music was made in 1928, with the mezzo-soprano Claire Croiza accompanied by the composer at the piano, in the complete song cycle "La bestiaire" for French Columbia. He made numerous recordings, mainly for the French division of EMI. With Bernac and Duval he recorded many of his own songs, and those of other composers including Chabrier, Debussy, Gounod and Ravel. He played the piano part in recordings of his "Babar the Elephant" with Pierre Fresnay and NoÃ«l Coward as narrators. In 2005, EMI issued a DVD, "Francis Poulenc & Friends", featuring filmed performances of Poulenc's music, played by the composer, with Duval, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Jacques FÃ©vrier and Georges PrÃªtre.
A 1984 discography of Poulenc's music lists recordings by more than 1,300 conductors, soloists and ensembles, including the conductors Leonard Bernstein, Charles Dutoit, Milhaud, Charles Munch, Eugene Ormandy, PrÃªtre, AndrÃ© Previn and Leopold Stokowski. Among the singers, in addition to Bernac and Duval, the list includes RÃ©gine Crespin, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Nicolai Gedda, Peter Pears, Yvonne Printemps and GÃ©rard Souzay. Instrumental soloists include Britten, Jacques FÃ©vrier, Pierre Fournier, Emil Gilels, Yehudi Menuhin and Arthur Rubinstein.
