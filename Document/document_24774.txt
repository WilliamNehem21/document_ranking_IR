For many years QuÃ©let's name and description were treated as valid because Bulliard's name antedated Persoon's. However, in 1950, a change in the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature" (termed the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused only names on fungi published after 1801 or 1821 (depending on their type) to be valid. This meant that suddenly Bulliard's name was no longer a valid name, and now it was Persoon's name that had priority. Nonetheless it was a well-known name, and the already chaotic situation caused by a change to a famous Latin name was further complicated by another of QuÃ©let's suggestions. He had in 1886 proposed a new, broader genus that included all pink-gilled fungi with adnate or sinuate gills and angular spores: "Rhodophyllus". These two approach to genus placement, using either "Rhodophyllus" or "Entoloma", coexisted for many decades, with mycologists and guidebooks following either; Henri Romagnesi, who studied the genus for over forty years, favoured "Rhodophyllus", as initially did Rolf Singer. However, most other authorities have tended to favour "Entoloma", and Singer conceded the name was far more widely used and adopted it for his "Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy" text in 1986.
