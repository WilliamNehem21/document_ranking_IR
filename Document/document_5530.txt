On 28 July 1937, at the night execution, Davidson gave his typical discourse before entering the enclosure in which two lions, Freddie and Toto, were sitting discreetly. At that point, as per Blythe: "in hardly tenable terms, the little minister from Norfolk and the lion showcased the traditional Christian suffering to the full". Observers later revealed that after Davidson had broken his whip and yelled, Freddie ended up upset and thumped Davidson over, before catching him by the neck and running with him around the enclosure. Somner attempted to appease the growling Freddie, who in the long run dropped the oblivious Davidson, empowering her to drag him to wellbeing; he was severely sliced, and had endured a broken bone in his neck. A baseless story coursed that while sitting tight for the emergency vehicle, Davidson asked that the London papers be cautioned in time for following day's first releases. As indicated by some press reports he sat up in medical clinic and approached guests for their impressions of his experience in the pen. Most history specialists of the issue, nonetheless, trust that Davidson never recuperated cognizance. He passed on 30 July, his demise perhaps hurried by an insulin infusion controlled by a specialist who trusted that Davidson was a diabetic. The coroner's decision was passing by misfortune.
