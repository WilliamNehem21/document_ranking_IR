At the point when in 995 Michinaga's two siblings Fujiwara no Michitaka and Fujiwara no Michikane passed on leaving the rule empty, Michinaga rapidly won a power battle against his nephew Fujiwara no Korechika (sibling to Teishi, Emperor IchijÃÂ's better half), and, helped by his sister Senshi, he accepted power. Teishi had bolstered her sibling Korechika, who was later disparaged and ousted from court, making her lose control. After four years Michinaga sent ShÃÂshi, his oldest little girl, to Emperor IchijÃÂ's collection of mistresses when she was around 12. A year subsequent to setting ShÃÂshi in the royal array of mistresses, with an end goal to undermine Teishi's impact and increment ShÃÂshi's standing, Michinaga had her named Empress despite the fact that Teishi effectively held the title. As history specialist Donald Shively clarifies, "Michinaga stunned even his admirers by masterminding the phenomenal arrangement of Teishi (or Sadako) and ShÃÂshi as simultaneous rulers of a similar sovereign, Teishi holding the typical title of "Brilliant Heir-carrier" "kÃÂgÃÂ" and ShÃÂshi that of "Inward Palatine" ("chÃÂ«gÃÂ«"), a toponymically determined equal instituted for the event". Around five years after the fact, Michinaga conveyed Murasaki to ShÃÂshi's court, in a position that Bowring depicts as a sidekick mentor.
