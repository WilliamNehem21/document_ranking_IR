The statement touched off discussion. Andrew Farke had in 2006 focused on that, aside from the lace, no precise contrasts could be found among "Torosaurus" and "Triceratops". He in any case questioned Scannella's decision by belligerence in 2011 that the proposed morphological changes required to "age" a "Triceratops" into a "Torosaurus" would be unprecedented among ceratopsids. Such changes would incorporate the development of extra epoccipitals, inversion of bone surface from a grown-up to juvenile sort and back to grown-up once more, and development of lace openings at a later stage than expected. An examination by Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Field broke down 35 examples of both "Triceratops" and "Torosaurus". The creators reasoned that "Triceratops" people too old to be in any way thought to be youthful structures are spoken to in the fossil record, as may be "Torosaurus" people too youthful to be in any way thought about completely develop grown-ups. The synonymy of "Triceratops" and "Torosaurus" can't be bolstered, they stated, without more persuading middle structures than Scannella and Horner at first created. Scannella's "Triceratops" example with a gap on its ornamentation, they contended, could speak to an ailing or contorted individual as opposed to a transitional stage between a juvenile "Triceratops" and develop "Torosaurus" structure.
