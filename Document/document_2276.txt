Somewhere in the range of 17 and 20 July, "Collingwood" participated in a test activation and armada audit as a feature of the British reaction to the July Crisis. Touching base in Portland on 27 July, she was requested to continue with the remainder of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days after the fact to protect the armada from a conceivable German shock assault. In August 1914, after the episode of World War I, the Home Fleet was redesigned as the Grand Fleet, and set under the order of Admiral John Jellicoe. Its vast majority was quickly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the guards at Scapa were reinforced. On the night of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet led an unproductive range in the southern portion of the North Sea; "Collingwood" remained with the principle body in help of Vice-Admiral David Beatty's first Battlecruiser Squadron. The armada was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The first Battle Squadron traveled north-west of the Shetland Islands and led gunnery practice on 8Ã¢ÂÂ 12 December. After four days, the Grand Fleet sortied amid the German strike on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, yet neglected to reach the High Seas Fleet. "Collingwood" and the remainder of the Grand Fleet led another breadth of the North Sea on 25Ã¢ÂÂ 27 December.
