The Florida landmass showed up above ocean level somewhere in the range of 100,000 and 150,000ÃÂ years prior. As ocean levels ascended toward the finish of the Wisconsin ice age, the water table seemed nearer to arrive. Lake Okeechobee started to flood, and convection tempests were made. Tremendous peat stores south of Lake Okeechobee demonstrate that customary flooding had happened around 5,000 years prior. Plants started to move, subtropical ones from the northern piece of Florida, and tropicals conveyed as seeds by winged animals from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone rack has all the earmarks of being level, however there are slight ascentsÃ¢ÂÂcalled apexesÃ¢ÂÂand sorrows brought about by the disintegration of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The measure of time during the time that water is available in an area in the Everglades decides the kind of soil, of which there just two in the Everglades: peat, made by numerous long periods of disintegrating plant matter, and marl, the aftereffect of dried periphyton, or lumps of green growth and microorganisms that make a grayish mud. Parts of the Everglades that stay overflowed for over nine months out of the year are typically secured by peat. Zones that are overflowed a half year or less are secured by marl. Plant people group are dictated by the sort of soil and measure of water present.
