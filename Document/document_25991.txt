In 1960 Hordern played Admiral Sir John Tovey in the British war film "Sink the Bismarck!", based on the book "Last Nine Days of the Bismarck" by C. S. Forester and with a plot reminiscent of his naval days. With a few smaller roles in between, Hordern started work on the American epic historical drama film "Cleopatra". It was made in 1962 and according to the actor, was "the most extraordinary piece of film-making in which I had the pleasure to take part". He played the Roman orator Cicero and was hired on an eight-week contract which due to various setbacks, including cast sickness and adverse weather conditions, was extended to nine months. Much to Hordern's annoyance, the film would require him to once again work with Rex Harrison, who was cast as Caesar. Despite the animosity between them, they agreed to endure each other's company for the sake of the film. The agreement was short-lived; Harrison made a drunken quip at a cast dinner about "Nina" which prompted Hordern to assault him. The incident almost resulted in Hordern's dismissal, but the matter was quickly resolved by producers and the two were kept separate in between filming. In 1993 Hordern claimed the incident had "cleared the air" between them and they eventually became friends. After "Cleopatra"'s release, Hordern made a return to films, appearing in "The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" (1965), "How I Won the War" (1967), and "Where Eagles Dare" in 1968. He also featured in the Roman farce "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" in 1966.
