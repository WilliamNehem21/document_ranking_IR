"No Restriction" was trailed by "Keep Your Seats, Please" in 1936, which was again coordinated by Banks with Desmond returning as the co-star. Pressures emerged in pre-creation with Banks and a portion of the cast mentioning to Dean that Beryl be restricted from the set. Tempers had likewise turned out to be stressed among Formby and Desmond, who were not on talking terms but to film scenes. The circumstance turned out to be bad to the point that Dean abstained from visiting his studios for the long stretch of recording. The film contained the melody "The Window Cleaner" (prominently known as "When I'm Cleaning Windows"), which was before long prohibited by the BBC. The company's chief John Reith expressed that "if the open needs to tune in to Formby singing his nauseating little tune, they'll must be substance to hear it in the films, not over the country's wireless transmissions"; Formby and Beryl were angry with the square on the tune. In May 1941 Beryl educated the BBC that the tune was a most loved of the regal family, especially Queen Mary, while an announcement by Formby called attention to that "I sang it before the King and Queen at the Royal Variety Performance." The BBC yielded and began to communicate the tune.
