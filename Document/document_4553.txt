Shelley and her significant other teamed up on the story yet the degree of Percy's commitment to the novel is obscure and has been contended over by perusers and pundits. There are contrasts in the 1818, 1823 and 1831 releases and Mary Shelley expressed, "I positively did not owe the recommendation of one episode, nor barely of one train of inclination, to my significant other, but then yet for his induction, it could never have taken the structure in which it was exhibited to the world." She composed that the prelude to the principal version was Percy's work "the extent that I can recall." James Rieger closed Percy's "help at each point in the book's production was extensive to the point that one scarcely realizes whether to view him as proofreader or minor associate", while Anne K. Mellor later contended Percy just "made numerous specialized remedies and a few times cleared up the story and topical coherence of the content." Charles E. Robinson, editorial manager of a copy release of the "Frankenstein" compositions, reasoned that Percy's commitments to the book "were close to what most distributers' editors have given new (or old) writers or, truth be told, what partners have given to one another in the wake of perusing each other's works in advancement."
