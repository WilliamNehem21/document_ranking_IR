Frequencies of the request of megahertz (MHz) are over the standard range for mechanical channels. The segments begin to turn out to be little, or on the other hand the parts are vast contrasted with the flag wavelength. The lumped component display depicted above begins to separate and the segments must be considered as dispersed components. The recurrence at which the progress from lumped to appropriated models happens is much lower for mechanical channels than it is for their electrical partners. This is on the grounds that mechanical vibrations travel at the speed of sound for the material the part is made out of. For strong segments, this is commonly (x15 for nickel-iron) the speed of sound in air () yet at the same time significantly not exactly the speed of electromagnetic waves (approx. in vacuum). Therefore, mechanical wavelengths are a lot shorter than electrical wavelengths for a similar recurrence. Preferred standpoint can be taken of these impacts by purposely planning parts to be conveyed components, and the segments and strategies utilized in electrical disseminated component channels can be conveyed to tolerate. The reciprocals of stubs and impedance transformers are both feasible. Structures which utilize a blend of lumped and conveyed components are alluded to as semi-lumped.
