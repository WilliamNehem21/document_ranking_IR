Arsenal recorded their first win of the pre-season against Austria Wien. Bergkamp capped off a "superb individual display" by scoring the first goal and setting up the second for Jeffers. The final match of the tour was against BeÅiktaÅ, which required tightened security given the history between English and Turkish football supporters. Bergkamp scored the only goal of the match in the second half, "a cheeky effort through keeper Ãscar CÃ³rdoba's legs". An Arsenal XI in England two days later faced St Albans City, where they won 3â1. The main squad then travelled to Scotland to play Celtic on 2 August 2003. Both goals in the one-all draw came in the second half; the match marked the return of Vieira after three months out with a knee problem. Wenger revealed afterwards that he intended to use the pre-season as an experiment for his defence. He partnered centre back Campbell with TourÃ©, who for much of last season played in midfield. Wenger was pleased with TourÃ©'s performance against Celtic and said: "He has quality. He was originally a central defender and, because we have kept a few clean sheets recently and he's played well, I thought we'd keep him there." An Arsenal XI travelled to Belgium for a game against Beveren and conceded two goals in the final five minutes to draw the match 2â2. Arsenal rounded off their pre-season preparations with a 3â0 win against Rangers on 5 August 2003.
