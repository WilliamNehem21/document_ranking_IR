At age six Starkey created a ruptured appendix. Following a standard appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, making him fall into a state of extreme lethargy that endured days. His recuperation spread over a year, which he spent far from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street kids' emergency clinic. Upon his release in May 1948, his mom enabled him to remain home, making him miss school. At age eight, he stayed unskilled, with a poor handle of science. His absence of training added to a sentiment of distance at school, which brought about his consistently playing truant at Sefton Park. Following quite a while of twice-week by week mentoring from his surrogate sister and neighbor, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had about gotten up to speed to his companions scholastically, yet in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he stayed for a long time. Amid his stay the restorative staff tried to animate engine movement and ease weariness by urging their patients to join the medical clinic band, prompting his first presentation to a percussion instrument: an alternative hammer produced using a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cupboards alongside his bed. Before long a while later, he became progressively keen on drumming, accepting a duplicate of the Alyn Ainsworth melody "Sleep time for Drums" as a recuperation blessing from Crawford. Starkey remarked: "I was in the medical clinic band ... That is the place I truly begun playing. I never needed whatever else from that point on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, however I didn't need them. My granddad gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano Ã¢ÂÂ nothing. Just the drums."
