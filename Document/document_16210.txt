The musicologist Jacques-Gabriel Prod'homme wrote that together with "La Demoiselle Ã©lue", the "Ariettes oubliÃ©es" and the "Cinq poÃ¨mes de Charles Baudelaire" (1889) show "the new, strange way which the young musician will hereafter follow". Newman concurred: "There is a good deal of Wagner, especially of "Tristan", in the idiom. But the work as a whole is distinctive, and the first in which we get a hint of the Debussy we were to know later â the lover of vague outlines, of half-lights, of mysterious consonances and dissonances of colour, the apostle of languor, the exclusivist in thought and in style." During the next few years Debussy developed his personal style, without, at this stage, breaking sharply away from French musical traditions. Much of his music from this period is on a small scale, such as the "Deux arabesques", "Valse romantique", "Suite bergamasque", and the first set of "FÃªtes galantes". Newman remarked that like Chopin, the Debussy of this period appears as a liberator from Germanic styles of composition â offering instead "an exquisite, pellucid style" capable of conveying "not only gaiety and whimsicality but emotion of a deeper sort". In a 2004 study, Mark DeVoto comments that Debussy's early works are harmonically no more adventurous than existing music by FaurÃ©; in a 2007 book about the piano works, Margery Halford observes that "Deux arabesques" (1888â1891) and "RÃªverie" (1890) have "the fluidity and warmth of Debussy's later style" but are not harmonically innovative. Halford cites the popular "Clair de Lune" (1890) from the "Suite Bergamasque" as a transitional work pointing towards the composer's mature style.
