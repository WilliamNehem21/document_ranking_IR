Though Truxtun's ship initially held an advantageous position in the wind known as the weather gauge, she was over-armed, and as a result her leeward side heeled so much that the gunports on that side of the vessel could not be opened. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing around "L'Insurgente"s leeward side and bringing "Constellation" near the French frigate's port side. In such a position "Constellation" was disadvantaged by the wind, but was able to avoid some of the heeling effect on her guns. With "Constellation" approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried to communicate with the Americans in order to avoid a fight. The American frigate ignored the French attempt at hailing her and closed to within fifty yards of "L'Insurgente" before opening up on her with a broadside. The double-shotted American salvo severely damaged the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadsides that damaged "Constellation's" fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of "Constellations" damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. "L'Insurgente" attempted to close on the American frigate to board her. With less damage to her rigging, "Constellation" was easily able to avoid Barreaut's attempts at boarding.
