Somewhere in the range of 1891 and 1893, Lloyd was selected by the manager Augustus Harris to show up close by Dan Leno in the tremendous and prominent Theater Royal, Drury Lane Christmas emulates. While eating with Harris in 1891 to talk about his offer, Lloyd played bashful, intentionally befuddling the performance center with the lesser referred to setting the Old Mo so as not to seem aware of Drury Lane's effective notoriety; she contrasted its structure with that of a jail. Covertly, she was excited with the offer, for which she would get ÃÂ£100 every week. The emulate seasons kept going from Boxing Day to March and were exceedingly worthwhile, yet Lloyd discovered working from a content prohibitive. Her first job was Princess Allfair in "Humpty Dumpty; or, The Yellow Dwarf and the Fair One", which she rejected as being "Grisly dreadful, eh?" She got blended audits for her opening execution. "The Times" depicted her as being "fun loving in signal, agile in appearance, yet not solid in voice." Despite the frail begin (which Lloyd accused on nerves), the emulate got gleaming surveys from the dramatic press. The "London Entr'acte" imagined that she "delivere[d] her content sharply, and sings and hits the dance floor with soul as well." She was noted for her gymnastic moving in front of an audience, and had the capacity to show handstands, tumbles and high kicks. As a kid, the essayist Compton Mackenzie was taken to the show's premiere night and conceded that he was "incredibly astounded that any young lady ought to have the fearlessness to let the world see her drawers as unquestionably as Marie Lloyd."
