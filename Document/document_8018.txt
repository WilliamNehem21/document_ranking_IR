Britain won the Brisbane Test by a record edge of 675 runs. Larwood took 6 for 32 in the Australian first innings, bowling at a speed that "Wisden"s S.J. Southerton portrayed as "quicker than I have ever observed him". As indicated by Jardine's biographer Christopher Douglas, this bowling, which incorporated a spell of 3 wickets in 5 overs for 9 runs, conveyed an enduring hit to Australian resolve and was a central point in England's definitive arrangement triumph. The match saw a relaxed Test debut by Don Bradman, who scored 18 and 1 and was dropped for the second Test, before being quickly restored for the third. Britain kept up their domination amid the second, third and fourth Tests, however with diminishing triumph edges; Australia at long last made progress in the last match, giving England a 4Ã¢ÂÂ 1 arrangement triumph. A mix of hard pitches, smothering warmth, and long matches diminished Larwood's adequacy as the visit advanced. He completed the Test arrangement with 18 wickets at 40.22, behind George Geary (19 at 25.11) and Jack White (25 at 30.80). In all top of the line coordinates on the visit, Larwood took 40 wickets at 31.35; as a batsman he scored 367 runs, averaging 26.21. Larwood's intermittent strategy of bowling leg hypothesis, that is, toward the batsman's legs to a grouping of leg side defenders, had been noted by the Australian previous bowler Arthur Mailey. In his report on the fourth Test, Mailey composed, Larwood turned to his "well known leg hypothesis" in the wake of getting extreme discipline from the Australian batsman Archie Jackson, yet the change brought no achievement: "All speculations and all bowlers were similar to [Jackson]".
