Birch Moss Covert is a small woodland containing birch, alder and willow trees, as well as various species of flora and fauna. The small mammal population includes the wood mouse ("Apodemus sylvaticus"), which attract both kestrel ("Falco tinnunculus") and sparrowhawk ("Accipiter nisus"). Foxes, stoats, weasels, and badgers, are often seen. The area is part of Shell's estate, covering about of land managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The trust also manages a small nature reserve located within Manchester United's training ground. This provides a habitat for a number of species including the red admiral butterfly ("Vanessa atalanta"), meadow pipit ("Anthus pratensis"), and grey partridge ("Perdix perdix"). Carrington Moss is home to the only recorded pairs of breeding grey partridge in Trafford. Six pairs of Eurasian bullfinch ("Pyrrhula pyrrhula") were recorded in 2003. The reduction in the population of these and similar birds is attributed to modern farming methods, the loss of broad hedgerows, and the lack of winter stubble. Action for Nature in Trafford has therefore included the site in its Biodiversity Action Plan. The group intends to develop Carrington Moss as a home for other species, such as reed bunting ("Emberiza schoeniclus"). "Stigmella continuella" (a species of moth occurring in southern and north-west England) has been observed in the area.
