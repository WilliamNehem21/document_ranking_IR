"WÃÂ¶rth" was requested as war vessel "B", and was set down at Germaniawerft in Kiel on 3 March 1890. Introductory work on the ship continued at the slowest pace of every one of the four vessels in the class; her frame was not propelled until 6 August 1892, over eight months after the other three boats. Princess Viktoria, the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II, initiated the ship. Fitting-out work continued rapidly, and she was authorized on 31 October 1893, the main ship of the class to enter dynamic obligation. Broad ocean preliminaries pursued her charging and kept going until April 1894. Amid her preliminaries, she was quickly doled out to the move squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet) to supplant her sister , which was harmed by a heater pipe blast. On 1 August 1894, "WÃÂ¶rth" was relegated as the lead of the German armada for the yearly fall moves, under the direction of Admiral Max von der Goltz. Goltz got on the new warship on 19 August with his staff, which included at that point "KapitÃÂ¤n zur See" (Captain at Sea) Alfred von Tirpitz. Around the finish of the moves, which occurred in both the North and Baltic Seas, Kaiser Wilhelm II got on "WÃÂ¶rth" and looked into an armada march on 21 September.
