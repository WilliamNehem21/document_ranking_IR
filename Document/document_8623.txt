To enable boats to be resupplied via air while working in the South Atlantic, changes were made to the Hercules flying machine, which ordinarily had a scope of about . At RAF Lyneham, Hercules transports were fitted with sets of assistant fuel tanks, in this way expanding their range by three or four hours. Including four tanks expanded the range even further, yet decreased the payload conveying limit by 75 percent. These altered Hercules air ship wound up known as LR2 and LR4 variations, contingent upon what number of assistant tanks had been introduced. They were additionally changed to take into consideration elevated refueling by the option of refueling tests taken from Vulcan aircraft. In the look for refueling tests, they were taken from Vulcans at the Royal Air Force Museum London, Imperial War Museum Duxford, Castle Air Museum in California, and the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum in Nebraska. The Hercules transports were the primary propeller-driven flying machine to be refueled by Victor tankers. The distinction in the paces required skilful flying. A Victor would approach a Hercules from above and toward the back at . The Hercules would then drop at every moment. At full throttle, this enabled the Hercules to reach , the base speed of the Victor. Refueling took around 15 minutes, by which time they would have plummeted to , yet infrequently it took longer and they dropped as low as .
