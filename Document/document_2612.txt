"Raptor Red" happens roughly 120ÃÂ million years prior, in the Early Cretaceous time of the Mesozoic. At the time, a land connect had shaped among Asia and the Americas, this enabled gatherings of outside dinosaurs to attack present-day Utah; one of these remote animal categories is "Utahraptor". Raptor Red's name originates from the images the dinosaur learns as a hatchling to self-relate to. Bakker gives an individual perspective on every specie of dinosaur or old animal in a similar style as Red's encounters; these incorporate an infant "Gastonia" who naturally assaults what it doesn't comprehend with its clubbed tail, and a whip-followed diplodocid who appreciates thumping predators. Bakker unmistakably includes the experiences of a "hide ball" (well evolved creature), "Aegialodon"; as per the creator, the accentuation was included on the grounds that the "Aegialodon" is on the direct tribal line to people. "Aegialodon", notwithstanding, did not live in a similar time and spot as "Utahraptor", hailing from England around 136 million years prior. A portion of different creatures highlighted in the novel were nearer in time and spot to "Utahraptor" however not carefully contemporary. For instance, fossils inferable from "Acrocanthosaurus" and "Deinonychus" are referred to from a similar shake arrangement as "Utahraptor" (the Cedar Mountain Formation), yet from residue around five million years more youthful.
