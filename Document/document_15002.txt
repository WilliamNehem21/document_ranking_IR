MDOT approved a $3.5Â billion 10-year transportation plan (equivalent to $ in ) in 1986 that included an extension of the USÂ 131 freeway north to Manton. Construction started on the Cadillac bypass in 1999, and the first section was opened to traffic in November 2000. This southern segment ran from USÂ 131 south of town to M-55 east of downtown. USÂ 131 remained routed through downtown, but M-55 was rerouted to the bypass. Local residents were allowed to use the northern section of the bypass for recreational activities until it was opened to traffic. The full bypass around Cadillac was dedicated to Sidney Ouwinga in a ceremony on October 27, 2001, and the road was opened to traffic on October 30, 2001. The former routing through town was redesignated Bus. USÂ 131 at the same time. Ouwinga was a state lawmaker who died in 1991 while serving in the Michigan House of Representatives. He was also a member of the USÂ 131 Area Development Association which promoted further northern extensions of the freeway. The freeway expansion north around the city of Manton was opened in 2003. The former routing was redesignated as a business loop at the time. The two bypasses cost $146Â million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete.
