By the late 17th-century, the "raja"s of Coorg had created an "aggressive and independent" state, which became known for its acts of "wanton cruelty" against enemies, and for its "system of terror" directed at its citizens. Muddu Raja, the Coorg ruler from 1633 to 1687, initially ruled from the town of Haleri, but later moved his capital to Mercara, which he fortified and where he built a palace in 1681. Early during the rule of his successor, Dodda Virappa (1687â1736), the army of the neighboring kingdom of Mysore, under the orders of "Wodeyar" Chikka Devaraja, attacked and seized Piriyapatna, a territory which abutted Coorg (see ), and which was then being ruled by a kinsman of Dodda Virappa. Buoyed by the victory, the Mysore army soon attacked Coorg itself; however, it had advanced only a short distance, when, while camping overnight on the plain of Palupare, it was surprised by a Coorg ambush. In the ensuing massacre, the Mysore army lost 15,000 men, and the survivors had to beat a hasty retreat.
For most of the next two decades, the western reaches of Mysore remained vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army. In the border district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and Mysore forces fought to a stalemate and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.
