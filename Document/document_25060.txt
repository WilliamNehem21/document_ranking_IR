At about ten years of age, Narayan learned the basics of "dhrupad", the oldest genre of Hindustani classical music, by studying and imitating the practice of "sarangi" player Uday Lal of Udaipur, a student of "dhrupad" singers Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar. After Uday Lal died of old age, Narayan met travelling singer Madhav Prasad, originally of Lucknow, who had performed at the court of Maihar. With Prasad, Narayan enacted the "ganda bandhan", a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil, in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad. He served Prasad and was taught in "khyal", the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music, but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school. Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician, although the idea of giving up a steady life was not well received by Narayan's family. He stayed with Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him to learn from singer Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore. Following Prasad's death in Lucknow, Narayan enacted the "ganda bandhan" with another teacher who gave him lessons, but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again.
