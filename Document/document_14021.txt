As indicated by Wetzler, writing in 1963 (and utilizing nom de plumes), camp underground had composed the getaway, providing data for Vrba and Wetzler to convey. "Otta" in Hut 18, a locksmith, had made a key for a little shed in which Vrba and others had drawn a site plan and colored garments. "Fero" from the focal library provided information from the vault; "Filipek" (Filip MÃÂ¼ller) in Hut 13 included the names of the SS officers working around the crematoria, an arrangement of the gas loads and crematoria, his records of the vehicles gassed in crematoria IV and V, and the name of a Zyklon B canister. "Edek" in Hut 14 pirated out garments for the escapees to wear, including suits from Amsterdam. "Adamek", "Bolek" and Vrba had provided socks, underwear, shirts, glucose, a razor, burn, nutrients, margarine, cigarettes and a cigarette lighter that said "made in Auschwitz". The data about the camp, including a sketch of the crematorium created by a Russian detainee, "Wasyl", was covered up inside two metal cylinders. The cylinder containing the sketch was lost amid the departure; the second cylinder contained information about the vehicles. Vrba's record contrasts from Wetzel's; as per Vrba, they took no notes and composed the VrbaÃ¢ÂÂ Wetzler report from memory. He told the student of history John Conway that he had utilized "individual memotechnical strategies" to recollect the information, and that the anecdotes about composed notes had been imagined in light of the fact that nobody could disclose his capacity to review so much detail.
