The gods were believed to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had a complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed of many of these same elements. The "ba" was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's power could be called its "ba"; thus, the sun was called the "ba" of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a "ka", another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's "ba" to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, were believed to house divine "ba"s in this way. Gods could be ascribed many "ba"s and "ka"s, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said to be one of the "ka"s of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the "ba" of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. The gods were so full of life-giving power that even their bodily fluids could transform into other living things; humankind was said to have sprung from the creator god's tears, and the other deities from his sweat.
