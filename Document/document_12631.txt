The original copy was first distributed when in 1806 it was taken to London and showed when a letter on it by the Rev. J. Milner, apparently Bishop John Milner, Catholic Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District, was perused to a gathering of the London Society of Antiquaries, which was in this way imprinted in their diary "Archaeologia". Milner pursued the medieval note in relating the book to Cuthbert, and contrasted its content with that of the Lindisfarne Gospels, by then in the British Museum, analyzing the two next to each other. Anyway he suspected that "the coupling is by all accounts of the season of Queen Elizabeth"! After the address it took a few years to come back to Stonyhurst as a middle person neglected to advance it. That the coupling was unique, and the soonest European precedent, was acknowledged amid the nineteenth century, and when shown in 1862 it was depicted in the index as "In exceptional contemporary (?) authoritative". The entire appearance and feel of the book, and the exactness of the content and magnificence of the content was exceedingly adulated by researchers, for example, Bishop Christopher Wordsworth (1807Ã¢ÂÂ 1885), nephew of the writer and a critical New Testament printed researcher, who depicted the book as "outperforming in sensitive straightforwardness of tidiness each composition that I have seen".
