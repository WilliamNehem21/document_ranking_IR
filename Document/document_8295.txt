Stone gave the voice of an Australian Shepherd in "Marmaduke" (2010), a satire from chief Tom Dey, which depends on Brad Anderson's long-running funny cartoon of a similar name. Her achievement came that year with a featuring job in "Simple An", a high schooler satire coordinated by Will Gluck. Somewhat dependent on Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 authentic romance book "The Scarlet Letter", the film recounts to the narrative of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a secondary school understudy who winds up entangled in a comic sex embarrassment after a bogus talk flows that she is explicitly unbridled. Stone read the content before the task was optioned for generation, and sought after it with her chief while creation subtleties were being finished. She found the content "so extraordinary and exceptional from anything I'd perused previously", saying that it was "interesting and sweet". At the point when Stone found that the film had started generation, she met with Gluck, communicating her energy for the undertaking. A couple of months after the fact, the tryout procedure began and she met again with Gluck, getting to be one of the main on-screen characters to try out. The film got positive basic audits, and Stone's execution was viewed as its prime resource. Anna Smith of "Time Out" remarked: "Stone gives a breathtaking exhibition, her realizing drawl suggesting acumen and lack of concern with hidden warmth." With an absolute film industry of $75 million, the film was a business achievement. Stone was designated for a BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.
