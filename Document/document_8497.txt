Their commitment, declared in May 1901, was startling by family and companions, as Peter had appeared earlier enthusiasm for ladies, and individuals from society expected he was gay. At 19 years old, on 9 August 1901, Olga wedded 33-year-old Peter. After the festival the love birds left for the Oldenburg castle on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her better half left for a betting club restoring the following morning. Their marriage stayed unconsummated, and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his yearning mother. Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have acknowledged his proposition to pick up freedom from her own mom, the Dowager Empress, or evade marriage into an outside court. The couple at first lived with her in-laws Alexander Petrovich and EugÃÂ©nie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. The plan was not amicable as Peter's folks, both surely understood for their charitable work, scolded their solitary child for his sluggishness. Olga took an aversion towards her relative; in spite of the fact that EugÃÂ©nie, a dear companion of the Dowager Empress, gave her little girl in-law numerous endowments, including a ruby tiara that had been a present to JosÃÂ©phine de Beauharnais from Napoleon. Half a month after the wedding, Olga and her significant other headed out to Biarritz, France, from where they cruised to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht advanced to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.
