Chris Stamp planned the front of the UK form of "Are You Experienced", which included an image of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding by Bruce Fleming. The picture demonstrates Hendrix wearing a long dim cape while remaining over Mitchell and Redding, striking what Egan portrayed as a "Dracula-esque posture". Chandler reached Fleming dependent on the picture taker's past work with the Hollies, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals. The photograph shoot occurred in February in the wake of Fleming had gone to a few chronicle sessions and Experience gigs. Chandler tried mentioning that the band part's appearances be obviously unmistakable in the photo; Fleming clarified: "[Album covers] got considerably more obscure as time went on, yet to build up the craftsman we needed to get their countenances crosswise over so the children would remember them." He took monochrome and shading shots of the band; Track chosen a picture from the last gathering. Fleming had demonstrated which picture he favored they use, denoting the shot with a cross, yet after the collection's discharge he understood that they had chosen another, less attractive picture. As indicated by Fleming, the shot that he picked was "progressively vile; additionally intriguing". Stamp procured visual craftsman Alan Aldridge to plan the sleeve's hallucinogenic lettering. Track mysteriously put just the collection's title on the spread, precluding the band's name; Polydor issued the discharge all through Europe with Hendrix's name printed at the top in coordinating text style. The spread craftsmanship's blend of dull green and dark colored tones, compared with the funny idea of the subject's posture, made a powerless by and large visual impression; Stamp remarked: "It is anything but an extraordinary spread by any stretch of the imagination. Ideally, we compensated for that in the various spreads."
