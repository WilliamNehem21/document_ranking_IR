In July 1986, a colloquium committed to Childe's work was held in Mexico City, denoting the 50th commemoration of "Man Makes Himself's" production. In September 1990, the University of Queensland's Australian Studies Center composed a centennial gathering for Childe in Brisbane, with introductions looking at the two his academic and communist work. In May 1992, a gathering denoting his century was held at the UCL Institute of Archeology in London, co-supported by the Institute and the Prehistoric Society, the two associations that he had in the past headed. The meeting procedures were distributed in a 1994 volume altered by David R. Harris, the Institute's executive, entitled "The Archeology of V. Gordon Childe: Contemporary Perspectives". Harris expressed that the book tried to "show the dynamic characteristics of Childe's idea, the broadness and profundity of his grant, and the proceeding with importance of his work to contemporary issues in archaic exploration". In 1995, another meeting gathering was distributed. Titled "Childe and Australia: Archeology, Politics and Ideas", it was altered by Peter Gathercole, T.H. Irving, and Gregory Melleuish. Further papers showed up regarding the matter of Childe in following years, taking a gander at such subjects as his own correspondences, and last resting spot.
