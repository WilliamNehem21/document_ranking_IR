John Hillcoat's ensemble crime-thriller "Triple 9" (2016) featured Winslet as Irina Vlaslov, a ruthless Russian-Israeli gangster. The critic Ann Hornaday of "The Washington Post" felt that Winslet had failed to effectively portray her. Her next release of the year, "Collateral Beauty", about a man (played by Will Smith) struggling with the death of his daughter, was panned by critics. Writing for "New York" magazine, Emily Yoshida criticised it as a vacuous remake of "A Christmas Carol" and wrote that Winslet had "never looked more painted and tired". It was a modest earner at the box office. Winslet agreed to the romantic disaster film "The Mountain Between Us" (2017) to take on the challenge of a role requiring physical exertion. It featured Idris Elba and her as two strangers who crash land on an icy, isolated mountain range. They filmed in the mountains of Western Canada at 10,000 feet above sea level where the temperature was well below freezing. Winslet performed her own stunts and described it as the most physically gruelling experience of her career. "The Atlantic"s Megan Garber praised the chemistry between Elba and Winslet, and Moira Macdonald of "The Seattle Times" thought that their charisma had enhanced a mediocre picture.
