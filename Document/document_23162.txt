In 1923 Holloway established himself as a BBC Radio performer. The early BBC broadcasts brought variety and classical artists together, and Holloway could be heard in the same programme as the cellist John Barbirolli or the Band of the Scots Guards. He developed his solo act throughout the 1920s while continuing his involvement with the musical theatre and "The Co-Optimists". In 1924 he made his first gramophone discs, recording for HMV two songs from "The Co-Optimists": "London Town" and "Memory Street". After "The Co-Optimists" disbanded in 1927, Holloway played at the London Hippodrome in Vincent Youmans's musical comedy "Hit the Deck" as Bill Smith, a performance judged by "The Times" to be "invested with many shrewd touches of humanity". In "The Manchester Guardian", Ivor Brown praised him for a singing style "which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head."
Holloway began regularly performing monologues, both on stage and on record, in 1928, with his own creation, Sam Small, in "Sam, Sam, Pick oop thy Musket". Over the following years, he recorded more than 20Â monologues based around the character, most of which he wrote himself. He created Sam Small after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and told him a story about an insubordinate old soldier from the Battle of Waterloo. Holloway developed the character, naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small; the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character. "The Times" commented, "For absolute delightÂ ... there is nothing to compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway's monologue, concerning a military contretemps on the eve of WaterlooÂ ... perfect, even to the curled moustache and the Lancashire accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero."
