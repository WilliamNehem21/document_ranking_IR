In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, several of the routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways which did not yet have a route number, such as the PrestonâNorwich state highway, were assigned one. The road was designated as NYÂ 319 and maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation west of the Norwich city limits and by the city of Norwich within the city. The alignment of NYÂ 319 remained unchanged for the next half-century.
Ownership and maintenance of NYÂ 319 west of the Norwich city limits was slated to be transferred from the state of New York to Chenango County as part of a highway maintenance swap approved by the New York State Legislature and signed into law on FebruaryÂ 13, 1962. However, the swap in maintenance was contingent on the construction and completion of a new alignment for NYÂ 23 in northwestern Chenango County. The new road would extend from the ChenangoâCortland county border in the town of Pitcher to Scotts Corners in the town of Pharsalia, a point west of the hamlet of North Pharsalia. At the time, NYÂ 23 began at NYÂ 26 in northwest Pharsalia and followed an easterly and southerly routing to Scotts Corners, where it turned eastward onto its modern alignment. The portion of the exchange describing the roads that would be transferred to Chenango County is written in New York State Highway Law as follows, with annotations in parentheses:
