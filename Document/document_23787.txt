In addition to the numerous "specific" count-classifiers described above, Chinese has a "general" classifier (), pronounced "gÃ¨" in Mandarin. This classifier is used for people, some abstract concepts, and other words that do not have special classifiers (such as æ±å ¡å "hÃ nbÇobÄo" "hamburger"), and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as Â ()Â "zhÄng" or Â ()Â "tiÃ¡o", especially in informal speech. In Mandarin Chinese, it has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of is increasing and that there is a general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it. Numerous studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use when they do not know the appropriate count-classifier, and even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally. The replacement of a specific classifier with the general is known as classifier "neutralization" ("" in Chinese, literally "classifier ä¸ª-ization"). This occurs especially often among children and aphasics (individuals with damage to language-relevant areas of the brain), although normal speakers also neutralize frequently. It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe, when asked, that those classifiers are obligatory, but nevertheless use without even realizing it in actual speech. As a result, in everyday spoken Mandarin the general classifier is "hundreds of times more frequent" than the specialized ones.
