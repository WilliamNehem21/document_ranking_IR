In June 1973 Hordern showed up on radio for the BBC as Jeeves in an adaption of P.G. Wodehouse's "Jeeves" stories, close by Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster. The next year, Hordern portrayed a few other, one-off projects for the supporter, including "The Honest Broker", "The Last Tsar", and "Tell the King the Sky Is Falling". In 1975 Hordern played the judge in Howard Barker's play "Stripwell" at the Royal Court Theater. Hordern depicted the character as "a man wracked by blame, brimming with self-uncertainty and cynicism". It was a job which the performing artist observed to be excessively near his very own identity for solace. His time in the play was damaged by close to home issues; he and Eve had quickly isolated and the on-screen character was compelled to lease a little level in Sloane Square from the performing artist Michael Wilding in the wake of being exiled from the family home. Hordern and Eve before long accommodated, however it was a period which he was quick to overlook, including the play. Faultfinders were complimentary of his execution, with one composition: ""Stripwell's" ambiguities are along these lines seen half warmly and half disdainfully and this comes over well in Michael Hordern's depiction of blundering, here and there charming ineffectualness, as skilful and achieved an exhibition as one would anticipate from this on-screen character."
