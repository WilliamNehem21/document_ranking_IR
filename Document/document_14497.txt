Barton does not trust Hollywood offers a similar chance. In the film, Los Angeles is a universe of false fronts and fake individuals. This is apparent in an early line of the screenplay (recorded, yet excluded in the dramatic discharge); while advising Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his operator lets him know: "I'm just asking that your choice be educated by a little realismÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ on the off chance that I can utilize that word and Hollywood at the same time". Afterward, as Barton endeavors to clarify why he is remaining at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick completes his sentence, perceiving that Barton needs a spot that is "less Hollywood". The suspicion is that Hollywood is phony and the Earle is certifiable. Maker Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at an eatery highlighting a painting of the "New York Cafe", an indication of Hollywood's push to duplicate the legitimacy of the East Coast of the United States. Lipnick's underlying overpowering abundance is additionally a faÃÂ§ade. In spite of the fact that he starts by telling Barton: "The author is lord here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he demands: "On the off chance that your sentiment made a difference, at that point I surmise I'd leave and given "you" a chance to run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the maniacs are not going to run "this" specific refuge".
