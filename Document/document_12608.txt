When El Greco touched base in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, however their model kept on being fundamental, and to some degree overpowering for youthful painters. El Greco was resolved to make his own imprint in Rome safeguarding his own creative perspectives, thoughts and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for specific commendation, however he didn't delay to reject Michelangelo's "Last Judgment" in the Sistine Chapel; he stretched out an idea to Pope Pius V to paint over the entire work as per the new and stricter Catholic reasoning. When he was later gotten some information about Michelangelo, El Greco answered that "he was a decent man, however he didn't have the foggiest idea how to paint". Also, along these lines we are stood up to by a mystery: El Greco is said to have responded most emphatically or even censured Michelangelo, yet he had thought that it was difficult to withstand his impact. Michelangelo's impact can be seen in later El Greco works, for example, the "Purposeful anecdote of the Holy League". By painting representations of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, apparently, Raphael in one of his works ("The Purification of the Temple"), El Greco offered his thanks as well as cutting edge the case to equal these bosses. As his very own analyses show, El Greco saw Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to imitate. In his seventeenth century "Accounts", Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had started, in different ways, a re-assessment of Michelangelo's lessons.
