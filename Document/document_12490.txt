The biggest skulls of "Paraceratherium" are around long, at the back of the skull, and wide crosswise over by the zygomatic curves. "Paraceratherium" had a long temple, which was smooth and come up short on the roughened region that fills in as connection point for the horns of different rhinoceroses. The bones over the nasal area are long and the nasal entry point goes far into the skull. This demonstrates "Paraceratherium" had a prehensile upper lip like that of the dark rhinoceros and the Indian rhinoceros, or a short proboscis (trunk) as in ungulates. The back of the skull was low and tight, without the vast lambdoid peaks at the top and along the sagittal peak, which are generally found in horned and tusked creatures that need solid muscles to push and battle. It likewise had a profound pit for the connection of nuchal tendons, which hold up the skull consequently. The occipital condyle was wide and "Paraceratherium" seems to have had extensive, solid neck muscles, which enabled it to clear its adamantly downwards while scavenging from branches. One skull of "P. transouralicum" has a domed temple, while others have level brows, perhaps as a result of sexual dimorphism. A mind endocast of "P. transouralicum" demonstrates it was just 8 percent of the skull length, while the mind of the Indian rhinoceros is 17.7 percent of its skull length.
