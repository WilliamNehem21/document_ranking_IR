On 23 March 1915, Jensen enrolled as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for administration in World War I; he was distributed to the sixth fortifications to the tenth Battalion. His support draft left on HMAT "Borda" at Outer Harbor on 23 June, and joined the legion at Gallipoli, Turkey, on 4 August. When Jensen arrived, almost 50% of the unit had been emptied debilitated with loose bowels. For the rest of the Gallipoli battle, the tenth Battalion turned through different positions in the line safeguarding the foothold until pulled back to Lemnos in November. Jensen stayed with his unit all through, aside from seven days in SeptemberÃ¢ÂÂ October that he spent in medical clinic. The brigade left for Egypt in late November and went through the following four months preparing and aiding the safeguard of the Suez Canal. While in Egypt, the force was part into two, one half framing the core of the new 50th Battalion, which was a piece of the thirteenth Brigade, fourth Division. In April 1916, Jensen and a few other tenth Battalion men were exchanged to the 50th Battalion; soon thereafter Jensen was charged for not being in his tent at tattoo. On 5 June the force left for France, touching base in Marseilles six days after the fact. The unit at that point entrained for the Western Front, entering the channels out of the blue on 28 June close Fleurbaix.
