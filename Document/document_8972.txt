In spite of the fact that Kansas isn't seismically dynamic, a solid quake could present huge dangers to the state. On the off chance that a quake were to happen, it would probably be along the Nemaha Ridge, which is as yet dynamic. The Humboldt Fault Zone, simply off the Ridge, lies only east of the close Manhattan. A seismic tremor there would probably crush the dam, discharging of water every second and flooding the adjacent region, which would compromise approximately 13,000 individuals and 5,900 homes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers reasoned that a moderate tremor "somewhere in the range of 5.7 and 6.6 would make sand underneath the dam condense into a sand trap, making the dam spread out and the top to drop up to three feet." A huge quake would bring forth holes, driving water to spill and in the long run reason the dam to crumple. Seismic tremors that could represent a danger to the dam happen on a cycle of about 1,800 years. To counter this danger, the Corps of Engineers has aroused a push to fortify the dam. Supplanting the sand (which could move amid a tremor) with in excess of 350 dividers, the gathering has outfitted the dam with sensors, which are associated with cautions that would alarm adjacent residents to the seismic tremor.
