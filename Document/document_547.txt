As per Volk, books two and three arrangement mostly with the better subtleties of the zodiac. Book two opens with an introduction in which Manilius presents a concise history of hexameter verse, singling out Homer and Hesiod. His motivation, he contends, is to stress the uniqueness of his sonnet in contrast with others as opposed to embed himself into this wonderful custom. As per Manilius, "Each way that prompts Helicon has been trodden" ("omnis promotion accessus Heliconos semita trita est"; every single other point have been secured) and he should discover "immaculate knolls and water" ("integra" ... "prata" ... "undamque") for his verse: soothsaying. Manilius closes the book's prelude by saying "that the perfect universe is intentionally uncovering itself both to humanity all in all and to the writer specifically", and that he is separate from the group since his graceful mission has been authorized by destiny. The writer at that point starts his clarification of the primary mysteriously huge circle: the zodiac itself. He first thinks about the indications of the zodiac (viz. Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces), before talking about the perspectives and connections between the signs and different articles. In this segment, the artist quickly examines the zodiac signs, the Olympian divine beings who fill in as their defenders, and the connection between the signs and the pieces of the human body. The "Astronomica" at that point considers "dodecatemoria" before he strays from the zodiac and starts to talk about the instructive technique. The book finishes up with a thought of the second mysteriously critical hover, that of the fixed hover of the onlooker. The last couple of lines are devoted to a review of the "dodecatropos".
