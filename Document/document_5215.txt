The mission of the WAVES was to supplant the men in shore stations for ocean obligation, which prompted some threatening vibe from the individuals who did not wish to be discharged. Some of the time the antagonistic vibe was unsaid, different occasions it was out in the open. In "Crossed Currents", Ebbert and Hall relate a circumstance where a male officer after welcome the WAVES officer going to work for him, disclosed to her that she was not needed. When she asked him where her gathering was to be quartered, he revealed to her that it was her concern. It was not constantly threatening conduct that was experienced; at times the ladies were doled out jobs to which they were not physically fit. Ebbert and Hall give a precedent where "...two imposing enrolled men contemplated that on the off chance that the ladies sent to supplant them couldn't carry out the responsibility, at that point the men could keep those occupations and abstain from being sent to ocean. They told the ladies, 'get those truck tires stowed appropriately in the space, and afterward headed out to lunch, beyond any doubt the ladies could scarcely lift the tires. However, they came back to discover the tires stowed legitimately. The ladies had fixed a pulley." In different cases, because of the conflicting demeanors of their male bosses, the ladies were underutilized in connection to their preparation, and frequently were just entrusted out of critical need. Then again, when the leaders found that they had ladies who demonstrated they could legitimately supplant the men who were not accessible, their biases were frequently put aside.
