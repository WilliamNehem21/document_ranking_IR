In the wake of going out of Commons, Bottomley upbraided parliament in the pages of "John Bull" as a "smelly, corroded, degenerate framework" that earnestly required substitution. Through his recently shaped Business League he tended to huge groups as he called for government kept running by agents not lawmakers. As usual, Bottomley's way of life required new wellsprings of pay, and in 1912 "John Bull" started to arrange rivalries for money prizes. Bottomley effectively sued the secretary of the Anti-Gambling League for proposing that a large number of the prizewinners were "John Bull" chosen people or workers, however gotten just a farthing in harms. These rivalries raised the magazine's course to 1.5ÃÂ million. In 1913 Bottomley met a Birmingham specialist, Reuben Bigland, and together they started running vast scale sweepstakes and lotteries, worked from Switzerland to dodge English law. Again questions emerged about the validity of proclaimed victors; the champ of the ÃÂ£25,000 sweepstake for the 1914 Derby turned out to be the sister-in-law of one of Bottomley's nearby partners. Bottomley demanded this was a happenstance; years after the fact, it was uncovered that everything except ÃÂ£250 of the prize had been paid into a financial balance constrained by Bottomley.
