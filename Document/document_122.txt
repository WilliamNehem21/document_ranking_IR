At the pinnacle of its creation, 350 illustrators, craftsmen and experts were taking a shot at "Atlantis" at all three Disney movement studios: Walt Disney Feature Animation (Burbank, California), Disney Feature Animation Florida (Orlando), and Disney Animation France (Paris). The film was one of only a handful couple of Disney vivified highlights created and shot in 70mm anamorphic configuration. The executives felt that a widescreen picture was significant, as a nostalgic reference to old activity experience films introduced in the CinemaScope position (2.35:1), noticing "Pillagers of the Lost Ark" as a motivation. Since changing to the arrangement would require movement work areas and hardware intended for widescreen to be bought, Disney officials were at first hesitant about the thought. The creation group found a basic arrangement by illustration inside a littler casing on a similar paper and hardware utilized for standard perspective proportion (1.66:1) Disney-vivified films. Design chief Ed Ghertner composed a manual for the widescreen group for use by the format craftsmen and referenced that one favorable position of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer in light of extra space to stroll inside the edge. Insightful drew further motivation for the arrangement from movie producers David Lean and Akira Kurosawa.
