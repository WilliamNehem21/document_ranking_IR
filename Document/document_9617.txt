The area of the "lower some portion of the city", somewhere else alluded to as the "Lower City", at the season of Josephus (first century CE) is acknowledged to be Jerusalem's south-eastern slope, the first urban focus customarily known as the City of David. Deceiving the south of the Temple Mount, notwithstanding, the region uncovered today is essentially lower than the Mount itself. The highest point of the Mount is around over the ground level at the southern holding mass of the later Herodian-time development of the Temple fenced in area. The rise diminishes toward the south of this point. Josephus, a local of Jerusalem, would have been very much aware of this disparity, yet is in any case ready to clarify it away by portraying how Simon had annihilated both the Acra and the slope on which it had stood. Archeological research south of the Temple Mount, notwithstanding, has neglected to find any proof for such huge scale quarrying. Despite what might be expected, unearthings in the district have revealed considerable proof of home from the earliest starting point of the principal thousand years BCE down to Roman occasions, providing reason to feel ambiguous about the proposal that amid Hellenistic occasions the region was fundamentally higher than it was at the season of Josephus or that an expansive slope had been cleaned up. This had driven numerous analysts to slight Josephus' record and his setting of the Acra, and propose a few exchange areas. Since 1841, when Edward Robinson proposed the region close to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher as the site of the Acra, no less than nine unique areas in and around the Old City of Jerusalem have been advanced.
