The passages focusing on the Old Testament concern the creation of the world, the Fall of Man, the Great Flood, and the Exodus from Egypt. Proba's presentation of the Creationlargely based on rewordings of Virgil's "Georgics"reorganizes the Genesis narrative to better align it with contemporary Greco-Roman beliefs about the origin of the world. Cullhed argues that certain aspects of the creation story are "abbreviated ... amplified or even transposed" so that Proba can avoid repetitive passages, such as the double creation of man (Genesis 1:25â27 and Genesis 2:18â19). In the events leading to the Fall of Man, Eve's actions are largely based on the story of Dido from Book IV of the "Aeneid", thereby "repeatedly foreshadowing ... the imminent disaster of the Fall". The Serpent is described with lines that detail LaocoÃ¶n's death (from Book II, "Aeneid") and the snake sent by the fury Alecto to enrage Amata (from Book VII, "Aeneid"). Proba relies on the first two books of the "Georgics" (specifically, the sections that discuss the Iron Age of Man) to describe human life after Adam and Eve eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; in this way, she connects the Greco-Roman concept of the Ages of Man with the Judeo-Christian concept of the Fall of Man.
