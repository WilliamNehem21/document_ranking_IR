The upgrades made amid the remaking expanded "Yamashiro"s draft by ; the two preeminent six-inch weapons were evacuated, as similar firearms on her sister send had gotten absorbed high oceans after that ship's recreation. The ship's light-AA deadly implement was expanded by eight 25ÃÂ mm Type 96 light AA firearms in twin-weapon mounts. Four of these mounts were fitted on the forward superstructure, one on each side of the channel and two on the back superstructure. This was the standard Japanese light-AA firearm amid World War II, however it experienced extreme plan deficiencies that rendered it a generally incapable weapon. As indicated by student of history Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts "needed adequate speed in train or rise; the weapon sights were unfit to deal with quick focuses on; the firearm showed over the top vibration; the magazine was excessively little, and, at long last, the firearm delivered inordinate gag impact". The arrangement of the AA weapons changed fundamentally after some time; in 1943, 17 single and two twin-mounts were included for an aggregate of 37. In July 1944, the ship was fitted with another 17 single, 15 twin and eight triple-mounts, for a sum of 92 hostile to air ship weapons in her last arrangement. The weapon had a powerful scope of , and a viable roof of at a height of 85 degrees. The most extreme compelling rate of flame was just somewhere in the range of 110 and 120 rounds for each moment on account of the incessant need to change the fifteen-round magazines.
