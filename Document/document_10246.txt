Spain in the end chose to purchase the French tank and by 1975 the Spanish Army had 299 AMX-30s, assigned as AMX-30Es. Of these, 280 tanks were made by the nearby organization Empresa Nacional Santa BÃÂ¡rbara (presently Santa BÃÂ¡rbara Sistemas) who got the AMX-30 patent from the French organization GIAT. As the main bunch of generation of AMX-30s finished, the French Army and Santa BÃÂ¡rbara started an exploration program for an inevitable modernisation of the AMX-30 to address lacks, for example, mechanical unwavering quality, shield insurance and the flame control framework. In handling the AMX-30E, the military discovered its overhauled M47s and M48s to be obsolete; its soonest M47 tank was more than 30ÃÂ years old.
