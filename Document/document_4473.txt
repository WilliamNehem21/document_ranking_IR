Jeppson of the first Ordnance Squadron, he embedded the Little Boy's powder sacks in the "Enola Gay"s bomb cove in flight. Prior to moving to height on way to deal with the objective, Jeppson exchanged the three wellbeing plugs between the electrical connectors of the inner battery and the terminating component from green to red. The bomb was then completely outfitted. Jeppson checked its circuits. Four different individuals from Project Alberta flew on the Hiroshima mission. Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew and Lawrence H. Johnston were on the instrument plane "The Great Artiste". They dropped "Bangometer" canisters to quantify the power of the impact, yet this was not used to figure the yield at the time. Bernard Waldman was the camera administrator on the perception flying machine. He was furnished with a unique rapid Fastax motion picture camera with six seconds of film so as to record the impact. Lamentably, Waldman neglected to open the camera screen, and no film was uncovered.
