From March 1958 Formby appeared in the musical comedy "Beside the Seaside", a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play may not have been to southern audiences' tastesâthe plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpoolâand the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to "Beside the Seaside", he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in "Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat" in January, and in April hosted his own show, "Steppin' Out With Formby". During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, partly as a result of his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.
