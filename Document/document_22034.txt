Although a period film, "Chandralekha" is not based on historical fact; its plot is based on the first chapter of "Robert Macaire, or the French Bandit in England". Sasankan is based on Macaire and, according to film historian B. D. Garga, Chandralekha is "probably" based on a female dancer in the novel whom Macaire flogs when she refuses to dance; the film includes the scene from the novel. Garga noted that "Chandralekha" was also influenced by other Western literary and cinematic works, including the novel "Blood and Sand" (1908) and the films "The Mark of Zorro" (1920), "Robin Hood" (1922), "The Thief of Baghdad" (1924) and "" (1925). In December 1964, film historian Jerzy Toeplitz called the film an "extension and development" of the mythological genre: "The characters are mortals but behave like heavenly beings, and their movements and gestures, like those of the gods and heroes of the "Mahabharata" are impregnated with the miraculous." Toeplitz wrote that the story was a "mere pretext to hold together the different episodes, each of which builds up like a circus turn: the tension mounts to a culminating point, whereupon the next episode immediately takes over." According to Roy Armes' 1987 book, "Third World Film Making and the West", Uday Shankar's 1948 "Kalpana" (also filmed at Gemini Studios) inspired Vasan to make "Chandralekha". In the 2003 "Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema", the film is described as a "Ruritanian period extravaganza".
