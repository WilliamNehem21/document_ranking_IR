In the Elizabethan play "The Merry Devil of Edmonton", Mowbray does not show up as a character in front of an audience, however the diverting figure Blague more than once asserts that: "I serve the great Duke of Norfolk." Exactly what period the play is set is the subject discussion among researchers. Proposals run from the rule of King Henry VI (1421Ã¢ÂÂ 1471) to the 1580s (in Queen Elizabeth I's rule). The twentieth century Shakespeare researcher W. W. Greg places it in the rule of Henry VI, putting together his decision to some degree with respect to Thomas Fuller's after death distributed "History of the Worthies of England" (1662). If so then the "Duke of Norfolk" alluded to in the play would be Mowbray. As indicated by J. M. Bromley, the play brings out "the similitudes among poaching and conspiracy", and the mysterious creator intentionally connects this Duke of Norfolk to both. Rudolph Fiehler noticed how Blague's support of the duke was especially founded on the obnoxious attributes of "weakness, poaching and burglary". It has additionally been proposed that his comic catchphrase was purposely planned to summon Sir John Falstaff, a standout amongst Shakespeare's best known characters, for the group of onlookers. In Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part 2", Justice Shallow alludes to Falstaff as having once been a page to "Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk", Mowbray's granddad. Falstaff is normally viewed as an anecdotal portrayal of either Sir John Oldcastle or Sir John FastolfÃ¢ÂÂor potentially an amalgamation of the twoÃ¢ÂÂboth of whom are differently connected with Mowbray.
