Elevated to colonel, Wells wound up General Staff Officer, first Grade (GSO1), to the ninth Division in November 1941. In that capacity, he was the ninth Division's head of staff, in charge of the full scope of staff exercises. On 28 June 1942, Wells went with Lieutenant General Sir Leslie MorsheadÃ¢ÂÂCommander of the ninth DivisionÃ¢ÂÂto Cairo, where they got orders entrusting the ninth Division with the safeguard of Cairo. The pair went through that night and the next day sorting out designs for the move, before Morshead got further requests on 30 June dropping his past guidelines and coordinating the division rather be dispatched to Alexandria; the move occurred on 1 July. After two days, it was chosen that the 24th Infantry Brigade would be sent forward to fortify the situation at El Alamein. The detachment was deficient in hardware, and Wells went through that day organizing gear for the unit just as directing its readiness; the unit pushed ahead the following day. The divisional home office continued to El Alamein on 7 July, and was presented on the northern flank of the British cutting edge. The unit at that point spent the rest of the month in real life against Axis powers in the zone. For his "recognized administrations" amid this period, Wells was Mentioned in Despatches a second time.
