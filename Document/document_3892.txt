Faultfinders have likewise refered to her utilization of characters from different class foundations as a decision rebellious to customary Western dream. In the meantime, analysts addressed Le Guin's treatment of sex in "A Wizard of Earthsea", and the first set of three in general. Le Guin, who later ended up known as a women's activist, limited the utilization of enchantment to men and young men in the principal volume of Earthsea.

"Tehanu" (1990), distributed as the fourth volume of "Earthsea" 18 years after the third, has been depicted both by Le Guin and her observers as a women's activist rethinking of the arrangement, in which the power and status of the main characters are turned around, and the male centric social structure addressed. Remarking in 1993, Le Guin composed that she couldn't proceed [Earthsea after 1972] until she had "grappled with the heavenly attendants of the women's activist awareness".
