Once in France, the division joined XI Corps and was set for possible later use, easing the 46th (North Midland) Division. The primary losses were before long endured because of preparing mishaps with projectiles. The division was then briefly part up and invested energy joined to the Guards Division and nineteenth (Western) Division, to pick up involvement in channel fighting. It soothed the nineteenth (Western) Division and until the mid year kept an eye on the front in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais district. It was turned along the XI Corps division, and invested energy in Festubert, Givenchy, La Gorgue, Laventie and Neuve Chapelle. Units of the division alternated on the cutting edge, looked after positions, directed channel assaults and were exposed to German bombardments, all of which enabled the men to pick up involvement of dynamic administration conditions. Amid this period Captain Goronwy Owen of the fifteenth RWF did a channel strike into a dead zone, where he found a gathering of German fighters who had quite recently completed the process of laying spiked metal. Owen pursued the Germans back to their channel and trapped them. The divisional history remarks that "the more prominent bit [of the German party] were slaughtered" and the assault was considered by the Army to be "the third bestÃÂ ... done up until now" in the war. For his activities, Owen was referenced in dispatches.
