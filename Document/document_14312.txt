The organic product bodies begin their advancement underground or covered in leaf flotsam and jetsam, connected to a strand of mycelium at the base. As they develop, the exoperidium (the external tissue layer of the peridium) parts open into 7 to 14 beams which bend in reverse; this pushes the organic product body over the substrate. Completely opened examples can achieve measurements of from beam tip to tip. The beams are of unequal size, with tips that frequently move back internal. They involve three unmistakable layers of tissue. The inward pseudoparenchymatous layer (so named for the likeness to the firmly pressed cells of plant parenchyma) is plump and thick when crisp, and at first pale beige yet obscuring to yellow or dark colored as it develops, regularly splitting and stripping off all the while. The outside mycelial layer, regularly tangled with fine leaf flotsam and jetsam or soil, ordinarily splits to uncover a center sinewy layer, which is made of thickly stuffed hyphae 1Ã¢ÂÂ 2.5ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m wide. The base of the organic product body is sunken to vaulted fit as a fiddle, and frequently secured with following soil. The generally circular spore sac (endoperidium) measures in width, and is bolstered by a bunch of short sections formed like smoothed circles. It is dim darker in shading, and minutely roughened with little, gently interconnected moles. There are a few to numerous equally scattered mouths, the ostioles, fundamentally on the upper portion of the endoperidium. They are generally round with fimbriate edges. The unappetizing organic product bodies have no unmistakable taste, albeit dried examples build up a smell looking like curry powder or bouillon solid shapes.
