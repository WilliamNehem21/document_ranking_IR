Hood and Corbett recommended a few plans that were offbeat by the models of the time. One arrangement involved the development of a huge pyramid crossing every one of the three hinders; this was later cut back to a little retail pyramid, which advanced into the oval retail assembling. Another arrangement incorporated an arrangement of vehicular inclines and extensions over the complex. In July 1930, Hood and Corbett quickly talked about the likelihood of developing the whole intricate as a superblock with promenades driving from the RCA Building. This proposal was not viewed as further on the grounds that, likewise with the corner to corner avenues plan, it would have included decommissioning lanes. In the end, the majority of the plans were streamlined into an increasingly conventional structure, with restricted rectangular sections, set once more from the road, on the majority of the squares. Hood made a rule that the majority of the workplace space in the complex would be close to from a window, which was the most extreme separation that daylight could straightforwardly enter the inside of a structure at New York City's scope. At the time, cooled places of business were uncommon, and the sunlit workplaces gave agreeable lodging, instead of workplaces in numerous more established structures, which were dull and cramped.
