The program in Schnittke's Fourth Symphony, mirroring the arranger's very own religious quandary at the time it was composed, is progressively unpredictable in execution, with most of it communicated silently. In the 22 varieties that make up the orchestra's single development, Schnittke authorizes the 15 conventional , which feature vital minutes in the life of Christ. As he did in the Second Symphony, Schnittke all the while gives a point by point melodic critique on what is being depicted. Schnittke does this while utilizing church music from the Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Orthodox religions, the symphonic surface winding up very thick from the numerous melodic strands advancing in the meantime. A tenor and a countertenor likewise sing silently at two points in the orchestra. The creation spares words for a finale that utilizes every one of the four sorts of chapel music contrapuntally as a four-section choir sings the "Ave Maria". The choir can pick whether to sing the "Ave Maria" in Russian or Latin. The automatic plan of utilizing these diverse kinds of music, Ivashkin composes, is a request by the author "on the thought ... of the solidarity of mankind, a combination and agreement among different indications of conviction".
