Handling drew motivation from numerous abstract sources and conventions just as from his own life. The structure and plot of "The Author's Farce" are like those of George Farquhar's "Affection and a Bottle" (1698), in that both plays depict the connection between a creator and his landowner. The plays just arrangement with the equivalent summed up thought be that as it may; the points of interest of each are unique. Handling likewise drew on the Scriblerus Club's utilization of parody and the silliness regular to customary Restoration and Augustan show. A large number of Luckless' circumstances are like those found inside different conventional British dramatizations, including Buckingham's "The Rehearsal" (1672), an ironical play about arranging a play. It is conceivable that Pope's "Dunciad Variorum", distributed on 13 March 1729, impacted the topics of the play and the plot of the manikin appear. The Court of Nonsense in the manikin show are identified with the Court of Dulness in "The Dunciad" and the Court of Nonsense in John Dryden's "Macintosh Flecknoe". The Scriblerus Club style of cleverness all in all impacts "The Author's Farce", and it is conceivable that Fielding obtained from Gay's "Three Hours after Marriage" (1717) and "The Beggar's Opera" (1728). Thusly, Fielding's play affected later Scriblerus Club works, particularly Pope's fourth book of his modified "Dunciad" and potentially Gay's "The Rehearsal at Goatham".
