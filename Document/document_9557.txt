Before the function started, King Edward VIII, present in his ability as ruler of Canada, reviewed the watchman of respect, was acquainted with the regarded visitors, and went through around thirty minutes talking with veterans in the group. Two Royal Air Force and two French Air Force squadrons flew over the landmark and dunked their wings in salute. The function itself started with petitions from ministers speaking to the Church of England, the United Church of Canada, and the Roman Catholic Church. Ernest Lapointe, Canadian Minister of Justice, talked first, trailed by Edward VIII who, in both French and English, expressed gratitude toward France for its liberality and guaranteed those gathered that Canada could always remember its war absent and dead. The King at that point pulled the Royal Union Flag from the focal figure of "Canada Bereft" and the military band played the Last Post. The function was one of the King's not many authority obligations before he surrendered the position of authority. The journey proceeded, and most members visited Ypres before being taken to London to be facilitated by the British Legion. 33% of the travelers left from London for Canada on 1 August, while the greater part came back to France as visitors of the legislature for one more seven day stretch of visiting before returning home.
