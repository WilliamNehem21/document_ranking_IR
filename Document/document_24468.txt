More recent views present the question of responsibility as more nuanced and complex â suggesting that Creutz cannot be singled out as solely responsible for the disaster. Historians Ingvar SjÃ¶blom and Lars Ericson Wolke have pointed out that Creutz's position as admiral was comparable to that of a chief minister. He would have primarily been an administrator without the need for intimate knowledge of practical details; turning a ship in rough weather would have been the responsibility of his subordinates. SjÃ¶blom has stressed that the disagreement between Major AnkarfjÃ¤ll and Lieutenant Admiral BjÃ¶rnram on how much sail was needed wasted precious time in a situation where quick decisions were crucial. Creutz was also unique as a supreme commander of the navy since he had no experience of military matters. The Swedish naval officer corps in the late 17th century lacked the prestige of army commanders, and seasoned officers and even admirals could be outranked by inexperienced civilians or army commanders with little or no naval background. Maritime archaeologist Lars Einarsson has suggested that Creutz's "choleric and willful temperament" probably played a part, but that it could equally be blamed on an untrained and inexperienced crew and the open discord among the officers. According to SjÃ¶blom it is still unclear to historians whether there was a designated ship commander on "Kronan" with overall responsibility.
