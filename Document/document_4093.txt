Sharpe's initial Gothic Revival works were pre-archeological, including Holy Trinity, Blackburn, worked in 1837Ã¢ÂÂ 46 for RevdÃÂ JWÃÂ Whittaker. Hughes communicates the conclusion that this congregation is Sharpe's "piÃÂ¨ce de opposition", it contains "a crossbreed blend of Gothic styles". All the while Sharpe was engaged with the plan of around twelve additional holy places in Northwest England, which progressively joined increasingly "right" Gothic highlights. In 1841 he acquired an agreement to fabricate three holy places and related structures (vicarages and schools) for the Weaver Navigation Trustees, at Weston Point, Runcorn; Castle, Northwich; and Winsford. Every one of the three were in Cheshire, and worked somewhere in the range of 1841 and 1844. Somewhere in the range of 1835 and 1842 Sharpe structured about 30ÃÂ new houses of worship in Lancashire and Cheshire, all to a low spending plan, and all to a degree pre-archeological. In 1843 Sharpe had the capacity to satisfy his guarantee to fabricate a congregation for the Earl of Derby; this was StÃÂ Mary, Knowsley, which was finished and sanctified the next year. It is depicted by Hughes as "one of Sharpe's loveliest manifestations". About a similar time he structured another steeple for StÃÂ Michael, Kirkham; the steeple and St Mary's Church contained significantly more in the method for "right" Gothic highlights, and both were commended by the Camden Society in "The Ecclesiologist".
