On 6 September 1937, Captain FÃÂ©lix Verdeja, telling the support organization of the Nationalist "BatallÃÂ³n de Carros de Combate" ("Tank Battalion"), started to secretly build up another light tank. His situation, with direct access to Panzer Is and T-26s, gave Verdeja direct proof of the inadequacies of current tank models as far as battle capacity and upkeep issues. Verdeja set up a future tank requiring the 45ÃÂ millimetre (1.77ÃÂ in) firearm fitted in the T-26; two coaxial light automatic weapons; a position of safety, all-around shield more prominent than 15ÃÂ millimetres (0.6ÃÂ in), with a turret mantlet plate of in any event 30ÃÂ millimetres (1.2ÃÂ in); street speed of , battle scope of , and a skilled suspension and new track framework. This last prerequisite depended on encounters with existing light tanks, which much of the time lost their tracks in battle. These necessities and arrangements were displayed in October 1938 to Colonel DÃÂ­az de la Lastra, boss of the "AgrupaciÃÂ³n de Carros de Combate". Despite the fact that the undertaking was affirmed, the program needed to utilize scrap to manufacture the principal model because of an absence of assets and cash. Regardless of early obstructions, including analysis from von Thoma, the program proceeded and Verdeja was granted a stockroom in Zaragoza to proceed with the development of the model.
