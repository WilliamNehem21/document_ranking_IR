Laurel started expressing "Dredd" amid after creation of his other composition credit "Daylight", and finished his first draft while filling in as an official maker amid recording of "28 Weeks Later". Laurel's draft rotated around one of Dredd's primary adversaries, the undead Judge Death. He portrayed the story as a "riff all in all Judge framework", yet that it didn't work in light of the fact that the Judge framework had not yet been set up and required a lot of information about the "Judge Dredd" comic from the gathering of people. He likewise considered the final product excessively dreamlike and outrageous. From this content, Garland chose that the story should have been progressively engaged and grounded. He rather considered adjusting a portion of the striking Judge Dredd storylines, including "Majority rule government" (1986) and "Causes" (2006). He chose to maintain a strategic distance from these long stories for a shorter, day-in-the-biography about Dredd and his capacity as a cop in the tragic condition of Mega-City One. When building up the Judge Dredd character, Garland attempted to intently pursue that of the comic-book character, who experiences just little identity changes over an extensive timeframe. He stated: "I didn't think Dredd could have an extraordinary revelation, however there is certainly an adjustment in him throughout the motion picture. He makes an extremely obvious explanation toward the start of the film which he at that point repudiates toward the end. That is about to the extent the move goes." Garland purposefully gave the conventional character advancement to Anderson to adjust for Dredd's character strength.
