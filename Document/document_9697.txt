Silicate volcanism, including basaltic magma with mafic to ultramafic (magnesium-rich) sytheses, was affirmed by the "Galileo" shuttle during the 2000s from temperature estimations of Io's various problem areas, areas where warm emanation is distinguished, and from unearthly estimations of Io's dull material. Temperature estimations from "Galileo"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Solid-State Imager (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) uncovered various problem areas with high-temperature segments going from at any rate to a limit of , like at the Pillan Patera ejection in 1997. Introductory appraisals throughout the "Galileo" mission recommending ejection temperatures drawing closer have since ended up being overestimates on the grounds that the wrong warm models were utilized to compute the temperatures. Otherworldly perceptions of Io's dim material proposed the nearness of orthopyroxenes, for example, enstatite, magnesium-rich silicate minerals basic in mafic and ultramafic basalt. This dull material is seen in volcanic pits, crisp magma streams, and pyroclastic stores encompassing later, hazardous volcanic ejections. In view of the deliberate temperature of the magma and the unearthly estimations, a portion of the magma might be closely resembling earthly komatiites. Compressional superheating, which could build the temperature of magma amid rising to the surface amid an emission, may likewise be a factor in a portion of the higher temperature ejections.
