On 20 October 1941, JevÃÂeviÃÂ and TrifunoviÃÂ-BirÃÂanin met and consented to team up with the leader of the data division of the Italian VI Corps. In late January 1942, JevÃÂeviÃÂ offered to help the Italians in the event that they involved Bosnia, and to compose Chetnik separations to work close by Italian units in their battle against the socialist drove Partisans. These contacts included General Renzo Dalmazzo, administrator of the Italian VI Corps, and Chetnik pioneers Stevo RaÃÂenoviÃÂ, TrifunoviÃÂ-BirÃÂanin, DangiÃÂ and JevÃÂeviÃÂ. In February, JevÃÂeviÃÂ counseled with one of DangiÃÂ's supporters, BoÃÂ¡ko TodoroviÃÂ, who educated him to consult with the new administrator of the Italian Second Army, Mario Roatta, to organize the withdrawal of NDH and German troops from eastern Bosnia, to be supplanted by a solely Italian organization. Both JevÃÂeviÃÂ and TodoroviÃÂ inspired Dalmazzo with the impact they had the capacity to apply over the eastern Bosnian Chetniks, yet TodoroviÃÂ was executed by the Partisans in Herzegovina in late February. The impact JevÃÂeviÃÂ had was shown when Serb patriot equipped gatherings in the GoraÃÂ¾de and FoÃÂa regions swung over to an enemy of Partisan and master Italian mentality when they were educated of JevÃÂeviÃÂ and TrifunoviÃÂ-BirÃÂanin's ties with VI Corps home office. The designs for Italian venture into eastern Bosnia were later talked about among JevÃÂeviÃÂ and NDH State Secretary Vjekoslav VranÃÂiÃÂ.
