At 13:00, Kondo's Advanced force and Abe's Vanguard force warships together headed directly towards the last reported position of the U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try to intercept them for a warship gunfire battle. The damaged carriers "ZuihÅ" and "ShÅkaku", with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area, leaving Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta in charge of the "Zuikaku" and "Jun'yÅ" aircraft forces. At 13:06, "JunyÅ" launched her second strike of seven torpedo planes and eight Zeros, and "Zuikaku" launched her third strike of seven torpedo planes, two dive bombers, and five Zeros. At 15:35, "JunyÅ" launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four bombers and six Zeros.
After several technical problems, "Northampton" finally began slowly towing "Hornet" out of the battle area at 14:45, at a speed of only five knots. "Hornet"s crew was on the verge of restoring partial power but at 15:20, "Jun'yÅ"s second strike arrived, and the seven torpedo planes attacked the almost stationary carrier. Although six of the torpedo planes missed, at 15:23, one torpedo struck "Hornet" mid-ship, which proved to be the fatal blow. The torpedo hit destroyed the repairs to the power system and caused heavy flooding and a 14Â° list. With no power to pump out the water, "Hornet" was given up for lost, and the crew abandoned ship. The third strike from "Zuikaku" attacked "Hornet" during this time, hitting the sinking ship with one more bomb. All of "Hornet"s crewmen were off by 16:27. The last Japanese strike of the day dropped one more bomb on the sinking carrier at 17:20.
