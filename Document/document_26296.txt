The spotted green pigeon was scientifically named by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, based on Latham's description. The original binomial name "Columba maculata" means "spotted pigeon" in Latin. Latham himself accepted this name, and used it in his 1790 work "Index ornithologicus". Since Latham appears to have based his 1783 description on Davies' specimen, this can therefore be considered the holotype specimen of the species. Subsequent writers were uncertain about the validity and relationships of the species; James Francis Stephens suggested that it belonged in the fruit pigeon genus "Ptilinopus" in 1826, and Johann Georg Wagler instead suggested that it was a juvenile Nicobar pigeon ("Caloenas nicobarica") in 1827. Tommaso Salvadori listed the bird in an appendix about "doubtful species of pigeons, which have not yet been identified" in 1893. In 1898, Henry Ogg Forbes supported the validity of the species, after examining Nicobar pigeon specimens and concluding that none resembled the spotted green pigeon at any stage of development. He therefore considered it a distinct species of the same genus as the Nicobar pigeon, "Caloenas". In 1901, Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert agreed that the pigeon belonged to "Caloenas", but suggested that it was probably an "abnormity", though more than one specimen had been recorded.
