Harrison's plan had "little that was English, still less that was unmistakably Oxonian", said the design student of history Sir Howard Colvin. There were no pitched rooftops, towers, or apexes. Rather, the proposed structure had "an emphatically Mediterranean character", motivated by medieval structures in that area. White Portland stone was the picked structure material; there were to be "unmistakable" outer dividers and level rooftops, and a substantial semi-roundabout entryway at the fundamental passage, with facetted voussoirs showing the impact of the Muslim engineering of Norman Sicily. The pinnacle, which was to have an inner arch and an outer polygonal plan, appeared (in Colvin's view) impacts of Byzantium and parts of southern France. In the lobby, there were to be paths on the north and south sides of the fundamental body of the corridor, as in a basilica, with the curves and sections of the passageways structured in a Greek Doric style. The lobby and its terrific staircase, said Colvin, would have matched those of Christ Church. Despite the fact that Harrison had not completed designs for the normal rooms, the underlying representations had oriental contacts, including chimneys reminiscent of the TopkapÃÂ± Palace in Istanbul. The Warden's Lodging would have been "a standout amongst the most attractive and large of its sort". In any case, Colvin believed that the sanctuary configuration was more qualified to Mediterranean daylight than Oxford agony.
