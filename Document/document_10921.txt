In light of the apparent danger, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet arranged an arrangement to shield the east coast from assaults by airborne plunderers and rockets. This arrangement was initially code-named 'Task Bumblebee', and later renamed 'Activity Teardrop'. Finished on 6 January 1945, the arrangement included U.S.ÃÂ Navy hostile to submarine powers just as United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Army units, which were in charge of shooting down assaulting flying machine and rockets. The focal point of the arrangement was the development of two expansive maritime teams to work in the mid-Atlantic as an obstruction against submarines moving toward the east coast. These teams were shaped from a few existing escort bearer gatherings, and utilized Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, as their forward working base. Just as guarding against rocket assaults, these vast powers were entrusted with countering the new and superior Type XXI submarines on the off chance that they started working in the focal Atlantic. The AtlanticÃÂ Fleet's officer, Vice Admiral Jonas H. Ingram, gave a question and answer session on 8 January in which he cautioned there was a danger of rocket assault and reported that an extensive power had been amassed to counter seaborne rocket launchers.
