The most seasoned very much dated record of "Oryzomys antillarum" is at Drum Cave in the Jacksons Bay Caves framework, where it was found in a stratum radiocarbon dated to somewhere in the range of 10,250 and 11,260 years before present as indicated by a recent report. It is available in a few other undated destinations that originate before the human colonization of the island, around 1,400 years before present. In any case, a site (Wallingford Roadside Cave) from the last interglacial, the Eemian, contains just the hystricognath rodents "Clidomys" and "Geocapromys browni" and needs "Oryzomys". The nearness of the rice rodent on Jamaica before the landing of people invalidates the theory that it was presented; rather, it more likely than not achieved the island by overwater dispersal through a boating occasion, presumably under 125,000 years prior. Amid the last frigid period, low ocean levels would have uncovered much land among Jamaica and Central America, significantly diminishing the separation required for the progenitor of "O.ÃÂ antillarum" to touch base on the island and presumably affecting ocean flows with the goal that piles of vegetation from Central America would be bound to achieve Jamaica. Types of "Oryzomys" are semiaquatic and intently connected with water, which may clarify the event of the class on Jamaica. The rice rodent has been found in numerous shallow, late Holocene cavern stores, some of which have been radiocarbon dated to inside the most recent 1,100 years. Its remaining parts additionally happen in some Amerindian archeological destinations. From its normal and far reaching event in caverns, Ray recommended that the rice rodent happened in a wide range of environments before European contact. "O.ÃÂ antillarum" was the main sigmodontine rat on any of the Greater Antilles, where the rat fauna generally comprises exclusively of hystricognaths and presented rodents.
