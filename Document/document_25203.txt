"Raptor Red" takes place approximately 120Â million years ago, in the Early Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic. At the time, a land bridge had formed between Asia and the Americas, this allowed groups of foreign dinosaurs to invade present-day Utah; one of these foreign species is "Utahraptor". Raptor Red's name comes from the symbols the dinosaur learns as a hatchling to self-identify with. Bakker gives an individual view of each species of dinosaur or ancient creature in the same style as Red's experiences; these include a baby "Gastonia" who instinctively attacks what it does not understand with its clubbed tail, and a whip-tailed diplodocid who enjoys beating up predators. Bakker prominently features the adventures of a "fur-ball" (mammal), "Aegialodon"; according to the author, the emphasis was added because the "Aegialodon" is on the direct ancestral line to humans. "Aegialodon", however, did not live in the same time and place as "Utahraptor", hailing from England about 136 million years ago. Some of the other animals featured in the novel were closer in time and place to "Utahraptor" but not strictly contemporary. For example, fossils attributable to "Acrocanthosaurus" and "Deinonychus" are known from the same rock formation as "Utahraptor" (the Cedar Mountain Formation), but from sediments about five million years younger.
