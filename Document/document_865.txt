The visit finished in a match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. With standard commander Don Bradman missing, Brown drove a group that included seven Test debutants. The hosts won the hurl and chose to bat first on a wet wicket, which occurred following seven days of downpour before the match. New Zealand figured out how to achieve 4/37 at lunch, before the sun rose and made the wicket transform into a sticky with erratic skip. Leg spinner Bill O'ReillyÃ¢ÂÂin his last TestÃ¢ÂÂand debutant Ernie Toshack, took 5/14 and 4/12 separately as New Zealand were bowled out for just 42, losing their last six wickets for five runs. In answer, Australia were 1/9 when Ken Meuleman was expelled. Having been dropped on 13, Brown at that point consolidated in a 109-run first-wicket remain with Barnes, before falling for the innings top-score of 67. It was the main association for the Test that went past 32. Barnes' expulsion set off a breakdown of 6/57, provoking Brown to announce Australia's innings shut down at 8/199. Australia at that point rejected New Zealand for 54 in the second innings in only two hours, bringing about triumph by an innings and 54 keeps running in only two days. As the hosts' batsmen fell rapidly, a considerable lot of the Australian bowlers had constrained chances. With one wicket left in the match, Brown utilized the flip of a coin to figure out which of the debutants Colin McCool and Ian Johnson would bowl in Tests out of the blue. McCool was given the ball and finished the match on his second conveyance. Dark colored's lone Test as commander makes him the first and the main local Queenslander to have driven Australia.
