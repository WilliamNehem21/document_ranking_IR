It is as sure as anything in a man's life can be certainly proposed, that had he kept on playing in English district cricketÃÂ ... he would have had his spot among the select organization of England's commanders." "The Times" remarked: "It was one of the extraordinary disillusionments of English cricket in the primary quarter of this century that his exceptional guarantee was never completely figured it out." Hart sees that Crawford's on-field triumphs were numerous up to 1909 however from that point onward, his vocation viably slowed down amid his nonattendance from English cricket. Hart takes note of Crawford's "ability to jump on the scoreboard and up foundation noses. He could turn diversions around and understandings over, threaten the ground-breaking, charm himself to the youthful and those sufficiently youthful on a fundamental level to want to describe extraordinary individual exhibitions as 'courageous'". He presumes that Crawford went through the most recent 40 years of his life "in similar donning lack of definition". Nobody on the Surrey council at any point communicated lament at what had occurred, and Leveson Gower did not make reference to the undertaking in his personal history.
