The 32X's game library consists of fortyÂ titles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD. Among the titles for the 32X were ports of arcade games "Space Harrier" and "Star Wars Arcade", a sidescroller with a hummingbird as a main character in "Kolibri", and a 32X-exclusive game in the "Sonic the Hedgehog" series titled "Knuckles' Chaotix". Several of the games released for the 32X are enhanced ports of Genesis games, including "After Burner", "NFL Quarterback Club", and "World Series Baseball '95". In a retrospective review of the console, "Star Wars Arcade" was considered the best game for the 32X by "IGN" for its cooperative play, soundtrack, and faithful reproduction of the experiences of "Star Wars". In a separate review, "IGN"'s Buchanan praised the 32X title "Shadow Squadron" as superior to "Star Wars Arcade". "Retro Gamer" writer Damien McFerran, however, praised "Virtua Fighter" as "the jewel in the 32X's crown", and "GamesRadar+" named "Knuckles' Chaotix" as the best game for the system. "Next Generation" called "Virtua Fighter" "the colorful wreath on 32X's coffin", reflecting the consensus among contemporary critics that the game was at once arguably the 32X's best release and a clear harbinger of the platform's imminent discontinuation, since it was clearly inferior to the Saturn versions of "Virtua Fighter Remix" (which had already been released) and "Virtua Fighter 2" (which was due out in just a few months). In response to fan inquiries, Sega stated that the 32X architecture was not powerful enough to handle a port of "Virtua Fighter 2".
