"Los Angeles Times" editor Ernesto Lecnher gave the album one-and-a-half out of four stars and claimed that "Romances" "sinks under its own weight, delivering mostly bloated versions of timeless material". Fellow "Los Angeles Times" contributor Ed Morales disagreed with his review: "Lechner needs to go into his music room, turn down the lights, snuggle up with his significant other and really listen to 'Romances.' I give his review * and 'Romances' ****" . Anne Valdespino of the "Los Angeles Daily News" praised the selection of songs and Miguel's performance, calling the performer a "class act". "The San Diego Union-Tribune" music critic Ernesto Portillo Jr. rated "Romances" three-out-of four stars and claimed that Miguel's "interpretations are first-rate and the music, with production help from famed composer Armando Manzanero, is executed with exquisite precision". However, he questioned the need for a third in the "Romance" series as he felt it "diminishes the specialness" of "Romance" and "Segundo Romance" noted that not all tracks in the album are "true boleros". "El Nuevo Herald" editor Eliseo Cardona wrote a mostly positive review of the album. He complimented Miguel's vocals and the productions but stated that Migule's interpretation of "La Gloria Eres Tu" "pales" compared to Lucho Gatica and JosÃ© JosÃ©'s cover of the song. Ramiro Burr of the "San Antonio Express-News" said "Romances" "sparkles with the joy of visiting good friends" and lauded its "timeless music, beautiful orchestration" and complimented Silvetti's arrangements. Burr commented while "we've heard all these classics before, and seemingly a million times" Miguel "does it so well, it hardly seems to matter."
