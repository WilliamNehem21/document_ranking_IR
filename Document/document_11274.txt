In June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker started working together under the name TRV$DJAM. They performed at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, in the wake of performing at a school occasion, he and Barker were on board a Learjet 60 when it smashed upon departure in Columbia, South Carolina. The accident murdered both group individuals and the other two travelers, a security watchman and Barker's right hand, fundamentally harming Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein endured severely charred areas to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore traveled to be close by in medical clinic, and the media detailed that they were dating once more. He was discharged on September 26, 2008, and was relied upon to make a full recuperation. In December 2008, Goldstein recorded a common claim against the plane's sanction organization, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit guaranteed carelessness with respect to the pilots, and an assembling deformity on part of the plane. He requested harms for torment and enduring, mental anguish, distortion and loss of profit. The claim was settled by his domain in 2010, a year after his demise.
