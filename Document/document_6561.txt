Walton's home in London was devastated by German shelling in May 1941, after which he invested quite a bit of his energy at Alice Wimborne's family house at Ashby St Ledgers in the wide open of Northamptonshire amidst England. While there, Walton dealt with undertakings that had been in his brain for quite a while. In 1939 he had been arranging a considerable chamber work, a string group of four, yet he put it aside while creating his wartime film scores. In mid 1945 he swung again to the group of four. Walton was cognizant that Britten, with "Les Illuminations" (1940), the "Sinfonia da Requiem" (1942), and "Subside Grimes" in 1945, had created a progression of generous works, while Walton had delivered no significant organization since the Violin Concerto in 1939. Among English faultfinders and groups of onlookers, the Violin Concerto was not at first evaluated one of Walton's best works. Since Heifetz had purchased the elite rights to play the concerto for a long time, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London debut, with a less well known soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the Royal Albert Hall, did not promptly uncover the work as a magnum opus. The String Quartet in A minor, debuted in May 1947, was Walton's most considerable work of the 1940s. Kennedy calls it one of his best accomplishments and "a beyond any doubt sign that he had lost the encumbers of his film style and rediscovered his actual voice."
