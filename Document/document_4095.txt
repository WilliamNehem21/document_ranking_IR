The next year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright went to a duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie upheld duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright bolstered Wells' rival, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each discharged two shots and, as neither one of the men had been harmed, settled their duel with a handshake. Different individuals from the gatherings, who had different explanations behind disdaining one another, started battling. Bowie was shot in the hip; in the wake of recovering his feet he drew a blade, portrayed as a butcher blade, and charged his assailant, who hit Bowie over the head with his vacant gun, breaking the gun and thumping Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the inclined Bowie, who returned discharge and potentially hit Wright. Wright at that point drew his sword stick and skewered Bowie. At the point when Wright endeavored to recover his cutting edge by setting his foot on Bowie's chest and pulling, Bowie pulled him down and gutted Wright with his extensive blade. Wright kicked the bucket immediately, and Bowie, with Wright's sword as yet projecting from his chest, was shot again and cut by another individual from the gathering. The specialists who had been available for the duel expelled the shots and fixed Bowie's different injuries.
