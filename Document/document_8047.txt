As per student of history Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, amid the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, the Mamluks utilized gun against the Mongols. He guarantees this was "the principal gun ever" and utilized a black powder equation practically indistinguishable to the perfect sythesis for unstable explosive. He additionally contends this was not known in China or Europe until some other time. Hassan further cases that the soonest literary proof of gun is from the center east, in view of prior firsts which report hand-held gun being utilized by the Mamluks at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. Anyway Hassan's cases have been invalidated by different antiquarians, for example, David Ayalon, Iqtidar Alam Khan, Joseph Needham, Tonio Andrade, and Gabor ÃÂgoston. Khan contends that it was the Mongols who acquainted black powder with the Islamic world, and trusts gun just came to Mamluk Egypt during the 1370s. As indicated by Needham, the expression "midfa", dated to literary sources from 1342 to 1352, did not allude to genuine hand-weapons or shells, and contemporary records of a metal-barrel gun in the Islamic world don't happen until 1365 Similarly, Andrade dates the printed appearance of gun in center eastern sources to the 1360s. Gabor ÃÂgoston and David Ayalon trust the Mamluks had unquestionably utilized attack gun by the 1360s, yet prior employments of gun in the Islamic World are dubious with a conceivable appearance in the Emirate of Granada by the 1330s, anyway proof is uncertain.
