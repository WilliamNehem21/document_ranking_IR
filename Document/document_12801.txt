It has 150 stars, making it the most extravagant bunch in Auriga; the most unmistakable part is an orange star that shows up at the middle. M37 is around 25 light-years in measurement. It is the most brilliant open group in Auriga with a greatness of 5.6; it has a clear distance across of 23.0 arcminutes. M37 was found in 1764 by Charles Messier, the first of numerous space experts to commend its excellence. It was depicted as "a virtual haze of sparkling stars" by Robert Burnham, Jr. what's more, Charles Piazzi Smyth remarked that the star field was "strewed ...with shining gold-dust". The stars of M37 are more established than those of M36; they are around 200 million years of age.
