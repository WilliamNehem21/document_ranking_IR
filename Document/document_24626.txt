Georgene L. Troseth and her colleagues at Vanderbilt University studied how toddlers use information gained from prerecorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year-olds do not learn as much from prerecorded videos because the videos lack social cues and personal references. Two-year-olds who viewed a pretaped video with instructions about how to find a toy in an adjoining room by a non-interactive researcher did not use the information, even though they smiled and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like "Blue's Clues", which although was "on the right track" due to the way in which the host invites interaction with the show's viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems. Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show's host may increase children's ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from "Blue's Clues" to solve new problems. Her research suggested that "Blue's Clues" engaged young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction. A longitudinal study published in 2005 found that early exposure to "Blue's Clues" to children between six and thirty months of age was positively linked with vocabulary and expressive language later learned.
