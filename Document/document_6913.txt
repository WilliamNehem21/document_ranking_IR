In the late eighth and ninth hundreds of years the main section of coin created in southern England was the silver penny. Coins were printed in a unidentified town in Wessex itself, however action in the mid-ninth century was negligible and no Wessex coins of ÃÂthelberht are known. Kent had mints at Canterbury and Rochester and they delivered coins for the sake of ÃÂthelwulf until 858 and ÃÂthelberht from that point. The absence of coins for the sake of ÃÂthelbald is proof that he didn't have any status of overlordship over ÃÂthelberht. In the early ninth century the nature of the engraving and the bust of the lord on coins declined, yet it restored on the Inscribed Cross penny toward the finish of ÃÂthelwulf's rule and this proceeded under ÃÂthelberht's, which additionally observed the presentation of the uncommon Floreate Cross structure in around 862. There was a significant increment in the quantity of moneyers: twelve struck Inscribed Cross coins in ÃÂthelwulf's reign and fifty in ÃÂthelberht's. This may have been expected to a recoinage beginning toward the finish of ÃÂthelwulf's reign and proceeding in ÃÂthelberht's, when old coins were brought in and dissolved down to make new ones. The silver substance of his Inscribed Cross issue tumbled to underneath half and one penny printed in Canterbury has just 30%, yet a Floreate Cross coin has 84%, maybe showing that it was a proposed as a recoinage with higher fineness. There was likewise expanding institutionalization of plan in the coinage, reflecting more noteworthy imperial command over money and printing amidst the ninth century.
