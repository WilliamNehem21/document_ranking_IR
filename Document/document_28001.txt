The designers included role-playing elements in the game. Similar to "Ultima Underworld", another Looking Glass Studios project, the environment in "System Shock 2" is persistent and constantly changes without the player's presence. Paper-and-pencil role-playing games were influential; the character customization system was based on "Traveller"s methodology and was implemented in the fictional military branches which, by allowing multiple character paths, the player could receive a more open-ended gameplay experience. Horror was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was deemed primary, which resulted in the player having little physical contact with other sentient beings. Secondly, a vulnerability was created by focusing on a fragile character. Last were the inclusion of moody sound effects and "the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows". The game's lead designer, Ken Levine, oversaw the return of "System Shock" villain SHODAN. Part of Levine's design was to ally the player with her, as he believed that game characters were too trusting, stating "good guys are good, bad guys are bad. What you see and perceive is real". Levine sought to challenge this notion by having SHODAN betray the player: "Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the "player" never is. I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that "they", and not [only] the character, were led on and deceived". This design choice was controversial with the development team.
