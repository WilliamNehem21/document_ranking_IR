In 1891, a political emergency emerged in Chile that drove a wedge among Harrison and Blaine. The American priest to Chile, Patrick Egan, a political companion of Blaine's, conceded haven to Chileans who were looking for asylum from the Chilean Civil War. Chile was at that point suspicious of Blaine due to his War of the Pacific discretion ten years sooner, and this occurrence raised strains significantly further. At the point when mariners from the "Baltimore" took shore leave in ValparaÃÂ­so, a battle broke out, bringing about the passings of two American mariners and three dozen captured. At the point when the news achieved Washington, Blaine was in Bar Harbor recovering from an episode of sick wellbeing and Harrison himself drafted an interest for reparations. The Chilean remote priest, Manuel Antonio Matta, answered that Harrison's message was "mistaken or purposely off base" and said that the Chilean government was treating the issue equivalent to some other criminal issue. Pressures expanded as Harrison took steps to sever conciliatory relations except if the United States got a reasonable expression of remorse. Blaine came back to the capital and made propitiatory suggestions to the Chilean government, offering to present the debate to mediation and review Egan. Harrison still demanded a statement of regret and presented a unique message to Congress about the danger of war. Chile issued a conciliatory sentiment for the occurrence, and the danger of war died down.
