Not long after leaving his vehicle, Martin expressed his conviction that it was impractical for him to secure the title: "They disclose to me many individuals are experiencing difficulty at any rate, yet we didn't have to discard that." He said he was ignorant that Yeley planned to make a pit stop and, from his perspective, it permitted Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was originating from the focal point of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was arranged and flagged his aims to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin set him in a situation to hit the backstretch divider. Hamlin said the primary lap crash that he was engaged with was a piece of auto hustling, and expressed it was tricky being associated with challenges in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: "We looked up and another person (Waltrip) didn't. I set myself back there in qualifying. We'll face the facts and go on." Seventh-place finisher Raines was upbeat to hold the primary position for 28 laps saying it was "additional uncommon" to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of "Frontstretch" opined that had the alert banner not been shown for the three security vehicles on lap nine, it could have brought about "a standout amongst the most grievous mishaps in NASCAR history."
