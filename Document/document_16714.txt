Starting in 1918, the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state-maintained roadways. The highway across the state from St. Croix Falls to Armstrong Creek was numbered WISÂ 14 at that time. The remainder of what is now USÂ 8 was unnumbered secondary highways, and WISÂ 14 continued north of Armstrong Creek to Florence. When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year, the future USÂ 8 was not included in the system. In Minnesota, USÂ 8 would follow what was Constitutional RouteÂ 46, which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2, 1920; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and Chisago City through Wyoming.
The first changes to the routings of the predecessor highways were made by Wisconsin by 1920. A series of curves were added between Turtle Lake and Barron adding "stair steps" to the routing while similar jogs were removed near Cameron, Weyerhauser, Hawkins and Prentice. WISÂ 14 was rerouted between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake to run via Monico, and WISÂ 38 (the future USÂ 141) was extended northward from Wausaukee to terminate at the state line near Niagara. The realignment between Rhinelander and Pelican Lake was shown as reversed by 1922. By 1925, the highway in that area was again rerouted to run directly from Rhinelander to Monico, but instead of turning south to Pelican Lake, it was run directly to Crandon. That same year, WISÂ 14 was extended eastward from Armstrong Creek to Pembine and northward to Niagara. The northâsouth section, previously numbered WISÂ 38, was also redesignated as part of WISÂ 57.
