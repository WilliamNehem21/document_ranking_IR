Al-Mu'tasim's dependence on his Turkish "ghilmÃÂn" developed over the long haul, particularly in the fallout of an unsuccessful plot against him found in 838, amid the Amorium battle. Headed by Ujayf ibn Anbasa, a long-serving Khurasani who had pursued al-Ma'mun since the common war against al-Amin, the trick aroused the conventional Abbasid elites, disappointed with al-Mu'tasim's arrangements and particularly his partiality towards to the Turks. Discontent with the last became because of their servile source, which annoyed the Abbasid gentry. The plotters expected to execute the Caliph and bring up al-Ma'mun's child al-Abbas in his stead. As per al-Tabari, al-Abbas, albeit aware of these plans, dismissed Ujayf's earnest recommendations to execute al-Mu'tasim amid the underlying phases of the battle because of a paranoid fear of seeming to undermine the jihad. In the occasion, Ashinas became suspicious of al-Farhgani and Ibn Hisham, and the plot was before long revealed. Al-Abbas was detained, and the Turkish heads Ashinas, Itakh, and Bugha the Elder attempted to find and capture different backstabbers. The issue was the flag for a substantial scale cleanse of the military that Kennedy depicts as "of practically Stalinesque heartlessness". Al-Abbas was compelled to bite the dust of thirst, while his male posterity were captured, and likely executed, by Itakh. Different pioneers of the intrigue were in like manner executed in brilliantly brutal ways, which were generally broadcasted as an obstruction to other people. As per the "Kitab al-'Uyun", around seventy administrators and officers were executed, including a few Turks.
