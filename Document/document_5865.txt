In 1903 the armada, which was made out of just a single squadron of current warships, was rearranged as the "Dynamic Battle Fleet". "Kaiser Barbarossa" stayed in the I Squadron alongside her sister ships and the most current s, while the more established "Brandenburg"- class ships were submitted for possible later use in request to be modified. The main quarter of 1903 pursued the standard example of preparing works out. The squadron went on a preparation journey in the Baltic, trailed by a voyage to Spain that endured from 7 May to 10 June. The ship endured some harm to her rudder, which required brief fixes at the "Kaiserliche Werft" (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel from the finish of July to 21 August. She from that point participated in the fall moves and the winter journey in the eastern Baltic and the Skagerrak. The harvest time moves comprised of a barricade practice in the North Sea, a voyage of the whole armada first to Norwegian waters and after that to Kiel toward the beginning of September, lastly a fake assault on Kiel. The activities closed on 12 September. The winter preparing journey started on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and proceeded into the Skagerrak toward the beginning of December. On 15 December, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was decommissioned for perpetual fixes to her rudder, which kept going until January 1905. At the point when the fixes were done, she didn't come back to support, be that as it may, and rather started a noteworthy remaking.
