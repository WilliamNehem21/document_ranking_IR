"Salanoia durrelli" most closely resembles the brown-tailed mongoose, which is a small, gracile mongoose-like carnivoran. It is reddish-brown overall, paler than the brown-tailed mongoose. The head and nape are speckled. The underparts are reddish-buff, not brownish as in the brown-tailed mongoose. Most of the tail is similar in color to the body, but the tip is yellowish-brown. The inner side of the well-furred external ear (pinna) is reddish-buff. The broad feet are naked below, with the naked skin buff on the forefeet and dark brown on the hindfeet, and show prominent pads. Each of the five digits on the fore- and hindfeet bears a long, dark brown claw. There are rows of stiff hairs along the outer margins of the feet. In contrast, the brown-tailed mongoose has narrower feet with more poorly developed pads. In "S.Â durrelli", the fur is long and soft.
In the holotype specimen, a female, the head and body length was , the tail length was , the hindfoot length was , the ear length was , and the body mass was . In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, the head and body length was about , the tail length was about , and the body mass was . Based on these limited data, "S.Â durrelli" may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.
