UrsÃºa decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were pointless, and a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on the morning of 13 March. The encampment at ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ was left defended by 25 Spanish soldiers, three Maya musketeers and several artillery pieces. UrsÃºa boarded the "galeota" with 108 soldiers, two secular priests, five personal servants, the baptised Itza emissary AjChan and his brother-in-law and an Itza prisoner from NojpetÃ©n. The attack boat was rowed east from ChÊ¼ichÊ¼ towards the Itza capital; halfway across the lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across the approach to NojpetÃ©n, covering about from one shore to another â UrsÃºa simply gave the order to row through them. A large number of defenders had gathered along the shore of NojpetÃ©n and on the roofs of the city. As the "galeota" approached, more canoes put out from the shore and the Spanish were surrounded. Once they had surrounded the "galeota", Itza archers began to shoot at the invaders. UrsÃºa gave orders to his men not to fire but arrows wounded several soldiers; one of the wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point the officers lost control of their men. The defending Itza soon fled from the withering Spanish gunfire.
