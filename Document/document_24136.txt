"Velociraptor" are well known for their role as vicious and cunning killers thanks to their portrayal in the 1990 novel "Jurassic Park" by Michael Crichton and its 1993 film adaptation, directed by Steven Spielberg. The "raptors" portrayed in "Jurassic Park" were actually modeled after the closely related dromaeosaurid "Deinonychus". Paleontologists in both the novel and film excavate a skeleton in Montana, far from the central Asian range of "Velociraptor" but characteristic of the "Deinonychus" range. A character in Crichton's novel also states that ""Deinonychus" is now considered one of the velociraptors", which suggests that Crichton used the controversial taxonomy proposed by Gregory S. Paul, even though the "raptors" in the novel are at another point referred to as "V. mongoliensis". Crichton met with the discoverer of "Deinonychus", John Ostrom, several times at Yale University to discuss details of the animal's possible range of behaviors and appearance. Crichton at one point apologetically told Ostrom that he had decided to use the name "Velociraptor" in place of "Deinonychus" because the former name was "more dramatic". According to Ostrom, Crichton stated that the "Velociraptor" of the novel was based on "Deinonychus" in almost every detail, and that only the name had been changed. The "Jurassic Park" filmmakers also requested all of Ostrom's published papers on "Deinonychus" during production. They portrayed the animals with the size, proportions, and snout shape of "Deinonychus" rather than "Velociraptor".
