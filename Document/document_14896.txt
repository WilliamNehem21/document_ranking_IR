The significant key acoustic prologue to "Battle Fire with Fire" showed Metallica's development towards an all the more pleasingly complex style of songwriting. The quickest Metallica tune as far as picking speed, it is driven by deftly tremolo-picked riffs in the refrains and chorale. The all-inclusive solo toward the end breaks down in an audio effect of a tremendous atomic blast. The principle riff was taped amid the Kill Them All Tour and the acoustic introduction was something Burton was playing on acoustic guitar at the time. The tune disheartened the "tit for tat" approach, and its expressive topics concentrated on atomic fighting and Armageddon. "Ride the Lightning" was Metallica's first melody to underscore the hopelessness of the criminal equity framework. The verses were composed from the point of view of somebody who is foreseeing execution by the hot seat. The melody, one of the two collection tracks that credited Mustaine, starts in a mid-beat which bit by bit quickens as the tune advance. It includes an instrumental center area featured by Hammett's soloing. As indicated by Hetfield, the melody was not an analysis of the death penalty, yet a story of a man condemned to death for a wrongdoing he didn't submit, as in the opening verses: "Blameworthy as charged/But Damn it/It ain't right".
