Petter's huge footed mouse is an earthly rat with short forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150ÃÂ mm (5.9ÃÂ in) and weight of 105ÃÂ g (3.7ÃÂ oz) in the main known total example, it is a lot bigger than "M.ÃÂ bastardi", and its estimations fall at or over the upper end of the known scope of variety in "M.ÃÂ ingens". The upperparts are secured with delicate and short, darker hide. Most spread hairs (the principle part of the hide) are dim darker for the 66% nearest to the base, at that point light dark colored, with a short dim darker tip. The center of the back seems darker, on the grounds that the spread hairs there are altogether dull dark colored. The hairs are 6 to 8ÃÂ mm (0.2 to 0.3ÃÂ in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9ÃÂ mm (0.3 to 0.4ÃÂ in) on the back. The watchman hairs are dim. Since the flanks need completely dull spread hairs, they are marginally lighter than the remainder of the upperparts. They are strongly isolated in shading from the underparts, which are totally white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (bristles over the mouth) are long, up to 60ÃÂ mm (2.4ÃÂ in), and white or dark in shading. The pinnae (outside ears) are dull darker and secured with fine silver hairs, and ear length is 32ÃÂ mm (1.3ÃÂ in).
