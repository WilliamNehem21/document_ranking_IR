In the meantime, the rule's military crusaded in Thrace, formally claiming towns verified by famous revolt. With Thessalonica banned against him, his supply lines to Thrace cut, and departures having diminished his military to 2,000 men, of whom half had a place with Hrelja, Kantakouzenos was compelled to pull back north to Serbia, where he planned to verify the guide of Stefan DuÃÂ¡an. Before long, Hrelja likewise abandoned Kantakouzenos and joined the rule, planning to deal with Melnik for himself. In July 1342, Kantakouzenos met DuÃÂ¡an close Pristina. The Serbian ruler showed up at first hesitant to shape a coalition. By and by, under strain from his nobles, particularly the incredible Jovan Oliver, he couldn't bear to pass up on this one of a kind chance to grow south. Frantically needing Serbian guide, Kantakouzenos evidently concurred that the Serbs could keep any town they took, in spite of his own later record despite what might be expected. As indicated by Nikephoros Gregoras, the Serbs asserted all of Macedonia west of Christopolis (Kavala), aside from Thessalonica and its environs. The main concession Kantakouzenos verified was that a special case be made for those towns that surrendered to him face to face. To seal the agreement, Kantakouzenos' more youthful child, Manuel, was to be marry to the little girl of Jovan Oliver, albeit after DuÃÂ¡an later broke the coalition, the marriage did not happen. Hrelja too agreed to the settlement, in return for the surrender of Melnik by Kantakouzenos' army. After Hrelja's passing soon thereafter, Melnik was seized by DuÃÂ¡an.
