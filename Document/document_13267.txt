Martin Robinson of IGN UK said that Lightning "in a split second charms herself" in examination with Hope or Snow, however he found that, when Lightning's backstory "gets hindered in conventional swash", Sazh turns into the all the more engaging character. GamesRadar's Carolyin Gudmundson was apathetic: she opined that, while Lightning's story has its benefits, it "absolutely isn't well beyond what we'd regularly anticipate". She remarked that this absence of creativity makes Lightning "one-dimensional and exhausting". Gamasutra author Christian Nutt trusted that Lightning's associations with the cast add mankind to the story.
