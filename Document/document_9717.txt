An aggregate of 19,499,337 gold dollars were begat, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. As indicated by an ad in the February 1899 issue of "The Numismatist", gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still popular as a birthday present and for adornments. That diary in 1905 conveyed updates on a client storing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, mindful of the esteem, acknowledged the record for $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a vendor offered $2 each for any amount. As mint piece gathering turned into an across the board interest in the mid twentieth century, gold dollars turned into a mainstream claim to fame, a status they hold. The 2014 release of R.S. Yeoman's "A Guide Book of United States Coins" rates the most economical gold dollar in fine condition (VF-20) at $300, an esteem given for every one of the Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those looking for one of each sort will observe the most costly to be an example of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 evaluated at $350 in that condition; the other two sorts have dates esteemed at $300 in that grade.
