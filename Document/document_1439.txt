As CAS, Hancock attempted to upgrade the RAAF's obstacle capacity in the Pacific locale, especially in light of uplifted pressures with Indonesia amid its time of "Konfrontasi" with Malaysia. In June 1963, Hancock embraced a mission to Britain, France and the United States to consider potential trades for the English Electric Canberra plane as Australia's prime flying strike stage. In the wake of exploring the US "TFX", North American A-5 Vigilante and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, the British BAC TSR-2, and the French Dassault Mirage IV, Hancock chose that the swing-wing TFX, precursor of the General Dynamics F-111, would be the flying machine most appropriate for this job. Be that as it may, as the TFX had not yet flown, he prescribed buy of the effectively operational Vigilante to neutralize an apparent impending danger from Indonesia. In the occasion, the Federal Government did not proceed with a prompt substitution for the Canberra, and Hancock's unique decision of the TFX was taken up as a long haul arrangement, prompting Australia's understanding in October to buy the F-111C. That month, as "Konfrontasi" kept on stewing, Hancock endorsed rearrangements to the tenets of commitment for Australian CAC Saber warriors based at RAAF Butterworth to draw in and crush Indonesian airplane disregarding Malay air space. The next month he encouraged utilizing RAAF Canberras from Butterworth to make pre-emptive strikes against Indonesian air bases, in countering for invasions into West Malaysia, however Britain, which had at first mentioned Australia's inclusion, kept down on activity.
