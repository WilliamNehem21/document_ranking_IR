A "sajal" was positioned underneath the "ajaw", and showed a subservient ruler. A "sajal" would be master of a second-or third-level site, offering an explanation to an "ajaw", who may himself have been subservient to a "kalomte". A "sajal" would frequently be a war commander or local senator, and engravings regularly connect the "sajal" title to fighting; they are regularly referenced as the holders of war hostages. "Sajal" signified "dreaded one". The titles of "ah tzÃÂ¼ihb" and "ah chÃÂ¼ul hun" are both identified with copyists. The "ah tzÃÂ¼ihb" was an illustrious recorder, more often than not an individual from the regal family; the "ah chÃÂ¼ul hun" was the Keeper of the Holy Books, a title that is intently connected with the "ajaw" title, showing that an "ajaw" constantly held the "ah chÃÂ¼ul hun" title at the same time. Other cultured titles, the elements of which are not surely knew, were "yajaw kÃÂ¼ahk"' ("Lord of Fire"), "tiÃÂ¼huun" and "ti'sakhuun". These last two might be minor departure from a similar title, and Mark Zender has proposed that the holder of this title may have been the representative for the ruler. Elegant titles are overwhelmingly male-situated, and in those moderately uncommon events where they are connected to a lady, they seem, by all accounts, to be utilized as honorifics for female eminence. Titled elites were frequently connected with specific structures in the hieroglyphic engravings of Classic period urban areas, showing that such office holders either claimed that structure, or that the structure was a vital concentration for their exercises. A "lakam" was perhaps the main non-first class post-holder in the illustrious court. The "lakam" was just found in bigger destinations, and they seem to have been in charge of the tax assessment of neighborhood areas.
