Development on a fifth film in the "Alien" franchise was in progress by 2002. Scott considered returning to the series he created with his 1979 science fiction horror film "Alien", to pursue a sequel that would explore the engineered origins of the series's Alien creatures, and the "space jockey"âthe extraterrestrial being, who briefly appears in "Alien", as the deceased pilot of a derelict spaceship. "Alien" star Sigourney Weaver also expressed interest in returning to the series. "Aliens" director James Cameron discussed the potential for a sequel with Scott, and began working with another writer on a story for the film. It was then that 20th Century Fox approached Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series's monsters against the title characters of the "Predator" films; this project became the 2004 science fiction film "Alien vs. Predator". After Fox confirmed that it would pursue the crossover, Cameron stopped working on his own project, believing the crossover would "kill the validity of the franchise." In 2006, Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the "Alien" sequel project, believing that the series was Fox's asset, and he was unwilling to deal with the studio's attempts to influence the potential sequel.
