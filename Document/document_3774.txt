Some classifier-thing pairings are subjective, or if nothing else appear to current speakers to have no semantic inspiration. For example, the classifier ÃÂ "bÃÂ¹" might be utilized for motion pictures and books, yet in addition for vehicles and phones. A portion of this intervention might be because of what language specialist James Tai alludes to as "fossilization", whereby a tally classifier loses its importance through verifiable changes yet stays combined with certain things. For instance, the classifier ÃÂ "pÃÂ" utilized for ponies is negligible today, yet in Classical Chinese may have alluded to a "group of two steeds", a couple of steed skeletons, or the blending among man and pony. Discretion may likewise emerge when a classifier is acquired, alongside its thing, from a tongue in which it has an unmistakable importance to one in which it doesn't. In both these cases, the utilization of the classifier is recollected more by relationship with certain "prototypical" things, (for example, "horse") as opposed to by comprehension of semantic classifications, and accordingly discretion has been utilized as a contention for the model hypothesis of classifiers. Gao and Malt recommend that both the classification and model hypotheses are right: in their origination, a few classifiers comprise "all around characterized classifications", others make "model classifications", and still others are generally discretionary.
