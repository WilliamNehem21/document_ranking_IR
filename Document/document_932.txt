Following the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Admiralty saw the requirement for devoted battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and reserved "Australia" to lead one of them. On 11 January, while in transit to Jamaica, "Australia" was occupied to Gibraltar. Coming to there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was requested to continue to Plymouth, where she touched base on 28 January and satisfied for a short refit. The docking was finished on 12 February, and "Australia" came to Rosyth on 17 February in the wake of cruising through a hurricane. She was made lead of the second Battlecruiser Squadron (second BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, some portion of the British Grand Fleet, on 22 February. Bad habit Admiral Patey was named to direction this squadron. Toward the beginning of March, to maintain a strategic distance from a contention of status among Patey and the pioneer of the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty, Patey was reassigned toward the West Indies, and Rear Admiral William Pakenham raised his banner on board "Australia". English and Allied boats sent toward the North Sea were entrusted with shielding the British Isles from German maritime assault, and keeping the German High Seas Fleet wrote in European waters through an inaccessible bar while attempting to bait them into a definitive fight. Amid her time with the second BCS, "Australia"s activities essentially comprised of preparing works out (either in disconnection or with different boats), watches of the North Sea territory because of real or saw German developments, and some escort work. These obligations were so dreary, one mariner was made crazy.
