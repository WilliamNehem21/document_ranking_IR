"G. a. viridigularis" was viewed as a different animal varieties when depicted by Jonathan Dwight in 1918, however a year after, in 1919, Arthur Cleveland Bent proposed that the previous species be moved to its present situation as a subspecies. The dark throated crackpot was recently viewed as conspecific with the North American Pacific nut case, which was its subspecies, yet they have now been part into two species; there was no proof of the two interbreeding in territories where they happened together. Besides, the engineering of the air sacs in the lungs of the two species are essentially unique. This split was finished by the AOU in 1985. The phylogeny of this species is discussed, the dark throated nut case and the Pacific nut case customarily being viewed as sister species, while an investigation utilizing mitochondrial and atomic intron DNA upheld putting the dark throated crackpot sister to a clade comprising of the Pacific nut case and the two sister species that are the normal nut case and the yellow-charged nut case. This last investigation is reprimanded on the premise that it might shape a phylogeny on deficient ancestry arranging. In the previous phylogeny, the split between the Pacific crackpot and the dark throated nut case is proposed to have occurred about 6.5 million years back.
