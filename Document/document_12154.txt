Joan Anderman of "The Boston Globe" trusted that the tune is "outline topper for its sheer star control just as moment melodic appeal, and on the eve of Madonna's 50th birthday celebration [...] '4 Minutes' feels a ton like a symbol's can't-miss present to herself." However, she saw that the "move in the power structure [is nowhere] more obtrusive than on '4 Minutes', where Madonna sounds like an included visitor attempting to keep pace with Timbaland's goliath beats and Timberlake's deft tune." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic applauded the melodic and musical snare, yet was disillusioned that Madonna's voice is "muffled by Timbaland's flatulating four-note synth Ã¢ÂÂ which probably won't have been so terrible if the tracks were fresher and if the entire venture didn't feel so drearily mechanical." At the 51st Grammy Awards, "4 Minutes" earned Madonna, Timberlake and Timbaland a designation in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals class. Dutch artist Junkie XL likewise earned a designation in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical classification for his remix of the melody. While positioning Madonna's singles out of appreciation for her 60th birthday celebration, "The Guardian"s Jude Rogers put "4 Minutes" at number 35, composing that "Timbaland's synth-metal introduction here is awesome, and the melody's apocalypse magnificence still sounds well sharpened sharp", yet calling attention to that it would be "better without Timberlake".
