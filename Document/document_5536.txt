As the arrangement of "Inside No. 9" requires new characters every week, the journalists had the capacity to draw in on-screen characters who may have been reluctant to focus on a whole arrangement. Notwithstanding PembertonÃ¢ÂÂwho played Graham, the dadÃ¢ÂÂ"Last Gasp" featured Sophie Thompson as Jan, the mother; Lucy Hutchinson as 9-year-old Tamsin; David Bedella as popstar Frankie J Parsons; Tamsin Greig as Sally, of WishmakerUK; and Adam Deacon as Si, Parsons' right hand. It was the primary scene of the program not to star Shearsmith. For Kerr, the regular trouble related with the utilization of youngster on-screen characters was absent in "Last Gasp"; for him, Hutchinson "was radiant. She was splendid; she had development past her years." Pemberton and Shearsmith had been quick to use "Inside No. 9" as a vehicle to work with new individuals, and had been quick to team up with Greig for quite a while. Kerr said that "one of the genuine delights of "Inside No. 9"" was the chance to see performing artists in altogether different jobs to those in which they had recently featured. He utilized Greig as his model, saying that the character of Sally was to some degree not quite the same as the jobs in which Greig had recently performed.
