Chris and Sheva board the tanker and experience Gionne, who escapes in the wake of dropping an instance of syringes; Sheva keeps a few. Whenever Chris and Sheva achieve the fundamental deck, Wesker reports over the ship's radio that he has deceived Gionne and tainted her with Uroboros. She transforms into a goliath beast, which Chris and Sheva rout. Valentine radios in, telling Chris and Sheva that Wesker must take exact, customary dosages of an infection to keep up his quality and speed; a bigger or littler portion would harm him. Sheva understands that Gionne's syringes are dosages of the medication. Chris and Sheva pursue Wesker to an aircraft stacked with rockets containing the Uroboros infection, infusing him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker attempts to escape on the aircraft; Chris and Sheva impair it, making him crash-land in a spring of gushing lava. FuriousÃ¢ÂÂ Wesker opens himself to Uroboros and pursues Chris and Sheva through the well of lava. They battle him, and the debilitated Wesker falls into the magma before Chris and Sheva are protected by a helicopter, which is directed by Valentine and Stone. As a diminishing Wesker endeavors to drag the helicopter into the spring of gushing lava, Chris and Sheva fire rocket-impelled explosives at Wesker, slaughtering him. In the diversion's last cutscene, Chris thinks about whether the world merits battling for. Taking a gander at Sheva and Valentine, he chooses to live in a world without dread.
