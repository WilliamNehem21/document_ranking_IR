"The Simpsons Game" was distributed by Electronic Arts and created by its backup, EA Redwood Shores; the organization had marked an agreement for the computer game rights to "The Simpsons" in 2005. The amusement's lead architect, Greg Rizzer, said that when he inquired as to whether they could spoof some Electronic Arts recreations including "Award of Honor", they were energetic about it. "The Simpsons Game", which spoofs computer games from 30 years before 2007, was compelled to have a portion of its substance expelled after a few computer game organizations whined about it. Rizzer, in any case, was as yet satisfied with the measure of farce in the amusement and considered "The Simpsons" the "ideal vehicle to make jokes about the diversions business". At the 2007 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany, a notice for "Stupendous Theft Scratchy", one of the dimensions in "The Simpsons Game" and a farce of "Fantastic Theft Auto", was approached to be brought somewhere near a representative of Rockstar Games, the organization that builds up the "Amazing Theft Auto" arrangement of computer games. A few organizations, notwithstanding, grasped the amusement's farce of their computer games, including designers from Harmonix, who were satisfied with the diversion's "Sitar Hero", a spoof of Harmonix's "Guitar Hero" computer game. Notwithstanding amusement spoofs, "The Simpsons Game" likewise includes a few appearances with ironical twists, including Matt Groening as himself and Will Wright as an enemy.
