In December 1986, Bono expressed that he had a loveÃ¢ÂÂ despise association with America, and this affected his work on the collection. Discussing his experience with COMADRES in El Salvador and their effect on the melody, he stated, "There's no doubt in my psyche of the Reagan Administration's association in maneuvering the routine that is perpetrating these abominations. I question if the general population of America are even mindful of this. It's not my situation to address them or reveal to them their place or to try and open their eyes up to it in a visual manner, yet it is influencing me and it influences the words I compose and the music we make." In 2007, Clayton noted "We were taking a gander at this America through an European focal point, when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the diggers... So we were singing from a similar psalm sheet as the Clash however with our spotlight concentrated on shamefulness inside and outside America." He said "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not only a reflection on what had occurred under the military government in Chile yet in addition at the US which had upheld that administration", and portrayed Bono's vocals as "ancient", saying "it interfaces with something extremely crude."
