On November 9, 1942, not long after subsequent to making his reports to Roosevelt and the American individuals, Willkie contended the instance of "Schneiderman v. US" under the steady gaze of the Supreme Court. William Schneiderman, secretary of the California Communist Party, was a naturalized American until the legislature disavowed his citizenship, expressing that he had covered his participation on his application for naturalization in 1927. Two lower government courts maintained the denaturalization. Speaking to a socialist, even in wartime, did nothing to shore up Willkie's reducing support in the Republican Party, yet he kept in touch with a companion saying, "I am certain I am directly in speaking to Schneiderman. Of the considerable number of times when common freedoms ought to be shielded, it is currently." In his contention Willkie cited Lincoln and Jefferson by saying that the general population could, in the event that they esteemed it important, revamp the administration, and he expressed that Marx's perspective on transformation was mellow by examination. In 1943, the Supreme Court ruled for Schneiderman, 5Ã¢ÂÂ 3, reestablishing his citizenship. Despite the fact that Willkie shunned censuring Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans, he expressed in a discourse that war was no reason for denying gatherings of individuals of their rights. He stood up against the individuals who reprimanded the Jews for the war, cautioning against "witch-hanging and horde teasing". For his exercises, he got the American Hebrew Medal for 1942.
