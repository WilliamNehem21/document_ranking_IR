The second hypothesis recommends that the Jupiter trojans were caught amid the relocation of the goliath planets depicted in the Nice model. In the Nice model the circles of the goliath planets ended up precarious years after the Solar System's development when Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 mean-movement reverberation. Experiences between planets brought about Uranus and Neptune being dispersed outward into the primordial Kuiper belt, upsetting it and tossing a large number of articles internal. Whenever Jupiter and Saturn were close to their 1:2 reverberation the circles of prior Jupiter trojans ended up temperamental amid an optional reverberation with Jupiter and Saturn. This happened when the time of the trojans' libration about their Lagrangian point had a 3:1 proportion to the period at which the position where Jupiter passes Saturn coursed with respect to its perihelion. This procedure was likewise reversible permitting a small amount of the various articles dissipated internal by Uranus and Neptune to enter this area and be caught as Jupiter's and Saturn's circles isolated. These new trojans had a wide scope of tendencies, the consequence of different experiences with the mammoth planets before being caught. This procedure can likewise happen later when Jupiter and Saturn cross more fragile resonances.
