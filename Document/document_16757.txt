Following the action Stuart remained with Campbell and Loveless as Inspectors of Shipping, choosing those vessels they believed to be best suited to Q-ship work for naval service. After some time ashore all three returned to sea in a vessel they had personally chosen, an old, battered tramp steamer named SS "Vittoria". Renaming it , they armed their vessel with a gun, two twelve pounders, two machine guns, torpedo tubes and depth charges. Thus armed the "Pargust" departed on her first patrol to the same grounds where "U-83" had been sunk, in the waters south of Ireland. For the first few days her duties consisted only of rescuing survivors from sunken cargo ships but with increasing German activity, an attack was expected at any moment. On 7 June 1917, "Pargust" was suddenly struck by a torpedo fired at very close range from an unseen German submarine. Unlike the "Farnborough" action, the damage done to the "Pargust" was immense. The ship was holed close to the waterline, and its cover was almost blown when one of the twelve pounder gun ports was blasted free from its mounting; it was only the quick thinking of sailor William Williams, who took the full weight of the gun port on himself, that prevented the gun being exposed. One petty officer was killed and a number wounded.
