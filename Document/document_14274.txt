In 1902, Guillaume Grandidier portrayed subfossil carnivoran stays from two gives in on Madagascar as a bigger "assortment" of the living fossa ("Cryptoprocta ferox"), "C. ferox" var. "spelea". G. Petit, writing in 1935, considered "spelea" to speak to an unmistakable animal varieties. Charles Lamberton surveyed subfossil and living "Cryptoprocta" in 1939 and concurred with Petit in perceiving two species, naming this species from an example found at Ankazoabo Cave close Itampolo. The particular name "spelea" signifies "cavern" and was given as a result of the area of its disclosure. In any case, Lamberton obviously had at most three skeletons of the living fossa, not almost enough to catch the scope of variety in that species, and some later creators did not separate "C.ÃÂ spelea" and "C.ÃÂ ferox" as species. Steven Goodman and associates, utilizing bigger examples, ordered another arrangement of "Cryptoprocta" estimations that was distributed in a 2004 article. They found that some subfossil "Cryptoprocta" fell outside the scope of variety of living "C.ÃÂ ferox", and distinguished those as speaking to "C.ÃÂ spelea". Grandidier had not assigned a sort example for the species, and to look after "C.ÃÂ spelea" as the name for the bigger type of the fossa, Goodman and partners assigned an example to fill in as the sort example (explicitly, a neotype).
