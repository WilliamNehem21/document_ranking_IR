Harrison's creation started gathering spread forms very quickly after the arrival of "Nunnery Road". Notwithstanding Joe Cocker, Peggy Lee and Tony Bennett each issued accounts of the tune toward the finish of 1969. Lena Horne recorded "Something" in the jazz style for her 1970 collection with guitarist Gabor Szabo, titled "Lena and Gabor". An instrumental form by Booker T. and the M.G.'s, from their "Convent Road" tribute collection "McLemore Avenue", topped at number 76 on the "Board" Hot 100 in August 1970. Different craftsmen who discharged fronts of the melody that year incorporate Della Reese, Nancy Sinatra, Perry Como, Karina, Duane Eddy, the Ray Conniff Singers, Jerry Butler, Johnny Mathis, Engelbert Humperdinck, Isaac Hayes, King Curtis, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, Ferrante and Teicher and the Shadows.
