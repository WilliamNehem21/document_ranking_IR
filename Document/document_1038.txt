On 2 June the French liner "Jamaique" announced a little vessel, flying the British banner and steaming southwards, close to the Bissagos Islands south of Dakar. In spite of the fact that this was at first thought to be "Young lady Pat", the following revealed locating, on 9 June, was more than toward the west, on the opposite side of the Atlantic. Chief Jones of the "Lorraine Cross," an American ship, cabled Lloyds' operators in Georgetown, British Guiana (presently Guyana) with a record of a little ship flying a pain motion off the South American coast, north-east of Cayenne. There were clearly four men ready. The pontoon's name and markings had been painted out, yet she professed to be the "Margaret Harold" headed for Trinidad from London. Jones thought the team's conduct suspicious, and when he requested to see the ship's papers, the ship brought down the trouble flag and dashed away. Jones said the vessel was "without a doubt a British angler", and thought it was "Young lady Pat". In Grimsby, a Marstrand representative communicated little amazement at this new area, and affirmed that the ship had adequate speed to have crossed the sea in the time since her last affirmed locating. A check with Lloyd's shown that there was no enrolled ship named "Margaret Harold".
