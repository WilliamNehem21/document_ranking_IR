Johnson was associated with another authoritative question amid the Australian leg of the battle. Cec PepperÃ¢ÂÂwhom colleagues Miller and Dick Whitington viewed as a standout amongst the best all rounders on the planet and a sureness for Australian Test determinationÃ¢ÂÂadvanced for leg before wicket against Australian commander Don Bradman in the match against South Australia. The intrigue was turned down and Pepper whined to the umpire Jack Scott, inciting BradmanÃ¢ÂÂwho was likewise an individual from the Australian Board of Control and the leading body of the South Australian Cricket AssociationÃ¢ÂÂto ask Scott whether Pepper's conduct was worthy. As he was a representative of the SACA, Scott offered an explanation to Bradman, and he held up a grumbling about Pepper to the Australian Board of Control. Pepper was never chosen for Australia. Cricket antiquarian Gideon Haigh said that "Johnson was plainly steamed at the undertaking, and furthermore by the disappointment of the [national] choice board [Bradman among them]ÃÂ ... to send Pepper, second just to Miller as a cricketer in the Services XI, to New Zealand". Johnson endeavored to mediate for Pepper's benefit, without much of any result, in spite of the fact that the other board individuals asserted that no weight had been set on the selectors to prohibit Pepper.
