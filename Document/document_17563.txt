Throughout England, he gave many successful concerts, including the premiere of the first work dedicated to him: [[Hamilton Harty]]'s Violin Concerto. Also during this time, Szigeti toured with an all-star ensemble including legendary singer [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]] and pianists [[Ferruccio Busoni]] and [[Wilhelm Backhaus]]. [[Philippe Gaubert]], a famous French flutist of the day, as well as the young singer [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], were also part of these tours.

The most significant of the new contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference brought on by the then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoniâparticularly through their careful study of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] [[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)|"Chaconne"]]â"shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency".
