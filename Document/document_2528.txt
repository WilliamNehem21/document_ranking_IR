The most punctual recommendations for the security of Biscayne Bay were a piece of proposition by Everglades National Park advocate Ernest F. Coe, whose proposed Everglades park limits included Biscayne Bay, its keys, inside nation including what are currently Homestead and Florida City, and Key Largo. Biscayne Bay, Key Largo and the abutting inland expansions were cut from Everglades National Park before its foundation in 1947. At the point when recommendations to create Elliott Key surfaced in 1960, Lloyd Miller solicited Secretary from the Interior Stewart Udall to send a Park Service surveillance group to survey the Biscayne Bay territory for consideration in the national park framework. A good report resulted, and with money related assistance from Herbert Hoover, Jr., political help was requested, most quite from Congressman Fascell. A territory of Elliott Key was at this point a piece of the Dade County park framework. The 1966 report noticed the proposed park contained the best residual zones of tropical woods in Florida and an uncommon blend of "earthly, marine and land and/or water capable life," just as noteworthy recreational esteem. The report found the most noteworthy ideals of the potential park were "the unmistakable, shimmering waters, marine life, and the submerged terrains of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Here in shallow water is a veritable wonderland."
