Development through the chasm was slower and considerably more troublesome, and the section couldn't completely open until December 14, 1973. To help revive development, the territory of Utah lent a bit of their government thruway assets to Arizona. Despite the fact that the roadway is of little significance to the transportation needs of Arizona, as it doesn't interface any Arizona people group, it serves as an essential connection between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas and Los Angeles toward the southwest. In spite of additional financing, in any case, challenges remained. Streak flooding and sand trap in the chasm more than once caused issues, with hardware and materials clearly vanishing medium-term. More terrible, the undertaking was to guarantee a real existence, when in October 1969, a helicopter performing surveillance on the crevasse smashed because of wind, slaughtering the pilot. To help explore the crevasse's rough and unforgiving landscape, a unique bit of hardware called a marsh surrey must be brought from Texas. Indeed, even with this assistance, the course still requested development of four scaffolds over Virgin River. The westernmost scaffold and the extension conveying the northbound paths at the third scaffold area from the west were finished in 1972. By 1973, each of the five scaffolds were at last total.
