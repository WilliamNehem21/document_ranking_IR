McLaren's mastery proceeded all through , and the Prost-Senna battle for matchless quality put them on an impact course. Common reverence swung to hard and fast disdain, with the Frenchman blaming his Brazilian colleague for ""unsafe driving"" and of accepting in excess of a decent amount of consideration from both McLaren and Honda. As far as concerns him, Senna blamed Prost for being in the pocket of FISA's French president Jean-Marie Balestre. The ill will between the two drivers reached a critical stage at Round 2 in San Marino. The drivers made an understanding between them that whoever won the begin would not be tested by the other going into the principal turn (for this situation, the Tosa twist on the Imola circuit). Prost kept to the understanding after Senna won the primary begin. Prost anyway won the restart (brought about by Gerhard Berger's red hot accident in his Ferrari), however was passed by Senna under brakes for Tosa. Prost went to a companion of his, a French columnist, and enlightened him concerning the broken understanding among him and Senna. Against Prost's desires, the columnist opened up to the world about the story. Amid testing at Pembrey in Wales, Senna denied in open any such understanding had ever existed among himself and Prost, yet the Frenchman's case was supported up by Marlboro's John Hogan who had been available when the understanding was made.
