Likely before they made an official NASA trek to Europe in November 1971, the Apollo 15 space explorers got and finished the administrative work important to open records in a Stuttgart-territory bank to get the concurred $7,000 installments. As indicated by Scott's declaration, while they were in Europe, they heard the Sieger covers were being sold monetarily. Scott called Eiermann, who guaranteed to investigate it. The space explorers demonstrated they got the bankbooks in mid 1972. Irwin recollected in his life account that before their outing to Europe, Scott came to him and stated, "Jim, we are stuck in an unfortunate situation nowÃ¢ÂÂthey are beginning to sell the envelopes over yonder", and that the spreads cast a shadow over their European trek. Scott said the group talked about it among themselves, at that point chose that the receipt of assets was ill-advised. In late February they restored the bankbooks to Eiermann, who reacted that the space explorers ought to get something for their endeavors. Howard C. Weinberger, in his record of the Apollo 15 covers, regarded the space explorers' refusal "a push to spare their vocations and notorieties". The group at first consented to acknowledge collections loaded up with aviation themed stamps for their kids, incorporating issues to pay tribute to Apollo 15. Scott related that they chose this also was inappropriate and said they don't needed anything. This last refusal occurred in April 1972. Worden recalled that, "we did this before NASA got some information about an arrangement with SiegerÃ¢ÂÂbefore NASA even thought about it".
