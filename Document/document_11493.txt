As a result of the loss of his dad, Skelton got down to business as right on time as the age of seven, selling papers and doing other unspecialized temp jobs to support his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He immediately took in the newsy's patter and would keep it up until a planned purchaser purchased a duplicate of the paper just to calm him. As indicated by later records, Skelton's initial enthusiasm for turning into a performer originated from an episode that occurred in Vincennes around 1923, when an outsider, as far as anyone knows the entertainer Ed Wynn, drew nearer Skelton, who was the paperboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. At the point when the man asked Skelton what occasions were going on nearby, Skelton recommended he see the new show around the local area. The man bought each paper Skelton had, giving enough cash to the kid to buy a ticket for himself. The outsider ended up being one of the show's stars, who later took the kid behind the stage to acquaint him with different entertainers. The experience incited Skelton, who had just appeared propensities, to seek after a profession as an entertainer.
