As the undertaking left to climb the mountain, a long pack train of about fifty officers, troopers and local aides withdrew from the town of Orizaba toward the beginning of May 1848. Following a few days of climbing through thick wilderness, the undertaking gradually picked up height and built up a base camp at . Beginning from base camp in the early morning of May 10 about two dozen climbers made the last push to the highest point of the mountain, yet just Raynolds and a couple of others achieved the summit. As per mountain climber and creator Leigh N. Ortenburger, this accomplishment may have accidentally set the American mountaineering height record for the following 50ÃÂ years. Raynolds evaluated the summit of Pico de Orizaba to be above ocean level, which was somewhat more prominent than past appraisals however beneath the cutting edge known height. As no higher pinnacles were known in North America around then, Raynolds trusted Pico de Orizaba was the tallest mountain on the landmass. The summit cavity was canvassed in snow yet evaluated to be between in width and profound. The American accomplishment was questioned by the Mexicans until a 1851 French undertaking found an American banner on the summit with the year 1848 cut in the flagpole.
