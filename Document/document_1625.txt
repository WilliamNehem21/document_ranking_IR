The historical background of "Mirza" astounded specialists for a long time. Dim regularly made puzzling and unexplained scientific classificationsÃ¢ÂÂa pattern not just proceeded with his portrayal of "Mirza" in 1870, yet additionally with the genera "Phaner" (fork-stamped lemurs) and "Azema" (for "M.ÃÂ rufus", presently an equivalent word for "Microcebus"), the two of which were depicted in a similar distribution. In 1904, American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer endeavored to archive the derivations of all mammalian taxa, however couldn't authoritatively clarify these three genera. For "Mirza", Palmer just noticed that it got from the Persian title mÃÂ®rzÃÂ¢ ("ruler"), a view probably upheld by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. Be that as it may, in light of the fact that the reference to Persian sovereigns may have originated from "Bedouin Nights", a mainstream bit of writing at the time, Dunkel "et al." likewise looked through the general writing distributed around 1870. The source of every one of the three names was found in a British satire "The Palace of Truth" by W. S. Gilbert, which debuted in London on 19ÃÂ NovemberÃÂ 1870, almost one and a half weeks before the date composed on the prelude of Gray's original copy (additionally distributed in London). The parody highlighted characters bearing each of the three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The creators presumed that Gray had seen the satire and after that based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.
