In 1952Ã¢ÂÂ 3, Brooke-Little served on the staff amassed by the Earl Marshal to design the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He was designated a Gold Staff Officer for the Coronation and held a key co-appointment job amid arranging just as on the day. It was his withstanding enthusiasm for heraldry that prompted this arrangement, and this work with the Earl Marshal and the officers of arms prompted his first heraldic arrangement. He joined the College of Arms as Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1956. The position of pursuivant is the lesser of the three dimensions an officer of arms can accomplish, and Brooke-Little related the tale of his arrangement in a publication. In 1956, Sir George Bellew, the Garter King of Arms, had suggested Brooke-Little and Colin Cole for the vacant position of Bluemantle. The two were approached to meet with the Earl Marshal in London. The Earl Marshal was not generally looked with two possibility for an opening; he offered the situation to Cole, who turned it down as his better half was anticipating a kid. Brooke-Little was made Bluemantle. A while later when Sir Gerald Wollaston kicked the bucket, in the following mix Cole was at last given his arrangement as Portcullis Pursuivant.
