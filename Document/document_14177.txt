Bumper's structure dunked in 1924 after a decent begin with bat and ball; from that point, regardless of intermittent victories, he needed consistency. Surrey completed third in the Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all five star matches. By and by, Fender was a contender for the England captaincyÃ¢ÂÂSouth Africa played a Test arrangement that season, and the MCC were to visit Australia in 1924Ã¢ÂÂ 25. The inevitable arrangement of Arthur Gilligan was scrutinized in the press, which again theorized why Fender was not picked. Bumper's prospects of driving England subsided further when he conflicted again with Lord Harris. The MCC had censured two province councils for covering their pitches preceding matches against the South Africans amid a spell of wet climate. Bumper called attention to in a letter distributed by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC knew this was basic practice at the Scarborough Festival, in spite of their cases despite what might be expected. At the point when Fender next played at Lord's, the irate Lord Harris called Fender to counsel him. Bumper dependably lamented his tactlessness and trusted it completed any opportunity he had of the England captaincy. Bumper played in the initial two Tests, absent much achievement, and was dropped; he played just a single more Test in his profession. Gilligan was harmed amid the arrangement, yet the selectors reviewed Douglas as skipper as opposed to choose Fender. At the point when the group to visit Australia that winter was picked, Fender was not chosen, a choice which upset him profoundly. Bumper was hitched toward the finish of the 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season expounded on the MCC voyage through Australia for the "Every day Express".
