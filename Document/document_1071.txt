The impact of the social request on the organization of the regiment as of now can be seen from an occurrence in 1847. It included a contradiction between Lord FitzHardinge, Lord-Lieutenant of Gloucestershire, and his sibling, Grantley Berkeley, an individual from parliament and chief of the Berkeley Troop, which had joined the regiment in 1840. In seeking after his complaint against his sibling, FitzHardinge constrained his occupants into leaving from the troop and undermined some with the loss of their homesteads in the event that they didn't. Further understanding into the regiment's solid connections to the cultivating network can be found in the records of the yearly activities. In 1865, the perpetual obligation was conceded until the fall because of an early gather, and investment in a noteworthy 14-day practice in 1871 was dropped because of a late collect. Participation at the yearly gatherings dipped under 300 men in the late 1870s and mid 1880s, contrasted with 445 of every 1875, because of a progression of terrible harvests. In 1890, the regiment bragged four Masters Hounds and an extensive number of fox seekers in its participation, the two officers and different positions, and that year it embraced an old chasing melody, "D'ye ken John Peel", as its regimental walk.
