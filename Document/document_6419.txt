Early scenes concentrated on fundamental subjects, for example, hues and numbers, yet later the projects concentrated on math, material science, life systems, and cosmology. The show's makers trusted that perception and consideration were unequivocally associated, so they composed the scenes to empower and build their watchers' consideration. They utilized substance and generation attributes, for example, pacing which gave youngsters time to react, just as "camera strategies, kids' voices, melodic signs, audio cues, clear advances, repeatable exchange, and visuals." Participation, as spoken or physical reaction from the gathering of people, and the dominance of reasoning abilities were energized by the utilization of redundancy, both inside the structure of individual scenes and over numerous scenes. The makers utilized an assortment of formal highlights, which were sound-related, and content highlights, which comprised of solicitations given to the group of onlookers, for example, "Will you help?" The highlights were likewise as both intermittent and one of a kind arrangements and substance.
