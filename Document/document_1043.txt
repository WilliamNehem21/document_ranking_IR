At the point when the USFWS actualized the translocation program, it likewise endeavored, in 1986, to execute "zonal administration" of the Californian populace. To deal with the challenge between ocean otters and fisheries, it pronounced a "sans otter zone" extending from Point Conception to the Mexican outskirt. In this zone, just San Nicolas Island was assigned as ocean otter living space, and ocean otters found somewhere else in the zone should be caught and migrated. These plans were deserted after many translocated otters passed on and furthermore as it demonstrated unfeasible to catch the several otters which disregarded guidelines and swam into the zone. Be that as it may, in the wake of participating in a time of open editorial in 2005, the Fish and Wildlife Service neglected to discharge a formal choice on the issue. At that point, because of claims documented by the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center and the Otter Project, on 19 December 2012 the USFWS announced that the "no otter zone" analyze was a disappointment, and will secure the otters re-colonizing the coast south of Point Conception as compromised species. Despite the fact that abalone angler accused the invasions of ocean otters for the decrease of abalone, business abalone angling in southern California arrived at an end from overfishing in 1997, years before noteworthy otter moved south of Point Conception. What's more, white abalone ("Haliotis sorenseni"), a species never covering with ocean otter, had declined in numbers 99% by 1996, and turned into the main marine invertebrate to be governmentally recorded as imperiled.
