On MarchÂ 21, a tropical disturbance quickly developed in the monsoon trough in the south-central Indian Ocean, about 1250Â km (775Â mi) east of Diego Garcia. A ridge to the south steered the system to the west-southwest, and moderate wind shear in the region prevented significant strengthening. The convection slowly organized, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ikala early on MarchÂ 25. By that time, the shear had decreased, although initially it was strong enough to prevent the convection from covering the center. An approaching cold front turned the storm to the southeast on MarchÂ 25, where upper-level conditions became more favorable for strengthening. Thunderstorms increased over the center, and an eye began developing on MarchÂ 26. The next day, Ikala intensified into a tropical cyclone, reaching peak winds of 165Â km/h (105Â mph) according to MFR; the JTWC estimated peak 1âminute winds of 205Â km/h (125Â mph). Shortly after peaking, increased wind shear and drier air from the front quickly weakened Ikala, and it deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on MarchÂ 28. That day, the center became exposed from the convection, and on MarchÂ 29 Ikala became extratropical. The remnants turned to the southwest before recurving to the southeast on MarchÂ 31, and Ikala was absorbed by a cold front on AprilÂ 3.
