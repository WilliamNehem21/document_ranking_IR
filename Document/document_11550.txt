Upon its discharge, "Aries" got blended responses from music pundits. AllMusic manager Jose F. Promis gave the collection 2.5 stars out of five and observed the songs to be "here and there excessively syrupy". He complimented a portion of the move tunes, for example, "Smooth" and "Woman Tu Amor", however said "Luz Verde" was a "fairly dated endeavor at mid '90s Latin hip-jump R&B". A music columnist for "Board" magazine composed a good audit of "Aries", expressing that Miguel "exchanges nostalgic boleros for an a la mode, cutting-edge bundle" and called "Ayer" an "impeccable progress track from "Sentiment"". "Chicago Tribune" music pundit Achy Obejas gave the record 2.5 stars out of four, calling it "a sort of center ground among "Sentiment" and its rich songs, and the fun fly of "20 AÃÂ±os," its quick precursor". She commended Miguel's vocals as "brilliantly nuanced and sensational", and said the numbers for the most part "work", yet that "the uptempo tunes crash and burn more often than not". Enrique Lopetegui of the "Los Angeles Times" gave the collection three stars out of four; he commended Miguel's consideration of "solid components of jazz and funk into his cleaned sound" and said he "comes back to a commonplace area joined by his standard radiant courses of action and musicianship".
