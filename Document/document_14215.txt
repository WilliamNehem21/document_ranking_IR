One part of raccoon conduct is so outstanding that it gives the creature part of its logical name, "Procyon lotor"; "lotor" is neo-Latin for "washer". In the wild, raccoons regularly fiddle for submerged nourishment close to the shore-line. They at that point regularly get the sustenance thing with their front paws to look at it and rub the thing, at times to expel undesirable parts. This gives the presence of the raccoon "washing" the nourishment. The material affectability of raccoons' paws is expanded if this scouring activity is performed submerged, since the water relaxes the hard layer covering the paws. In any case, the conduct saw in hostage raccoons in which they convey their nourishment to water to "wash" or splash it before eating has not been seen in nature. Naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, trusted that raccoons don't have satisfactory spit creation to soak sustenance accordingly requiring splashing, yet this theory is presently viewed as wrong. Hostage raccoons drench their nourishment all the more much of the time when a watering opening with a format like a stream isn't more distant away than . The broadly acknowledged hypothesis is that drenching in hostage raccoons is a fixed activity design from the dallying conduct performed when scrounging at shores for amphibian nourishments. This is upheld by the perception that sea-going nourishments are soaked all the more much of the time. Cleaning filthy sustenance does not appear to be a purpose behind "washing". Specialists have provided reason to feel ambiguous about the veracity of perceptions of wild raccoons soaking nourishment.
