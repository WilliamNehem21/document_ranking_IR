The regiment was reconstituted in the surveillance job in 1947, furnished at first with Daimler Armored Cars which were later supplanted by Ferret scout vehicles. On 27ÃÂ May 1962, another Guidon was introduced for the benefit of the Queen by Colonel the Duke of Beaufort at Badminton House, and in 1963 the regiment was conceded the Freedom of Gloucester. In 1967, after a revamping of the TA, the regiment was diminished to a squadron and joined with components of the North Somerset and Bristol Yeomanry, the fifth Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment and the Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery to frame the Wessex Volunteers. A further rearrangement in 1969 diminished the squadron to a unit of eight men, however it was extended two years after the fact to give the regimental HQ and two squadrons in the infantry-roled Wessex Yeomanry, which in 1979 turned into the Royal Wessex Yeomanry. In 1983, the new yeomanry regiment was outfitted with stripped-down Land Rovers and took on the surveillance job. It was additionally revamped and re-purposed as a heavily clad hold regiment during the 1990s, entrusted with the arrangement of swap teams for the ordinary armed force's Challenger 2 tanks. The Gloucestershire yeomanry ancestry is kept up in the Royal Wessex Yeomanry by C (Royal Gloucestershire Hussars) Squadron.
