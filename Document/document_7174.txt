Essayist Neville Cardus portrayed Chapman as "the student's fantasy of the ideal commander of an England cricket eleven. He was tall, thin, constantly energetic, and pink and plump of face. His left-gave batting blended splendor and graceÃÂ ... His cricket was sentimental in its vaunting vitality however exemplary fit as a fiddle." While batting, Chapman constantly attempted to assault the bowling; in spite of the fact that this implied he committed errors which brought about his rejection, it implied that he could change the course of an amusement in a brief timeframe. Cricket essayist R. C. Robertson-Glasgow depicted him as: "Tall, solid, and agile, he was a left-gave hitter with universal protection, quite a bit of which was rendered pointless by an immense reach, and a capacity to drive great length balls over the head of mid-off, bowler, and mid-on. His spread driving, as well, was massively solid." Gibson takes note of that Chapman's profession batting figures were great, however that faultfinders trusted that, with his ability, he ought to have scored more runs. Gibson expresses: "When Chapman was going admirably, he looked very on a par with Woolley [his Kent and England group mate] at the opposite end, and in the mid-1920s there was no other English left-hander, potentially no other England batsman at all aside from Hobbs, of whom that could be said." His expanded load during the 1930s denied him of certainty and backed him off to the point where his batting declined. When batting, Chapman typically wore the Quidnuncs top.
