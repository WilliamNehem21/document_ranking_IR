In January 1164 the ruler gathered a chamber at Clarendon. The diocesans were solicited to support the Constitutions from Clarendon, which proposed confinements on the forces of the Church and breaking points to ecclesiastical specialist in England; Becket's refusal prompted the incredible question among ruler and diocese supervisor, into which Foliot and his kindred religious administrators were definitely drawn. At the point when Becket showed up under the steady gaze of the court with his archiepiscopal cross borne before him, a contemplated affront to the lord, Foliot told the diocese supervisor that "If the ruler were to display his sword, as you currently shake yours, what expectation can there be of harmony between you?" The lord wouldn't see Becket, and dealings between the two camps before long uncovered that Becket had requested the religious administrators to won't condemn him and undermined them with suspension from ministerial office in the event that they did. Becket likewise took steps to claim the case to the papacy. Both of these activities by the diocese supervisor broke the Constitutions of Clarendon. Amid the resulting forward and backward between the ministers and the ruler, just as the diocesans and the ecclesiastical overseer, Foliot was solicited by one from his kindred religious administrators to attempt and induce Becket to alter his conduct. Foliot answered that Becket "was dependably a trick and dependably will be".
