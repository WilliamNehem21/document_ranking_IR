Of the foremost four caudal vertebrae, the anteriormost two are exceptionally inadequate. Both of the short, yet more extensive than-tall, centra save hints of the sideways projections (transverse procedures) found in other vertebrae, which are extremely low on the sides contrasted with following caudals. The neural spines are exceptionally flimsy, diminishing to a solitary edge in front (the prespinal lamina), however having two spinopostzygapophyseal laminae like the dorsals. The fourth caudal is the most total front caudal. The centrum is sunken in front, however level behind (amphiplatyan). There are no pleurocoels not at all like the dorsals, and the transverse procedures start in the top portion of the centrum. The centrum is long, tall and wide, with the absolute vertebra being tall. Foremost caudals of the "Cetiosaurus leedsi" example NHMUK R1984 are fundamentally the same as those of "Cetiosauriscus", yet the neural curves are not as tall in "C. leedsi", and the transverse procedures come up short on a conspicuous edge along the highest point of them. Center and back caudals from an almost nonstop arrangement of 27 bones are very much saved in "Cetiosauriscus". The later vertebrae are somewhat more prolong than those in front, and marginally less inward in their foremost face. Moving towards the finish of the tail the centra lessen in size and the transverse procedures recoil until they are totally missing, with the neural spines getting to be shorter, more slender, and increasingly inclined. The seventh vertebrae of the arrangement, at tall, is long, just a single cm longer than the 21st of a similar arrangement that is tall. A distinctive normal for "Cetiosauriscus" is the nearness of a front-to-back concavity on the highest point of the foremost and center caudal neural spines.
