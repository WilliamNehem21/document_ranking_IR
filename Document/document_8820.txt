The contention re-surfaced in 1149, when a portion of the priests of St Augustine's, drove by their earlier and sacrist, would not comply with the forbid put on England by Theobald and Pope Eugene III. Theobald had the two authorities banished and openly whipped. At the point when the past abbot of St Augustine's kicked the bucket in 1151, the earlier, Silvester, paid the lord for the privilege to regulate the nunnery and to hold a free decision for another abbot. The priests at that point continued to choose Silvester as the new abbot, however Theobald would not affirm the race, blaming Silvester for purchasing the workplace. In the end, be that as it may, Pope Eugene III arranged Theobald to permit Silvester to take up the workplace, which Theobald did in August 1152. Theobald and St Augustine's additionally clashed over the nunnery's cases of exception from the ecclesiastical overseers' oversight, since it owed dutifulness legitimately to the pope. Ecclesiastical reports held at Rome supported the convent, yet there were no English illustrious sanctions that gave the monastery its freedom from the diocese supervisors. Theobald endeavored to end the perplexity by lawful activities both at Rome and in England, yet the record was blended. The records at Rome obviously supported the convent, however at an illustrious gathering held at Northampton in 1157, Henry II decided for Theobald. As a feature of the settlement Silvester, as abbot, was required to make a formal calling of acquiescence to Theobald, something he had been endeavoring to keep away from since his race. The battle with Silvester was only one occasion in the long history of the debate among Canterbury and St Augustine's.
