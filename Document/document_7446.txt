In the desire for accessing the best in class assets of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman went to an address on crafted by Austrian rocket engineer Eugen SÃÂ¤nger and speculative above-stratospheric airplane by the foundation's William BollayÃ¢ÂÂa PhD understudy gaining practical experience in rocket-controlled flying machineÃ¢ÂÂand moved toward him to express their enthusiasm for structuring a fluid fuel rocket engine. Bollay diverted them to another PhD understudy named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical designer forming a proposition on rocket drive who shared their interests and before long become friends with the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina connected for financing from Caltech together; they didn't specify that their definitive goal was to create rockets for space investigation, understanding that the majority of the logical foundation at that point consigned such plans to sci-fi. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan promptly repelled them, Malina's doctoral counselor Theodore von KÃÂ¡rmÃÂ¡n saw more guarantee in their proposition and consented to enable them to work under the sponsorship of the college's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they accessed Caltech's master gear, however the financial aspects of the Great Depression left von KÃÂ¡rmÃÂ¡n unfit to fund them.
