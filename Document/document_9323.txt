As a kid, Rabi was keen on science. He read science books acquired from the open library and assembled his own radio set. His first logical paper, on the structure of a radio condenser, was distributed in "Present day Electrics" when he was in grade school. In the wake of finding out about Copernican heliocentrism, he turned into a nonbeliever. "It's everything extremely straightforward", he told his folks, including, "Who needs God?" As a trade off with his folks, for his Bar Mitzvah, which was held at home, he gave a discourse in Yiddish about how an electric light functions. He went to the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, from which he graduated in 1916. Soon thereafter, he entered Cornell University as an electrical building understudy, however before long changed to science. After the American passage into World War I in 1917, he joined the Student Army Training Corps at Cornell. For his senior proposal, he examined the oxidation conditions of manganese. He was granted his Bachelor of Science certificate in June 1919, yet since at the time Jews were to a great extent avoided from work in the substance business and the scholarly community, he didn't get any activity offers. He worked quickly at the Lederle Laboratories, and after that as a clerk.
