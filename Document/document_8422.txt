In the wake of leaving as Premier, Rutherford kept on sitting as a Liberal MLA. He told the dedication of numerous Liberals who had bolstered his administration through the Alberta and Great Waterways issue, however this group started progressively to consider Cross to be its genuine pioneer. Rutherford restricted the Sifton government's choice to appropriate the Alberta and Great Waterways security cash and repudiate its contract, and in 1913 was one of just two Liberals to help a non-certainty movement against the administration (Cross had at this point joined the Sifton bureau, which mollified most individuals from the Cross-Rutherford group). In the 1913 race, Rutherford was again named as the Liberal competitor in Edmonton South (Strathcona had been amalgamated into Edmonton in 1912), regardless of promising resistance to the Sifton government and offering to battle around the area for the Conservatives on the off chance that they made a deal to avoid running an applicant against him. At the designation meeting, he expressed that he was "not running as a Sifton competitor" and was "a great free candidateÃÂ ... also, a great Liberal as well". Notwithstanding his restriction to the administration, the Conservatives declined his idea of help and designated Herbert Crawford to keep running against him. After a lively crusade, Crawford crushed Rutherford by less than 250 votes. Cross campaigned Prime Minister Laurier for Rutherford to be named to the Senate. This was ineffective, yet Rutherford was made King's Counsel not long after his appointive thrashing.
