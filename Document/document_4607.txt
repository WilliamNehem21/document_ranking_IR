Cleopatra Selene was conceived somewhere in the range of 135 and 130 BC to Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. Cleopatra Selene had numerous kin, including Ptolemy IX, Ptolemy X, and Cleopatra IV. Antiquated essayists, for example, Cicero and Appian, notice that the ruler's name is Selene, and Strabo elucidated that she was surnamed "Cleopatra". Then again, present day researchers, for example, Arthur Houghton and Catharine Lorber, trusted that Selene was actulay a designation. The paleologist Nicholas L. Wright recommended that she accepted the designation "Selene" when she progressed toward becoming ruler of Egypt and that it is a divinising appellation, demonstrating that Cleopatra Selene introduced herself as the sign of the moon goddess on earth. Coins struck in her name record her as Cleopatra Selene. Selene was the name of the Greek moon goddess and it is associated with the word selas (ÃÂÃÂ­ÃÂ»ÃÂ±ÃÂ), signifying "light". "Cleopatra" was a Ptolemaic dynastic name; it signifies "popular in her dad" or "famous in her family". As a ruler of Syria, she was the second to govern with the name 'Cleopatra'. Henceforth, she is named "Cleopatra II Selene" to separate her from her forerunner and auntie Cleopatra I Thea, who was the mother of Cleopatra Selene's spouses Antiochus VIII and Antiochus IX. Classicist Grace Macurdy numbered Cleopatra Selene as "Cleopatra V" inside the Ptolemaic administration and numerous history specialists have utilized this tradition.
