The account of the brilliant crown does not show up in the known works of Archimedes. Also, the common sense of the technique it portrays has been raised doubt about, because of the outrageous precision with which one would need to quantify the water uprooting. Archimedes may have rather looked for an answer that connected the standard referred to in hydrostatics as Archimedes' guideline, which he portrays in his treatise "On Floating Bodies". This guideline expresses that a body submerged in a liquid encounters a light power equivalent to the heaviness of the liquid it dislodges. Utilizing this rule, it would have been conceivable to contrast the thickness of the crown with that of unadulterated gold by adjusting the crown on a scale with an unadulterated gold reference test of a similar weight, at that point drenching the mechanical assembly in water. The distinction in thickness between the two examples would make the scale tip in like manner. Galileo thought of it as "likely that this technique is a similar that Archimedes pursued, since, other than being exceptionally exact, it depends on showings found by Archimedes himself." In a twelfth century content titled "Mappae clavicula" there are guidelines on the most proficient method to play out the weighings in the water so as to figure the level of silver utilized, and along these lines take care of the issue. The Latin ballad "Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris" of the fourth or fifth century depicts the utilization of a hydrostatic parity to take care of the issue of the crown, and ascribes the technique to Archimedes.
