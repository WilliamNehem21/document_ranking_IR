"Phantasmagoria" is a point-and-snap experience diversion that highlights live-activity on-screen characters and true to life film, both amid scenes between the ongoing interaction and inside the three-dimensional rendered conditions of the amusement itself. The diversion was made when intuitive motion picture amusements were at the pinnacle of their fame, with the arrival of such prominent PC recreations as "Wing Commander III" and "Under a Killing Moon". In this single-player amusement, the player controls hero Adrienne Delaney, who is dependably on the screen. The player can click certain regions of the screen to control her developments or influence her to investigate explicit places and items. The camera points and rooms change contingent upon where the player moves Adrienne. The amusement incorporates just four mouse directions: look (which changes to "converse with" while choosing an individual), get thing, use thing, and walk. The mouse cursor is dependably a bolt, not at all like in most prior Sierra On-Line amusements, in which the cursor could be changed to speak to various capacities (like walk, hand, and eye) by right-clicking. The cursor turns red when it disregards a region where the client can snap to play out an activity. When the activity has been finished, the cursor won't turn red once more. Articles in the diversion can be gotten by tapping on them or cooperating with them in a film arrangement, after which the thing consequently goes into the stock. In the event that an item is little enough that it very well may be not entirely obvious, a beating sparkle infrequently encompasses it to attract regard for it.
