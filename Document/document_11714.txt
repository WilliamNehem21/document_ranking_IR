In February 1987, Nos.ÃÂ 36 and 37 Squadrons joined No.ÃÂ 33 Squadron (flying Boeing 707 tanker-transports) as a major aspect of a re-shaped No.ÃÂ 86 Wing under the recently settled Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). In May that year four C-130s flew a rifle organization of the first Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville to Norfolk Island amid Operation Morris Dance, the Australian Defense Force's reaction to the first of the 1987 Fijian upsets; the fighters in this manner set out onto RAN warships by helicopter. In 1988, No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron's Hercules accomplished without 200,000ÃÂ accident flying hours. No.ÃÂ 36 Squadron accomplished sans 100,000ÃÂ accident flying hours on the C-130H in 1990. Individuals from the voyaging open experienced flying by Hercules in 1989, when the Australian Government utilized the C 707s for transport amid the pilots' question that abridged tasks by the two household carriers; the subsequent spike in operational hours required No.ÃÂ 486 Squadron sending separations to a few areas all through the nation to adapt to expanded support requests. By the late 1980s, some C-130 support errands had been re-appropriated to business firms, and Air New Zealand won a four-year warehouse upkeep contract in 1990.
