At the point when Breckinridge requested to meet with Buchanan not long after the introduction, Buchanan instructed him to go to the White House and request to see the master, Harriet Lane. Affronted, Breckinridge wouldn't do as such; Buchanan's companions later disclosed that requesting to see Lane was a mystery guidance to take a visitor to the president. Buchanan apologized for the misconception, however the occasion forecasted a poor connection between the two men. Angry of Breckinridge's help for both Pierce and Douglas, Buchanan permitted him little impact in the organization. Breckinridge's suggestion that previous Whigs and KentuckiansÃ¢ÂÂPowell, specificallyÃ¢ÂÂbe incorporated into Buchanan's bureau went unnoticed. Kentuckians James B. Dirt and Cassius M. Earth were offered strategic missions to Berlin and Peru, individually, yet both declined. Buchanan regularly asked Breckinridge to get and engage remote dignitaries, yet in 1858, Breckinridge declined Buchanan's solicitation that he leave and take the once more empty position as U.S. Priest to Spain. The main private gathering between the two happened close to the finish of Buchanan's term, when the president called Breckinridge to get his recommendation on whether to issue an announcement proclaiming multi day of "Mortification and Prayer" over the isolated condition of the country; Breckinridge certified that Buchanan should make the declaration.
