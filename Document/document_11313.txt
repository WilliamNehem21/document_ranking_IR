Two boats pursued presently conveying sixty pilgrims, all men. They spent July and August in Plymouth before moving north to settle in present day Weymouth, Massachusetts at a settlement which they named Wessagussett. The settlement of Wessagussett was fleeting, however it gave the flash to an occasion that significantly changed the political scene between the nearby Native American clans and the English pioneers. Reports achieved Plymouth of a military danger to Wessagussett, and Myles Standish sorted out a local army to guard them. Nonetheless, he found that there had been no assault. He in this way settled on a pre-emptive strike, an occasion which history specialist Nathaniel Philbrick calls "Standish's attack". He tricked two noticeable Massachusett military pioneers into a house at Wessagussett under the affectation of sharing a supper and making arrangements. Standish and his men at that point cut and executed the two clueless Native Americans. The nearby sachem named Obtakiest was sought after by Standish and his men yet got away with three English detainees from Wessagussett, whom he at that point executed.
