Since the player and the primary character wind up in another world, Nojima needed Tidus' comprehension of that world to follow the player's advancement in the diversion. Nojima felt that Tidus was the most straightforward character to attract the primary portion of "Conclusive Fantasy X", since character and player find out about the storyline together.

Nomura was approached to plan Tidus uniquely in contrast to the amusement's subject so he would emerge. Film executive Hiroshi Kuwabara noticed the trouble the designers had in making Tidus and the other fundamental characters reasonable.
