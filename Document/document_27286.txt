Erich von Neurenberg was installed as "gauleiter" (provincial leader); he was assisted by George Waight, who acted as the local Gestapo chief. Their stated purpose was to assist Hitler in his plans to take advantage of Canada's relatively low population density by colonizing the country. Von Neurenberg issued the following decree, which was posted throughout the city:
NO ONE WILL ACT, SPEAK OR THINK CONTRARY TO OUR DECREES.
Notices were posted on churches forbidding worship services, and priests who objected were arrested. Buses were stopped and their passengers searched by armed troops. The "Winnipeg Tribune" was renamed "Das Winnipeger LÃ¼genblatt" ("The Winnipeg Lies-sheet"), a 'Nazi' publication featuring heavily censored columns and a front page written almost entirely in German. One satirical story noted that "this is a great day for ManitobaÂ ...The Nazis, like Der Fuehrer, are patient, kind and tolerant, but THEIR PATIENCE IS RAPIDLY EXHAUSTED BECOMING", while another included an "official joke", approved by the German authorities, at which all readers were ordered to laugh or be imprisoned. Henry Weppler, a newspaper seller for the "Winnipeg Free Press", was attacked and his papers ripped up. The "Winnipeg Free Press" featured a front-page story about the "invasion", describing in great detail the devastation caused by the Nazis in Winnipeg.
