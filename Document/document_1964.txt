On the morning of June30, 1862, the Union V Corps under Fitz John Porter, a piece of McClellan's Army of the Potomac, amassed on Malvern Hill. Col. Henry Hunt, McClellan's talented head of big guns, posted 171 weapons on the slope and 91 more for possible later use in the south. The mounted guns line on the slope's slant comprised of eight batteries of field big guns with 37 weapons. Brig. Gen. George Sykes' division would protect the line. Available for later were extra field gunnery and three batteries of overwhelming big guns, which included five 4.5-inch (11ÃÂ cm) Rodman weapons, five 20-pounder (9.1ÃÂ kg) Parrott rifles and six 32-pounder (15ÃÂ kg) howitzers. As a greater amount of McClellan's powers touched base at the slope, Porter kept on fortifying the Union line. Brig. Gen. George Morell's units, positioned between the Crew and West homesteads, stretched out the line toward the northeastern segment. Brig. Gen. Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, so far unbloodied by the engagements of the Seven Days, further broadened the northeastern line. This left 17,800 warriors from Couch's and Morell's divisions at the northern substance of the slope, sitting above the Quaker Road, from which the Federals anticipated that Lee's powers should assault.
