Bourlamaque had pulled back with everything except 400 of his men to Fort St. FrÃÂ©dÃÂ©ric when he discovered that the British were drawing closer. The gun discharge by this little power murdered five and injured another 31 of the assaulting British. Chief Louis-Philippe Le Dossu d'HÃÂ©bÃÂ©court, who had been left in direction of the stronghold, made a decision on the night of July 26 that the time had come to leave. His men pointed the stronghold's weapons at its dividers, laid mines, and put down a powder trail to the overloaded powder magazine. They at that point lit the circuit and surrendered the fortification, leaving the French banner flying. The British were advised of this activity by the entry of French traitors. General Amherst offered 100 guineas to any man willing to enter the attempts to discover and drench the wire; yet nobody was happy to take up the offer. The whole works went off late that night with a gigantic thunder. The powder magazine was decimated, and various wooden structures burst into flames because of flying ashes, yet the stronghold's dividers were not seriously harmed. After the blast, a portion of Gage's light infantry raced into the stronghold and recovered the French banner. Flames in the fortification were not by any means smothered for two days.
