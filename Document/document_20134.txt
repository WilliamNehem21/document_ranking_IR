"Drava" was based at Bezdan under the command of Aleksandar BeriÄ, when the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941. She was assigned as flagship of the 1st Mine Barrage Division, and was responsible for the Hungarian border on the Danube, under the operational control of the 30th Infantry Division "OsijeÄka", which was part of the 2nd Army. "Drava" steamed upstream to MohÃ¡cs in Hungary to shell the airfield there on 6 and 8 April, but was subjected to daily attacks by the "Luftwaffe". On 10 April, "Drava" and her fellow monitor were ordered to sail downstream to conform with the withdrawals of the 1st and 2nd Army's from BaÄka and Baranja. About 14:00 the following day, a Yugoslav lookout near Batina signalled "Drava" that a group of four Hungarian patrol boats, armed with guns, was coming down the Danube from the direction of MohÃ¡cs. "Drava" engaged the patrol boats at a range of , and drove the small Hungarian flotilla north again. BeriÄ followed this up at 16:00 by once again shelling the airfield at MohÃ¡cs. Morale on the ship was good, but when BeriÄ met with Army elements later that day he became aware of the situation elsewhere, and nine crew deserted.
