In 1921 Wood was granted the gold award of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the primary English conductor to get the respect. At this point he was starting to discover his situation as Britain's driving conductor under test from rising more youthful opponents. Thomas Beecham had been an undeniably powerful figure since around 1910. He and Wood disliked each other, and each maintained a strategic distance from notice of the other in his diaries. Adrian Boult, who, at Wood's proposal, assumed control over a portion of his obligations at Birmingham in 1923, constantly appreciated and regarded Wood. Other more youthful directors included men who had been individuals from Wood's symphony, including Basil Cameron and Eugene Goossens. Another protÃÂ©gÃÂ© of Wood was Malcolm Sargent, who showed up at the Proms as an arranger conductor in 1921 and 1922. Wood urged him to desert musings of a vocation as a piano player and to focus on directing. Wood further demonstrated his enthusiasm for the eventual fate of music by assuming the conductorship of the understudy ensemble at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923, practicing it two times every week, at whatever point conceivable, for the following twenty years. Around the same time, he acknowledged the conductorship of the beginner Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, voyaging three times each year until 1939 to practice and direct its shows.
