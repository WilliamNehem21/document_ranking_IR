The earliest manuscript offering clues to governance and military conflict in the pre-1760 Mysore, seems to be Dias , an annual letter written in Portuguese by a Mysore-based Jesuit missionary, Joachim Dias, and addressed to his Provincial superior. After the East India Company's final 1799 victory over Tipu Sultan, official Company records began to be published as well; these include , a collection of Anglo-Mysore Wars-related correspondence between the Company's officials in India and Court of Directors in London, and , the first report on the new Princely State of Mysore by its resident, Mark Wilks. Around this time, French accounts of the Anglo-Mysore wars appeared as well, and included , a history of the wars by Joseph-FranÃ§ois Michaud, another Jesuit priest. The first attempt at including a comprehensive history of Mysore in an English language work is , an account of a survey of South India conducted at Lord Richard Wellesley's request, by Francis Buchanan, a Scottish physician and geographer. By the end of the period of British Commissionership of Mysore (1831â1881), many English language works had begun to appear on a variety of Mysore-related subjects. These included , a book of English translations of Kannada language inscriptions, and , William Digby's two volume critique of British famine policy during the Great Famine of 1876â78, which devastated Mysore for years to come.
