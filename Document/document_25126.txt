Christiaan Hendrik Persoon described this species as "Agaricus myomyces" var. "pardinus" in 1801, although he queried whether it was a distinct species. However, the German naturalist Jacob Christian SchÃ¤ffer had in 1762 published "Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur Icones", in which he described a mushroom he called "Agaricus tigrinus". The illustration accompanying the name fits what we now know as "Tricholoma pardinum", although the description is less clear. To confuse matters further, Elias Magnus Fries used the name "Agaricus tigrinus" in his 1821 work "Systema Mycologicum", in accordance with Bulliard's 1782 description, which now corresponds with "Lentinus tigrinus". In his 1838 work "Epicrisis systematis mycologici: seu synopsis hymenomycetum", Fries assigned a different fungus again to the binomial name and linked it to SchÃ¤ffer's 1762 description. French mycologist Lucien QuÃ©let reclassified it as a species in 1873, giving it its current binomial name. Italian mycologist Alfredo Riva has noted that Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan provided a description forty years before QuÃ©let, in his 1833 work "Mycographie Suisse", and queried why it was ignored. He has proposed the fungus be written as "Tricholoma pardinum" (Secr.) QuÃ©l. However, Secretan's works are generally not recognised for nomenclatural purposes because he did not use binomial nomenclature consistently.
