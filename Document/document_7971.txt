In each board, Dyer is encircled by an entryway, and set against a level, unknown frontal area shaded with dark and darker tints. In the left casing, he is situated on a can with his head squatted between his knees as though in agony. Despite the fact that his angled back, thighs and legs are as per the Irish faultfinder Colm TÃÂ³ibÃÂ­n, "affectionately painted", Dyer is at this point plainly a broken man. The focal board demonstrates Dyer sitting on the latrine bowl in a progressively pensive represent, his head and chest area squirming underneath a hanging light which tosses an extensive bat-like shadow framed in the state of an evil presence or Eumenide. The craftsmanship commentator Sally Yard has noticed that in the depiction of Dyer's substance, "life appears to unmistakably drainÃÂ ... into the significant character of the shadow underneath him". Dyer's stance recommends he is situated on a latrine bowl, however the item isn't portrayed. Schmied has recommended that in this casing the darkness of the foundation has wrapped the subject, and it "is by all accounts progressing forward over the limit, undermining the watcher like a flood or a monster bat with fluttering wings and expanded hooks."
