Poulenc was born in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, the younger child and only son of Ãmile Poulenc and his wife, Jenny, "nÃ©e" Royer. Ãmile Poulenc was a joint owner of the Poulenc FrÃ¨res, a successful manufacturer of pharmaceuticals (later RhÃ´ne-Poulenc). He was a member of a pious Roman Catholic family from Espalion in the dÃ©partement of Aveyron. Jenny Poulenc was from a Parisian family with wide artistic interests. In Poulenc's view, the two sides of his nature grew out of this background: a deep religious faith from his father's family and a worldly and artistic side from his mother's. The critic Claude Rostand later described Poulenc as "half monk and half naughty boy".
Poulenc grew up in a musical household; his mother was a capable pianist, with a wide repertoire ranging from classical to less elevated works that gave him a lifelong taste for what he called "adorable bad music". He took piano lessons from the age of five; when he was eight he first heard the music of Debussy and was fascinated by the originality of the sound. Other composers whose works influenced his development were Schubert and Stravinsky: the former's "Winterreise" and the latter's "The Rite of Spring" made a deep impression on him. At his father's insistence, Poulenc followed a conventional school career, studying at the LycÃ©e Condorcet in Paris rather than at a music conservatory.
