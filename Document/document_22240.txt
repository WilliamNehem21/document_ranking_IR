Ferreira stepped down at the end of the 2009â10 season and was replaced by AndrÃ© Villas-Boas, a former assistant of Mourinho at Porto, Chelsea, and Internazionale. In a single season, Villas-Boas guided the team to a record-matching four titles, including victory in the 2010â11 UEFA Europa League. Their triumphant campaign started in the play-off round, where they overcame Belgian side Genk to reach the group stage. Porto topped their group undefeated, only dropping points against BeÅiktaÅ. In the round of 32, despite a second-leg home loss, they eliminated the 2005â06 and 2006â07 UEFA Cup winners Sevilla, setting up a tie with CSKA Moscow. Porto defeated the Russians in both legs and advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were paired against another Muscovite club, this time Spartak Moscow. Two prolific displays, which included a hat-trick by Radamel Falcao, sealed a 10â3 aggregate win for Porto. In the semi-finals, Falcao went one better and scored four goals in a first-leg 5â1 win against Villarreal, which all but confirmed the club's fourth major European final.<ref name="2010/11"></ref> The Dublin final was an all-Portuguese affair between Porto and Primeira Liga rivals Braga. Contrasting with previous matches in the tournament, Porto's performance was more contained and victory was secured with a single goal by Falcao, who became the competition's top scorer.
