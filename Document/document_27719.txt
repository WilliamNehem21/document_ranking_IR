The direct distance between the source and mouth is only . U.S. Route 15 and the Union County Industrial Railroad run north-south here along the river and cross the creek just before its mouth; however, this track is not in service as of 2009.

From the mouth of White Deer Hole Creek it is along the West Branch Susquehanna River to its confluence with the Susquehanna River at Northumberland. The elevation at the source is , while the mouth is at an elevation of . The difference in elevation, , divided by the length of the creek of gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of creek or relief ratio of 84.6Â feet/mile (16.0Â m/km). The meander ratio is 1.14, so the creek's path is not entirely straight in its bed. The meandering increases near the mouth.
