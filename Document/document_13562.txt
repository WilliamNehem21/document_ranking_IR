Following the Fourth Crusade, the Orthodox pastorate in the two primary Greek states, Epirus and Nicaea, had viably turned out to be isolated. In 1208, the Nicaeans had assembled a synod and chosen Michael Autoreianos as successor to the empty see of the Patriarch of Constantinople. The decision was uncanonical and along these lines of sketchy authenticity. This thus implied Laskaris' majestic title was additionally open to challenge, as he had been delegated by a similar Michael Autoreianos. Effectively under Michael I, two neighborhood synods of ministers had developed in the Epirote spaces to carry on organization of the Church, to a great extent free of the Patriarch, one at Naupaktos under John Apokaukos, and one at Ohrid under Chomatianos. The more yearning Chomatianos before long turned into the pre-famous "western" minister, and looked to reinforce the "true" Epirote self-rule in religious undertakings, including the arrangement of clerics for the neighborhood sees without the Patriarch's impedance. This strategy, which dovetailed with Theodore's very own aspirations of freedom from and contention towards Nicaea, brought the two parts of the Greek Church to an open fight, as the Nicaea-based patriarch Manuel I Sarantenos started designating diocesans of his own to Epirote sees, whom the Epirotes would not acknowledge. Regardless of his nearby connections to Epirus, Stefan II NemanjiÃÂ misused the EpiroteÃ¢ÂÂ Nicaean contention further bolstering his good fortune to verify autocephaly for the Serbian Church, which generally had been under the locale of the Archbishop of Ohrid. Ignoring Chomatianos' eager protests, Stefan figured out how to have his sibling Rastko, renamed Sava, sanctified by Manuel Sarantenos as autocephalous diocese supervisor of Serbia in 1219. Theodore took care not to let the fights of the churchmen influence his genial relations with the Serbian ruler.
