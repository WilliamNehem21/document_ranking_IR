As Baalham made his inspection, others observed the extent of the damage, and a mood of concern and anxiety began to develop as news spread. With the ship's four pumps working at full capacity, Luce attempted to stanch the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship's bow. This, he hoped, could be fastened over the holes in the hull to lessen the inflow of water, but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart. The ship's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials, but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached. Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking, Luce decided to run for the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety while "Arctic" was still afloat; Cape Race was about four hours distant, if the ship could be kept moving. This decision meant abandoning "Vesta", but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment, and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate. After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew, who were being left to fend for themselves, Luce ordered full speed ahead. A few minutes later, "Arctic" ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from "Vesta". All but one of its dozen occupants were killed, mostly crushed under "Arctic"s paddle wheels. The single survivor was a fisherman, FranÃ§ois Jassonet, who jumped clear and was hauled aboard "Arctic" by a rope.
