Little Moreton Hall initially shows up in the chronicled record in 1271, however the present structure dates from the mid sixteenth century. The north range is the soonest part of the house. Worked somewhere in the range of 1504 and 1508 for William Moreton (kicked the bucket 1526), it contains the Great Hall and the northern piece of the east wing. An administration wing toward the west, worked in the meantime yet in this way supplanted, gave the early house a H-molded floor plan. The east range was stretched out toward the south in around 1508 to give extra living quarters, just as lodging the Chapel and the Withdrawing Room. In 1546 William Moreton's child, additionally called William (c.ÃÂ 1510Ã¢ÂÂ 63), supplanted the first west wing with another range lodging administration rooms on the ground floor just as a yard, display, and three interconnected rooms on the main floor, one of which approached a garderobe. In 1559 William had another floor embedded at display level in the Great Hall, and included the two substantial sound windows looking onto the patio, constructed so near one another that their rooftops adjoin each other. The south wing was included about 1560Ã¢ÂÂ 62 by William Moreton II's child John (1541Ã¢ÂÂ 98). It incorporates the Gatehouse and a third story containing a Long Gallery, which seems to have been a bit of hindsight included after development work had started. A little kitchen and Brew-house square was added toward the south wing in around 1610, the last significant expansion to the house.
