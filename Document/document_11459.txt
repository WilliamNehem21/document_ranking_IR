The Peace of Prague (1866) offered tolerant terms to Austria, in which Austria's association with the new country territory of Italy experienced major rebuilding; in spite of the fact that the Austrians were unquestionably progressively fruitful in the military field against Italian troops, the government lost the vital area of Venetia.
