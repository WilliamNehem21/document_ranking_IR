This park sits on of land, and it was donated to the City of Menominee by German-American brewer John O. Henes in 1907. M-35 leads northeast from the intersection before turning north to head out of town. The highway runs northeasterly following the shoreline of the Green Bay, toward Escanaba. M-35 between Menominee and Gladstone forms part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour and comprises a section of the UP Hidden Coast Michigan Recreational Heritage Route, one of the Pure Michigan Byways.
At the MenomineeâDelta county line, M-35 passes from the Central to the Eastern Time Zone. After entering the south side of Escanaba, M-35 runs into town on Lake Shore Drive, passing to the south and east of the Delta County Airport before turning onto Lincoln Road. Just west of downtown, USÂ 2/USÂ 41 join M-35 at the intersection of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road. Ludington and Lincoln form the eastâwest and northâsouth axes respectively of the Escanaba street numbering grid. From these two streets, the eastâwest avenues and northâsouth streets are numbered in a grid in the City of Escanaba. USÂ 2/USÂ 41 enter Escanaba from the west along Ludington Street, turning north along Lincoln Road, joining M-35. Here, M-35 joins the National Highway System, which is a road system important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.
