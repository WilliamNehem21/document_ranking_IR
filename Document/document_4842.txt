Benjamin's view that bondage should proceed was situated in his conviction that natives reserved a privilege to their property as ensured by the Constitution. As Butler put it, "he could no more observe that it was directly for Northern individuals to deny him of his slave than it would be for him to plot at steed taking". He stayed away from the contentions of some that the slaves were mediocre creatures, and that their position was appointed by God: Evans credits this to Benjamin not being raised as a slaveowner, however coming to it further down the road. Benjamin participated in a far reaching perspective on white Southerners that the African American would not be prepared for liberation for a long time, if at any time. They expected that liberating the slaves would destroy numerous and lead to murders and assaults by the recently freed of their previous experts and paramours. Such a slaughter had been dreaded by Southerners since the Haitian Revolution, the brutal revolt known as "Santo Domingo" in the South, in which the captives of what progressed toward becoming Haiti executed numerous whites and mulattoes in 1804 while picking up autonomy from French control. At the point when the abolitionist servitude book "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was distributed in 1852, Benjamin took a stand in opposition to Harriet Beecher Stowe's depiction. He said that slaves were generally very much treated, and estate disciplines, for example, whipping or marking, were more tolerant than sentences of detainment that a white man may get in the North for comparable lead.
