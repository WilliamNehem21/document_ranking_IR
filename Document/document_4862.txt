The Soviet Union built up the principal dynamic security framework somewhere in the range of 1977 and 1982, named "Drozd" (Russian: ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¾ÃÂ·ÃÂ´). This framework was structured as an option in contrast to aloof or receptive covering, to shield against adversary hostile to tank weapons. The framework's advancement was animated in huge part by the presentation of new high touchy enemy of tank warheads. "Drozd" was intended to pulverize these warheads before they hit the reinforcement of the vehicle being assaulted. It was made out of three principle parts: two launcher clusters put on either side of the turret and an assistant power unit situated to the back of the turret. The clusters were constrained by two millimeter-wave radar recieving wires. The framework utilized a , cone-molded fracture warhead. "Drozd" could secure a tank between the heights of Ã¢ÂÂ6 and 20 degrees along the vertical plane, and somewhere in the range of 40 and 60 degrees along the flat plane. Albeit answered to offer a 80% expansion in survival rate amid its testing in Afghanistan, the radar was unfit to sufficiently identify dangers and the terminating of its rockets caused unsuitably large amounts of inadvertent blow-back. Around 250 "Drozd" frameworks were made, which were all introduced on T-55s having a place with the Soviet Union's maritime infantry.
