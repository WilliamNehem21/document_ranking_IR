Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag and was back in Kiel by 30 December. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" briefly replaced her sister as the squadron flagship, from 23 January 1915 to 23 February. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service by February. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser der Grosse" and her sisters. Starting in October, she served briefly as a training ship for engine room personnel, though on 19 November she was decommissioned in Kiel and disarmed. She was thereafter employed as a prison ship for prisoners of war in Wilhelmshaven. In November 1918, Germany capitulated and signed the First Armistice at CompiÃ¨gne, which ended hostilities so a peace treaty could be negotiated. According to of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the " or "Lothringen" types". On 6 December 1919, the ship was struck from the naval list and sold to ship-breakers. The following year, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was broken up for scrap metal in RÃ¶nnebeck.
