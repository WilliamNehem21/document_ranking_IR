On 17 February, Brigadier General Dennis Hejlik recorded a critical solicitation with the Marine Corps for 1,200 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, explicitly intended to withstand IED assaults, for use in Anbar Province. In his solicitation, General Hejlik included, "The [Marines] can't keep on lose... genuine and grave losses to IED[s]." The Marine Corps did not formally follow up on the solicitation for 21 months. Hejlik later guaranteed that he was alluding to IEDs which "attacked the sides of vehicles", and that the Marine Corps had discovered that basically including increasingly defensively covered Humvees would give satisfactory insurance. Informant Franz Gayl deviated, and composed a report for Congress guaranteeing that the solicitation was racked on the grounds that the Marine Corps needed to utilize the assets to build up the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, a swap for the Humvee not booked to end up operational until 2012. Some Army faculty griped that the Marines took a practically easygoing frame of mind towards IEDs. One Army officer in Ramadi whined that, in the wake of caution about the vast number of IEDs on a specific course, he was told, "Except if there are individuals dissolving within Humvees, at that point it is anything but a genuine issue."
