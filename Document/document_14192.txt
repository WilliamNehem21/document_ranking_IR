The Navy chose that a Hawaiian base was a need, considering the Army field at Ford Island a perfect hopeful. Maritime Air Station Pearl Harbor, comprising of nine officers and fifty-five men, was dispatched on December 19, 1919. In spite of the fact that the Navy endeavored to uproot the Army from the island and assign it exclusively for maritime use, U.S. Secretary of War Newton D. Pastry specialist isolated the island similarly between the military branches. The Army got the west side of the island, and the Navy the southeastern side. Lieutenant Commander Robert D. Kirk-Patrick was sent to set up a maritime station on the island with four planes and fifty-five men. Kirk-Patrick's men had two Curtiss HS2L flying water crafts and two N-9 planes rescued from World War I, which they put away in two vast canvas storages over the harbor from the island. After the maritime overhangs were dispatched on January 17, 1923, by Lieutenant Commander John Rodgers, the separation moved onto Ford Island and got Naval Aircraft Factory TS, Felixstowe F5L, Curtiss H-16, Keystone PK-1 and Douglas DT type air ship. To suit transport berthing the Navy fabricated a solid and-stone quay around the whole island, and in 1926, they got Vought FU, Vought VE-7 and Vought VE-9 biplanes.
