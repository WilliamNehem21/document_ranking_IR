Publicized as the "Untitled Eve Project" in an early press release, the series had the working title "The Opposite Sex" before it was changed to reflect Eve's status as the star. Eve initially resisted the change and felt that "The Opposite Sex" was a stronger choice, but described it as a "corporate decision". According to her, UPN executives explained that the title would better attract the rapper's fans. They also felt that the audience would not be confused by the title "Eve", despite Eve playing a character named Shelly. After the title was established, the show's premise was modified slightly, but remained centered around male and female friends discussing their love lives, and navigating their relationships with the opposite sex. While Eve described the series as "the PG version of "Sex and the City"", DeLoatch promoted "Eve" as unique for incorporating both male and female perspectives on dating and love. She further described the sitcom as "focus[ing] on one relationship and follow[ing] all of the ups and downs in it" with the purpose of "showing the male and female points of view". To achieve this goal, DeLoatch included male writers in the discussions of potential episodes and storylines to hear their input.
