Skelton was unfit to work in TV until the finish of his 1951 MGM film contract; a renegotiation to expand the agreement gave authorization after that point. He marked an agreement for TV on NBC with Procter and Gamble as his support on May 4, 1951, and said he would play out indistinguishable characters on TV from he had been doing on radio. The MGM concurrence with Skelton for TV exhibitions did not enable him to go reporting in real time before September 30, 1951. His TV debut, "The Red Skelton Show", debuted on that date: toward the finish of his opening monolog, two men behind the stage got his lower legs from behind the set window ornament, pulling him offstage face down. A 1943 instrumental hit by David Rose, called "Occasion for Strings", turned into Skelton's TV signature melody. The move to TV enabled him to make two non-human characters, seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe, which he performed while the pair were flying by tucking his thumbs under his arms to speak to wings and forming his cap to resemble a flying creature's bill. He designed his tame, henpecked TV character of George Appleby after his radio character, J. Newton Numbskull, who had comparable attributes. His "Freddie the Freeloader" jokester was presented on the program in 1952, with Skelton duplicating his dad's cosmetics for the character. He figured out how to copy his dad's cosmetics and play out his schedules through his mom's memories. A custom ended up set up toward the finish of each program, with Skelton's timid innocent wave and expressions of, "pleasant evening and may God favor."
