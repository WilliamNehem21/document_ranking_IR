A standout amongst the most essential parts of Irish phonology is that practically all consonants come in sets, with one having an "expansive" articulation and the other a "thin" one. Expansive consonants are either velarized (that is, the back of the tongue is pulled back and somewhat up toward the delicate sense of taste while the consonant is being verbalized) or just velar (for example ). Slim consonants are palatalized, which implies the tongue is pushed up toward the hard sense of taste amid the verbalization. The complexity among expansive and slim consonants is urgent in Irish, on the grounds that the importance of a word can change if a wide consonant is substituted for a thin consonant or the other way around. For instance, the main distinction in articulation between the words ('cow') and ('alive') is that is articulated with a wide "b" sound, while is articulated with a slim "b" sound. The differentiation among wide and slim consonants assumes a basic job in recognizing the individual consonants themselves, yet in addition in the elocution of the encompassing vowels, in the assurance of which consonants can remain beside which different consonants, and in the conduct of words that start with a vowel. This expansive/thin qualification is like the hard/delicate one of a few Slavic dialects, similar to Russian.
