The 2005â06 season started with Neale Cooper being appointed as the new manager, but despite achieving a 3â2 victory over Premiership side Portsmouth in the Football League Cup, the team struggled in the league, and shortly after defeat in the first round of the FA Cup by Northern Premier League side Burscough, Cooper resigned. He was replaced by Ronnie Jepson, who led the team to a mid-table finish, which he repeated in 2006â07. After a poor start to the 2007â08 season Jepson resigned, and Mick Docherty and Iffy Onuora were appointed joint caretaker managers. Docherty left the club a month later, but Onuora remained in charge until the appointment of Mark Stimson on 1 November 2007. At the end of the 2007â08 season the club was relegated from League One. The following season the Gills earned promotion through the play-offs after finishing fifth in the league, Simeon Jackson scoring the only goal in the final against Shrewsbury Town at Wembley Stadium. In the 2009â10 season, however, the Gills were relegated back to League Two,
with Stimson leaving the club by mutual consent two days after the end of the season. Within two weeks, Andy Hessenthaler returned for a second spell as manager.
