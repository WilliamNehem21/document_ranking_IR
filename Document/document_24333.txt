Since 1954, Panavision had been working on a new widescreen process commissioned by MGM. The MGM camera system used 1930 Mitchell FC "Fox Grandeur" 70mm motion picture cameras, retooled for 65mm film and modern lenses. The resulting system used the retooled Grandeur 65Â mm film camera in conjunction with the APO Panatar lens, which was an integrated anamorphic lens (as opposed to a standard prime lens with an anamorphoser mounted on it). This created a 1.25x anamorphic squeeze factor. Movies using the process had an astounding potential aspect ratio of 2.76:1 when exhibited with 70Â mm anamorphic projection prints. Introduced as MGM Camera 65, the system was used on just a few films, the first of which was "Raintree County" (1956). However, the film was released only in 35Â mm anamorphic prints because the circuit of 70Â mm theaters was booked with "Around the World in Eighty Days" (1956), shot with the competing, nonanamorphic Todd-AO system. In January 1959, the posters for the 70Â mm release of Disney's "Sleeping Beauty" carried the notation "Process lenses by Panavision" next to the Super Technirama 70 logo. The first film to be presented in 70Â mm anamorphicâ"Ben-Hur"âwas released by MGM in 1959 under the trade name MGM Camera 65. Panavision also developed a nonanamorphic widescreen process called Super Panavision 70, which was essentially identical to Todd-AO. Super Panavision made its screen debut in 1959 with "The Big Fisherman", released by Disney's Buena Vista division.
