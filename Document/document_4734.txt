Allen was presented as a "man of his word" yet his portrayal changed to the point that Hoshino composed a meeting between the character and herself. In the meeting she griped to Allen about his change from "unadulterated and guiltless" to an "adulterated" character, calling him "Dim Allen". "Allen" answered that the change must be because of the arrangement's dull setting. She exhibited Allen's clouded side when the character struck his lord Cross Marian in outrage at his powerlessness to figure out how he would turn into the fourteenth Noah relative: Nea D. Campbell. As indicated by Hoshino, Cross Marian was irate with Allen for the assault yet delighted in observing this side of his understudy. While Allen turned into a darker character, Hoshino likewise needed to symbolize his own dread in the manner in which his persona ended up apprehensive his late watchman Mana Walker did not adore him. Therefore, Hoshino made a minor plan change and modified the scar Mana's Akuma set on his brow in a berserker state; by having the scar show all the more plainly, Allen's aggravation about his adoration for Mana was all the more unmistakably communicated. For the bend including the Third Exorcists, Hoshino's editors exhorted her to draw Allen as a contender for the manga's characters Yu Kanda and Alma Karma, who are intensely highlighted in the adventure.
