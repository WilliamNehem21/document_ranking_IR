Following the war, Cambridge University experienced an absence of value bowling toward the beginning of the 1919 cricket season. Thusly, Gilligan confronted little challenge for his place in the group and took 32 wickets at a normal of under 27 in Cambridge matches, which pundits thought about a poor return. He established a greater connection when, batting at number eleven in the request, he scored 101 against Sussex and shared a last-wicket association of 177 out of 65 minutes with John Naumann. A couple of days after the fact, Gilligan won his blueÃ¢ÂÂthe granting of the Cambridge "hues" to sportsmenÃ¢ÂÂby showing up in the University Match against Oxford. On the most recent day of the three-day coordinate, he took five wickets for 16 keeps running in 57 conveyances to complete with bowling figures of six for 52 (six wickets taken for 52 runs surrendered). As per "Wisden Cricketers' Almanac", this was the best bowling execution in the University Match for a long time, despite the fact that Cambridge lost the match. Towards the finish of the period, Gilligan played three top of the line matches for Surrey and showed up in a celebration amusement, in spite of the fact that he achieved little with bat or ball. In all five star diversions in 1919, he scored 231 keeps running at a batting normal of 17.76 and took 35 wickets at 31.57. Toward the finish of the period, he changed districts; his family associations in the region, and the nearness of his sibling Harold in the group, drove him to enlist with Sussex.
