The principal yeomanry troop brought up in Gloucestershire was the 60-in number First or Cheltenham Troop of Gloucestershire Gentlemen and Yeomanry, framed in 1795 by Powell Snell, a man of honor of methods and great position. Altogether, eight troops had been raised by 1798. Following the 1802 Peace of Amiens, all with the exception of the Cheltenham Troop were disbanded, however the next year Napoleon's arranged intrusion of the United Kingdom provoked the re-foundation of a few old troops and the development of new troops; before the finish of 1803 there were thirteen troops in Gloucestershire, and in 1813 the region's yeomanry had a quality of 582 men. Just as lasting obligation, the yeomanry collected as required for stately and harmony keeping purposes; the Gloucester Troop gave an escort amid the visit of the Prince of Wales to the city in 1807, and in 1810 it was shouted to an affray between Irish civilian army and residents in a nearby bar. A general decrease in volunteer powers pursued the thrashing of Napoleon, and by 1815 all yeomanry troops in Gloucestershire with the exception of one were disbanded. Just the Gloucester Troop was held, as a mounted police constrain, until it also was disbanded in 1827.
