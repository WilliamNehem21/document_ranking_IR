The species that Korhonen called EBSÃÂ B was named "A.ÃÂ bulbosa" by Helga MarxmÃÂ¼ller in 1982, as it was believed to be proportionate to "Armillaria mellea" var. "bulbosa", first portrayed by Jean Baptiste Barla (Joseph Barla) in 1887, and later raised to species status by Josef VelenovskÃÂ½ in 1927. In 1973, the French mycologist Henri Romagnesi, unconscious of VelenovskÃÂ½'s distribution, distributed a depiction of the animal types he called "Armillariella bulbosa", in light of examples he had found close CompiÃÂ¨gne and Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte in France. These examples were later exhibited to be indistinguishable species from the EBSÃÂ E of Korhonen; EBSÃÂ B was later resolved to be "A.ÃÂ cepistipes". Thusly, the name "A.ÃÂ bulbosa" was a twisted name for EBSÃÂ E. In 1987 Romagnesi and MarxmÃÂ¼ller renamed EBSÃÂ E to "Armillaria gallica". Another equivalent word, "A.ÃÂ lutea", had initially been depicted by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1874, and proposed as a name for EBSÃÂ E. Despite the fact that the name had need because of its initial distribution date, it was dismissed as a "nomen ambiguum" as a result of an absence of supporting proof to distinguish the organism, including an example, type region, and fragmented gathering notes. "A.ÃÂ inflata" (VelenovskÃÂ½, 1920) may speak to another equivalent word, however the sort examples were not saved, so it is viewed as a questionable name ("nomen dubium"). Starting at 2010, both the Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider "Armillaria gallica" Marxm. and Romagn. to be the present name, with "A.ÃÂ bulbosa" and "A.ÃÂ lutea" as equivalent words.
