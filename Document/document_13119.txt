Another clarification construed is that Wagner did not assent since he believed he was not accepting only pay from the ATC for his baseball card. Wagner had a background marked by being an intense moderator; he had declared his retirement from baseball in December 1907, yet returned in a matter of seconds before the beginning of the 1908 baseball season in the wake of getting a $10,000 contract, twofold his pay from the 1907 season. This hypothesis is imperfect, in any case, since Wagner sent Gruber a check for $10 to remunerate him for the charge ATC would have paid him if Wagner had offered authorization to make his baseball card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, creators of "The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card", inquired as to why Wagner would repay Gruber for $10, a generous measure of cash at the time (around equivalent to $275 in 2016), in the event that he denied approval for money related reasons. The ATC had just delivered various T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards; the definite number is obscure, yet is conjectured to be somewhere in the range of 50 and 200. They ceased generation of the card, in any case, after Wagner denied approval.
