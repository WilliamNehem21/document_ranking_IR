The 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division would lead the assault. During Phase I, codenamed "Gout", they were to take the villages of Sainte Manvieu and Cheux. In Phase II ("Hangover"), the division would advance to capture several crossings over the Odon River and the villages of Mouen and Grainville-sur-Odon. Should resistance during the opening phase prove light, the 11th Armoured Division would seize the bridges over the Odon River by "coup de main". During the first two phases, the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Divisionâto be reinforced on 28 June with the infantry brigade of the Guards Armoured Divisionâwas to remain on the start line to provide a "firm base".
In the third phase, "Impetigo", the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish infantry north of the Odon. The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed "Goitre", elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and to be in a position to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.
