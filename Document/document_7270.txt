As the strike drive neared the coast, substantial cloud was located covering the slopes close Kaafjord. Since the mists forestalled precise besieging, the Barracudas and Corsairs came back to the transporters without assaulting. The Hellcat and Firefly warriors progressed forward, and moved toward the fjord underneath the cloud base. These airplane accomplished shock, and "Tirpitz" was not darkened by smoke when they touched base over Kaafjord. The Fireflies started the assault at 12:49 pm by strafing German enemy of air ship firearms close by "Tirpitz". After two minutes nine Hellcats assaulted the ship with bombs yet did not accomplish any hits. As the strike drive came back to the bearers it wrecked two of "Tirpitz"s seaplanes in Bukta harbor and gravely harmed the submarine "U-965" at Hammerfest. At IngÃÂ¸y, north of Hammerfest, three Hellcats strafed a German radio station. The assault set the station's structures burning and harmed the aerials. The eight Seafires made diversionary assaults on the Banak zone and a close-by seaplane base, wrecking five German seaplanes. Three British air ship were lost amid the assault on the morning of 22 August; one Hellcat and a Seafire were shot down, and one of the Barracudas was compelled to dump into the ocean amid its arrival flight.
