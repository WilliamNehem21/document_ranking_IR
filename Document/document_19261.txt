Hurricane Iris was a small, but powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread destruction in Belize. Iris was the second-strongest storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, behind Hurricane Michelle. It was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the year, forming from a tropical wave on OctoberÂ 4 just southeast of Barbados. It moved westward through the Caribbean, intensifying into a tropical storm on OctoberÂ 5 south of Puerto Rico, and into a hurricane on the following day. While passing south of the Dominican Republic, Iris dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides, killing eight people. Later, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica, where it destroyed two houses. On reaching the western Caribbean Sea, Iris rapidly intensified into a CategoryÂ 4 on the SaffirâSimpson scale. A small hurricane with an eye of only 7Â mi (11Â km) in diameter, Iris reached peak winds of 145Â mph (230Â km/h) before making landfall in southern Belize near Monkey River Town on OctoberÂ 9. The hurricane quickly dissipated over Central America, although its remnants contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The hurricane caused severe damageâdestroying homes, flooding streets, and leveling treesâin coastal towns south of Belize City.
