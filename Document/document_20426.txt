The Great Depression prevented BÃ¤r from gaining a civil pilot license. In 1934, he joined the Reichswehr and was assigned to the 3. "Kompanie" of "Kraftfahrabteilung 4" (3rd Company of the 4th Motor Vehicle Battalion) as a mechanic. He served in this position until the following year, when he was transferred to a combat wing of the Luftwaffe. A few months later, he was accepted for pilot training, receiving his transport aircraft pilot's training. From 1 November 1937 to 31 March 1938, BÃ¤r attended the flight school at Oldenburg and was then transferred to the flight school at Hildesheim. He was transferred again, attending the flight school at Ludwigslust where he attained his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate ("Erweiterter Luftwaffen-FlugzeugfÃ¼hrerschein"), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 16 May 1938. BÃ¤r then attended the blind flying school "Blindflugschule" 2 (BFS 2â2nd blind flying school) at Neuburg an der Donau from 7 July to 14 August 1938. He was transferred to I./"Jagdgeschwader" 135, the core of the future "Jagdgeschwader" 51 (JGÂ 51), on 1 September 1938, usually flying the Junkers Ju 86. The Squadron Leader ("StaffelkapitÃ¤n") Douglas Pitcairn noticed BÃ¤r's flying talents and tried to convince BÃ¤r to become a fighter pilot. Initially BÃ¤r refused, but after he illegally conducted some aerobatics in the Ju 86 leading to an engine failure, he reluctantly accepted and became a fighter pilot.
