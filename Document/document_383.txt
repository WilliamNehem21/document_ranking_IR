Following refit, "Ark Royal"Ã¢ÂÂ joined by , and Ã¢ÂÂ cruised for Gibraltar, touching base on 6 November. They were sent with the remainder of Force H to escort caravans from Gibraltar to Alexandria and Malta, playing out a few keeps running before being doled out to Operation Collar, one of 35ÃÂ convoys to help Malta somewhere in the range of 1940 and 1942, on 25 November. An Italian armadaÃ¢ÂÂdriven by the warships and Ã¢ÂÂ was dispatched to capture the escort. The Italian armada was distinguished by a surveillance air ship from "Ark Royal" and the transporter propelled Swordfish torpedo planes while the capital boats of Force H swung to meet the foe. Amid the commitment, the Battle of Cape Spartivento, the Italian destroyer was harmed, in spite of the fact that it is questionable if torpedoes from the aircraft or British gunfire were dependable. The British mixed up "Lanciere" for a cruiser, while the Italian commandants got off base reports that the cruiser had been hit. English assaults neglected to harm some other Italian ships or sink the handicapped destroyer, and a retaliatory assault by the Italian aviation based armed forces saw "Ark Royal" as the subject of different shelling runs, none of which hit. The fight had no unmistakable outcome, in spite of the fact that the British caravan achieved its goal solid.
