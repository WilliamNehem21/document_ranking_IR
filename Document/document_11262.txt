Card Collector Services reviewed the card and formally decided that it was undoubtedly a reproduce. Cobb and Edwards rejected the discoveries and went to Integrated Paper Services (IPS), an autonomous paper testing and examination lab, in February 2003 to have their card's paper tried. An IPS master verified that the card dated back to 1910, which would be predictable to the timeframe when the card was circulated. The master decided that the "paper stock was predictable with the time that card would have been made." Cobbs and Edwards later went to an Ohio paper industry expert who affirmed that the card was from 1909. The expert expressed that a better than average fake of the card must be created from an "ace pressman with 5Ã¢ÂÂ 10 years experience, and would require a machine which would cost somewhere in the range of $500,000 and $2 million." Afterwards, an appraiser named Bob Connelly esteemed the card at $850,000, in light of the two past paper examination reports. In November 2005, Cobb and Edwards put the card available to be purchased on eBay. They needed to close down the deal, nonetheless, on the grounds that Connelly possibly consented to assess the card if his report was imprinted completely at the eBay card posting.
