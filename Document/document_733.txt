When he started his political profession, Breckinridge had inferred that subjection was more an established issue than an ethical one. Slaves were property, and the Constitution did not engage the central government to meddle with property rights. From Breckinridge's constructionist perspective, enabling Congress to administer liberation without protected authorization would prompt "boundless domain over the regions, barring the general population of the slave states from emigrating thither with their property". As a private native, he bolstered the subjugation assurances in the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 and reviled the Wilmot Proviso, which would have illegal servitude in domain gained in the MexicanÃ¢ÂÂ American War. As a state official, he announced servitude a "completely neighborhood and household" matter, to be chosen independently by the inhabitants of each state and region. Since Washington, D.C., was an administrative substance and the central government couldn't meddle with property rights, he presumed that constrained liberation there was unlawful. As a congressman, he demanded Congress' "immaculate non-mediation" with subjection in the domains. Discussing the 1854 KansasÃ¢ÂÂ Nebraska Act, he clarified, "The privilege to build up [slavery in a region by government sanction] includes the correlative appropriate to restrict; and, denying both, I would vote in favor of not one or the other."
