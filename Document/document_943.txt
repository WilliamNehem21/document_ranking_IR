Notwithstanding being one of Davis' lesser-known records, "Agharta" had a place with a period in his profession that affected specialists in British jazz, new wave, and punk shake, including guitarists Robert Quine and Tom Verlaine. It propelled an age of artists to concentrate on cathartic playing instead of exact instrumentation and arrangement. Quine was especially interested by Cosey's electric guitar sounds; Bangs, who went to Quine's execution with the Voidoids in 1977, asserted "he takes from "Agharta"! What's more, makes it "work"!" Other scholars later commended the quality and creativity of Cosey's playing on the collection, seeing it as a standard for guitar authority and complexity. Jazz faultfinder Bill Milkowski credited his digressive style for "bringing forth a whole school of 'debilitated' guitar playing" and said the blend of Fortune's astringent sax lines on Foster, Henderson, and Lucas' syncopated depressions were 10 years in front of Steve Coleman and Greg Osby's M-Base examinations. Tingen discovered Cosey's performances incredibly uncovering and comparatively radical when heard decades later: "At times snarling, dashing around all corners like a confined tiger, now and then taking off like a flying creature, in some cases incoherently conceptual, in some cases richly melodic and delicate, his electric guitar idea is a standout amongst the most unique to have been formulated on the instrument." In Christgau's assessment, the clamors he delivered on the main track's second half "include the absolute most prominent free act of spontaneities at any point heard in a 'jazz'- 'shake' setting."
