The book was distributed not long after her verse gathering "Tickets for a Prayer Wheel" (1974, University of Missouri Press). Exploring the two volumes for "America", John Breslin noticed the likenesses between the two: "Regardless of whether her first book of ballads had not been distributed at the same time, the language she utilizes in "Pioneer" would have given her away."

I investigate the area.' Here is no delicate sentimental whirling a buttercup, no effortless inscriber of 365 moving writing lyrics. As she controls the consideration regarding a muskrat, to a ruler butterfly, a heron or a coot, Miss Dillard is stalking the peruser as definitely as any predator stalks its amusement."
