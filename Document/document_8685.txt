A continuation of "Lord of War" was first prodded toward the finish of its credits, which expressed, "Kratos Will Return". "Divine force of War II" was formally declared at the 2006 Game Developers Conference (GDC). "Divine force of War" Game Director David Jaffe ventured down and turned into the Creative Director of its continuation. "Divine force of War"s lead artist Cory Barlog accepted the job of Game Director. In a meeting with "PC and Video Games" ("CVG") in June 2006, Barlog said that while taking a shot at the initial couple of drafts of content, he contemplated the folklore widely. He said that the folklore is large to the point that "the genuine trouble is picking things that truly fit inside the tale of Kratos just as being anything but difficult to swallow for gatherings of people." Although he adores showing things through narrating (for this situation Greek folklore), Barlog stated, "you can't give your story a chance to get hindered by that." He said that in the diversion, players would see "a bigger perspective on Kratos' job inside the fanciful world." He likewise said that he preferred the possibility of a set of three, however there were no plans "starting at the present moment."
