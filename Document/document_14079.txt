The UN peacekeeping power, UNAMIR, was in Rwanda amid the decimation, however its Chapter VI order rendered it feeble to mediate militarily. Endeavors by General Dallaire to agent harmony were fruitless, and a large portion of UNAMIR's Rwandan staff were killed in the beginning of the decimation, seriously constraining its capacity to work. Its most noteworthy commitment was to give asylum to a large number of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its base camp in Amahoro Stadium, just as other secure UN locales, and to help with the departure of remote nationals. The Belgian Government, which had been one of the biggest troop supporters of UNAMIR, hauled out in mid-April following the passings of its ten warriors securing Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana. In mid-May the UN surrendered that "demonstrations of destruction may have been submitted", and consented to support. The new fighters began landing in June, and following the finish of the annihilation in July they remained to keep up security and soundness, until the end of their main goal in 1996. Fifteen UN warriors were slaughtered in Rwanda among April and July 1994, including the ten Belgians, three Ghanaians, a Uruguayan, and Senegalese Mbaye Diagne who took a chance with his life over and over to spare Rwandans.
