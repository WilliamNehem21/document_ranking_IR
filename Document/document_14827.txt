Since 1999, the procedure has comprised of two stages. Amid the primary stage, which starts following the offer accommodation due date, the "candidate urban communities" are required to answer a poll covering topics of significance to an effective Games association. This data enables the IOC to investigate the urban communities' facilitating limits and the qualities and shortcomings of their arrangements. Following a definite investigation of the submitted polls and resulting reports, the IOC Executive Board chooses the urban communities that are met all requirements to continue to the following stage. The second stage is the genuine candidature organize: the acknowledged candidate urban communities (starting now and into the foreseeable future alluded to as "hopeful urban areas") are required to present a second poll as an all-encompassing, increasingly nitty gritty, candidature record. These records are painstakingly contemplated by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a gathering made out of IOC individuals, agents of universal game leagues, NOCs, competitors, the International Paralympic Committee, and worldwide specialists in different fields. The individuals from the Evaluation Commission at that point make four-day investigation visits to every one of the competitor urban communities, where they check the proposed settings and are informed about subtleties of the topics shrouded in the candidature document. The Evaluation Commission conveys the aftereffects of its reviews in a report sent to the IOC individuals as long as one month before the choosing IOC Session.
