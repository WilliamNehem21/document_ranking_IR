Allward built the dedication on the vantage purpose of Hill 145, the most astounding point on the edge. The commemoration contains many adapted highlights, including 20 human figures, which help the watcher in thinking about the structure overall. The front divider, regularly confused with the back, is high and speaks to an impervious mass of protection. There is a gathering of figures at each finish of the front divider, beside the base of the means. The "Breaking of the Sword" is situated at the southern corner of the front divider while "Compassion of the Canadians for the Helpless" is situated at the northern corner. All things considered, the two gatherings are "The Defenders" and speak to the beliefs for which Canadians gave their lives amid the war. There is a gun barrel hung in tree and olive branches cut into the divider over each gathering, to symbolize triumph and harmony. In "Breaking of the Sword", three young fellows are available, one of whom is hunkering and breaking his sword. This statue speaks to the annihilation of militarism and the general want for harmony. This gathering of figures is the most unmistakable picture to pacifism in the landmark, the breaking of a sword being very unprecedented in war remembrances. The first arrangement for the model included one figure pulverizing a German head protector with his foot. It was later chosen to reject this element in view of its obviously battle ready symbolism. In "Compassion of the Canadians for the Helpless", one man stands erect while three different figures, stricken by yearning or illness, are squatted and bowing around him. The standing man speaks to Canada's compassion toward the powerless and abused.
