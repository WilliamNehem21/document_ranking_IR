Stowe was incompletely motivated to make "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by the slave account "The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated without anyone else's input" (1849). Henson, an earlier subjugated dark man, had lived and chipped away at a 3,700-section of land (15ÃÂ km) tobacco estate in North Bethesda, Maryland, possessed by Isaac Riley. Henson got away servitude in 1830 by escaping to the Province of Upper Canada (presently Ontario), where he helped other outlaw slaves settle and become independent, and where he composed his journals. Stowe recognized in 1853 that Henson's works propelled "Uncle Tom's Cabin". At the point when Stowe's work turned into a success, Henson republished his diaries as "The Memoirs of Uncle Tom" and went on address visits broadly in the United States and Europe. Stowe's epic loaned its name to Henson's homeÃ¢ÂÂUncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site, close Dresden, Ontario, CanadaÃ¢ÂÂwhich since the 1940s has been an exhibition hall. The lodge where Henson lived while he was subjugated never again exists, yet a lodge on the Riley ranch wrongly thought to be the Henson Cabin was acquired by the Montgomery County, Maryland, government in 2006. It is currently a piece of the National Park Service National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program, and plans are in progress to construct an exhibition hall and interpretive focus on the site.
