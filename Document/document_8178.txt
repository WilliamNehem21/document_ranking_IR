In 1822, groups from Jesus and Brasenose hustled each other to move toward becoming Head of the River. One Brasenose rower clearly "got a crab", moderating the watercraft. The Brasenose vessel was knock by the Jesus pontoon, yet paddled on in any case and asserted that it was still Head of the River. Jesus and Brasenose men contended over which school's banner ought to be raised to mean the triumphant vessel. One of the Brasenose team finished the question by saying ""Quot homines tot sententiae", distinctive men have diverse sentiments, some like leeks and some like onions", alluding to the insignia on the Jesus paddles, and it was consented to push the race once more. The Brasenose team won the rematch. The occurrence has been said to be appeared in a 1822 picture, the most punctual delineation of an eights race at Oxford, painted by I. T. Serres (Marine Painter to GeorgeÃÂ IV). Be that as it may, the print was distributed on 1 March 1822 and it would have taken a while to get ready and imprint. It likewise demonstrates a late spring scene. Both of these focuses propose that the print portrays either a nonexistent scene or an unrecorded occasion from 1821.
