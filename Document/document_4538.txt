Richard Franklin fights that now and again surrealist composing darkens meaning, however in Asturias maintains a strategic distance from this defect. His blend of logic with "a universe of structures" makes "a symbolism which uncovers a more profound reality, one which is all the more profoundly established in the human mind". All things considered, Asturias' surrealist style features the cutting edge crumbling of long-standing conviction frameworks. Artistic researcher Gabriele Eckart gives as a brilliant case of Asturias' surrealist style his depiction of The Zany's mystic procedures in which "language at times breaks separated into tremendous sounds". This permits Asturias to show the genuine and fanciful, just as the transferable and incommunicable, as non-conflicting. Himelblau likewise features how extends "reality in relative, liquid termsÃ¢ÂÂthat is it enables its characters to unveil the worldly setting of the novel's anecdotal occasions". In such manner, at that point, Himelblau noticed that "is additionally, to the extent we know, the primary novel in Spanish America that looks to render anecdotal truth of time as an element of perspective". The epic resists conventional account style by embeddings various scenes that contribute close to nothing or nothing to the plot as the characters in these scenes frequently show up conflictingly. Rather than handing-off the book's subjects through characters, Asturias utilizes redundancy of themes and a legendary substructure to harden the book's message.
