In 1051 the childless King Edward of England seems to have picked William as his successor to the English honored position. William was the grandson of Edward's maternal uncle, Richard II, Duke of Normandy. The "Old English Saxon Chronicle", in the "D" form, expresses that William visited England in the later piece of 1051, maybe to verify affirmation of the progression, or maybe William was endeavoring to verify help for his inconveniences in Normandy. The excursion is far-fetched given William's assimilation in fighting with Anjou at the time. Whatever Edward's desires, almost certainly, any case by William would be restricted by Godwin, the Earl of Wessex, an individual from the most dominant family in England. Edward had hitched Edith, Godwin's little girl, in 1043, and Godwin seems to have been one of the principle supporters of Edward's case to the position of royalty. By 1050, notwithstanding, relations between the ruler and the lord had soured, finishing in an emergency in 1051 that prompted the outcast of Godwin and his family from England. It was amid this outcast that Edward offered the position of royalty to William. Godwin came back from outcast in 1052 with military, and a settlement was come to between the ruler and the lord, reestablishing the duke and his family to their territories and supplanting Robert of JumiÃÂ¨ges, a Norman whom Edward had named Archbishop of Canterbury, with Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. No English source makes reference to an alleged government office by Archbishop Robert to William passing on the guarantee of the progression, and the two Norman sources that notice it, William of JumiÃÂ¨ges and William of Poitiers, are not exact in their order of when this visit occurred.
