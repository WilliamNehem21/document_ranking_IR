In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki took into consideration differences in spore characteristics: species in the genus "Cantharellus" were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like "Polyozellus"; however, these spore characteristics were common in species in the Thelephoraceae family ("Cantharellus" belongs in a different family, the Cantharellaceae). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), and the presence of thelephoric acid, a mushroom pigment common in the family. Taken together, these factors led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae. The suggested family-level taxonomical change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it "Thelephora multiplex". As of 2009, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list "Polyozellus" as being within the Thelephoraceae family, a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the leathery earthfans. The genus name is derived from the Greek "poly" meaning "many", and "oz", meaning "branch". The specific epithet "multiplex" means "in many pieces", referring to the compound nature of the fruit body. Common names for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle. In Alaska, where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black chanterelle, although this name is shared with some "Craterellus" species.
