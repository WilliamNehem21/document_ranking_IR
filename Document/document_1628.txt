"Suillus spraguei" has had a complex ordered history. The main example was initially gathered in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague, and a formal logical depiction was distributed in 1872 when Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it "Boletus spraguei". In a production that showed up the next year, American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species "Boletus pictus". Berkeley and Curtis had additionally portrayed what they accepted to be another speciesÃ¢ÂÂ"Boletus murraii"Ã¢ÂÂ despite the fact that this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be simply a more youthful adaptation of their "Boletus spraguei". Peck's depiction showed up in print in 1873, yet the date stamp on the first distribution uncovered that he had sent his archives to the printer before the presence of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis production, in this manner building up nomenclatural need under the tenets of contagious naming. In 1945 Singer announced that the name "Boletus pictus" was ill-conceived on the grounds that it was a homonym, previously being utilized for a polypore mushroom depicted via Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806. The name was authoritatively changed to "Suillus spraguei" in 1986 (Otto Kuntze had recently exchanged the taxon to "Suillus" in 1898).
