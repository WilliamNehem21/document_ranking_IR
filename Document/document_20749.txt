"Kaga" was provided with a heavy gun armament in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and other features made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship. Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized. The ship was armed with ten 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type guns: one twin-gun turret on each side of the middle flight deck and six in casemates aft. "Kaga"s waterline armored belt was reduced from during her reconstruction and her deck armor was also reduced from . The carrier displaced at standard load, and at full load, nearly less than her designed displacement as a battleship. This reduction in her displacement increased her speed to and gave her a range of at .
In 1933â35 "Kaga" was rebuilt to increase her top speed, improve her exhaust systems, and adapt her flight decks to more modern, heavier aircraft. After the reconstruction, the ship displaced at standard load, better boilers gave her a top speed of , and additional fuel storage increased her range to at and raised her aircraft capacity to 90. The ten guns, although now all mounted singly in casemates, were retained.
