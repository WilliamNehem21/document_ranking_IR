Diem, who had a notoriety for intensely supporting Catholics, conceded his new constituents a lopsidedly high number of government and military posts on religious grounds as opposed to justify. The lopsided number of northerners who involved authority posts likewise raised pressures among some provincial disapproved of southerners who viewed them as gatecrashers. He proceeded with the French routine with regards to characterizing Catholicism as a "religion" and Buddhism as an "affiliation", which confined their exercises. This encouraged a social separation between the fresh debuts and their countrymen. While on a visit to Saigon in 1955, the British columnist and writer Graham Greene detailed that Diem's religious bias "may well leave his tolerant nation a heritage of hostile to Catholicism". In 1963, stewing discontent over Diem's religious predisposition detonated into mass common distress amid the Buddhist emergency. After the Buddhist banner was restricted from open presentation for the Vesak festivities celebrating the introduction of Gautama Buddha, Diem's powers opened flame and slaughtered nine dissenters. As exhibits proceeded through the late spring, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces scoured pagodas the nation over, executing hundreds and imprisoning a large number of Buddhists. The pressure finished in Diem being ousted and killed in a November upset.
