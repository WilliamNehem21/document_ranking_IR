While the train is being stacked with travelers, the catch vehicle for the link lift dives the lift slope and hooks onto the center vehicle underneath the train. When the train is cleared, the link lift promptly pulls the train up the 45 degree lift slope at to a tallness of . The train drops at a 80 degree edge and achieves a top speed of at the base of the slope. It at that point moves through a privilege overbanked divert at 122 degrees from the flat pivot, at that point goes through a passage as it ignores the Frontier Trail. It at that point goes over an illustrative slope, which gives a snapshot of zero gravity as it ignores a tidal pond and down onto Adventure Island. It finishes a , 360-degree right-gave helix, trailed by a left overbanked turn. It at that point finishes a little right-hand turn before heading out over another slope to leave the island. The train at that point voyages left during a time burrow where the on-ride photograph is taken, trailed by a left turn and a little slope, going by the line. At long last, the train voyages high through another privilege overbanked turn over the line and is ceased by attractive brakes. Travelers land the ride at an emptying station and the train moves to a second station where it is stacked.
