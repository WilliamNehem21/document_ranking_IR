The thought processes of Demetrius III are not determined in Josephus' record; the history specialist gives the feeling that Demetrius III helped the Pharisees for nothing out of pocket, which is difficult to acknowledge. The Syrian lord's assistance more likely than not been adapted on political concessions by the Jewish agitators. Proof for Demetrius III's thought processes is given by the Pesher Nahum, which peruses: "[Interpreted, this worries Deme]trius ruler of Greece who looked for, on the guidance of the individuals who look for smooth things, to enter Jerusalem"; the scholastic accord distinguishes "Demetrius lord of Greece" with Demetrius III. The rationale driving Demetrius III to assault Judaea probably won't have had anything to do with the call of the Pharisees. On the off chance that Alexander Jannaeus exploited Demetrius' nonappearance in 93 BC to wrest control of Damascus, at that point the intrusion was likely in reprisal against Judaea. It is additionally conceivable that Demetrius needed to exploit Judaea's HR in the battle against his adversaries to the Syrian honored position. At long last, the Syrian lords, including Demetrius III's dad, never completely acknowledged the autonomy of Judaea and engaged designs to reconquer it; the crusade of Demetrius III can be found in this unique circumstance.
