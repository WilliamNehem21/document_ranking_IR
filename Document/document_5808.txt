At first, Cindy's energetic breezes brought down banana trees and electrical cables crosswise over northern Martinique. Night-time of proceeded with downpour, a few streams, for example, the RiviÃÂ¨re des PÃÂ¨res, RiviÃÂ¨re Claire and RiviÃÂ¨re SÃÂ¨cheÃ¢ÂÂimmediately swelled and flooded. Serious flooding and mudslides cleared through northern towns, submerging homes and pulverizing streets and extensions. News film on national TV demonstrated "autos [being] cleared away to ocean and covered in mud". The PrÃÂªcheur River, which typically streams at 18ÃÂ ft/s (0.5ÃÂ m/s), burst its banks after accomplishing an extraordinary release rate of about 25,000ÃÂ ft/s (700ÃÂ m/s). A lot of volcanic issue from the riverbed hardened into a monstrous flotsam and jetsam stream, which struck the little cooperative of Le PrÃÂªcheur. Achieving statures of up to 10ÃÂ ft (3ÃÂ m), the flotsam and jetsam totally secured houses and streets and unleashed an expected Ã¢ÂÂ£15ÃÂ million (1993 esteem; $2.7ÃÂ million in 1993 USD) in basic harm. Streak floods following the flood of the Grande RiviÃÂ¨re flooded through the adjoining town of a similar name, destroying property and suffocating one individual. In spite of late upgrades to its flood safeguards, the RiviÃÂ¨re Roxelane quickly beaten its banks and immersed quite a bit of Saint-Pierre.
