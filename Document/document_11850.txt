The Jin were debilitated by the weight of the rising Mongols toward the north, a progression of floods coming full circle in a Yellow River flood in 1194 that crushed Hebei and Shandong in northern China, and the dry spells and swarming insects that tormented the south close to the Huai. The Song were educated of the Jurchen issue by their diplomats, who ventured out two times every year to the Jin capital, and began inciting their northern neighbor. The threats were affected by chancellor Han Tuozhou. The Song Emperor Ningzong (r. 1194Ã¢ÂÂ 1224) looked into the war exertion. Under Han Tuozhou's supervision, arrangements for the war continued bit by bit and carefully. The court revered the irredentist saint Yue Fei and Han arranged the distributing of verifiable records that advocated war with the Jin. From 1204 onwards, Chinese furnished gatherings struck Jurchen settlements. Han Tuozhou was assigned the head of national security in 1205. The Song financed extremists in the north that declared supporter feelings. These early conflicts kept on heightening, incompletely abetted by revanchist Song authorities, and war against the Jin was authoritatively announced on June 14, 1206. The archive that declared the war guaranteed the Jin lost the Mandate of Heaven, a sign that they were unfit to control, and required an uprising of Han Chinese against the Jin state.
