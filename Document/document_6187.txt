Gilligan played for Sussex all through the 1921 season and as indicated by "Wisden" "made an unmistakable development". His batting record was like the past season, in spite of the fact that he expanded his number of wickets in the season to 90 at a normal of 30.64. "Wisden" takes note of that his bowling was not measurably great, however that his greatest effect came in handling, which was "splendid in the extraordinary. He was portrayed on all hands as the best mid-off in England." In 1922, Gilligan expected the Sussex captaincy from Herbert Wilson. The group's outcomes were not amazing, however "Wisden" said that the group were alluring to watch and exceeded expectations in handling, in which Gilligan shown others how its done. Gilligan later reviewed that he got extraordinary help from George Cox, the senior expert in the group. By and by, Gilligan had his best season to date with bat and ball; he scored 916 runs and took 135 wickets at a normal of 18.75. In view of his great structure, he was chosen in the esteemed Gentlemen v Players coordinate at Lord's. Showing up for the Gentlemen, a group of novices, his handling specifically awed observers. He was chosen in a further delegate coordinate, when he played for the "Remainder of England" against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In the last diversion, he took eight wickets altogether. Toward the finish of the period, Gilligan was incorporated into the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) group to visit South Africa and play a Test arrangement.
