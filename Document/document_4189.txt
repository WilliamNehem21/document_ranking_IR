In the group's unique arrangement, "Land Nova" comprised of missions that were bookended by oversimplified cutscenes, similar to those of the 1990 Origin Systems computer game "Wing Commander". Be that as it may, in 1994, Origin discharged "", which includes live-activity full-movement video (FMV) cutscenes. This constrained Looking Glass into fusing FMV into "Land Nova". Schmidt later stated, "Heaps of A-rundown diversions were including increasingly more FMV, and it was felt by the board that if "Land Nova" didn't have any, it would look below average." The choice to incorporate it came when the amusement was at that point late, and a huge bit of the amusement's subsidizing was diverted toward cutscene generation. A scriptwriter from outside the organization was contracted to compose the cutscenes; on account of the transaction between the cutscenes and missions, the content experienced various modifies. The diversion's postponements and substantial spending plan brought about the expulsion of an arranged online multiplayer part, and the FMV cutscenes, which were costly to create, expanded the quantity of offers expected to recover advancement costs. A fix was intended to discharge post-dispatch in September 1996 and include the online multiplayer usefulness, however it didn't emerge. Schmidt called the cutscenes a "mammoth diversion" for the group and himself as venture pioneer: he later depicted them as "cheesier than most" of those from the period and noticed that "I flinch a great deal thinking back on [them]". Schmidt trusted that they were likely a mistake from a business outlook, as they further expanded the diversion's financial plan and creation length, in any case did not build deals.
