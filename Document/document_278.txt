A few atomic investigations distributed during the 2000s showed that "Psilocybe", as it was characterized at that point, was polyphyletic. The examinations upheld isolating the sort into two clades, one comprising of the dye, stimulating species in the family Hymenogastraceae, and the other the non-dye, non-psychedelic species in the family Strophariaceae. Be that as it may, the for the most part acknowledged lectotype (an example later chosen when the first creator of a taxon name did not assign a sort) of the variety overall seemed to be "Psilocybe montana", which is a non-dye, non-psychedelic species. In the event that the non-dye, non-stimulating species in the examination were to be isolated, it would have left the psychedelic clade without a legitimate name. To determine this problem, a few mycologists proposed in a 2005 distribution to ration the name "Psilocybe", with "P.ÃÂ semilanceata" as the sort. As they clarified, rationing the name "Psilocybe" along these lines would avert nomenclatural changes to an outstanding gathering of parasites, numerous types of which are "connected to prehistoric studies, humanities, religion, exchange ways of life, scientific science, law authorization, laws and guideline". Further, the name "P.ÃÂ semilanceata" had generally been acknowledged as the lectotype by numerous creators in the period 1938Ã¢ÂÂ 68. The proposition to ration the name "Psilocybe", with "P.ÃÂ semilanceata" as the sort was acknowledged consistently by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi in 2009.
