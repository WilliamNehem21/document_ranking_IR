Notwithstanding this, the two were factional foes, and Boyd doled out Breckinridge to the daintily respected Committee on Foreign Affairs. Breckinridge's first discourse, and a few ensuing ones, were made to protect William Butler, again a presidential hopeful in 1852, from charges leveled by defenders of the Young America development that he was excessively old and had not made his position on servitude clear. The assaults originated from the pages of George Nicholas Sanders' "Popularity based Review", and on the House floor from a few men, almost every one of whom upheld Stephen Douglas for the assignment.

He guarded the defendability of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 against assaults by Ohio Representative Joshua Giddings and contradicted Andrew Johnson's proposed Homestead Act out of worry that it would make more domains that prohibited subjection. In spite of his crusade talk that government assets should just be utilized for interior enhancements "of a national character", he looked to build Kentucky's administrative assignment for development and upkeep of streams and harbors, and bolstered charges that profited his region's hemp ranchers.
