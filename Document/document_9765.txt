In the spring of 198ÃÂ BC, Attalus came back to Greece with twenty-three quinqueremes joining an armada of twenty Rhodian decked warships at Andros, to finish the victory of Euboea started the earlier year. Before long joined by the Romans, the consolidated armadas took Eretria and later Carystus. In this way, the partners controlled all of Euboea aside from Chalcis. The associated armada at that point cruised for Cenchreae in anticipation of an assault on Corinth. In the interim, the new Roman representative for that year, Titus Quinctius Flamininus, had discovered that the Achaean League, partners of Macedon, had an adjustment in administration which favored Rome. With the expectation of inciting the Achaeans to forsake Philip and join the partners, emissaries were sent, including Attalus himself, to Sicyon, where they offered the consolidation of Corinth into the Achaean League. Attalus obviously so inspired the Sicyonians, that they raised a huge statue of him in their commercial center and organized forfeits in his respect. A gathering of the League was assembled and after a warmed discussion and the withdrawal of some of agents the rest consented to join the coalition. Attalus drove his military from Cenchreae (presently constrained by the partners) through the Isthmus and assaulted Corinth from the north, controlling the entrance to Lechaeum, the Corinthian port on the Gulf of Corinth, the Romans assaulted from the east controlling the ways to deal with Cenchreae, with the Achaeans assaulting from the west controlling the entrance to the city by means of the Sicyonian entryway. Anyway the city held, and when Macedonian fortifications arrived, the attack was surrendered. The Achaeans were rejected, the Romans left for Corcyra, while Attalus cruised for Piraeus.
