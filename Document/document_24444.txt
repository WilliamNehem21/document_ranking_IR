On 26 April, he assumed command of the unitafter Galland was wounded. BÃ¤r possibly flew his first operational sortie with JVÂ 44 on 27 April 1945. Flying the MeÂ 262Â A-1/U5, a six MK 108 cannon prototype, he was accompanied by "Major" Wilhelm Herget and the non-commissioned officer NCO ("Unteroffizier") Franz KÃ¶ster when the trio engaged American fighters over Riem; BÃ¤r claimed one aerial victory. While not flying operationally, BÃ¤r spent most of his time giving hasty instruction to the new pilots still being assigned to JVÂ 44. With JVÂ 44, he achieved his final four aerial victories (3 P-47s and 1 Mosquito) on 28 April, bringing his total to 220. All told, he had achieved 16 victories in the MeÂ 262, making him the second most successful "Jet Expert" of the war, which he finished as a Lieutenant Colonel ("Oberstleutnant").
During the final days of the Second World War in Europe, Lieutenant General ("Generalleutnant") Adolf Galland attempted to surrender JVÂ 44 to American forces from his hospital bed. At the same time Air General ("General der Flieger") Karl Koller had ordered JVÂ 44 to relocate to Prague and continue fighting. BÃ¤r, as a Galland loyalist, attempted to ignore the order. BÃ¤r was further pressured to relocate JVÂ 44 when Major General ("Generalmajor") Dietrich Peltz, commander of "IX. Fliegerkorps", and Colonel Hajo Herrmann, commander of 9. Flieger-Division (J), unexpectedly emerged at the control room in Maxglan on 2 May 1945. A heated and violent dispute erupted between BÃ¤r, Peltz and Herrmann, witnessed by Walter Krupinski. He later recalled that BÃ¤r responded with "Yes, sir, but we are under the command of "Generalleutnant" Galland, and I will only follow orders of "Generalleutnant" Galland!"âa final act of disobedience that Krupinski believed could have led to BÃ¤r being shot for insubordination.
