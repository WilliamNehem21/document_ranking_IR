Having showed up in six scenes of the third season and the initial two of the fourth season, Blake Bashoff tried out for and won the piece of Moritz Stiefel in the Broadway melodic "Spring Awakening". He cautioned Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse that he would be unfit to shoot "Lost" for no less than a half year starting in December 2007, as he practiced for and performed in the creation. Being "enormous fans" of the melodic and saluting Bashoff on what they thought was a "stunning chance," they conceptualized thoughts with different authors to work him out of the story while despite everything they had him available to them. Having chosen some time back that Karl would in the long amazing, pinpointed the scene. The cliffhanger of "Meet Kevin Johnson" sees Karl shot dead by inconspicuous executioners in the wilderness. Two scenes later, the character Miles Straume (Ken Leung) discovers Karl in part covered in the wilderness soil, however this carcass is depicted by a body twofold and not Bashoff. As indicated by Bashoff, the scholars trust that he can come back to "Lost" sooner or later to "fill a cool need like [Tom does in 'Meet Kevin Johnson']." as to his involvement with "Lost", Bashoff related that "I adore the show. [The cast]'s an incredible gathering Ã¢ÂÂ¦ and Ã¢ÂÂ¦ you get the chance to shoot in heaven"; in any case, he wanted that he had gotten familiar with Karl's backstory.
