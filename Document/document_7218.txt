In 1876, city authorities talked about what job the chime should play in the country's Centennial celebrations. Some needed to fix it so it could sound at the Centennial Exposition being held in Philadelphia, however the thought was not received; the ringer's caretakers inferred that it was improbable that the metal could be made into a chime that would have a lovely stable, and that the break had moved toward becoming piece of the ringer's character. Rather, a copy gauging (1,000ÃÂ pounds for every one of the first states) was thrown. The metal utilized for what was named "the Centennial Bell" included four liquefied down guns: one utilized by each side in the American Revolutionary War, and one utilized by each side in the Civil War. That ringer was sounded at the Exposition grounds on July 4, 1876, was later recast to improve the sound, and today is the chime connected to the check in the steeple of Independence Hall. While the Liberty Bell did not go to the Exposition, a large number of Exposition guests came to visit it, and its picture was omnipresent at the Exposition groundsÃ¢ÂÂheap trinkets were sold bearing its picture or shape, and state structures contained reproductions of the ringer made of substances extending from stone to tobacco. In 1877, the ringer was swung from the roof of the Assembly Room by a chain with thirteen connections.
