He won his tenth round of the period on June 28, 1950, and turned into the principal pitcher to hit the 10-win mark close by Bob Lemon. After the amusement, he told an Associated Press columnist that he was just about persuaded that Lady Luck had chosen to offer him a reprieve in the wake of kicking him around for as long as a few years. Houtteman stated, "I've been having a quite decent year and it beyond any doubt feels great after a portion of the things that have transpired". Seven days into July, Houtteman scored his eleventh triumph, and just lost five amusements, in a 6Ã¢ÂÂ 1 success against the St. Louis Browns. Only a couple of days after the fact, Houtteman was named to the All-Star list close by individual Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers. In the 1950 All-Star diversion, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He permitted one earned run, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning on a Ralph Kiner grand slam that influenced the diversion to go to additional innings.
