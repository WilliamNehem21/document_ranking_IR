In spite of the fact that, the utilization of oil as a coupling operator can be followed to the twelfth century, advancements in its taking care of and control characterize the period. Egg gum based paint was the prevailing medium until the 1430s, and keeping in mind that it produces both brilliant and light hues, it dries rapidly and is a troublesome medium in which to accomplish naturalistic surfaces or profound shadows. Oil permits smooth, translucent surfaces and can be connected in a scope of thicknesses, from barely recognizable differences to thick general terms. It dries gradually and is effectively controlled while still wet. These qualities enabled more opportunity to include unobtrusive detail and empower wet-on-wet strategies. Smooth changes of shading are conceivable in light of the fact that segments of the mediator layers of paint can be cleaned or evacuated as the paint dries. Oil empowers separation among degrees of intelligent light, from shadow to brilliant pillars, and moment delineations of light impacts using straightforward coatings. This new opportunity in controlling light impacts offered ascend to increasingly exact and reasonable delineations of surface surfaces; van Eyck and van der Weyden commonly show light falling on surfaces, for example, gems, wooden floors, materials and family unit objects.
