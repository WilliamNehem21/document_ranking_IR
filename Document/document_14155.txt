Later in June, the boats partook in extra gunnery preparing and were available at the Kiel Week cruising regatta. Amid Kiel Week, an American squadron that incorporated the ship and four cruisers visited. Following the finish of Kiel Week, the I Squadron, which had been fortified with the new cruiser , and the I "Torpedobootsflotille" went to ocean for increasingly strategic and gunnery practices in the North Sea, which kept going from 6 to 28 July. Amid the moves, "Kaiser Friedrich III" slammed into the torpedo watercraft . One man on board "G112" was murdered in the mishap, however the pontoon stayed above water and was towed to Wilhelmshaven. "Kaiser Friedrich III" supported just minor harm. At the finish of the activities, the I Squadron ceased in Arendal from 24 to 27 July, while the littler vessels went to Stavanger. The boats came back to Kiel on 28 July, where arrangements for the yearly armada moves started, which began on 15 August. After the finish of the activities, the "Heimatflotte" was revamped as the "Aktive Schlachtflotte" (Active Battle Fleet), and Koester supplanted Prince Heinrich as the armada authority; he exchanged his banner from "Kaiser Friedrich III" to "Kaiser Wilhelm II".
