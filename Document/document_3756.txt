Expounding on Terry-Thomas on TV, Wilfred Greatorex saw that "he hasÃÂ ... physical qualities that make him a blessing to visual amusement: a huge, rather emaciated face, pre-created for close-ups; the famous space of 33% of an inch between his two most conspicuous top teeth; a mouth that is loaded with demeanor. Add to these pictoral favorable circumstances his eight-inch cigarette holder and Eddie Cantor eyes".
