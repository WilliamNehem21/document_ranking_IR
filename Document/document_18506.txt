FaurÃ©'s operas have not found a place in the regular repertoire. "PromÃ©thÃ©e" is the more neglected of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century. Copland considered "PÃ©nÃ©lope" (1913) a fascinating work, and one of the best operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, "distinctly non-theatrical." The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In FaurÃ©'s late style, "tonality is stretched hard, without breaking." On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, "A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre.Â ... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective." However, after a 2006 production at the Wexford Festival, Ian Fox wrote, "FaurÃ©'s "PÃ©nÃ©lope" is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, it was a surprise how sure the composer's theatrical touch was."
