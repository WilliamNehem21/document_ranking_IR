The turnpike starts at the crossing point of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard in San Diego. For its initial couple of miles, it parallels the San Diego River floodway. Close Old Town San Diego, I-8 meets with I-5 just as with Rosecrans Avenue, the previous directing of SRÃÂ 209. As the interstate enters Mission Valley, it proceeds with eastbound, bisecting the zone known as "Inn Circle" that has a few inns. I-8 at that point has exchanges with SRÃÂ 163, I-805, and I-15 and its continuation, SRÃÂ 15, before making a little curve toward the north. In La Mesa, the course converges SRÃÂ 125. I-8 proceeds into El Cajon, where it converges with SRÃÂ 67 before it rises into the mountains and the Cleveland National Forest, going through towns, for example, Alpine and Pine Valley, achieving high focuses at Laguna Summit, Crestwood Summit, and Tecate Divide, crossing the Pine Valley Creek Bridge and going close to the Viejas Casino. A U.S. fringe watch inside checkpoint was developed in 1995 close Alpine, for westward traffic on I-8; in any case, this brought about bootleggers driving the incorrect path on I-8 at high speeds so as to keep away from the checkpoint, causing a few accidents, even after solid hindrances were introduced. The interstate converges with SRÃÂ 79 in the national backwoods before going through the La Posta and Campo Indian reservations. In Boulevard, I-8 has a trade with the eastern end of SRÃÂ 94.
