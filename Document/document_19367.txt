At magnitude 3.8, the brightest star in Leo Minor is an orange giant of spectral class K0III named 46Â Leonis Minoris or Praecipua; its colour is evident when seen through binoculars. Situated from Earth, it has around 32Â times the luminosity and is 8.5Â times the size of the Sun. It was also catalogued and named as o Leonis Minoris by Johann Elert Bode, which has been misinterpreted as Omicron Leonis Minoris. More confusion occurred with its proper name "Praecipua", which appears to have been originally applied to 37 Leonis Minoris in the 1814 "Palermo Catalogue" of Giuseppe Piazzi, who mistakenly assessed the latter star as the brighter. This name was later connected by Allen with 46 Leonis Minorisâan error perpetuated by subsequent astronomers. The original "Praecipua", 37 Leonis Minoris, has an apparent magnitude of 4.69, but is a distant yellow supergiant of spectral type G2.5IIa and absolute magnitude of â1.84, around distant.
Beta Leonis Minoris is a binary star system. The primary is a giant star of spectral class G8 and apparent magnitude of 4.4. It has around double the mass, 7.8Â times the radius and 36Â times the luminosity of the Earth's Sun. Separated by 11Â seconds of arc from the primary, the secondary is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F8. The two orbit around a common centre of gravity every 38.62Â years, and lie away from the Solar System.
