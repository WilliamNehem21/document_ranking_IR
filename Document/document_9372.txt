In the high separation of the foundation, over the cross breed stone developments, four gatherings of individuals and animals are found in flight. On the quick left a human male rides on a chthonic sun powered falcon lion. The human conveys a triple-expanded tree of life on which roosts a fowl; as indicated by Fraenger "an emblematic flying creature of death". Fraenger trusts the man is planned to speak to a virtuoso, "he is the image of the eradication of the duality of the genders, which are settled in the ether into their unique condition of solidarity". To their privilege a knight with a dolphin tail cruises on a winged fish. The knight's tail twists back to contact the back of his head, which references the normal image of time everlasting: the snake gnawing its own tail. On the quick right of the board, a winged youth takes off upwards conveying a fish in his grasp and a bird of prey on his back. As indicated by Belting, in these entries Bosch's "creative ability triumphsÃÂ ... the uncertainty of [his] visual sentence structure surpasses even the puzzler of substance, opening up that new component of opportunity by which painting progresses toward becoming craftsmanship." Fraenger titled his section on the high foundation "The Ascent to Heaven", and composed that the airborne figures were likely planned as a connection between "what is above" and "what is underneath", similarly as the left and right hand boards speak to "what was" and "what will be".
