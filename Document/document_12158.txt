Walters was selected a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1956 New Year Honors. In March 1957, he was one of three hopefuls, alongside Air Vice Marshals Scherger and Hancock, touted as conceivable successors to Air Marshal Sir John McCauley as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. In spite of the fact that Walters was viewed as entirely capable, Scherger had for some time been viewed as extraordinary and seemed to be "effectively the best material on offer" as indicated by a previous CAS, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman. Scherger picked up the arrangement, and Walters progressed toward becoming Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 21ÃÂ October. As AMP he involved a seat reporting in real time Board, the administration's controlling body that included its senior officers and was led by the CAS. In this job Walters supported the proposals of a survey by the AOC Training Command, Air Vice Marshal Ian McLachlan, that prompted an arrangement of RAAF College cadets undertaking scholastic degrees, in accordance with comparable establishments in the other equipped administrations; the school was hence renamed RAAF Academy. Walters filled in as AMP until August 1959. The next month he was selected AOC Support Command, another association made by blending the RAAF's previous Training and Maintenance Commands. At the point when Scherger's term as CAS was because of complete in May 1961, Walters and Hancock were yet again advanced to the Minister for Air as potential substitutions. "Walters was again unfortunate", in the expressions of Air Force students of history Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, Hancock's "proficient capacity, operational experience and individual characteristics" being regarded increasingly proper for the job.
