Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uraniumâthorium dating, based on the decay of U to Th, and ioniumâthorium dating, which measures the ratio of Th to Th. These rely on the fact that Th is a primordial radioisotope, but Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of U. Uraniumâthorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of U and Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of U into Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uraniumâthorium dating. Uraniumâthorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ioniumâthorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both Th and Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of Th to Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of Th to Th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer.
