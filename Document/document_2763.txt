In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" asked eight Tamil movie chiefs to list their untouched most loved Tamil movies; twoJ. Mahendran and K. Balachandernamed "Chandralekha". Mahendran stated, "In the event that anyone endeavors to redo this highly contrasting film, they will make a joke of it." According to Balachander, "Much the same as "Sivaji" today, individuals discussed "Chandralekha" previously. Delivered at an expense of 30 lakhs ([3 million], a gigantic entirety around then), it has terrific sets. I have seen it multiple times." In December 2008, Muthiah stated: "Given how fantastic it wasand the thankfulness showered on it from 1948 till well into the 1950s, which is the point at which I made up for lost time with itI'm beyond any doubt that if re-discharged, it would improve in the cinema world than most Tamil movies today." In a 2011 meeting with Indo-Asian News Service (IANS), South Indian Bollywood on-screen character Vyjayanthimala said that despite the fact that individuals think about that she "prepared" for other South Indian female performing artists in Hindi film, "the individual who truly opened the entryways was S. S. Vasan ... Whenever ["Chandralekha" was] discharged, it overwhelmed the North in light of the fact that by then they haven't seen that sort of sumptuous sets, ensembles and magnificence. So Vasan was the individual who opened the entryway for Hindi movies in the South."
