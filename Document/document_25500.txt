On 12Â April 1944, Savige's IÂ Corps headquarters moved up from Queensland to relieve that of Berrymanâs IIÂ Corps at Finschhafen. The two staffs had hoped to exchange office equipment, thus saving on shipping, but Advanced LHQ ordered that each should move with all its stores. Instead, the designations of the two corps were exchanged, so that IÂ Corps was still the corps in Australia and IIÂ Corps the one in New Guinea. On 20Â April, IIÂ Corps was ordered to assume the designation and function of New Guinea Force and the existing headquarters of New Guinea Force in Port Moresby was broken up. Savige therefore assumed command of New Guinea Force, his new headquarters opening at Lae on 6Â May. At this time, no major combat operations were taking place and activities were winding down in Australian New Guinea. New Guinea Force's main role was rolling up the base installations and shipping units back to Australia. On 9 September 1944, MacArthur discarded the task force organisation. Henceforth the US Sixth Army and Eighth Army and Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdeeâs First Army reported directly to him. First Army headquarters arrived at Lae on 1Â October and assumed control of Australian troops in New Guinea. At midnight, New Guinea Force was discontinued, and Savige's headquarters became IIÂ Corps once more.
