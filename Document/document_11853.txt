Given $700 in Spanish gold by the Bacheller-Johnson syndicate to function as a war journalist in Cuba as the SpanishÃ¢ÂÂ American War was pending, the 25-year-old Crane left New York on November 27, 1896, on a train destined for Jacksonville, Florida. Upon landing in Jacksonville, he enrolled at the St. James Hotel under the assumed name of Samuel Carleton to keep up obscurity while looking for entry to Cuba. While sitting tight for a vessel, he visited the city and visited the nearby massage parlors. Inside days he met 31-year-old Cora Taylor, owner of the downtown indecent house Hotel de Dream. Naturally introduced to a good Boston family, Taylor (whose legitimate name was Cora Ethel Stewart) had just had two brief relational unions; her first spouse, Vinton Murphy, separated from her on grounds of infidelity. In 1889, she had hitched British Captain Donald William Stewart. She left him in 1892 for another man, however was still legitimately hitched. When Crane arrived, Taylor had been in Jacksonville for a long time. She carried on with a bohemian way of life, claimed a lodging of meeting, and was a notable and regarded neighborhood figure. The two hung out while Crane anticipated his flight. He was at last cleared to leave for the Cuban port of Cienfuegos on New Year's Eve on board the SS "Commodore".
