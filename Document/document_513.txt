James Montgomery of MTV News called it outwardly striking and watched a lot of "reminiscent symbolism (marvelous high contrast close-ups, thick tufts of translucent smoke, oversaturated slope scapes, shrewdly outlined stallions)". He said that, similar to the melody, the video is by turns pompous and exceptionally private. The site's Jocelyn Vena felt that it had illusory and surrealistic pictures of Rihanna, who travels through set-ups that are once in a while remarkable. E! Online's Bruna Nessif said that the video demonstrates a plenitude of expound symbolism, stories, and particularly a "strange and attractive" Rihanna. Moreover, she thought that it was evident that the body of an intensely inked man's arm, which Rihanna sticks to urgently, is a reference to Chris Brown. "NME" magazine watched Rihanna being appeared four situations that speak to the four components of the earth, air, water and flame. Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Canada felt the video had neglected to catch the tune's distinctive festival of a relationship and expressed, "It appears just as [Rihanna is] in turmoil, considering more joyful occasions." Marc Hogan of "Turn" inferred that the video was an "affirmation of Rihanna's cumbersome segue into grown-up contemporary-dom." The video for "Jewels" was Vevo's fourth most-saw visual of 2013.
