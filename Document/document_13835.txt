In 1721, the duke started to come up short on room in the Alter Hauptbau for the elements of his court and Frisoni started intending to develop it. The duke rejected the thought in 1724 and requested Frisoni to build the Neuer Hauptbau. Frisoni planned a four-story structure, twofold the tallness of the current castle, yet designs changed a few times after development started in 1725 on the primary porch of the south patio nursery. Frisoni settled on a three-story fabricating that still managed Eberhard Louis six spaces for his suite to the three in the Alter Hauptbau. To interface the Neuer Hauptbau to the current royal residence, Frisoni fabricated the Bildergalerie and Festinbau on the west side, and the Ahnengalerie and Schlosstheater (Palace theater) on the east. The Bildergalerie and Ahnengalerie were improved from 1731 to 1733. Except for the insides of the Neuer Hauptbau and Schlosstheater, all work was done in 1733, yet Eberhard Louis kicked the bucket that equivalent year. Just a couple of rooms in the west end of the Neuer Hauptbau had been finished when he kicked the bucket. Development of the Neuer Hauptbau and its associating exhibitions cost 465,000 guilders and was overseen by Paolo Retti, who on occasion had in excess of 650 stone artisans, cutters, and essential workers chipping away at the exteriors somewhere in the range of 1726 and 1728. Development of Ludwigsburg Palace cost the Duchy of WÃÂ¼rttemberg 3,000,000 florins.
