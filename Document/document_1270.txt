The general British task was for the most part finished by September 2000. The RUF started to incapacitate after political weight, and later monetary assents, were applied on LiberiaÃ¢ÂÂwhich had bolstered the RUF in return for struggle jewels carried out of Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government in the end marked a truce with the RUF that obliged the last to enter the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British preparing groups were supplanted by a universal power, the DDR procedure was practically finished. English powers kept on being engaged with Sierra Leone by giving the biggest commitment of work force to the global preparing group and educating on a rebuilding regarding Sierra Leone's military. A little power was sent to the territory in 2003 to guarantee solidness while a few arraignments and captures were made by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The accomplishment of British activities in Sierra Leone vindicated a few ideas, including the maintenance of high-status powers. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was quick to see Western intercessions in different clashes, andÃ¢ÂÂalongside FranceÃ¢ÂÂbolstered the formation of a few European Union Battlegroups for the reason. As it occurred, political resistance and later British responsibilities in Afghanistan and Iraq forestalled further British activities in Africa.
