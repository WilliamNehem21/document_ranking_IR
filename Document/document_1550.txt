Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off at a respectable starting point to end the eighth inning. At the point when the amusement went into additional innings, Hershiser did not have any desire to proceed: "I truly would not like to break it", Hershiser said. "I needed to stop at 58. I needed me and Don to be as one at the top. Be that as it may, the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) revealed to me they weren't removing me from the diversion, so I figured, what the hell, I should get the person out." Through the initial nine innings, no Padre had achieved a respectable halfway point. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the amusement and to himself to proceed. Hershiser endured the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball gotten by right defender JosÃÂ© GonzÃÂ¡lez. In any case, he had some near fiascoes in two or three innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, however achieved a respectable starting point after a wild pitch dodged catcher Mike Scioscia. The accompanying two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. At that point, Garry Templeton was given a purposeful base on balls. Templeton progressed to a respectable halfway point before the last out was recorded.
