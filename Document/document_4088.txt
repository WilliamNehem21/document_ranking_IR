In the wake of Hurricane King moving northward through Florida, a territory of low weight formed into a tropical violent wind on OctoberÃÂ 18 south of Louisiana. This tempest was given the name Love and immediately reinforced, achieving storm status presently. The tempest at first moved westbound over the Gulf of Mexico, however before long swung southward into the focal part of the Gulf on OctoberÃÂ 19. Sea tempest Love's most extreme supported breezes are accepted to have achieved their pinnacle power right off the bat October 20. All through the sea tempest's track, dry air encroached on the western side of the tropical violent wind's flow, which delivered ominous conditions for extra tropical cyclogenesis. On OctoberÃÂ 20, the tempest started bending northeastward towards the shore of western Florida; in any case, the dry air totally circumnavigated Love's focal point of course, radically debilitating the typhoon simultaneously. On OctoberÃÂ 21, Love debilitated to a typhoon, and it struck the Big Bend locale of Florida, north of Cedar Key. At the time, its breezes were just of moderate intense, and the tempest deteriorated into a trough of low weight presently. This joined with a moving toward virus front to create an amazing extratropical storm.
