England pulled back the greater part of its High Commission staff from Salisbury in the days following UDI, leaving a little skeleton staff to man a "remaining mission" proposed to enable Gibbs to keep the British government educated of nearby happenings. A few nations pursued Britain's lead and shut their offices in Salisbury, with one conspicuous special case to this being the United States, which held its department general in post-UDI Rhodesia, relabelling it a "US Contacts Office" to dodge the issue of discretionary acknowledgment. South Africa and Portugal kept up "Authorize Diplomatic Representative" workplaces in Salisbury, which were government offices in everything except name, while Rhodesia kept its pre-UDI abroad missions in Pretoria, Lisbon and LourenÃÂ§o Marques. Informal delegate workplaces of the Rhodesian government additionally existed in the US, Japan and West Germany, while a resident of Belgium was utilized to speak to Rhodesian interests there. The Rhodesian High Commission in London, situated at Rhodesia House on the Strand, stayed under the control of the post-UDI government and viably turned into its agent office in the UK. Like the South African Embassy on Trafalgar Square, Rhodesia House turned into a normal focus for political showings. These proceeded even after Britain constrained the workplace to shut in 1969.
