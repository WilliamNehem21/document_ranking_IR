The situation of the Inaccessible Island rail in the bigger rail family (Rallidae) has for some time been a wellspring of vulnerability. Lowe believed that its nearest relatives may have been dark crake of Africa, or maybe an early branch of the variety "Porphyrio" (swamphens), an end dependent on similitudes of plumage. He conceded that it was hard to appoint the rail to any relatives. American scientist Storrs Olson recommended in 1973 that it was identified with the ""Rallus" collection", which incorporated the genera "Rallus" and "Hypotaenidia" (presently lumped with "Gallirallus"), in light of the structure of the skeleton. Specifically he proposed it was a piece of a professional "Rallus" aggregate that incorporated the Indian Ocean variety "Dryolimnas", and the Australasian "Lewinia". Olson proposed the professional "Rallus" rails have a relict circulation and would have been available in Africa and South America, where the progenitors of the Inaccessible Island rail originated from. The latest similar morphological investigation to incorporate the class, in 1998, set it in a subtribe Crecina of the crakes. Its accurate position couldn't be resolved, yet it was proposed to maybe be the sister taxon to the sort "Laterallus", a class of little crakes found for the most part in South America.
