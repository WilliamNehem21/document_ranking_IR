In 2004, eighteen years after Hubbard's demise, the Church guaranteed eight million adherents around the world. As indicated by religious researcher J. Gordon Melton, this is an overestimate, considering Scientologists individuals who had just purchased a book. The City University of New York's American Religious Identification Survey found that by 2009 just 25,000 Americans distinguished as Scientologists. Hubbard's essence still invades Scientology. Each Church of Scientology keeps up an office held for Hubbard, with a work area, seat and composing gear, prepared to be utilized. Lonnie D. Kliever noticed that Hubbard was "the main wellspring of the religion, and he has no successor". Hubbard is alluded to just as "Source" inside Scientology and the religious adequacy of any Scientology-related movement is dictated by how intently it sticks to Hubbard's tenets. Hubbard's name and mark are legitimate trademarks of the Religious Technology Center, set up in 1982 to control and manage the utilization of Hubbard's works and Scientology's trademarks and copyrights. The RTC is the focal association inside Scientology's mind boggling corporate chain of importance and has put much exertion into re-checking the precision of all Scientology productions to "ensur[e] the accessibility of the unadulterated compositions of Mr. Hubbard to the coming ages".
