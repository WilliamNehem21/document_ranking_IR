Wackett's first role was to establish parachute instruction within the Air Force. His trip home from England had been postponed at the last minute to enable him to be trained; he began instructing volunteers in 1926Â at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and made Australia's first freefall descent from a military aircraftâan Airco DH.9âon 26Â May. The Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, himself made a successful jump on 5Â August, to set "a good example" prior to making the wearing of parachutes compulsory for all aircrew. On 21Â August, Wackett piloted the DH.9Â from which Flying Officer Frederick Scherger made the first public display of parachuting in Australia, at Essendon, Victoria.
By August 1927, Wackett had been promoted flight lieutenant and given command of the Papuan Survey Flight formed at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Consisting of two Supermarine SeagullÂ III single-engined amphibious biplanes and six aircrew, the flight was to examine and photograph the Papuan and New Guinean coasts as far north as Aitape and, if possible, Bougainville. Stripped of all equipment considered non-essentialâincluding radio setsâto increase range, the aircraft departed on 27Â September and journeyed some , covering almost of country and taking 350Â photos. Wackett's machine (serial A9-5) returned to Melbourne on 26Â December and the other (A9â6) on 19Â January 1928. Inclement weather prevented the expedition from reaching Bougainville, and thick jungle cover limited the usefulness of its photographic record. Nevertheless, the Air Force learned valuable lessons concerning the Seagull's capabilities in a potential wartime role, as it was found to be unsuited to operations in the tropics.
