Carey was later to take incredible pride in being the main commentator to perceive Etty's potential, and kept on advocating him all through his profession. In 1818 Etty entered a duplicate of Damiano Mazza's "The Rape of Ganymede"Ã¢ÂÂ at the time thought to be by TitianÃ¢ÂÂin one of the Royal Academy's work of art rivalries. Effectively the most cultivated section in the challenge, Etty was because of win until two of different candidates whined that he had in fact ruptured RA administers by quickly expelling the sketch from Academy premises to take a shot at it at home; they further griped that Etty was actually an expert craftsman and in this manner ineligible for the challenge in spite of his as yet being an understudy. Etty was excluded from the challenge, yet the high caliber of his work additionally raised his glory inside the Academy.
