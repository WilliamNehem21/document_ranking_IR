In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De LeÃ³n, discovered Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans.

Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De LeÃ³n conducted funeral services for the three victims.
