"Naruto" has been depicted by a few commentators as a story about growing up. Clinician Lawrence C. Rubin recommends that the storylines would engage perusers of all ages who have lost friends and family, or are experiencing issues discovering companions, or who are in different circumstances appeared in the arrangement. In Yukari Fujimoto's view, as the characters develop, they show regard to the grown-ups who have raised and shown them, making it a moderate storyline in contrast with other manga of a similar timeframe, for example, "One Piece" and "Air Gear". Rik Spanjers sees the distinction between Sasuke (an introvert) and Naruto (a positive thinker) as deplorable, contending that the complexity between the two heroes' way to deal with the world is essential to the plot: "Naruto's quality develops as he acquires friends and family to secure, while Sasuke stays alone and is progressively consumed by his mission for vengeance". Omote Tomoyuki calls attention to that there are numerous comic minutes in the story notwithstanding the challenges Naruto winds up in, however the comic components reduce drastically after some time as Naruto develops into a youngster, especially once Part II starts. "ShÃÂnen Jump" started to convey comedies, for example, "Gintama" and "Renewed!" from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view this is a piece of the purpose behind the adjustment in accentuation: "Naruto" "shouldn't give chuckling any longer".
