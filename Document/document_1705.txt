Through the early many years of the 20thÃÂ century, the Upper Basin states, except for Colorado, remained moderately undeveloped and utilized little of the water permitted to them under the Colorado River Compact. Water use had expanded fundamentally by the 1950s, and more water was being redirected out of the Colorado River bowl to the Front Range passage, the Salt Lake City region in Utah, and the Rio Grande bowl in New Mexico. Such tasks incorporated the Roberts Tunnel, finished in 1956, which occupies every year from the Blue River to the city of Denver, and the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, which conveys from the Fryingpan River to the Arkansas River bowl every year. Without the expansion of surface water stockpiling in the upper bowl, there was no assurance that the upper bowl states would almost certainly utilize everything of water given to them by the minimized. There was additionally the worry that dry spell could impede the upper bowl's capacity to convey the required past Lee's Ferry every year as stipulated by the minimized. A 1956 demonstration of Congress made room for the USBR's Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP), which involved the development of extensive dams on the Colorado, Green, Gunnison and San Juan Rivers.
