Special editions of magazines and products featured the team. "Dave Campbell's Texas Football" put out a 45,000-copy special issue titled "One for the Ages â Vince Young Leads Longhorns to the Fourth National Title". This issue included a column from Longhorn fan Matthew McConaughey as well as 15Â pages of photos from the Rose Bowl. The cover featured Young kissing the "crystal football" national championship trophy. "Sports Illustrated" held up their regular weekly edition to await the results of the Rose Bowl. They finally went to press with a cover showing Young diving into the end zone with the label "Superman". Analysis inside the issue gave Young a large part of the credit for the win. They also printed a special commemorative issue in the state of Texas with Young on the cover, shouting in triumph amidst a storm of multi-colored confetti after winning the game. Features in the special edition included a story on "Vince Young's Glory Days" by Tim Layden, as well as a story dissecting "How the" Rose Bowl "was won" by Austin Murphy. The issue was on sale alongside the regular edition of the magazine. General Mills produced a commemorative issue Wheaties box featuring Mack Brown and a Texas Longhorns football helmet on the front. The commemorative packaging was sold nationwide. Texas is the first national college football champion to be featured since Nebraska was on the box in 1997.
