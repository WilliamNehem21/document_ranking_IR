On November 13, 1923, twenty-nine days after the World Series finished, Stengel was exchanged to the lasting second-division-abiding Boston Braves with Dave Bancroft and Bill Cunningham for Joe Oeschger and Billy Southworth. Stengel had made the most of his time in New York and was at first despondent at the exchange, particularly since he had turned out to be near McGraw. He before long chilled off, and later commended McGraw as "the best chief I at any point played for". In spite of pestering agonies in his legs, Stengel played in 134 recreations amid the 1924 season, the most since his days with the Dodgers, and hit .280 with a group driving 13 stolen bases, however the Braves completed last. After the season, Stengel joined a baseball voyage through Europe sorted out by McGraw and Charles Comiskey, with Edna Stengel going with the group. Casey Stengel met King George V and the Duke of York, later to move toward becoming King George VI; Edna tasted tea with Queen Mary, an encounter that stressed her nerves. That winter, the Stengels moved into a house worked by Edna's dad in Glendale, California, where they would experience the remainder of their lives. The marriage delivered no kids.
