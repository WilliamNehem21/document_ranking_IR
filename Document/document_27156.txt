USÂ 2/USÂ 141 makes a run through Florence County, passing the Spread Eagle Chain of Lakes. The highway serves the communities of Spread Eagle and Florence. The only junction with another state trunk highway in Wisconsin on the northern section is with the concurrent highways WISÂ 70 / WISÂ 101 in Florence. The highway crosses back into Michigan on a bridge over the Brule River south of Crystal Falls.
Across the state line, the trunkline runs through forest near several smaller bodies of water such as Stager, Kennedy and Railroad lakes. The highway enters Crystal Falls on 5th Street. USÂ 2/USÂ 141 runs along the top of the hill in town and intersects the western terminus of M-69 next to the Iron County Courthouse. USÂ 141 continues westward on Crystal Avenue and separates from the USÂ 2 concurrency on the western edge of town. Running north and northwesterly, USÂ 141 passes to the east of the Ottawa National Forest through rural Iron County. The highway crosses the Paint River and continues through forest to the community of Amasa. The trunkline crosses the Hemlock River on the west side of town. From there, USÂ 141 runs northward into the southwest corner of Baraga County and also enters the Eastern Time Zone. West of Worm Lake, USÂ 141 meets M-28 in the community of Covington. The two highways merge and run easterly for about before USÂ 141 terminates at USÂ 41; M-28 continues eastward, merging with USÂ 41.
