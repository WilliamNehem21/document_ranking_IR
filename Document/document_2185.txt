The road proceeds through the southern end of Grand Rapids, close by local locations until Burton Street. A huge rail yard adjoins the trunkline on the east, and the interstate turns northeasterly on its way to deal with downtown. At Wealthy Street, the turnpike takes a sharp swing toward the west to cross the Grand River and quickly turns back north on a scaffold structure known as the S-Curve. The most astounding traffic volumes along USÃÂ 131 are found north of this waterway crossing. In 2009, MDOT estimated an AADT of 5,992ÃÂ trucks through the stretch between Market Avenue and Pearl Street. The trunkline proceeds past the Gerald R. Passage Museum and the Public Museum of Grand Rapids before the northbound carriageway traverses, at that point back under, the southbound paths, constraining traffic through this stretch to quickly drive on the left. North of I-196, USÃÂ 131 grabs a second, concealed assignment on thruway stock logs called I-296, in spite of the fact that the number isn't signposted along the street. I-296/USÃÂ 131 proceeds with the banks of the Grand River into Walker where the shrouded I-296 assignment swings toward the northwest along a progression of inclines to I-96 while USÃÂ 131 bends toward the upper east along a twist in the stream. As it proceeds with the waterway the road goes through the unincorporated network of Comstock Park and close to Fifth Third Ballpark, home of the West Michigan Whitecaps nearby small time baseball crew.
