GÃÂ©ricault masterminded the work of art to be displayed in London in 1820, where it was appeared at William Bullock's Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, from 10 June until the year's end, and seen by around 40,000 guests. The gathering in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the sketch was hailed as illustrative of another heading in French workmanship. It got more positive surveys than when it was appeared at the Salon. Partially, this was because of the way of the canvas' presentation: in Paris it had at first been balanced high in the Salon CarrÃÂ©Ã¢ÂÂan oversight that GÃÂ©ricault perceived when he saw the work introducedÃ¢ÂÂyet in London it was set near the ground, accentuating its grand effect. There may have been different purposes behind its notoriety in England also, including "a level of national self-salutation", the intrigue of the artistic creation as startling diversion, and two dramatic stimulations put together around the occasions with respect to the pontoon which agreed with the presentation and obtained vigorously from GÃÂ©ricault's portrayal. From the London presentation GÃÂ©ricault earned near 20,000ÃÂ francs, which was a lot of the expenses charged to guests, and significantly more than he would have been paid had the French government obtained the work from him. After the London display, Bullock conveyed the work of art to Dublin from the get-go in 1821, yet the presentation there was far less effective, in expansive part because of a contending show of a moving scene, "The Wreck of the Medusa" by the Marshall siblings firm, which was said to have been painted under the bearing of one of the overcomers of the calamity.
