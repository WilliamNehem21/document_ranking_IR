Senior battle architect Derek Daniels said that for "Lord of War II", they were putting together the mystical assaults with respect to components (e.g., air and earth). He said the battle framework was refreshed so it streamed easily among assaults and exchanging among weapons and enchantment. He said that they were working for a comparative parity of riddle understanding, investigation, and battle found in the principal diversion, and they utilized components that worked in that amusement as a base for the general equalization.

Barlog said the amusement would include new animals and saints from the folklore, and he needed to put progressively supervisor fights in it. Remarking on multiplayer alternatives, Barlog said that "there are potential outcomes for that however it isn't something we are doing well at this point." He said that he felt that "Lord of War" is a solitary player experience, and in spite of the fact that multiplayer "would be cool," it didn't speak to him to deal with. With respect to a PlayStation Portable (PSP) portion, he said that he figured it "would crack great," yet not something he had sufficient energy to deal with and it was Sony's choice whether to make a PSP portion.
