There are no records of sales figures of ukiyo-e from the era in which the print was made. Determining the popularity of a print requires indirect means, one of which is to compare the differences in surviving copies. For example, the more copies printed, the more the woodblocks wore down, resulting in loss of line clarity and details. Another example is that publishers often made changes to the blocks in later print runs. Researchers use clues such as these to determine whether prints were frequently reprintedâa sign of their popularity. The original printing of "Three Beauties of the Present Day" had the title in a bookmark-shape in the top right corner with the names of the three beauties to its left. Only two copies of this state are believed to have survived; they are in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the Koishikawa Ukiyo-e Art Museum in Tokyo. Later printings lack the title, the names of the beauties, or both, and the position of the publisher's and censor's seals varies slightly. The reasons for the changes are subject to speculation, such as that the beauties may have moved away, or their fame may have fallen. Based on clues such as these changes, researchers believe this print was a popular hit for Utamaro and Tsutaya.
