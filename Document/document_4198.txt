Another impact may have been the octagonal Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, not a tomb itself, yet "the soonest Islamic model for halfway arranged dedicatory structures", adjusting the Byzantine type of the martyrium in a structure remaining solitary, however on a stone stage as opposed to in a greenery enclosure. In the Persian circle, a custom of moderately little catacombs developed, frequently in the state of short hexagonal or octagonal domed towers, for the most part containing a solitary chamber, similar to the Malek Tomb. These single-chambered tombs formed into bigger structures in the Timurid and Mughal Empires, similar to the Gur-e Amir tomb of Timur at Samarkand and the renowned Mughal tombs of India, which finished in the Taj Mahal. The Mughal tombs are generally set in a vast walled "charbagh" ("chahar-bagh") or Mughal gardens, regularly with structures at the corners and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically set toward the finish of the greenery enclosure, backing onto the stream Yamuna; a focal putting is regular. They may have minarets, despite the fact that they don't regularly work as mosques. The Tomb of Jahangir does not have any vault, while the Tomb of Akbar the Great has just little enhancing ones. Other Islamic Indian rulers constructed comparable tombs, for example, Gol Gumbaz.
