In 1896, the manager Milton Bode drew closer Leno with a proposition for a ludicrous melodic satire vehicle formulated for him called "Orlando Dando, the Volunteer", by Basil Hood with music by Walter Slaughter. Leno's specialist declined the offer, as his customer was emphatically reserved for a long time. Bode offered Leno ÃÂ£625 (ÃÂ£ in 2019 balanced for expansion) for a six-week appearance in 1898. After hearing this, the entertainer abrogated his operator and acknowledged the offer. Leno visited the regions in the piece and was a prompt achievement. So well known was his execution that Bode reconnected him for a further two shows: the melodic sham "In Gay Piccadilly!" (1899), by George R. Sims, in which Leno's uncle, Johnny Danvers showed up ("The Era" said that Leno was "pulling in immense houses" and called him "agonizingly entertaining"); and the melodic parody "Mr. Wix of Wickham" (1902). Both visited after their unique runs. In 1897, Leno went to America and made his presentation on 12 April of that year at Hammerstein's Olympia Music Hall on Broadway, where he was charged as "The Funniest Man on Earth". Surveys were blended: one paper revealed that the house thundered its endorsement, while another griped that Leno's English cleverness was outdated. His American commitment reached an end a month later, and Leno said that it was "the crown of my profession". Regardless of his celebration, Leno was aware of the few negative surveys he had gotten and dismissed every single later idea to visit the United States and Australia.
