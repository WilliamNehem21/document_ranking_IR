In August 1889, two novice archeologists, George Payne and A. A. Arnold, went over the landmark, which they noted was referred to among local people as the "Coldrum Stones" and "Druid Temple"; as indicated by Payne, "the tremendous stones were so congested with thorns and brushwood that they couldn't be observed". He restored the following year, noticing that the brushwood had since been removed to uncover the stone monuments. In his 1893 book "Collectanea Cantiana", Payne noticed that despite the fact that it had first been depicted in print in 1844, "since that time nobody appears to have set aside the time to appropriately record them or make an arrangement", an irregular case given that a duplicate of Petrie's distributed arrangement existed in his library. Thus, in the wake of picking up authorization from the landowner, he persuaded Major A. O. Green, Instructor in Survey at Brompton, to lead a review of the landmark in August 1892. He likewise kept in touch with the paleologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, urging him to plan the Coldrum Stones as a lawfully secured site under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. Payne depicted the Coldrum Stones as "the best landmark of its class in the province, and one deserving of each consideration and consideration." Comparing it to different landmarks of its sort in Britain, he expressed that it was without a doubt "of sepulchral root, having a place with a period front to the Roman mastery of Britain." Payne additionally noticed a people convention that there were stone roads associating Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, despite the fact that additional that he was unfit to find any physical proof of this element.
