Following the thrashing, the England selectors rolled out a few improvements for the fourth Test; both Barnes and Jessop were forgotten. MacLaren favored Jessop's consideration however the selectors thought of him as temperamental. In spite of the fact that Barnes was not completely fit, later reporters proposed the selectors excluded him in view of MacLaren's activities at Sheffield. A further player was added to the squad on the off chance that the pitch was influenced by downpour before the match, but instead than picking Haigh, the main wet-contribute bowler the nation, Hawke demanded that Sussex's Fred Tate was incorporatedÃ¢ÂÂpundits have proposed that Hawke needed to keep Haigh's nonattendance from the Yorkshire group, of which Hawke was skipper, given the improbability of the additional bowler being required. As indicated by the cricket author Neville Cardus, when MacLaren saw the rundown of players in the group, he reacted: "My God, look what they've sent me". MacLaren was irate with Hawke, and when it rained before the match, included Tate in the last eleven to the detriment of George Hirst, a main all-rounder. Gibson proposes that Tate was just included by the selectors "since they thought MacLaren couldn't in any way, shape or form pick him" thus he couldn't make any further late changes to the group; MacLaren, as per Gibson, thusly included Tate out of disdain. Different scholars have proposed that MacLaren, as a Lancastrian, favored a Sussex player to a Yorkshire one.
