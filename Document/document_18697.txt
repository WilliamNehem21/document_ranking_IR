On April 12, 2012, Sony released a teaser image for "Ascension" on its official PlayStation Facebook page, which was followed by the game's announcement on April 19 on PlayStation.Blog. Todd Papy, who had previously worked as a designer on "God of War" and "God of War II" and as design director on "God of War III", assumed the role of game director; "God of War III" director Stig Asmussen was busy with another project at Santa Monica and did not work on "Ascension". The announcement officially confirmed the game's title and Papy said it was not titled "God of War IV" to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy.<ref name="4/30"></ref> The game features a retooled "God of War III" engine, enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players. The decision to add multiplayer came about from curiosity, according to lead combat designer Jason McDonald. The multiplayer was first tested using Kratos, and McDonald said the testers had "a lot of fun". Seeing their reaction made the team feel that the multiplayer had value and they then began to put the ""God of War" spin on it".<ref name="PSBlog3/8/13"></ref> In the developmental transition from "God of War III" to "Ascension", one of the graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that the limits of the "God of War III" engine restricted artist creativity, so they "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance." "Ascension" did not have a graphical leap over its predecessor like "God of War III" did. Dynamic lighting was added, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved upon from "God of War III".
