For the 2007 supper, the White House Correspondents' Association brought back the less disputable Rich Little. Arianna Huffington revealed that Colbert disclosed to her he had explicitly abstained from perusing any audits of his execution, and stayed unconscious of the open's response. On June 13, 2007, he was given a Spike TV Guys' Choice Award for "Gutsiest Move". He acknowledged the honor by means of video meeting. A half year later, "New York Times" reporter Frank Rich considered Colbert's after-supper discourse a "social essential", dedicating it the "vital turning point" of the United States' 2006 midterm decisions. Three and a half years after the discourse, Frank Rich referenced it once more, calling it "splendid" and "useful for the nation", while feature writer Dan Savage alluded to it as "something that kept individuals like me normal amid the darkest days of the Bush years". The editorial manager of "The Realist", Paul Krassner, later put Colbert's execution in authentic setting, saying that it emerges among contemporary US parody as the main case of the soul of the parody of Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Richard Pryor, which went out on a limb and broke obstructions to free discourse, "as opposed to simply gladly practicing it as comics do now."
