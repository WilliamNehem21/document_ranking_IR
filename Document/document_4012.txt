Toward the finish of the 1970s, MDOT partook in a FHWA-sponsored activity called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two offices inspected signage rehearses in the region of the I-96/M-37 and I-296/USÃÂ 131 exchange in Walker. MDOT discovered that use of the I-296 assignment was "a potential wellspring of perplexity for drivers." FHWA concurred with the division's proposition to dispose of all signage and open guide references to the assignment in April 1979. MDOT then appealed to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) on June 22, 1979, for their authorization to roll out the improvement, saying "it is felt that the I-296 assignment fills no helpful need other than to assign an Interstate steering." AASHTO endorsed the solicitation on October 13. On October 24 that year, MDOT additionally mentioned formal consent from the FHWA to evacuate all signage and guide references to I-296. The FHWA allowed authorization on December 3, 1979, depending on the prerequisite that MDOT would keep on utilizing the assignment on authority archives. The endorsement expressly held the roadway in the Interstate framework for subsidizing and different purposes. The last state guide to demonstrate the I-296 assignment was distributed in 1979, as the 1980 guide comes up short on any reference to the assignment. Different maps, similar to the one distributed by the Kent County Road Commission, periodically show I-296, and FHWA incorporates the assignment in their "Course Log and Finder List" for the Interstate Highway System.
