Under Kristine Kathryn Rusch "F&SF" started to distribute progressively dull dream and repulsiveness stories, for example, "The Night We Buried Road Dog" by Jack Cady, which won a Nebula Award. At the point when Rusch took over as proofreader, Isaac Asimov had been composing the science section for more than three decades, and Algis Budrys had been contributing a book audit segment since 1975; in 1992 Asimov passed on and Budrys left. The science segment kept running for 399 back to back issues, finishing off with February 1992. Asimov's widow, Janet Asimov, composed another paper for the December 1994 issue, in light of her discussions with her significant other before his demise, and a last article showed up in January 1996, containing material from the book "Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Lifetime of Letters". The science segment kept on showing up, composed by Bruce Sterling and Gregory Benford among others, and John Kessel assumed control over the book audits; Robert Killheffer succeeded Kessel, with some cover in 1994 and 1995. "Asimov's" kept up its predominance of the field through the 1990s, however Rusch distributed generally welcomed material, for example, "The Martian Child" by David Gerrold and "The previous Summer at Mars Hill" by Elizabeth Hand. Rusch won one Hugo Award as proofreader amid her five years at "F&SF", in 1994.
