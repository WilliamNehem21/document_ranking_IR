All through the encounter over Thessalonica, the Ottomans propelled consistent attacks against Venetian belongings in Albania. In late-winter 1428, the Ottoman armada propelled a noteworthy strike against Venetian belongings in Greece: 40 to 65 vessels struck the island of Euboea and took around 700 Venetian natives prisoner, before proceeding to attack the environs of the two Venetian stations of Modon and Coron in the southwestern Morea. At the point when news landed in Venice on 22 April, despite the fact that the earlier year's watchman armada under Guido da Canal was still abroad, a gatekeeper armada of 15 galleys was approved to chase the Ottoman thieves, under Andrea Mocenigo. In the occasion, the new armada did not cruise until September, after Canal's armada was vanquished at Gallipoli by an alliance of Ottoman and Christian boats. The Ottoman maritime risk turned out to be especially intense right now because of the abandonment of the Duke of Naxos, Giovanni II Crispo (). In spite of the fact that a Venetian native and vassal of the Republic, mounting Ottoman weight on his assets had constrained the Great Council to approve him to go into a different harmony arrangement with the Ottomans, which Crispo appropriately did. Accordingly, Crispo was compelled to adequately help the Turks in their very own attacks, and stopped flagging the Venetians in Euboea of approaching Ottoman strikes through reference points. Toward the beginning of March 1429, an Ottoman armada even showed up before Thessalonica, and caught two Venetian vessels.
