Extraordinary changes in the strategic utilization of mounted force were a checked element of World War I, as improved weaponry rendered frontal charges insufficient. In spite of the fact that mounted force was utilized with great impact in Palestine, at the Third Battle of Gaza and Battle of Megiddo, by and large the method of fighting changed. Tanks were starting to assume control over the job of stun battle. The utilization of channel fighting, security fencing and automatic weapons rendered customary mounted force practically out of date. Following the war, the armed forces of the world forces started a procedure of automation vigorously, and most rangers regiments were either changed over to motorized units or disbanded. Student of history G.J. Meyer composes that "the Great War brought the finish of mounted force". From the Middle Ages into the twentieth century, mounted force had ruled front lines, however from as ahead of schedule as the American Civil War, their incentive in war was declining as ordnance turned out to be all the more dominant, diminishing the adequacy of stun charges. The Western Front in World War I demonstrated that mounted force was practically pointless against present day weaponry, and it likewise fortified that they were hard to transport and supply. English rangers officers, undeniably more than their mainland European partners, continued utilizing and looking after cavalry, trusting that mounted troops would be helpful for abusing infantry achievements, and under the correct conditions would probably confront automatic weapons. Neither of these convictions demonstrated right.
