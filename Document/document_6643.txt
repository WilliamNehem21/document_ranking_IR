Throughout the following three hours the squadrons kept on shutting, light breezes confining them to a little more than three bunches. A protege of Nelson, Hoste reviewed the moving impact of Nelson's flag before the Battle of Trafalgar and raised his own: "Recollect Nelson", which was welcomed with wild cheering from the squadron. As he shut with Hoste's power, Dubourdieu understood that he would be unfit to effectively cross "Active's" bow because of the British ship's speed, and would likewise be unfit to get through their line because of the British boats' closeness to each other. He rather looked to assault the second ship in the British line, Hoste's leader HMS "Amphion". Dubourdieu had a huge favorable position in boats as well as in men, the Italian warriors on board allowing him the chance to overpower the British groups on the off chance that he could board their frigates effectively. The principal shots of the fight were discharged at 09:00, as the British utilized their more extensive field of shoot to assault the main French boats, "Top choice" and "DanaÃÂ©", unopposed for a few minutes. The French squadron held their flame, Dubourdieu gathering his troops and mariners into "Top pick's" bow so as to amplify the impact of his underlying assault once his leader came into contact with "Amphion".
