The ship's light AA deadly implement comprised of seven triple and five twin-firearm mounts for permit assembled Hotchkiss 25ÃÂ mm Type 96 AA weapons. Two of the triple mounts were sited on a stage just underneath the forward end of the flight deck. The firearm was the standard Japanese light AA weapon amid World War II, however it experienced extreme structure inadequacies that rendered it to a great extent insufficient. As per student of history Mark Stille, the weapon had numerous issues including a powerlessness to "handle rapid targets since it couldn't be prepared or raised quick enough by either hand or power, its sights were deficient for fast targets, it had unnecessary vibration and gag impact, and its magazines were too little to even think about maintaining high rates of discharge". These firearms had a viable scope of , and a compelling roof of at a rise of +85 degrees. The most extreme successful rate of flame was just somewhere in the range of 110 and 120 rounds for each moment as a result of the regular need to change the fifteen-round magazines. The Type 96 firearms were constrained by five Type 95 chiefs, two on each side and one in the bow.
