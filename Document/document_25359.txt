The Dogon people are an ethnic group in Mali, West Africa, reported by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible without the use of telescopes. In 1938 Marcel Griaule produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the Ãcole pratique des hautes Ã©tudes (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books "Conversations with OgotemmÃªli" 1965 and "The Pale Fox" 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B. Robert Temple's 1976 book "The Sirius Mystery" credits them with knowledge of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. This has been the subject of controversy and speculation.
Doubts have been raised about the validity of Griaule and Dieterlein's work. In a 1991 article in "Current Anthropology" anthropologist Walter van Beek concluded after his research among the Dogon that, "Though they do speak about "sigu tolo" [which is what Griaule claimed the Dogon called Sirius] they disagree completely with each other as to which star is meant; for some it is an invisible star that should rise to announce the "sigu" [festival], for another it is Venus that, through a different position, appears as "sigu tolo". All agree, however, that they learned about the star from Griaule."
