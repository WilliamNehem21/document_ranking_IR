Jacques started her relationship with the "Continue" arrangement in March 1958 with the main film in the arrangement, "Carry On Sergeant". She assumed the little job of Captain Clark, a "battleax medicinal officer" who neglects to trust the created afflictions of the anxious person Private Horace Strong, played by Kenneth Connor. The next year she played "Lady" without precedent for "Continue Nurse", a film which broke that year's film industry records, selling in excess of 10 million tickets in British films. Despite the fact that Jacques' job was still moderately little, she showed up in maybe the best known scene of the film, in which she recovers a daffodil from Wilfrid Hyde-White's rump, put there by an insidious medical caretaker as retribution for his consistent badgering of the staff. So well known was Jacques' scene, that the makers imported two million plastic daffodils from Japan which were then used to advance the satire. Different characterisations pursued, including the impressive maths special lady Grace Short in "Carry On Teacher" (1959) and the neighborly Police Sergeant Laura Moon in "Carry On Constable" (1960). Of the previous film, Derek Prouse of "The Sunday Times" believed that Jacques "triumph[ed] over material so callously adolescent that one is battered into a sort of entranced reverence".
