The new magazine was titled "Adventure Science Fiction", and the main issue was dated January 1957. Plants was overseeing proofreader of "F&SF" all through "Adventure's" first run; he moved toward becoming editorial manager of "F&SF" not long after "Adventure" stopped distributing in July 1958. The publication reasoning was spread out by Ferman in the debut issue: "solid accounts of activity and adventureÃÂ ... There will be two prime necessities for "Adventure" stories: in any case, each must be a well-told "story", with a starting, center and end; in the second spot, each must be a solid storyÃ¢ÂÂa story with pace, power and energy." Ferman would have liked to exploit a hole in the sci-fi magazine advertise opened up by the destruction of "Planet Stories", one of the last sf pulps, which had stopped production in late 1955. "Planet Stories" had concentrated on experience stories, rather than the reasonable style ending up increasingly well known in sci-fi during the 1950s, and Ferman would have liked to join the ideals of the exaggerated mash fiction style with the abstract qualities that were critical to "F&SF"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s achievement. "Venture"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s inclination towards activity situated experience prompted stories with generally more sex and viciousness than those in contending magazines, and sf student of history Mike Ashley has remarked that it was maybe five or ten years relatively revolutionary. One story, "The Girl Had Guts", by Theodore Sturgeon, included an outsider infection that made its exploited people upchuck their digestion tracts; Ashley records an analyst saying that the story made him physically sick.
