The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus "Banksia" is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the "Flora of Australia" book series. In this arrangement, "B.Â dentata" is placed in "Banksia" subgenus "Banksia", because its inflorescences take the form of "Banksia"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s characteristic flower spikes, section "Banksia" because of its straight styles, and series "Salicinae" because its inflorescences are cylindrical. There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to. Alf Salkin had noted that "B.Â dentata" displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus. Unlike southern banksias, it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves. Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with "Banksia integrifolia" on account of their similar inflorescences. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries "Acclives" along with "B.Â plagiocarpa", "B.Â robur" and "B.Â oblongifolia" within the series "Salicinae". These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike. It was held to be most closely related to "B.Â robur" on account of its large undulate leaves. Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of "B.Â dentata", "B.Â robur" and "B.Â oblongifolia" were all similar and roughly linear, suggesting a close relationship. However, this subgrouping of the "Salicinae" was not supported by George; he discounted a close relationship with "B.Â robur", which he felt was too distinctive.
"B.Â dentata"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement within "Banksia" according to "Flora of Australia" is as follows:
