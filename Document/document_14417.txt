On 9 February "Kaga" hit a reef at Palau after she had fruitlessly sortied against American transporter powers assaulting the Marshall Islands on 1 February. The harm decreased the bearer's speed to 18 ties. After impermanent fixes, she proceeded to the Timor Sea, where on 19 February 1942 she, with different bearers of the First and Second Carrier Divisions, propelled air strikes against Darwin, Australia from a point southeast of the easternmost tip of Timor. "Kaga" contributed 27 B5Ns (conveying bombs), 18 D3A, and 9 Zeros to the assault, which got the protectors off guard. Eight boats were sunk, including the destroyer , and fourteen more were harmed, at an expense of just a single of "Kaga"s B5Ns. In March 1942, "Kaga", based out of Staring-baai, helped spread the attack of Java, in spite of the fact that her solitary commitment seems to have been air ship for the 5 March 1942 airstrike on Tjilatjap. In that assault "Kaga" contributed 27 bomb-conveying B5N escorted by nine Zeros. The assaulting air ship shelled shipper sends in the harbor, sinking eight of them, and assaulted against air ship batteries and a distribution center without misfortune. The vast majority of the Allied powers in the Dutch East Indies surrendered to the Japanese later in March. "Kaga" was unfit to take an interest in the Indian Ocean assault in April due to the harm she had gotten in February. Rather, she cruised for Sasebo on 15 March for fixes, entering drydock on 27 March. The fixes were finished on 4 May.
