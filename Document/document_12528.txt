The narrative pulled in significant debate. On 26 April, two days before the program was planned for communicate, Sir Geoffrey Howe called the director of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to demand that the expert postpone the communicate until after the investigation in light of the fact that it gambled prejudicing the procedures. Subsequent to review the program and taking legitimate exhortation, the IBA chose the morning of 28 April that "Passing on the Rock" ought to be communicated as planned, and Howe was educated of the choice. Howe made further portrayal to the IBA that the narrative would be in hatred of the examination; subsequent to taking further lawful exhortation, the IBA maintained its choice to permit the communicate. The program was communicated at 21:00 (GMT) on 28 April. The next morning, the British newspaper papers assailed the program, portraying it as a "slur" on the SAS and "preliminary by TV", while a few condemned the IBA for enabling the narrative to be communicated. Over the next weeks, papers more than once printed anecdotes about the narrative's observers, specifically Carmen Proetta, who gave a record of seeing McCann and Farrell shot without notice by warriors who touched base in a Gibraltar Police vehicle. Proetta accordingly sued a few papers for criticism and won significant harms. "The Sunday Times" led its own examination and detailed that "Demise on the Rock" had distorted the perspectives on its observers; the observers included later grumbled to different papers that "The Sunday Times" had mutilated their remarks.
