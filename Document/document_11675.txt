In 2010, Mark Lane Jangala and other conventional proprietors taught law offices Maurice Blackburn, Surry Partners (a firm that incorporates human rights legal counselor George Newhouse), and legal advisor Julian Burnside to start legitimate procedures against the Northern Land Council and the Australian government in the Federal Court of Australia to stop the assignment of Muckaty Station as an atomic waste storeroom. The Federal Court challenge was expected to start right off the bat in 2013 preceding Justice Tony North, who took care of the Tampa issue. As indicated by a June 2012 report in "The Age", some indigenous proprietors would "affirm they were never counseled, while others [will] state that they were not appropriately counseled and never assented to the selection". The court did not start hearing the case until 2 June 2014, for what was relied upon to be a five-week preliminary. In any case, on 18 June, the Northern Land Council pulled back the assignment of Muckaty as a component of a legitimate settlement between the gatherings. The Australian government demonstrated there would be a three-month time span amid which the Northern Land Council and conventional proprietors could decide if they wished to name an elective site for the landfill somewhere else on Muckaty Station.
