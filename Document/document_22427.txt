Striggio's main sources for his libretto were Books 10 and 11 of Ovid's "Metamorphoses" and Book Four of Virgil's "Georgics". These provided him with the basic material, but not the structure for a staged drama; the events of acts 1 and 2 of the libretto are covered by a mere 13 lines in the "Metamorphoses". For help in creating a dramatic form, Striggio drew on other sourcesâPoliziano's 1480 play, Guarini's "Il pastor fido", and Ottavio Rinuccini's libretto for Peri's "Euridice". Musicologist Gary Tomlinson remarks on the many similarities between Striggio's and Rinuccini's texts, noting that some of the speeches in "L'Orfeo" "correspond closely in content and even in locution to their counterparts in "L'Euridice"". The critic Barbara Russano Hanning writes that Striggio's verses are less subtle than those of Rinuccini, although the structure of Striggio's libretto is more interesting. Rinuccini, whose work had been written for the festivities accompanying a Medici wedding, was obliged to alter the myth to provide a "happy ending" suitable for the occasion. By contrast, because Striggio was not writing for a formal court celebration he could be more faithful to the spirit of the myth's conclusion, in which Orfeo is killed and dismembered by deranged maenads or "Bacchantes". He chose, in fact, to write a somewhat muted version of this bloody finale, in which the Bacchantes threaten Orfeo's destruction but his actual fate is left in doubt.
