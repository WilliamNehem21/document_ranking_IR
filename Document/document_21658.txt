Cartier was still able to direct several notable productions during the decade, including a number which explored the Nazi era in Germany from which he had escaped in 1933. These included the World War II dramas "Cross of Iron" (1961, dealing with the court martial of a U-Boat captain in a British prisoner of war camp) and "The July Plot" (1964, about the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler), as well as "Firebrand" (1967, about the 1933 Reichstag fire, an event Cartier had personally witnessed). He also began, for the first time, to direct pieces which dealt with the Holocaust, such as "Doctor Korczak and the Children" ("Studio 4", 1962), concerning the Warsaw Ghetto orphanage, and "The Joel Brand Story" (1965, about Adolf Eichmann's 1944 offer to the Allies of the lives of 1 million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks). Other significant 1960s productions included adaptations of "Anna Karenina" (1961, starring Sean Connery and Claire Bloom) and "Wuthering Heights" (1962, a new version of Kneale's 1953 script, starring Bloom and Keith Michell). "Lee Oswald â Assassin" (1966) was a drama-documentary telling the story of Lee Harvey Oswald, based on the Warren Commission's findings, while "Conversation at Night" (1969) saw the first television acting appearance of Alec Guinness.
