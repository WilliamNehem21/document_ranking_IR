"Divine force of War III" was first referenced by Cory Barlog at a "Lord of War II" dispatch occasion, and it was authoritatively reported at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). After the initial eight months of improvement, Barlog left Santa Monica for different chances and Stig Asmussen (lead condition craftsman and workmanship chief on "Divine force of War" and "Lord of War II", separately) moved toward becoming executive. Asmussen said that one of the best difficulties in creating "Divine force of War III" for the PlayStation 3 was the "multifaceted nature of everything"; singular undertakings, for example, structuring Helios' beheading, could take a year on the grounds that the "dimension of detail [that was] expected [was] so high and perplexing, it [crossed] numerous divisions." He said that the PlayStation 3's equipment capacities permitted greater adaptability in character creation and association with the environment.<ref name="IGN12/8/09"></ref><ref name="GamePro11/4/09"></ref> The motor for "Lord of War III" was ported from the initial two portions to the PlayStation 3. As the diversion was being built up, the code office swapped out PlayStation 2 segments with PlayStation 3 parts. They supplanted the renderer, the molecule framework, and the impact framework. In spite of the fact that they were re-utilizing the motor from "Divine force of War II", the center motor for "Lord of War III" was fresh out of the plastic new. Between E3 2009 and the time the amusement transported, morphological enemy of associating (MLAA) was included, which designs engineer Ben Diamand said "improved edges significantly and spared generous measures of edge rate." Diamand likewise said that "profundity of-field, movement obscure, crepuscular 'god' beams and refraction were either included or improved in quality and speed" amid that equivalent time period.<ref name="Euro5/4/13"></ref>
