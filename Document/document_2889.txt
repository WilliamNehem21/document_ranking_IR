The intrusion had been normal by the English for quite a while; two years sooner the Chancellor of England had told parliament that the Scots were "stating straightforwardly that they will break the dÃÂ©tente when our enemy [France] wants and will walk into England". When the Scots attacked, a military was immediately activated at Richmond in north Yorkshire under the supervision of William de la Zouche, the Archbishop of York, who was Lord Warden of the Marches. It was anything but a huge armed force: 3,000Ã¢ÂÂ 4,000 men from the northern districts of Cumberland, Northumberland and Lancashire; it is realized that Lancashire contributed 1,200 longbowmen and few softly furnished fringe mounted force, known as hobelers. Another 3,000 Yorkshiremen were on the way to strengthen their kindred northerners. This was conceivable on the grounds that Edward III, when raising his military to attack France, had exempted the regions north of the River Humber. On 14 October, while the Scots were sacking Hexham Abbey, the Archbishop chose not to sit tight for the Yorkshire troops and walked north west towards Barnard Castle, and afterward quickly north east to Durham. He was joined in transit by the Yorkshire unexpected and Lord Ralph Neville took direction of the consolidated power of 6,000Ã¢ÂÂ 7,000 men.
