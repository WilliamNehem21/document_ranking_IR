"Persoonia terminalis" was first reported by Lawrie Johnson of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, in the 1981 edition of "Flora of New South Wales". He viewed it as a distinctive subspecies of "Persoonia nutans", a broadly defined species that included many forms since classified as distinct. Queensland botanists Trevor Donald Stanley and Estelle M. Ross classed "P.terminalis" as part of "Persoonia oxycoccoides" in their 1983 work "Flora of South-eastern Queensland". They considered it more likely a species in its own right, as they believed the description of the Queensland populations did not match the "P. oxycoccoides" from central New South Wales. Upon re-examining "Persoonia nutans" and "Persoonia oxycoccoides", Johnson and Peter Weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species, and that "Persoonia terminalis" was described as such in 1991. The type specimen was collected south of the Torrington pub on the EmmavilleâTorrington road by Weston and ecologist Peter Richards, and is now housed in the National Herbarium of New South Wales, which is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney and Office of Environment and Heritage. The Herbarium houses over 1.2million other specimens. The generic name "Persoonia" is derived from the name of South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The specific name "terminalis" refers to the inflorescences (clusters of flowers) that are in this species at the ends of the branchlets. Its common name is the Torrington geebung.
