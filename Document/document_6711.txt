Through his inclusion with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, general chief of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no involvement in structuring for transport, however this would change through his cooperation with Pick. In 1923, Pick dispatched Holden to plan a faÃÂ§ade for a side passage at Westminster Underground station. This was followed in 1924 with an arrangement to plan the UERL's structure for the British Empire Exhibition. Additionally in 1924, Pick charged Holden to plan seven new stations in south London for the expansion of the City and South London Railway (presently part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The plans supplanted a set by the UERL's own planner, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had discovered unacceptable. The structures mirror the straightforward pioneer style he was utilizing in France for the war graveyards; twofold tallness ticket corridors are clad in plain Portland stone encircling a coated screen, each adjusted to suit the road corner locales of the vast majority of the stations. The screens include the Underground roundel made up in shaded glass boards and are isolated by stone segments surmounted by capitals shaped as a three-dimensional form of the roundel. Holden additionally exhorted Heaps on new faÃÂ§ades for some of the current stations on hold and delivered the structure for another passageway at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.
