Convention would have made his sibling Domnall BÃÂ¡n MÃÂ¡el Coluim's successor, however it appears that Edward, his oldest child by Margaret, was his picked beneficiary. With MÃÂ¡el Coluim and Edward dead in a similar fight, and his different children in Scotland still youthful, Domnall was made ruler. Be that as it may, Donnchad II, MÃÂ¡el Coluim's oldest child by his first spouse, acquired some help from William Rufus and took the honored position. As per the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" his English and French devotees were slaughtered, and Donnchad II himself was murdered later around the same time (1094) by Domnall's partner MÃÂ¡el Petair of Mearns. In 1097, William Rufus sent another of MÃÂ¡el Coluim's children, Edgar, to take the majesty. The resulting demise of Domnall BÃÂ¡n verified the majesty for Edgar, and there pursued a time of relative harmony. The rules of both Edgar and his successor Alexander are dark by correlation with their successors. The previous' most outstanding act was to send a camel (or maybe an elephant) to his kindred Gael Muircheartach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. At the point when Edgar passed on, Alexander took the sovereignty, while his most youthful sibling David moved toward becoming Prince of Cumbria.
