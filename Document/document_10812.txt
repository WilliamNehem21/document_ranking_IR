A large portion of the data accessible on the Gregorian mission originates from the medieval essayist Bede, particularly his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum", or "Ministerial History of the English People". For this work Bede requested help and data from numerous individuals including his contemporary abbot at Canterbury just as a future Archbishop of Canterbury, Nothhelm, who sent Bede duplicates of ecclesiastical letters and archives from Rome. Different sources are accounts of Pope Gregory, incorporating one written in Northern England around 700 just as a ninth century life by a Roman author. The early "Existence of Gregory" is by and large accepted to have been founded on oral customs conveyed to northern England from either Canterbury or Rome, and was finished at Whitby Abbey somewhere in the range of 704 and 714. This view has been tested by the student of history Alan Thacker, who contends that the "Life" gets from prior composed works; Thacker proposes that a great part of the data it contains originates from a work written in Rome soon after Gregory's demise. Gregory's entrance in the "Liber Pontificalis" is short and of little use, yet he himself was an essayist whose work reveals insight into the mission. Furthermore, more than 850 of Gregory's letters endure. A couple of later compositions, for example, letters from Boniface, an eighth century Anglo-Saxon preacher, and imperial letters to the papacy from the late eighth century, include extra detail. A portion of these letters, in any case, are just protected in Bede's work.
