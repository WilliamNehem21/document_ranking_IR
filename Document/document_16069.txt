The State of Oregon demanded that the ship's owners or their insurers remove the ship or pay a US$25Â million bond to cover the cost of removing the ship and for environmental damages. The state also filed a lawsuit in Coos County, demanding removal, storage fees of USDÂ $1,500 per day, restoration of the beach, and other unspecified damages. The state alleged negligence on the part of Morgado and also accused Green Atlas shipping of attempting to avoid the expense of the stern dismantling. On 13 November 2002, a Coos County jury found the ship's owners guilty of negligent trespass after a six-week trial; the state was awarded US$25Â million in damages. That sum was placed in escrow, pending appeal. The circuit court judge later remarked that the case was the most memorable of his 37-year career, noting that "You donât usually get trespass cases that involve a ship". On 23 May 2006, a settlement was reached in the appeal; the state kept US$20Â million of the US$25Â million in escrow, plus US$2.1Â million in interest earned on the escrow account. The remaining US$5Â million was returned to Green Atlas Shipping. Of the US$22.1Â million that the state was awarded in the settlement, US$3.1Â million was used to pay the state's legal fees. The remaining US$19Â million was reserved for cleanup, including the removal of the vessel's stern.
