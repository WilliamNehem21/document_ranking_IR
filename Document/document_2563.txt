Ottaviani's enthusiasm for Knight in the end prompted his organization G.T. Labs distributing Knight's personal history, with notes by Ottaviani and forewords by Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen. Other character connections were fictionalized also: editorial manager James Gordon Bennet, Jr. never campaigned with Cope, and never uncovered Marsh's will. Adapt's bones likewise never made it to New York. A few discussions, because of their private nature, were fictionalized; Ottaviani makes up Marsh's campaign to Congress and what occurred amid his gathering with President Grant, and P.T. Barnum never reprimanded Marsh the manner in which he did in the novel. Ottaviani likewise wove the story Marsh tells about the Mastodon from a few distinct renditions of the legend. A key plot point is manufactured for the motivations behind sensational incongruity: in the book, Marsh has his specialist Sam Smith leave a "Camarasaurus" skull for Cope to discover and erroneously put on the wrong dinosaur. Rather, Hatcher discovers it; Smith attempts to shield an accidental Marsh from getting it, yet because of Marsh's disagreeable way he lets him all things considered. Therefore, Marsh erroneously orders the (non-existent) "Brontosaurus". Ottaviani concedes in the book he developed this, as "the abstract convention of lifting somebody up by his very own petard was too great to even consider passing up".
