On 6 April 1941, when the World War II German-drove Axis attack of Yugoslavia started, "Morava" was put together at Stara KanjiÃÂ¾a with respect to the Tisza waterway, as the lead of the second Mine Barrage Division. This power was in charge of the Hungarian fringe, and went under the operational control of the seventh Infantry Division "Potiska". The rest of the second Mine Barrage Division comprised of the waterway pull "R-XXI", the stream transport "Senta", and a couple prepared traditions speedboats, put together further south with respect to the Tisza at Senta. On 7 April, "Morava" pulled back to Senta, where she was assaulted by German air ship. As per her administrator, "PoruÃÂnik bojnog broda" BoÃÂ¾idar AranÃÂeloviÃÂ, her group shot down one German flying machine and caught a "Luftwaffe" "Oberstleutnant". On 10 April, "Morava" was requested to pull back to accommodate with the retreat of the second Army Group of the Royal Yugoslav Army from BaÃÂka and Baranja. On the night of 11 April, "Morava" moored at the conversion of the Danube and Sava close Belgrade, alongside her individual screens "Vardar" and "Sava", and AranÃÂeloviÃÂ took direction of the flotilla. The three chiefs gave, and chose to abandon their vessels because of the high water levels in the streams and low scaffolds, which implied inadequate leeway for the screens to explore openly. The groups of the screens were transshipped to two tugboats, yet when one of the tugboats was going under a railroad connect, annihilation charges on the scaffold detonated rashly and the extension fell onto the tugboat. Of the 110 officers and men on board the vessel, 95 were executed.
