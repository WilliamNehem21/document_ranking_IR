For the 1885Ã¢ÂÂ 86 season Gould changed from fullback at Newport to the inside position; this strategy was embraced by Wales and Gould substituted Cardiff's Hancock at place for their first match of the 1886 Home Nations Championship against England. The match brought about a Welsh misfortune. In Wales' next amusement, against Scotland, Wales turned into the main nation to preliminary the four threequarter framework. They did this by bringing back Hancock as chief and having him play at focus close by Gould. The test was a strategic catastrophe Ã¢ÂÂ the eight Welsh advances battled against the nine Scottish advances. Hancock appropriately regrouped the group at half-time and readopted the standard development, bringing Harry Bowen from fullback into the pack, and pushing Gould from focus into Bowen's empty position. Ribs lost by two objectives to nil, the framework was regarded a disappointment and Hancock never spoken to Wales again. The entire undertaking negatively affected Gould, who at first disdained the system, expressing that he was "partial against the four seventy five percent." Gould even went similarly as inducing the Welsh selectors to return to the old development. Whenever Wales trialed the framework was in the 1888 experience with the visiting New Zealand Natives, a match in which Gould was inaccessible to play.
