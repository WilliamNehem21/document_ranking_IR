At the point when the groups reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, starting much rancor and debate in the English cricket network. The reason was said to be Hutton's troubles against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. Onlookers saw Hutton stepping back, and the English selectors accepted such a sight would negatively affect the remainder of the side as it was a poor precedent from a key player. The Australians were satisfied and trusted the England selectors had blundered, in light of the fact that they viewed Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. Britain batted first and Lindwall evacuated Hutton's substitution as opener, George Emmett, who battled a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been shocked by Lindwall's bouncer and took his eyes from the ball, battling with one hand on the bat, while dodging his head beneath his arms. The ball skiped gradually off the pitch and in the wake of hitting Emmett's bat, bounced back delicately open to question for Barnes to gather. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire quickly going before the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who reluctantly parried it away for a solitary. Lindwall did not bob Emmett again amid the match, and O'Reilly deduced that the paceman was unobtrusively holding up until the Tests to uncover his rival's shortcoming against the short ball. O'Reilly presumed that Lindwall and Johnston "had again discarded the English opening batsmen with the base measure of exertion".
