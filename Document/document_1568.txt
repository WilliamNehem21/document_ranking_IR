The evening of June 11Ã¢ÂÂ 12, 1920, would end up celebrated in political history as the evening of the "smoke-filled room," in which, legend has it, party seniors consented to compel the tradition to designate Harding. Antiquarians have concentrated on the discussions held in the suite of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Will Hays at the Blackstone Hotel, at which representatives and others went back and forth, and various conceivable applicants were examined. Utah Senator Reed Smoot, before his takeoff promptly at night, supported Harding, telling Hays and the others that as the Democrats were probably going to designate Governor Cox, they should pick Harding to win Ohio. Smoot likewise told "The New York Times" that there had been a consent to assign Harding, however that it would not be accomplished for a few votes yet. This was not valid: various members sponsored Harding (others upheld his opponents), yet there was no settlement to choose him, and the congresspersons had little capacity to authorize any understanding. Two different members in the smoke-filled room exchanges, Kansas Senator Charles Curtis and Colonel George Brinton McClellan Harvey, a dear companion of Hays, anticipated to the press that Harding would be named in view of the liabilities of different applicants.
