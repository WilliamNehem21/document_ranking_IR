Just "Lion" was finished to the first plan, which had the fore channel set between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This implied hot clinkers and pipe gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast totally unworkable when the boats were steaming at rapid, that the upper scaffold could without much of a stretch be rendered appalling, contingent upon the breeze, and that the flag banners and halyards were in danger of consuming. The two boats were changed to address this issue, "Lion" before being dispatched, and "Princess Royal" as she was fitting out, at an absolute expense of ÃÂ£68,170. The fore pipe was moved behind, the first fore and mainmasts traded position, and the foremast was currently only a post pole, not a tripod. The spotting tower at the back of the conning tower was expelled, the conning tower expanded, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the top of the conning tower, and every one of the pipes were raised to a similar tallness. As a component of these changes, the two 4-inch weapons mounted over the forward gathering of casemates were encased in casemates of their own to shield the firearm teams from climate and foe activity.
