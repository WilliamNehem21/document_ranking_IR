The jaws of "Nemegtomaia" were toothless, and like other oviraptorid dinosaurs, it had a short nose with a profound, powerful, and fairly parrot-like nose. It had a hard sense of taste framed by the premaxillae, vomers, and maxillae, as different oviraptorids. The sense of taste was emphatically inward (downwards-anticipating), and had a separated on the focal part. As in different oviraptorids, it had a couple of tooth-like projections on the sense of taste that were coordinated downwards (an element that has been classified "pseudo-teeth"). "Nemegtomaia" had little foramina (openings) on the sides of the suture (joint) between the premaxillae at the front of the nose, which may have been supplement openings (and which show the nearness of a keratinous bill). The lower jaw was short and profound, with an arched lower surface, and achieved 153ÃÂ mm (6ÃÂ in) long. The dentary bone of the lower jaw achieved 50ÃÂ mm (2ÃÂ in) at its most noteworthy point. The mandibular symphysis (where the two-parts of the lower jaw associated) was short, profound, and very pneumatised (with air-spaces). The mandibular fenestra was substantial and was situated at the front piece of the lower jaw. As in most different oviraptorids, the front of the let jaw was down-turned.
