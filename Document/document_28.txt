Moore presented the expressed motivation behind the coin, to celebrate the 50th commemoration of Cincinnati as a focal point of music, at that point noticed that the front-side delineated Stephen Foster, the author and lyricistÃ¢ÂÂwho kicked the bucket in 1864, though Cincinnati was not remarkable as a focal point of music until somewhere around 1873. "The Commission is at a misfortune to interface a fiftieth commemoration in 1936 with a development that started in 1873." Foster did live in Cincinnati, Moore conceded, yet just for a concise period while filling in as an accountant, and his primary commitments to American music came later, when he lived in Pittsburgh and in New York City. Further, the coin was to remember Cincinnati's commitments to the specialty of music, and Foster "was an American troubadour, however to music as a craftsmanship he made no commitment". Moore felt that on the off chance that anybody ought to be portrayed, it ought to be Theodore Thomas, who led the Cincinnati May Festival from its start in 1873 and in 1878 moved toward becoming executive of the Cincinnati College of Music. He expressed that "Theodore Thomas was, aesthetically, the originator of Cincinnati as a melodic focus. His picture ought to show up on any coin memorial of Cincinnati 'as a focal point of music'".
