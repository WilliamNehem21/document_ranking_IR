The top is at first curved, however as it develops the inside structures a dejection and the external edges ascend until it expect the state of a shallow channel; its last width is ordinarily between . The top edge is unequivocally twisted internal; when youthful, it is tomentose (secured with a thick tangling of hairs), shaping a cloak like structure that halfway conceals the gills. This tomentum decreases with age. The top surface is at first correspondingly tomentose, yet in the long run the hairs wear off, leaving the surface pretty much smooth. The surface begins off to some degree sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a "zonate" design); these rings, particularly the external ones, for the most part blur in development. The top shading is pinkish-orange to pale dull pink, getting to be orange to whitish toward the edge as the pink bit by bit blurs. The white to tissue shaded substance is firm and fragile, yet ends up flabby in age. The latex that is delivered when the mushroom tissue is sliced or harmed is white to cream, and does not change shading with delayed introduction to air, nor does it recolor the gills. It has a bitter taste, with a slight to sharp smell.
