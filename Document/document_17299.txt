The black currawong is about long with an wingspan. The male is slightly larger and heavier than the female; males of the nominate subspecies average to females' . Male wings average around and tails , while female wings average and tails . Data for the two island subspecies is limited, but males of subspecies "colei" have been measured at with wings on average, and a female at with a wing, and subspecies "parvior" at for males with wings on average, and and wing for a female. The sexes are similar in plumage, which is all black except for white patches at the tips of the wings and tail feathers. The bill and legs are black and the eyes bright yellow. The white tips line the trailing edges of the wings in flight, and a paler arc across the bases of the primary flight feathers is also visible on the underwing. Although there is no seasonal variation to the plumage, the black may fade a little to a dark brown with wear. Immature birds have browner-tinged plumage, and a yellow gape until they are two years old. The oldest recorded age of a black currawong has been 15 years; a bird was sighted in July 2004 near Fern Tree, Tasmania, less than from where it had been banded in July 1989.
