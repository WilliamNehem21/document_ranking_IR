The four withdrawn members demanded that the Council return to the Act of 8 January and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany. After heated debates that lasted for several weeks, on 15 February, at 10 am, the new revision of the Act was ready. It included, with minor stylistic changes, wording of the Act of 8 January and promulgation and notification, drafted on 1 February. Promulgation and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change the meaning of a legal document. The Council, including the withdrawn members, was invited to return the next day for its finalization. On the next day, 16 February 1918, at 12:30 pm, all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims, at 30 DidÅ¾ioji Street in Vilnius. The building has since been known as the House of the Signatories () and houses a museum. The Council first voted to approve the first part, the first two paragraphs up to the word "drauge", of the Act. This section was approved unanimously. The second part, however, did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word ""finally"" in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly (in ""... the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other countries will be finally determined by the Constituent Assembly ...""). They were afraid that this word would give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly, while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non-negotiable and non-appealable nature of the future Assembly's decisions. Therefore, the Act was unanimously approved "en bloc" but did not have full-fledged support from all twenty men.
