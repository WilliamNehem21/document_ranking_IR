Different faultfinders respected Etty's surprising understanding of prophetically catastrophic religious symbolism, his capacity to give unmistakable characters and shapes to the individual devils and their exploited people, and the striking quality of his creative ability. "The Morning Post" especially commended Etty's capacity to pass on "creation imagined and tossed upon the canvas with all the rage of poetical motivation" by joining the "dauntless soul of a sketch" with the "amazing impression of a completed picture". The noticeable workmanship pundit William Paulet Carey (composing under the name of 'Ridolfi') advocated "The Destroying Angel", and specifically Etty's capacity to adjust magnificence, loathsomeness and dread without diving into blandness. Carey considered Etty to be confirmation that British masterful conventions were equivalent to any others on the planet, and "The Destroying Angel" as proof of Etty's "reclaiming beauty and soul". Etty's long-standing foes at "The Morning Chronicle" discovered little to assault in the work of art, their survey expressing that "The upper piece of the image is skillful, great and wonderful. The lower part not so well, however a portion of the figures are in outstanding activity and fine illustration." The hesitance of "The Morning Chronicle" incited Carey to remark that they were in "desirous quietness".
