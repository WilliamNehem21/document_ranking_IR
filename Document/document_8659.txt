Prost marked to join Ferrari in 1990 turning into the principal driver marked to the group after the demise of group author Enzo Ferrari in 1988. The Frenchman supplanted Gerhard Berger at Ferrari and was banded together with Britain's Nigel Mansell for 1990 (Berger sat down at McLaren). As authoritative best on the planet, Prost took over as the group's lead driver and was said to have played on Mansell's feeling of inadequacy. Mansell reviews one occurrence where at the 1990 British Grand Prix, the vehicle he drove didn't deal with equivalent to in the past race where he had taken post position, and later discovered from group mechanics that Prost considered Mansell to be having a prevalent vehicle and had them swapped without Mansell knowing. Prost won five races for Ferrari that year, in Brazil, Mexico, France, Britain and Spain. Remarkable among these was the Mexican Grand Prix, where he won in the wake of beginning in thirteenth position. In both the Mexican and Spanish races, he drove Mansell to Ferrari 1Ã¢ÂÂ 2 completions. The title by and by went to the penultimate round of the period in Japan with Prost trailing his McLaren enemy, Ayrton Senna, by nine points. As in 1989, a disputable impact between the two settled the race. At the primary corner Senna, as conceded a year later, deliberately drove his race vehicle into Prost's, removing them both from the race and fixing the title to support him. "What he did was nauseating," Prost said. "He is a man without esteem." Prost completed the season seven behind Senna, and his Ferrari group were sprinters up to McLaren.
