At the point when the Museum of the Chinese Revolution opened on Tiananmen Square in 1961, the sketch was shown on a tremendous divider in the display gave to the Communist triumph, yet in 1966, amid the Cultural Revolution, radicals shut down the gallery, and it stayed shut until 1969. Amid that time, Liu Shaoqi, blamed for taking an "industrialist street", was cleansed from government. His expulsion from the artwork was requested in 1967, and Dong was entrusted to complete it. Dong had endured amid the Cultural Revolution: blamed for being a rightist, he was ousted from the Party for a long time, sent to a rustic work camp, and after that was "restored" by being made to work as a steelworker. Dong's errand was troublesome, as Liu was a standout amongst the most conspicuous figures in the main line, remaining to one side of Madame Song. Authorities needed Liu supplanted with Lin Biao, much to support Mao at the time. Dong was reluctant to give Lin noticeable quality he had not then had, and however he couldn't decline out and out at the unsafe time of the Cultural Revolution, he in the long run got consent to simply evacuate Liu. The figure was excessively extensive to just erase, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to show up as though in the second line. As per Andrews, the endeavor was a disappointment: "the new Dong Biwu does not retreat into the second line as proposed. Rather, he shows up as a sneering, gleaming figure, a peculiarly vindictive character amidst a generally stately gathering". Authorities considered the changed work unexhibitable. Andrews theorized that Dong may have been attempting to disrupt the change, or may have been influenced by the worry of the long periods of the Cultural Revolution.
