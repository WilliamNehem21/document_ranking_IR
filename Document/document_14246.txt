At the same time, the II Canadian Corps on the western flank of Goodwood started Operation Atlantic to fortify the Allied toehold along the banks of the Orne stream and take VerriÃÂ¨res Ridge toward the south of Caen. Atlantic made introductory gains however came up short on steam as losses mounted. Having cost the Canadians 1,349 men and with the intensely guarded edge immovably in German hands, Atlantic was shut down on 20 July. At Montgomery's asking, "emphatically underlined in the Supreme Commander's interchanges to Montgomery", the II Canadian Corps leader, Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, started a second hostile a couple of days after the fact, codenamed Operation Spring. This had the constrained however essential point of secures German units to keep them from being exchanged to the American part, in spite of the fact that Simonds accepted the open door to make another offer for VerriÃÂ¨res Ridge. Again the battling for VerriÃÂ¨res Ridge demonstrated incredibly grisly for the Canadians, with 25 July denoting the costliest day for a Canadian legionÃ¢ÂÂThe Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of CanadaÃ¢ÂÂsince the Dieppe Raid of 1942. A counterstroke by two German divisions drove the Canadians back past their begin lines and Simonds needed to submit fortifications to balance out the front. With Goodwood, the Canadian activities made the Germans submit the majority of their shield and fortifications toward the eastern area. Activity SpringÃ¢ÂÂregardless of its expenseÃ¢ÂÂhad drawn the ninth SS Panzer Division far from the U.S. segment on the eve of Operation Cobra. Just two "Panzer" divisions with 190 tanks currently confronted the First Army. Seven "Panzer" divisions with 750 tanks were around Caen, far from Operation Cobra similar to all the overwhelming Tiger tank contingents and the three "Nebelwerfer" detachments in Normandy.
