Pundits judged Leyland a superior Test than district batsman. His five star batting figures were not remarkable contrasted with different cricketers who played far less Test matches, yet in Tests, his normal is six runs an innings higher; against Australia, the most grounded of England's adversaries amid his vocation, he found the middle value of 56, a further increment of ten runs. Gibson proposes that he rose to the enormous events, and that he performed best against the hardest rivals. As indicated by Leyland's tribute in "The Times", "He was basically a man for the enormous event, a batsman taking care of business in an emergency, and his most loved diversion was a Roses coordinate or an Australian Test. Britain's supporters frequently inhaled a murmur of help to see his husky figure deliberately striding to the wicket." The author R. C. Robertson-Glasgow recommended that Leyland in a Test coordinate resembled the "four-squarers of antiquated or sentimental occasions. He was Horatius on the tottering scaffold; Hector, who alone remained among Troy and annihilation. He was destined to safeguard. However, he is more perilous than the individuals who are obstinate or inauspicious. He has something of D'Artagnan in him; there is a jollity other than the effortlessness and quality; found in the slight rundown of the top, and in a specific buoyancy and positive thinking of step."
