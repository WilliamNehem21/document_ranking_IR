For "Section 2", Steve Miner asked Carl Fullerton, the make-up impacts chief, to adhere to Savini's unique plan, however Fullerton just had one day to structure and shape another head. Fullerton drew a harsh sketch of what he trusted Jason should resemble, and had it affirmed by Miner. Fullerton added long hair to the character. Gillette needed to invest hours in a seat as they connected elastic structures everywhere all over, and needed to keep one eye shut while the "saggy eye" application was set up. Gillette's eye was shut for twelve hours on end while he was taping the last scenes of the film. False teeth made by a nearby dental practitioner were utilized to contort Gillette's face. A significant part of the essential idea of Fullerton's structure was disposed of for "Section 3". Digger needed to utilize a mix of the structures from Tom Savini and Carl Fullerton, yet as work advanced the plan started to lean increasingly more toward Savini's idea. Stan Winston was employed to make a structure for Jason's head, yet the eyes were level and Doug White, the make-up craftsman for "Section 3", required a saggy right eye. White kept Winston's plan for the back of the head, on the grounds that the group did not have sufficient energy to structure an altogether new head for Jason. The way toward making Jason's look was diligent work for White, who needed to always make adjustments to Richard Brooker's face, even up to the most recent day of taping.
