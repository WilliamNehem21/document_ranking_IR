For much of the 20th century, Alkan's work remained in obscurity, but from the 1960s onwards it was steadily revived. Raymond Lewenthal gave a pioneering extended broadcast on Alkan on WBAI radio in New York in 1963, and later included Alkan's music in recitals and recordings. The English pianist Ronald Smith championed Alkan's music through performances, recordings, a biography and the Alkan Society of which he was president for many years. Works by Alkan have also been recorded by Jack Gibbons, Marc-AndrÃ© Hamelin, Mark Latimer, John Ogdon, and HÃ¼seyin Sermet, among many others. Ronald Stevenson has composed a piano piece "Festin d'Alkan" (referring to Alkan's Op.Â 39, no. 12) and the composer Michael Finnissy has also written piano pieces referring to Alkan, e.g. "Alkan-Paganini", no.Â 5 of "The History of Photography in Sound". Marc-AndrÃ© Hamelin's "Ãtude No. IV" is a moto perpetuo study combining themes from Alkan's Symphony, Op.Â 39, no.Â 7, and Alkan's own perpetual motion Ã©tude, Op.Â 76, no. 3. It is dedicated to Averil Kovacs and FranÃ§ois Luguenot, respectively activists in the English and French Alkan Societies. As Hamelin writes in his preface to this Ã©tude, the idea to combine these came from the composer Alistair Hinton, the finale of whose Piano Sonata No.Â 5 (1994â95) includes a substantial section entitled "Alkanique".
