The separation of the old Viceroyalty of the RÃÂ­o de la Plata amid the 1810s in the end brought about the development of autonomous countries of Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay in the northern bit of the Viceroyalty, while its southern regions blended into the United Provinces of the RÃÂ­o de la Plata. Rosas wanted to reestablish, if not all, no less than a significant piece of the previous outskirts of the old Viceroyalty of the RÃÂ­o de la Plata. He never perceived the autonomy of Paraguay and respected it a dissident Argentine region that would unavoidably be reconquered. He sent a military under Manuel Oribe who attacked Uruguay and vanquished the vast majority of the nation, aside from its capital Montevideo that persevered through a long attack beginning in 1843. At the point when squeezed by the British, Rosas declined to ensure Uruguayan autonomy. In South America, all potential outside dangers to Rosas' arrangements of triumph crumbled, including Gran Colombia and the PeruÃ¢ÂÂ Bolivian Confederation, or were beset by inward unrest, similar to the Empire of Brazil. To fortify his cases over Uruguay and Paraguay, and keep up his predominance over the Argentine regions, Rosas barricaded the port of Montevideo and shut the inside streams to remote exchange.
