At 07:00, four British boats and six French battled a befuddled scuffle while the French vanguard proceeded with eastwards immediately and the slower segments of the British armada attempted to come up in the light breezes. The whole battle was gradually destroying nearer to the invigorated rough island of Groix, near which Villaret planned to shield his armada. Douglas in "Ruler Charlotte" had been constrained out of the commitment because of extreme harm to his apparatus and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he floated past the broke body of "Alexandre"; Captain Guillemet opened flame quickly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with destroying impact. Indeed, even as his ship fell back, Douglas kept on drawing in the French at long range, turning the firearms on "Peuple" and "Tigre", joined by "Sans Pareil" which assaulted "Tigre" under Captain Jacques Bedout and constrained it out of the French arrangement with serious harm. Villaret again endeavored to accumulate his powers in help of "Tigre", and even situated his frigate in front of his own escaping ships in anticipation of removing their retreat and driving them to impersonate his very own moves, however futile; "they would have disregarded my very body had not taken order and kept an impact", he wrote in his report. As "Tigre" dropped out of line, "Ruler" and "London" joined the assault on the secluded ship, and Bedout was compelled to surrender notwithstanding overpowering chances. The French ship had been seriously harmed, with of water in the hold, the poles and apparatus gravely torn and in excess of 130 men killed or injured, including Bedout, who had been hit multiple times.
