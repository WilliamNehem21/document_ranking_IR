Hobbs and his wife lived in rented property for the first years of their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of lower middle class according to McKinstry: although considerably more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable. Hobbs' wages increased as his reputation grew, so that by 1913 he was earning Â£375 annually (equivalent to about Â£32,000 in 2018), placing his family within the bracket of the London middle class. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was able to buy his own house in 1913, in Clapham Common, then a comfortable and prosperous area of London. By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the best players were nationally famous. Hobbs was the biggest cricket star of them all and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around Â£780 each year), the income from his sporting goods business, product endorsementâhe was one of the first cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial productsâand ghostwritten books and articles made him comparatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached Â£1,500 a year by 1925, more than an experienced doctor could earn at the time. Consequently, in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds, and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools. He had achieved greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers, but was always first concerned to give his wife and children the security lacking from his own childhood.
