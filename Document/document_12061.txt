David Bowers guesses that Dr. George F. Heath, editorial manager of "The Numismatist", who contradicted such commemoratives, declined to run any public statements that Zerbe may have sent. All things considered, an article showed up in the August 1905 issue, advancing the display and dollar. As it cites Zerbe and commendations his endeavors, it was likely composed by him. Zerbe focused on mass deals to sellers, just as easygoing ones at the reasonable at a cost of $2; he enrolled Portland coin vendor D.M. Averill and Company to make retail deals via mail. There were additionally a few banks and different organizations that sold coins legitimately to general society. Averill ran notices in the numismatic press, and in mid 1905, raised costs on the 1904 pieces, guaranteeing that they were close depletion. This was a lie: in actuality the 1904-dated coins sold so gravely that nearly 15,000 were liquefied at the San Francisco Mint. Zerbe had Averill sell the 1905 issue at a limited cost of ten dollars for six pieces. As he had for the Louisiana Purchase dollar, Zerbe made the coins accessible mounted in spoons or in adornments.
