As a life following death god, Hathor showed up every now and again in funerary writings and craftsmanship. In the early New Kingdom, for example, Osiris, Anubis, and Hathor were the three divinities most generally found in regal tomb beautification. In that period she frequently showed up as the goddess respecting the dead into existence in the wake of death. Different pictures alluded to her all the more at a slant. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show people playing out a custom called "shaking the papyrus". The centrality of this custom isn't known, yet engravings now and again state it was performed "for Hathor", and shaking papyrus stalks delivers a stirring sound that may have been compared to the rattling of a sistrum. Other Hathoric symbolism in tombs incorporated the bovine rising up out of the heap of the necropolis and the situated figure of the goddess managing a patio nursery in life following death. Pictures of Nut were frequently painted or etched inside pine boxes, showing that the box was her belly, from which the inhabitant would be renewed in existence in the wake of death. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor started to be put on the floor of the pine box, with Nut on the inside of the top.
