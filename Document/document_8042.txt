Chad Orton notes it would be physically outlandish for three young men to convey five hundred individuals over the stream in two hours. In fact, the salvage party had a few rescuers rather than three, eighteen of which have been decidedly recognized as being at the Sweetwater crossing. The rescuers got ten salvage wagons expansion to the wagons the Martin Company had with them. Numerous survivors expounded on riding the wagons over. In any case, in light of time requirements, not every person could ride the wagons. Some were conveyed, however different survivors composed that they crossed the waterway themselves or with the assistance of individuals other than the three young men. The young men referenced in the story helped a few people over, however not "about each part" as announced in the mythologized rendition of the story. While the three young men were among those that helped a few over, the ages weren't right. C. Allen Huntington was 24, David P. Kimball was 17, and George W. Allow was 16. There is no therapeutic proof that they kicked the bucket from impacts of the intersection, and most lived dynamic and generally long lives. Outside of Kimball's record, there is no other record of Brigham Young promising everlasting salvation to the rescuers dependent on a solitary demonstration. Orton takes note of that such a guarantee is conflicting with chapel principle. John Thomas takes note of that Solomon Kimball did not observe the intersection, however depended intensely on different sources, especially Orson F. Whitney's 1888 record, who likewise asserted that the majority of the young men kicked the bucket from the occasion, despite the fact that Huntington was as yet alive in 1888.
