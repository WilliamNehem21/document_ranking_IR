"Kroonland" next left New York on 15 June with "Finland", , , , , the Italian steamer , and the British steamer "Vauban" and met up with the Newport News portion of the convoyâconsisting of , , , , and the British troopship (another fellow "Volturno" rescuer)âthe next morning and set out for France. The convoy was escorted by the cruisers and , and the destroyers and ; the battleship and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time. The convoy had a false alarm when a floating barrel was mistaken for submarine, but the otherwise uneventful trip concluded at Brest on the afternoon of 27 June.
On 10 July, as "Kroonland" steamed homeward from France, a lookout spotted a periscope rising from the water about away. "Kroonland" opened fire and the fourth shot from her No. 4 gun "burst with a tremendous cloud of dirty blue smoke" exactly on the periscope. The submarine zig-zagged "erratically back and forth until she was directly in the disturbed water" of "Kroonland"s wake. The transport continued firing until the submarine disappeared, leaving an oil slick which could be seen for at least 15 minutes. "Kroonland" arrived safely in New York on 13 July.
