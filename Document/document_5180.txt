Pittas assemble a simple home that is a vault with a side passage. The structure of the home is predictable over the entire family. The home is as huge as a rugby ball, and is normally very much disguised among vines or vegetation or some likeness thereof. The home's appearance is likewise hard to recognize from a stack of leaves pushed together by the breeze, in spite of the fact that a couple of animal categories make a "doormat" of sticks (in some cases improved with warm blooded creature compost) by the passage. The homes can either be set on the ground or in trees. A few animal groups dependably home in trees, as both African species, others home just on the ground, and others show extensive variety. Both genders help to assemble the home, yet the male does the greater part of the work. It takes around two to eight days to manufacture another home; this presumably changes relying upon the experience of the flying creatures included. Another home is developed for each settling endeavor, and work on structure a home for a second brood may begin while the chicks from the main brood are as yet being encouraged.
