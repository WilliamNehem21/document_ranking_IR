Anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stageâor teleomorph stageâis later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The name of the anamorphic state of "S.Â coccinea" is "Molliardiomyces eucoccinea", first described by Marin Molliard in 1904. Molliard found the growth of the conidia to resemble those of the genera "Coryne" and "Chlorosplenium" rather than the Pezizaceae, and he considered that this suggested an affinity between "Sarcoscypha" and the family Helvellaceae. In 1972, John W. Paden again described the anamorph, but like Molliard, failed to give a complete description of the species. In 1984, Paden created a new genus he named "Molliardiomyces" to contain the anamorphic forms of several "Sarcoscypha" species, and set "Molliardiomyces eucoccinea" as the type species. This form produces colorless conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia) that are usually irregularly branched, measuring 30â110 by 3.2â4.7Â Âµm. The conidia are ellipsoidal to egg-shaped, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and 4.8â16.0 by 2.3â5.8Â Âµm; they tend to accumulate in "mucilaginous masses".
