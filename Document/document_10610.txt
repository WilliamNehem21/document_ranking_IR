Cooper's supporters trusted he would again look for the governorship of Kentucky or be selected to the Supreme Court of the United States in the mid 1950s; some even shaped a board to choose Cooper president. Cooper thought about running for senator in 1951, yet when Chapman was executed in a car crash on March 8, 1951, he chose to make another keep running for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's nominee to fill the opportunity. Underwood was viewed as a substantial most loved in the race. A few Republicans blamed Cooper for taking an arrangement from Democrat Truman. Both the "Louisville Times" and the "Louisville Courier-Journal" abjured their announcements in 1950 for Cooper to look for decision to the Senate in 1954. They presently expected that the decision of a Republican would enable that gathering to sort out the Senate, giving key board of trustees chairmanships to noninterventionists restricted to proceeded with US association in the Korean War. By the by, Cooper crushed Underwood by 29,000 votes in the race and served out the rest of Chapman's term. His triumph denoted the first run through in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been chosen to the Senate more than once.
