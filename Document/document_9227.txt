In December 1889, a letter composed by an occupant of St. Lawrence named Charles J. H. Saunders showed up in the "Bromley Record". Saunders expressed that he had bantered with numerous older inhabitants of Thanet regarding the matter of hoodening, and that they educated him that the custom had been ceased around fifty years beforehand, after a lady in Broadstairs was so terrified by the hooden horse that she passed on. He included that a steed's skull was seldom utilized, "attributable to the trouble acquiring one", and that the wooden head was subsequently regularly utilized as a substitution. He expressed that the hoodening organization regularly comprised of a "Racer" who put himself on the back of the individual conveying the pony, and that it was the "sport" that spectators endeavored to distract him, bringing about viciousness. The steed and racer were likewise joined by two vocalists, two specialists, and an individual dressed as an "elderly person" conveying a floor brush; when the organization thumped on individuals' entryways, it was the elderly person's business to clear the occupants feet away with her sweeper and to pursue any young ladies until being satisfied with cash or refreshments. He was of the assessment that the custom had been confined to the Isle of Thanet, noticing that local people educated him that it had been done in Ramsgate, St. Lawrence, Minster, St. Nicholas, Acol, Monkton, and Birchington. Repudiating this were a few letters distributed in the "Congregation Times" in January 1891 which bore witness to the proceeding with routine with regards to the hooden horse custom at both Deal and Walmer.
