The Evil Campaign pursues an elective adaptation of the War in the North. Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the NazgÃÂ»l toward the North to assemble wild Goblins. His lieutenants lead the Goblin armed force and dispatch an ambush on the Elven timberland of LÃÂ³rien. In spite of overwhelming opposition, the backwoods is invade, with Celeborn killed and Galadriel having fled to Rivendell; even Caras Galadhon falls under the sheer power of the enormous intrusion. The Mouth peers anxiously into the caught Mirror of Galadriel for his next assault, as his Goblins praise their triumph over the Elves in the midst of the remains of the once-relentless old fortress. Another gathering of Goblins, driven by the Goblin King Gorkil, assaults the Gray Havens via land and ocean. The Elven port is crushed and caught, and the walk crosswise over Eriador starts; Hobbits of the Shire are picked as the following target. Gorkil's crowd figures out how to pulverize the Hobbits and consume their nation to the ground, however Saruman's hireling GrÃÂ­ma Wormtongue, all of a sudden shows up with a huge armed force of Isengard Uruks and cases the land for his lord. The Goblins obliterate the very much prepared armed force and murder Wormtongue, taking the Shire for themselves.
