The gossip was that Griselda Steevens' isolation and continually being hidden were inferable from her having been brought into the world with a pig's head. Chambers (1864) conjectures that her irregular name may have added to the legend, and notes the basic conviction that she was named "Terrible" by virtue of her appearance when conceived. It was asserted that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mom had said "remove your litter of pigs!" to a lady poor person requesting cash to sustain her youngsters, and Griselda had then been brought into the world with the head and face of a pig. Daunted by the prevalent view that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open overhang to enable general society to see her face. This neglected to stem the spread of the gossip, and she authorized a picture of herself to be hung in the principle lobby of the medical clinic. The picture neglected to have the ideal impact; a considerable lot of the open picked rather to trust a representation in a bar neighboring the medical clinic, which indicated Steevens with a pig's head; the bar likewise showed a silver trough claimed to have had a place with her. She in the end pulled back from general visibility totally before her demise on 18 March 1746.
