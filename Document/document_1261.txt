The holotype of "Angaturama" "limai" comprises just of the front piece of the upper jaw, involving the tips of the combined premaxillae and the frontmost finishes of the maxillae. The example measures in tallness and long, with the width of the palatal locale being . The suture between the maxilla and premaxilla was spiked at the front and fixed towards the back. The lower edge of the premaxillae was sunken, with the concavity achieving its peak at the 6th premaxillary tooth. The front of the nose was extended, framing the spoon-molded terminal rosette normal for spinosaurids. This inward underside of the premaxillae would have supplemented a raised and broadened mandible tip. The premaxillae associated with one another on the base to frame "Angaturama"s auxiliary sense of taste, which was additionally in part added to by two procedures reaching out from the maxillae. The nose was unequivocally packed along the side, and the premaxillae delicately decreased towards the top to frame a tall sagittal peak in thickness. This peak was bigger and expanded more remote advances on the nose than in other known spinosaurids. The frontmost upper outskirt of the premaxilla had a little lump that overhung the base of the peak. This lump was evidently harmed on its upper surface, demonstrating that the highest point of the peak may have broadened considerably more remote over and advances starting there. The front of "Angaturama"s nose subsequently had a vertically straight or sunken edge, atypical from the more easily slanting noses of different spinosaurs.
