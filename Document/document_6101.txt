The Whig Party was likewise separated in Kentucky, among Clay and Taylor, however between gubernatorial competitors. William J. Graves, out of governmental issues since his lethal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the sponsorship of sitting Whig senator William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had verified help from previous Whig representative Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic triumph in the gubernatorial decision would injuriously affect Whig any desires for conveying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential race; another previous Whig representative, Thomas Metcalfe, agreed.

The selection effectively conveyed before Crittenden's companions could square it. The governorship was less esteemed and paid under Crittenden's situation in the Senate. He would likewise need to desert his developing lawful practice under the watchful eye of the Supreme Court and would lose contribution on national issues of significance to him, for example, the regional inquiries that became out of the Mexican War. In any case, he trusted that his office would join the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's appointive votes in the general decision. He acknowledged the selection seven days after it was made.
