Amid the fall, elk grow a thicker layer of hair, which protects them amid the winter. Guys, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all develop meager neck manes; female and youthful Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis don't. By late-spring, the overwhelming winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and different articles to help expel hair from their bodies. All elk have little and obviously characterized rear end patches with short tails. They have diverse shading dependent on the seasons and sorts of natural surroundings, with dim or lighter tinge common in the winter and an increasingly rosy, darker coat in the late spring. Subspecies living in parched atmospheres will in general have lighter hued coats than do those living in woodlands. Most have lighter yellow-darker to orange-dark colored coats as opposed to dull darker hair on the head, neck, and legs amid the late spring. Backwoods adjusted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker ruddy darker coats with less difference between the body coat and the remainder of the body amid the late spring months. Calves are brought into the world spotted, as is normal with numerous deer species, and they lose their spots before the finish of summer. Grown-up Manchurian wapiti may hold a couple of orange spots on the back of their late spring coats until they are more established. This trademark has likewise been seen in the woodland adjusted European red deer.
