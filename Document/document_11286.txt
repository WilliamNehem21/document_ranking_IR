MGM held open throwing sessions in London, Los Angeles, and New York for the job of Tank Girl. As indicated by Talalay, some were doubtful of the open throwing, feeling that it was an attention stunt. This was consistent with a degree, as she had been requesting that the studio cast a notable English on-screen character, Emily Lloyd. Talalay says she terminated Lloyd after she would not trim her hair for the job. Lloyd, who had gone through four months preparing for the job, question this, saying she essentially rescheduled her meeting with the film's hairdresser to the next day, after which Talalay terminated her for "being troublesome". Talalay cast Lori Petty, an American, since "she is insane in her very own life and [the film] required someone like that." MGM faxed "Due date" approaching them for a "perfect cast" list; they chose Malcolm McDowell for Kesslee, yet never trusted MGM would really get in touch with him. McDowell has spoken positively of his experience taking a shot at the film, saying it had "a similar flavor" as "A Clockwork Orange", and adulated Talalay and Petty. Talalay was drawn closer by a few people who needed appearances in the film, however she didn't need the film to be eclipsed by such appearances. Two appearances were settled on Ã¢ÂÂ Iggy Pop was given the job of Rat Face, and BjÃÂ¶rk was offered Sub Girl. She later dropped out, her character's scenes were modified, and the job was then given to Ann Cusack.
