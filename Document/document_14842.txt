As his girls moved toward womanhood, Liszt felt that an adjustment in their lives was called for and in 1855 he masterminded (over their mom's unpleasant challenges) for them to move to Berlin. Here they were put being taken care of by Franziska von BÃÂ¼low, whose child Hans was Liszt's most extraordinary understudy; he would assume responsibility for the young ladies' melodic training while Frau von BÃÂ¼low administered their general and good welfare. Hans von BÃÂ¼low, conceived in 1830, had deserted his lawful instruction in the wake of hearing Liszt lead the debut of Wagner's "Lohengrin" at Weimar in August 1850, and had chosen to devote his life to music. After a concise spell directing in little musical show houses, BÃÂ¼low considered with Liszt, who was persuaded that he would turn into an extraordinary professional piano player. BÃÂ¼low was immediately awed by Cosima's own ability as a piano player, in which he saw the stamp of her dad, and the pair created sentimental affections for one another. Liszt affirmed the match, and the marriage occurred at St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. Amid their special first night, alongside Liszt they visited Wagner at his home close Zurich. This visit was rehashed the next year, when Cosima, on withdrawing, stunned Wagner with an enthusiastic showing: "[S]he fell at my feet, secured my hands with tears and kisses ... I contemplated the riddle, without having the capacity to explain it".
