Waugh's companions were commonly energetic about the book. Anthony Powell suspected that it was a standout amongst Waugh's most intriguing works, and Graham Greene set it among the essayist's best fiction. The Donaldsons suspected that he had "succeeded superbly" in giving so striking a record of his encounters. John Betjeman, investigating the book for "The Daily Telegraph", composed: ""The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold" is self-examination composed as a novel, however not at all like other such works, which are commonly bleak and self indulging, this, since it is by Mr Waugh, is coherent, exciting and withdrew". Different commentators were commonly increasingly careful. Philip Toynbee in "The Observer" thought that it was "difficult to state whether it is a decent book or not; it is surely a fascinating and a moving one". He detected in Waugh's composing a "switch of gear", a point grabbed by John Raymond in the "New Statesman". Raymond thought Waugh was the main current English writer whose work hinted at advancement, and that in "Pinfold" had created "one of his wittiest, most accommodating excitements", a work of self-disclosure just damaged, in Raymond's view, by an inadmissible end. "The Times Literary Supplement's" commentator R.ÃÂ G.ÃÂ G. Cost regarded it a "slim little story", while recognizing that Waugh as a comic essayist could sensibly be contrasted and P.ÃÂ G. Wodehouse regarding creativity and silliness.
