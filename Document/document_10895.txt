Cases that Bury could have been the Ripper started to show up in papers not long after Bury's capture. Like Bury, the Ripper had delivered stomach wounds on his unfortunate casualties following their demises, and Bury lived in Bow, close Whitechapel, from October 1887 to January 1889, which set him genuinely close to the Whitechapel murders at the fitting time. The "Dundee Advertiser" of 12 February asserted that the Burys' "neighbors were frightened and frightened at the possibility that one whom in their dread they connected with the Whitechapel catastrophes had been living in their middle." "The New York Times" of that day associated Bury straightforwardly to the abominations and announced the hypothesis that William had killed Ellen to keep her from uncovering his blame, a story got and rehashed by "The Dundee Courier" the next day. "The Courier" claimed that Bury admitted to Lieutenant Parr that he was Jack the Ripper, however Parr's variant of the story says just that Bury said he was apprehensive he would be captured as Jack the Ripper. Cover denied any association, regardless of making a full admission to his significant other's homicide. By and by, the killer James Berry advanced that Bury was the Ripper. Berry did exclude Bury or the Ripper in his diaries, "My Experiences as an Executioner", however Ernest A. Parr, a writer in the Suffolk town of Newmarket, kept in touch with the Secretary of State for Scotland on 28 March 1908 that Berry "let me know expressly that Bury was known to have been Jack the Ripper".
