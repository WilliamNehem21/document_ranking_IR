In 1997, British scientistss Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner considered "Angaturama" a feasible junior equivalent word of "Irritator", taking note of that the two genera had withdrawn nostrils, long jaws, and trademark spinosaurid dentition. Paul Sereno and associates in 1998 concurred with this plausibility, and furthermore seen that the holotype of "Angaturama" appears to finish that of "Irritator" (implying that they could have a place with a similar example). Creators including ÃÂric Buffetaut and Mohamed Ouaja in 2002, Cristiano Dal Sasso and associates in 2005, Tor G. Bertin in 2010, Darren Naish in 2013, and Madani Benyoucef and partners in 2015 upheld this end. In their redescription of "Irritator", Sues and associates called attention to that the two holotypes are similarly as thin, and offer transversely round teeth with characterized yet unserrated edges. They additionally noticed that a sagittal peak on "Angaturama"s premaxillae may relate with that of "Irritator"s nasal bones. Some protest has been raised to these statements. Kellner and Campos in 2000 and Brazilian scientist Elaine B. Machado and Kellner in 2005 communicated the conclusion that the fossils originate from two distinct genera, and that the holotype of "Angaturama limai" was obviously more along the side leveled than that of "Irritator challengeri".
