"Ark Royal" left Scapa Flow with the battlecruiser and three destroyers, arriving at Gibraltar on 23 June 1940. Here she joined Force H, under Sir James Somerville. After the capitulation of France there was concern that a French fleet at Mers-el-KÃ©bir might fall under Axis control and tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean, affecting the whole war. "Ark Royal"s captain, Cedric Holland, had been the British naval attachÃ© in Paris, and was sent to negotiate the surrender or scuttling of the French fleet. Force H was deployed outside the harbour, and when the French admirals refused to agree to the offered terms, opened fire on the French ships. During the attack on Mers-el-KÃ©bir, "Ark Royal"s aircraft provided targeting information for the British ships. The French battleship escaped, despite attacks by Swordfish from "Ark Royal". Two days after the attack, aircraft from "Ark Royal" incapacitated the French battleship , which had been beached in the initial attack.
Having reduced the possibility of a French challenge in the Mediterranean, Force H prepared for attacks on Italian targets, and sailed from Gibraltar on 8 July. The force was attacked by Italian bombers within eight hours of departing, and although Force H escaped damage, Somerville cancelled the raids and ordered the fleet to Gibraltar. During July, the British colony of Malta came under attack from the Italian air force, with Force H ordered to deliver Hawker Hurricanes to reinforce the island's air defences. Force H was deployed from 31 July â 4 August, with the carrier used to deliver the aircraft, while "Ark Royal" provided air cover for the fleet. On 2 August, "Ark Royal" launched a successful air attack against the Italian air base at Cagliari.
