In 1962, Ranariddh joined up with the law staff at the University of Provence (presently part of Aix-Marseille University). He acquired his lone ranger's and graduate degrees in 1968 and 1969 separately, gaining practical experience in open law. In the wake of finishing his master's, Ranariddh took the PhD qualifying examinations in 1969. He came back to Cambodia in January 1970, and worked quickly as a secretary at the Interior Ministry. At the point when Lon Nol arranged an effective upset against Sihanouk in March 1970, Ranariddh was expelled from his activity and fled into the wilderness where he was a nearby partner of opposition pioneers. In 1971, Ranariddh was caught, alongside a few individuals from the regal family, and was held in jail for a half year before being discharged. He was rearrested the next year, and went through a further three months in detainment. In 1973, Ranariddh came back to the University of Provence, where he finished his PhD in 1975. Somewhere in the range of 1976 and 1979, he functioned as an exploration individual at the CNRS, and was granted a confirmation of higher investigations in air transport. In 1979 Ranariddh returned to the University of Provence as a partner teacher, showing courses in protected law and political humanism.
