The title was changed to "Thrilling Wonder Stories" to match the rest of the "Thrilling" line. The first issue appeared in August 1936âfour months after the last Gernsback "Wonder Stories" appeared. "Wonder Stories" had been monthly until the last few Gernsback issues; "Thrilling Wonder" was launched on a bimonthly schedule. In February 1938 Weisinger asked for reader feedback regarding the idea of a companion magazine; the response was positive, and in January 1939 the first issue of "Startling Stories" appeared, alternating months with "Thrilling Wonder". A year later "Thrilling Wonder" went monthly; this lasted fewer than eighteen months, and the bimonthly schedule resumed after April 1941. Weisinger left that summer and was replaced at both "Startling" and "Thrilling Wonder" by Oscar J. Friend, a pulp writer with more experience in Westerns than science fiction, though he had published a novel, "The Kid from Mars", in "Startling Stories" just the year before. In mid-1943 both magazines went to a quarterly schedule, and at the end of 1944 Friend was replaced in his turn by Sam Merwin, Jr. The quarterly schedule lasted until well after World War II ended: "Thrilling Wonder" returned to a bimonthly schedule with the December 1946 issue and again alternated with "Startling" which went bimonthly in January 1947. Merwin left in 1951 in order to become a freelance editor, and was replaced by Samuel Mines, who had worked for Ned Pines since 1942.
