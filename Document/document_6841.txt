As leader of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron, Jeffrey thought of creative methods for improving confidence despite living conditions that were "crude, best case scenario". On one event he organized settlement for his men close to a shoreline, well far from the commotion of evening shelling that was making them lose rest all the time. Another of his increasingly "radical thoughts" and enduring heritages was a joined chaos for all pilots in the battle zone, regardless of whether appointed or non-charged. The idea was at first disliked by Royal Air Force units, however when Air Vice Marshal "Mary" Coningham feasted at the mutual chaos on 11ÃÂ October 1941 and gave his endorsement, it flourished over the whole Desert Air Force; driving expert Clive Caldwell later set a similar thought in motion as authority of the RAAF's No.ÃÂ 1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory. One of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron's flight sergeants reviewed that Jeffrey made it a standard for new pilots to become acquainted with their ground team to expand their feeling of comradeship, and furthermore gave one of his senior warrant officers uncommon duty regarding monitoring the area of Allied runways and petroleum supplies to guarantee that the unit was never shy of fuel or places to arrive in a crisis.
