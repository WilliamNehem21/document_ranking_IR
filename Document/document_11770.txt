Expressively, "Precious stones" is a takeoff from Rihanna's common subjects of undesirable connections on her different melodies, and contains a conspicuous idea of adoration. The main section presents the tune's idea: "Discover light in the excellent ocean/I be cheerful/You and I, you and I/We're similar to jewels in the sky." The snare proceeds with this allegory: "So sparkle splendid, today around evening time, you and I/We're delightful like precious stones in the sky/Eye to eye, so alive." According to Glenn Yoder of "The Boston Globe", the tune demonstrates Rihanna uniquely in contrast to how she is seen by the open due to verses, for example, "I be upbeat" and "We're similar to jewels in the sky". James Montgomery of MTV News remarked that she grasps the energy and satisfaction of an acknowledged relationship, especially with the line "When you hold me, I'm alive", and concedes "I realized that we'd turned out to be one immediately". Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com translated that Rihanna is shouting out for her darling when she sings lines, for example, "When you hold me, I'm alive," and "At first sight I felt the vitality of sun beams/I saw the life inside your eyes." The "Messenger Sun" stated that the verses were in all probability propelled by Rihanna's private life.
