Alongside the buff-grouped rail and close relatives, the Tahiti rail has been set in either the family "Gallirallus" or the sort "Hypotaenidia"; the last is viewed as an equivalent word of the previous by certain specialists. The particular name "pacificus" alludes to the Pacific Ocean and is Latin for "quiet". The class name "Gallirallus" is a mix of the variety names "Gallus" and "Rallus". In 1977 the American ornithologist Sidney Dillon Ripley proposed that the Tahiti rail was a secluded type of buff-united rail, and maybe had a place with a superspecies with that flying creature and the Wake Island rail ("Gallirallus wakensis"). Rails are the absolute most across the board earthly vertebrates, and have colonized basically all island gatherings, with numerous island species being flightless. In 1973 the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson contended that numerous separate flightless types of rails were slid from still surviving flighted rails, that flightlessness had advanced freely and quickly in various island species, and that this component is along these lines of no ordered significance. Flightlessness can be invaluable (particularly where nourishment is rare) in light of the fact that it moderates vitality by diminishing the mass of flight muscles; the nonappearance of predators (especially mammalian) and a decreased requirement for dispersal are factors that enable this element to create in island winged animals.
