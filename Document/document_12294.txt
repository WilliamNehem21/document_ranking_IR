In 2013, the video appropriation organization The Criterion Collection, in a joint effort with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Film Archive, started the reclamation of the first negatives of the Apu set of three, including "Pather Panchali". These negatives had been seriously harmed by a flame in London in 1993, and all film jars and pieces having a place with the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for capacity, where they lay inconspicuous for two decades. It was found upon reconsideration that, albeit numerous pieces of the movies were undoubtedly devastated by flame or the impacts of age, different parts were salvageable. The materials were sent to a reclamation lab in Bologna, Italy: L'Immagine Ritrovata. Over a thousand hours of work by hand were exhausted in reestablishing and filtering the negatives and, at last, around 40 percent of the "Pather Panchali" negative was reestablished. (For those pieces of the negative that were absent or unusable, copy negatives and fine-grain aces from different business or chronicled sources were utilized.) The Criterion Collection's own lab at that point went through a half year making the computerized variant of each of the three movies, on occasion saving the particular look of the movies even at the expense of holding a few flaws.
