The work at Siding Spring was fulfilling, however it could likewise be risky. Amid development, Gascoigne continually cautioned associates to take care on the raised catwalks around the telescope. Notwithstanding, Gascoigne himself was nearly executed when, while working one night around the telescope structure, he fell seven meters to the floor of the observatory, barely missing "an enormous steel structure with long distending jolts". He endure, and was the first to snap a picture utilizing the telescope, on 26 or 27 April 1974. Gascoigne was so satisfied with the nature of the optics that he said he needed a number depicting the hyperboloid state of the mirror (1.1717) engraved on his tombstone. The site rapidly wound up one of the world's most vital cosmic observatories and was for a long time home to world-driving astrophotographer David Malin. The achievements of the AAT have been recorded in yearly reports by its Board, while a 2008 investigation of the general effects of galactic watching offices set the AAT in the main three, coming after just the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the W. M. Keck Observatory (the two telescopes constructed over two decades later). For Gascoigne, it was "an awesome thing to be related with Ã¢ÂÂ the high point in my life."
