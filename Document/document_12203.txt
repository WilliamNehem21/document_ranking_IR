Having settled on an area and date, there still remained the matter of what might be tried. John Challens, whose weapons gadgets gathering would need to create the get together, needed to know the design of Green Granite. Cook decided that it would utilize a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube packaging for dropping. The plan was solidified in April 1956. There were two renditions of Orange Herald, substantial and little. They had comparative centers, yet the huge rendition contained progressively dangerous. The plans were solidified in July. Green Bamboo was likewise ostensibly solidified, however tinkering with the plan proceeded. On 3 September, Corner proposed that Green Granite could be made littler by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This plan ended up known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests only months away, a speculative timetable had risen. Short Granite would be terminated first. Green Bamboo would pursue if Short Granite was ineffective, however be overlooked as pointless generally. Orange Herald (little) would be terminated straightaway. Since Short Granite was too extensive to even consider fitting into a rocket or guided bomb, this would happen whether Short Granite was a triumph. At long last, Green Granite would be tried. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another structure, known as Green Granite II. This was littler than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun packaging that could be utilized by the Blue Steel guided rocket then being worked on; yet it couldn't be made prepared to achieve Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and broadening Operation Grapple would have cost another Ã¢ÂÂ¤1.5 million.
