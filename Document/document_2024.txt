No records exist to exhibit precisely how the body was quartered, despite the fact that an etching of the quartering of Sir Thomas Armstrong in 1684 demonstrates the killer making vertical slices through the spine and evacuating the legs at the hip. The dispersion of Dafydd ap Gruffydd's remaining parts was depicted by Herbert Maxwell: "the correct arm with a ring on the finger in York; the left arm in Bristol; the correct leg and hip at Northampton; the left [leg] at Hereford. In any case, the miscreant's head was bound with iron, in case it should tumble to pieces from rottenness, and set prominently upon a long lance shaft for the joke of London." After the execution in 1660 of a few of the regicides associated with the passing of King Charles I eleven years sooner, the diarist John Evelyn commented: "I saw not their execution, however met their quarters, damaged, and cut, and stinking, as they were brought from the hangman's tree in crates on the obstacle." Such remains were commonly parboiled and shown as a horrifying notice of the punishment for high treachery, as a rule wherever the trickster had schemed or discovered help. Salt and cumin seed would be included amid the bubbling procedure: the salt to avoid rottenness, and the cumin seed to avert winged creatures pecking at the tissue.
