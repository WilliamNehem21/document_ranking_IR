The beverage is said to cause mind flights of giraffes, accepted to be the giraffes' apparitions by the Humr. In the nineteenth century, European pilgrims started to chase them for game. Territory annihilation has harmed the giraffe, as well: in the Sahel, the requirement for kindling and touching space for domesticated animals has prompted deforestation.
