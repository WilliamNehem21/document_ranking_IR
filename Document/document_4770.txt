"The Whistleblower" centers around sexual subjugation, human dealing, and defilement. Kondracki needed her first task to concern sex dealing yet was uncertain how to make a moving, unique plot. Her mom was conceived in Ukraine, and she knew about what she depicted as the nation's "pandemic" of dealing. Victor Malarek's book "The Natashas" enlivened her to deliver a film regarding the matter. She said of her drive being a test, "Nobody needs to watch a film of an oppressed young lady being assaulted for two hours." Bolkovac's encounters gave Kondracki a system for the film and included the topics of debasement and wide-scale smoke screens. Film pundit Rex Reed said that the maltreatment of intensity highlighted conspicuously in "The Whistleblower"; various government authorities partake in the sex exchange or deliberately ignore to it (counting peacekeepers, UN individuals and soldiers of fortune). Wallace Baine of the "Santa Clause Cruz Sentinel" composed that these perspectives' depiction made the motion picture "tricky and consistent with life". She stated, "There are clear and striking beasts in this film, however there are additionally those current in the shades-of-dim center, sufficiently pleasant folks enduring wrongdoings of unspeakable barbarity." Justice, another conspicuous subject, does not emerge by the end. The sex dealing unfortunate casualty Raya is murdered, and none of the peacekeepers who partook in the dealing are arraigned (albeit a few are sent home). As indicated by Baine, watchers are left with the feeling that "the most noticeably awful savagery in Bolkovac's story was the brutality done to equity".
