Lang's association with his clergymen was commonly formal. They knew about his aspiration and felt that he some of the time invested an excess of energy to his outside advantage, for example, his All Souls Fellowship, yet were by and by awed by his proficiency and his forces of rhetoric. The Church student of history Adrian Hastings singles out Portsea under Lang for instance of "very restrained peaceful polished methodology". Lang may have understood that he was bound for high office; he is accounted for to have rehearsed the mark "Cosmo Cantuar" amid a casual dialog with his ministers ("Cantuar" is a piece of the Archbishop of Canterbury's formal mark). In January 1898 he was welcomed by Queen Victoria to lecture at Osborne House, her Isle of Wight home. A short time later he chatted with the Queen who, Lang records, recommended that he ought to wed. Lang answered that he couldn't stand to as his clergymen cost excessively. He included: "If a clergyman demonstrates unacceptable I can dispose of him. A spouse is an installation." He was called on a few additional events and in the next January was named an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. These visits to Osborne were the beginning of a nearby relationship with the Royal Family which went on for a mind-blowing remainder. As one of the Queen's clerics, he aided the memorial service courses of action after her passing in January 1901.
