On SeptemberÃÂ 17, Gert moved over the Gulf of Honduras, where it before long restrengthened into a typhoon. Its term over water and its chance for extra reinforcing were abridged after a mid-to upper-level trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico turned the tempest toward the north-northwest, bringing it over the bank of Belize on the following day. When inland, Gert started to feel the impacts of a high-weight edge toward the northwest, which pushed the tempest on an all the more west-northwestward course. In the wake of intersection the YucatÃÂ¡n Peninsula and slowing down over land, Gert entered the Bay of Campeche seaward ChampotÃÂ³n late on SeptemberÃÂ 18 as a tropical wretchedness. The open tropical waters, joined with light wind shear up high, enabled the typhoon's profound convection to reconsolidate; around 0600ÃÂ UTC the following day, Gert again restrengthened into a hurricane. The tempest veered toward the west and eased back marginally because of a shortwave trough to its north, giving it more opportunity to develop over water. On SeptemberÃÂ 20, information from a United States Air Force airplane showed that Gert had turned into a tropical storm with winds of 75ÃÂ mph (120ÃÂ km/h); it achieved its pinnacle power as a CategoryÃÂ 2 typhoon on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂ Simpson scale before long, with winds of 100ÃÂ mph (155ÃÂ km/h) and a base weight of 970ÃÂ mbar (hPa; 28.64ÃÂ inHg).
