As initially instituted, the Horse Protection Act was to be upheld by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), a part of the USDA. In any case, an absence of staff and subsidizing implied little achievement, prompting the 1976 revision to the demonstration. With this correction, Congress made a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) program. This program permits non-USDA workers from inside the equine network to take preparing and affirmation programs kept running by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and directed by the USDA; subsequent to finishing the preparation, they may total assessments for infringement of the HPA at open occasions. The USDA is then ready to twofold check crafted by DQP members by making arbitrary investigations at few shows. One individual from the Tennessee Walking Horse world expresses this makes "the potential for a "fox guarding the chicken coop" circumstance", as though the HIO isn't completely keen on averting or distinguishing the act of soring, the DQPs may not be completely prepared or may purposely ignore examples of soring. At the point when APHIS reviewers are available at steed appears, the quantity of references for infringement increments fundamentally. Contenders and coaches at shows, seeing themselves as treacherously mistreated, have been known to leave when they discover APHIS monitors present, as opposed to enabling the auditors to see their ponies. In June 2012, the USDA distributed another standard requiring infringement found by HIOs to have punishments surveyed at a rate equivalent to or surpassing those given by APHIS examiners. Beforehand, HIOs were permitted to set their own punishment rates, bringing about certain associations acting indulgently towards violators of the HPA.
