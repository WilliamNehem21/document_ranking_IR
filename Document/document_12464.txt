After dim, the 48th Battalion assumed control over the line from the rest of the ninth Division. The 47th Battalion was still to its right side, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion involved a little remarkable among Albert and Dernancourt. Amid the night, erratic big guns and automatic weapon discharge was aimed at the contingent's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two organizations could make out German infantry progressing through the haze. They drew nearer without the inclusion of a blast, and in very close arrangement, some had their rifles thrown. The men of the 48th Battalion rapidly conveyed their weapons to manage and the Germans quit progressing. A minor achievement on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was rapidly managed and thirty detainees taken. Amid the day, the Germans propelled another multiple times, each time all the more carefully and with somewhat more flame support. Yet, each time the Australians beat them back. Before sun-down the Germans seemed to have pulled back, and the 48th Battalion had endured the loss of 62 men. That night and the following two days passed generally discreetly, with Leane pivoting his organizations through the bleeding edge posts, with trademark care not to make blockage in the forward territories. The regiment was alleviated the evening of 30 March.
