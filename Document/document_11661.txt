The task was now named "AlÃÂ³ Presidente", a working title taken from ChÃÂ¡vez's week after week TV and radio program. BSÃÂ start investigating roads of financing; the association convinced Bartley and ÃÂÃÂ Briain to make a short pilot to show to potential speculators, yet denied the movie producers' application for a Ã¢ÂÂ¬60,000 allow towards their Ã¢ÂÂ¬131,000 generation spending plan. BSÃÂ felt the pair expected to join forces with a generation organization that had involvement in the field, and which could help raise the rest of the assets. Bartley and ÃÂÃÂ Briain moved toward Power Pictures and, with the expansion of David Power as a maker, reapplied for the allow. Indeed, even as taping started, the full spending planÃ¢ÂÂpresently at Ã¢ÂÂ¬200,000Ã¢ÂÂhad not been verified. David Power pitched the undertaking at a few narrative celebrations and markets. At Dublin's Stranger Than Fiction celebration in September 2001, the BBC, S4C and Channel 4 declined to contribute. RaidiÃÂ³ TeilifÃÂ­s ÃÂireann (RTÃÂ) communicated enthusiasm for giving improvement reserves; no such arrangement was made, yet RTÃÂ offered Ã¢ÂÂ¬10,000 (consequently Ã¢ÂÂ¬20,000) for the Irish communicate rights. In October, the Dutch supporter Nederlandse Programma Stichting likewise dedicated Ã¢ÂÂ¬10,000. At a November advertise in Amsterdam, Power by and by moved toward the BBC and was turned down, as the association trusted the film's subject seemed to be "excessively far away to be pertinent to [its viewers'] lives". In any case, RTÃÂ's Kevin Dawson pushed the film at an European Broadcasting Union pitching session, verifying the enthusiasm of German TV station ZDF, which in this way given assets. In late 2001, BSÃÂ at last endorsed a creation give of Ã¢ÂÂ¬63,000.
