The little railroad became bankrupt a couple of years after the fact. At about this time, the Arkansas, Oklahoma and Western Railroad (AO&W) was shaping. The railroad kept running from Rogers to Siloam Springs, over a separation of around 30ÃÂ miles (43ÃÂ km). It was opened for traffic on New Year's Day 1908, interfacing with the Frisco at Rogers and the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf (P&G) at Siloam Springs. The AO&W wanted to fabricate eastbound to Eureka Springs. On December 1, 1909, the AO&W obtained the Monte Ne railroad. To interface the AO&W and the Monte Ne, a track would need to be laid from Hazelwood, Arkansas on the AO&W to Lowell; the Frisco line is standing out, and they would not permit an association. The AO&W rather manufactured a costly underpass of the Frisco. The development of the underpass empowered the Monte Ne line to turn over quite a bit of its outbound cargo business to the AO&W as opposed to contender Frisco. So the line delighted in a brief yet considerable volume of active cargo traffic from the Rogers White Lime Company situated at Limedale. The underpass still exists is as yet crossed via trains of Frisco Central Division successor Arkansas and Missouri Railroad.
