Later in 2017, Larson portrayed Jeannette Walls in "The Glass Castle", an adaptation of Walls' memoir, which reunited her with Destin Daniel Cretton. It tells the story of a young woman's relationship with her dysfunctional and nonconformist parents (played by Woody Harrelson and Naomi Watts). Larson was attracted to the complex depiction of a parent-child relationship and identified with its theme of forgiveness. She collaborated closely with Walls and her siblings and observed their mannerisms. Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" disliked the film's sentimentality but noted that "it is saved, just a little, by the robustness of Brie Larson's presence". Larson made her feature film directorial debut with the comedy-drama "Unicorn Store", in which she also starred. She played a disillusioned art student who becomes fascinated with unicorns. Larson had unsuccessfully auditioned in 2012 to star in the film when Miguel Arteta was attached to direct. After the production was stalled, Larson was offered to direct and star in it. She was drawn towards the fanciful narrative and found a connection between her character's journey and her experience as a director. Peter Debruge of "Variety" labeled it a "creative misfire" and found her "directing style [to be] entirely incompatible with whimsy". Larson's final appearance that year was in the India-set musical romance "Basmati Blues", a project she had filmed back in 2013, which received criticism on social media for its white savior narrative.
