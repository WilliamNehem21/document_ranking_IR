Theodore was fit and amazingly driven. Despite his vow to Laskaris, he tried not exclusively to grow his state to the detriment of Thessalonica, yet to in the end recoup Constantinople and restore the Byzantine Empire with himself as its ruler. To verify his northern flank, Theodore aligned himself with Serbia and the Albanian families. The Principality of Arbanon had just come in the Epirote political circle under Michael I, and closer ties created when its ruler, Demetrios, kicked the bucket in 1215, leaving his realm to his widow, who immediately remarried the following year to a Greek head honcho, Gregory Kamonas. Against the Serbs, Theodore relinquished Michael I's endeavor to seek after a northward venture into Zeta, and rather sought after a coalition with the Serbian sovereign Stefan II NemanjiÃÂ () that was coordinated towards holding the Bulgarians within proper limits. The ties among Epirus and Serbia were hardened by the marriage of Theodore's sibling Manuel Komnenos Doukas to one of Stefan II's sisters . Stefan II at that point looked to marry one of his childrenÃ¢ÂÂno doubt his oldest child and beneficiary, Stefan RadoslavÃ¢ÂÂto Michael I's second little girl Theodora. The Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, wouldn't endorse the marriage because of associationÃ¢ÂÂTheodora was a second cousin of Stefan Radoslav's mom, Eudokia Angelina, a little girl of Alexios III Angelos. In 1217, Stefan II endeavored to dodge this by presenting himself as the husband to be to Theodora's stepsister Maria, yet Chomatianos vetoed this proposition also on comparable grounds. At last, Stefan Radoslav wedded Theodore's firstborn little girl Anna in winter 1219/20.
