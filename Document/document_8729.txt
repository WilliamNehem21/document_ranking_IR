In spite of the fact that Etty had just planned to remain for 10 days, he was so taken with Venice that he stayed for more than seven months. He fell into a daily schedule of duplicating artworks in Venetian accumulations by day, and going to the existence class of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts by night, delivering around 50 oil compositions altogether just as various pencil draws. He was amazingly awed with the high caliber of the Venetian Academy; the teachers in their turn were incredibly awed with the nature of Etty's work, specifically his tissue tones. He obtained the moniker of "Il Diavolo" inferable from the fast at which he had the capacity to paint, and watching him at work progressed toward becoming something of a scene in its very own right; lights including Gioachino Rossini and Ladislaus Pyrker (at that point Patriarch of Venice) came to watch him paint. So committed was Etty to his examinations in Venice that he displayed no unique work in 1823, keeping in touch with his sibling that "On the off chance that one invested all the energy in painting firsts, one should, nay better, be at home". The individuals from the Venetian Academy were so awed by Etty that he was chosen an Honorary Academician.
