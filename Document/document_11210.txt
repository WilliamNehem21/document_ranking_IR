The United States economy went into a subsidence in the mid 1920s and vehicle deals diminished. Combined with expanding rivalry, Haynes Automobile Company started running into obligation issues. Haynes needed to utilize his own investment funds to safeguard the organization in 1921 and pay off some extraordinary records. A security drive was propelled to raise $1ÃÂ million to help support the organization through the period, however it missed the mark concerning collecting enough cash. Haynes was the essential buyer of the bonds. Dissimilar to the next vast auto organizations like Ford and General Motors, Haynes Auto did not have the broad vendor understandings that had the capacity to support their organizations through the harsh occasions; his organization depended on client's requesting legitimately from the plant. Haynes Auto deals rapidly started to slip from a pinnacle of almost 6,000 autos sold in 1922. In 1923 deals dropped to 4,300, and 1,500 out of 1924. The circumstance kept on being distressing for the organization, and it was compelled to default on some loans in October 1924. Haynes looked for a merger with various other auto organizations, including Henry Ford, yet accomplices were not imminent and Haynes was compelled to consent to a liquidation in 1925. He was considered by and by in charge of about $95,000 of the organization's obligation. What's more, he lost $335,700 in stock he held in the organization and a significant sum in venture bonds. Altogether, the shortfall cost Haynes an expected quarter of his total assets.
