While crossing the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, Gert dropped considerable rainfall in Quintana Roo; a 24-hour accumulation of 7.4Â in (188Â mm) was recorded at Chetumal, although higher localized totals of around 15Â in (380Â mm) fell elsewhere in the state. Gusty winds briefly buffeted the coast during the storm's landfall, with a maximum wind speed of 44Â mph (70Â km/h) recorded in Chetumal. The effects of the storm were limited to localized floods, however, which cut off one road to traffic and forced the inhabitants from low-lying areas in Chetumal and Felipe Carrillo Puerto to evacuate to higher ground. Scattered showers also caused light flooding in parts of the state of Campeche, including Ciudad del Carmen.
Upon Gert's final landfall, high gales and waves battered wide stretches of coastline in the states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz, though hurricane-force winds were largely confined to areas within the cyclone's southern eyewall. Tuxpan, just south of where the eye moved ashore, recorded wind velocities of more than 100Â mph (160Â km/h), while 80Â mph (130Â km/h) gusts occurred farther south in Poza Rica. To the north, winds reached 55Â mph (90Â km/h) in Tampico, Tamaulipas. Despite the severity of the winds, the worst of Gert was due to orographic lift when its broad circulation interacted with the eastern side of the Sierra Madre Oriental, generating extreme precipitation over much of the Huasteca region. As many as 31.41Â in (798Â mm) of rain were recorded in AquismÃ³n, San Luis PotosÃ­, while Tempoal in Veracruz observed a 24-hour total of 13.35Â in (339Â mm) from the storm.
