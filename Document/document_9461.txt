It isn't the situation that each thing is just connected with one classifier. Crosswise over lingos and speakers there is extraordinary inconstancy in the manner in which classifiers are utilized for similar words, and speakers regularly don't concur which classifier is ideal. For instance, for vehicles a few people use ÃÂ "bÃÂ¹", others use ÃÂ "tÃÂ¡i", and still others use ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "liÃÂ ng"; Cantonese utilizes ÃÂ "gaa3". Indeed, even inside a solitary lingo or a solitary speaker, a similar thing may take distinctive measure words relying upon the style in which the individual is talking, or on various subtleties the individual needs to pass on (for example, measure words can mirror the speaker's judgment of or feeling about the article). A case of this is the word for individual, ÃÂ "rÃÂ©n", which utilizes the measure word ÃÂ ()ÃÂ "gÃÂ¨" regularly, yet utilizes the measure ÃÂ "kÃÂu" when including number of individuals in a family, and ÃÂ "wÃÂ¨i" while being especially gracious or honorific, and ÃÂ "mÃÂ­ng" in formal, composed settings; moreover, a gathering of individuals might be alluded to by massifiers as ("yÃÂ¬ rÃÂ©n", "an of people") or ("yÃÂ¬ rÃÂ©n", "an of people"): the first is unbiased, though the second suggests that the general population are boisterous or generally being judged ineffectively.
