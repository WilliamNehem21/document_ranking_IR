As Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun, Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court eunuchs represented a threat to the imperial court. Zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs, and convinced Shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence. The eunuchs attempted to slander Zhang, who responded with a "fu" rhapsody called ""Fu" on Pondering the Mystery", which vents his frustration. Rafe de Crespigny states that Zhang's rhapsody used imagery similar to Qu Yuan's (340â278Â BC) poem "Li Sao" and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it.
While working for the central court, Zhang Heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the Archives of the Eastern Pavilion. Zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the "Records of the Grand Historian" by Sima Qian (145â90Â BC) and the "Book of Han" by Ban Gu (ADÂ 32â92) differed from other ancient texts that were available to him. His account was preserved and recorded in the 5thÂ century text of the "Book of Later Han" by Fan Ye (398â445). His rhapsodies and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts, Chinese philosophy, and histories. He also compiled a commentary on the "Taixuan" (, "Great Mystery") by the Daoist author Yang Xiong (53Â BCâADÂ 18).
