In , Square reused the "Seiken Densetsu" trademark for a random Game Boy activity pretending diversion coordinated by Koichi Ishii. Initially created under the title "Gemma Knights", the amusement was renamed "Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden" (distributed in North America as "Conclusive Fantasy Adventure" and in Europe as "Spiritualist Quest"). Starting with the spin-off, "Mystery of Mana", "Seiken Densetsu" was along these lines "spun off" into its own arrangement of activity pretending recreations unmistakable from "Definite Fantasy", named the "Mana" arrangement outside Japan. Four titles in the arrangement were discharged somewhere in the range of 1993 and 2003. "Mystery of Mana" was initially proposed to be a dispatch title for the Super NES CD-ROM Adapter, yet when the extra was dropped it was chopped down into a standard Super NES cartridge, with a large number of the cut thoughts showing up in other Square titles. It was followed in 1995 by the Japan-just "Seiken Densetsu 3"; the amusement was initially intended to be discharged in English as "Mystery of Mana 2", however specialized issues and confinement costs restricted the discharge. The last new diversion in the arrangement's underlying run is the 1999 "Legend of Mana", produced for the PlayStation. "Legend" is a 2D diversion like its antecedents, in spite of the PlayStation's 3D center, on the grounds that the reassure couldn't deal with the full 3D world Ishii imagined where one could associate with normal molded items. 2003 saw the arrival of "Sword of Mana", a redo of the first "Seiken Densetsu" for the Game Boy Advance. The revamp was re-appropriated to Brownie Brown, which was made out of a considerable lot of the Square representatives who had taken a shot at "Legend".
