By early September, Klenau's power had rejoined Wurmser's segment and battled at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. Here, the Austrians were dwarfed just about two to one by the French. As the Austrian armed force withdrew, Bonaparte requested an interest that made the Austrians relinquish their cannons and stuff. The greater part of the third contingent of the 59th "Jordis", and the main force of the Border Infantry Banat were caught and these units stopped to exist after this fight. The Austrians lost 600 slaughtered and injured, and 2,000 caught, in addition to lost 30 weapons, eight hues, and 200 limbers and ammo wagons. Klenau was with Wurmser's segment again as it battled its approach to blockaded Mantua and he took an interest in the battle at La Favorita close there on 15 September. This was the second endeavor to ease the post; as the Austrians pulled back from the fight, they withdrew into Mantua itself, and from 15 September until 2 February 1797, Klenau was caught in the fortification while the city was blockaded. Following the Austrian misfortune at the Battle of Rivoli, north of Mantua, on 14Ã¢ÂÂ 15 January 1797, when obviously there would be no Austrian help for Mantua, Klenau arranged states of surrender with French General Jean SÃÂ©rurier, albeit extra proof proposes that Bonaparte was available and directed definitely more liberal terms than Klenau anticipated. At the point when the army gave in February, Klenau co-marked the archive with Wurmser.
