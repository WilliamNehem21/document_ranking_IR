Beauregard, ignorant that he was currently dwarfed, intended to proceed with the assault and drive Grant into the stream. Incredibly, Union powers began pushing ahead in a gigantic counterattack at first light. Concede and Buell propelled their assaults independently; coordination happened just at the division level. Lew Wallace's division was the first to see activity, about 5:30ÃÂ a.m., at the extraordinary right of the Union line. Wallace proceeded with the development, crossing Tilghman Branch around 7 a.m. what's more, met little obstruction. Altering course and moving toward the southwest, Wallace's men drove back the unit of Col. Preston Pond. To Wallace's left side were the overcomers of Sherman's division, at that point McClernand's, and W. H. L. Wallace's (presently under the direction of Col. James M. Tuttle). Buell's military proceeded to one side with Bull Nelson's, Crittenden's, and McCook's divisions. The Confederate safeguards were so severely intermixed that little unit attachment existed over the detachment level. It required over two hours to find Gen. Polk and raise his division from its bivouac toward the southwest. By 10 a.m., Beauregard had settled his front with his corps commandants from left to right: Bragg, Polk, Breckinridge, and Hardee. In a shrubbery close to the Hamburg-Purdy Road, the battling was intense to the point that Sherman depicted in his report of the fight "the severest musketry fire I at any point heard."
