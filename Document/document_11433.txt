The video was recorded August 17, 1991 on a soundstage in Culver City. The music video highlights Nirvana playing at an energy rally in a secondary school rec center to a crowd of people of passionless understudies on seats, and team promoters wearing dark dresses with the Circle-A rebel image. The video includes an appearance by Burton C. Ringer, later known as frontman of overwhelming metal band Fear Factory. Once in a while, the scene slices to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a naval force blue jumpsuit and hitting the dance floor with a push sweeper handle. The video closes with the understudies annihilating the set and the band's apparatus. The discontent was veritable; the additional items that filled the grandstands had been compelled to remain situated through various replays of the tune for a whole evening of taping. Cobain persuaded Bayer to enable the additional items to mosh, and the set turned into a scene of bedlam. "When the children turned out moving they just said 'screw you', since they were so tired of his crap for the duration of the day," Cobain said. Cobain hated Bayer's last alter and directed a re-alter of the video, making the last form. One of Cobain's significant increases was the penultimate shot, a nearby of his face after it had been clouded for the greater part of the video. Bayer said that not at all like ensuing craftsmen he worked with, Cobain was not vain, and was increasingly intrigued that "the video had something that was really about what they were about".
