The settling example was found in a stratigraphic territory demonstrating that oviraptorids favored settling close streams that gave delicate, sandy substrate and sustenance in conditions that were generally xeric (accepting a little measure of dampness). Numerous oviraptorids have been found in agonizing positions, demonstrating they may have agonized for moderately significant lots, like present day feathered creatures, for example, the ostrich, emu, and dark breasted scavanger, which brood for over 40 days with a restricted supply of sustenance. Settling in desert conditions can be unsafe to grown-ups that stay in the home for substantial pieces of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, because of warmth stress. The decision of settling zone may consequently have been a system for fruitful brooding in outrageous warmth. It has additionally been recommended that the development of tail-plumes in oviraptorosaurs was an adjustment for shading and securing eggs in their homes. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was decreased in size contrasted with the hearty first finger might be clarified by an adjustment in capacity; it might be identified with the nearness of long wing quills that were joined to the second finger. These wing quills were most likely used to secure the eggs amid settling. At the point when the second finger started working as a quill support, its capacity to get a handle on was decreased, and this capacity was taken over by the main finger, which along these lines turned out to be progressively powerful. The third finger was decreased in size, as well, most likely on the grounds that it was situated behind the wing quills in a way where it would not be successful for getting a handle on.
