At 13:00 the batteries went without hesitation; a little later two Allied sections set out from the furthest points of their line and assaulted the flanks of the Franco-Bavarian armed force. Toward the south the Dutch Guards, under the order of Colonel WertmÃÂ¼ller, approached with their two field weapons to catch the village of FranquenÃÂ©e. The little Swiss army in the town, shaken by the abrupt surge and unsupported by the units to their back, were before long constrained back towards the town of Taviers.

In any case, scarcely had the withdrawing Swiss rejoined their companions in that town when the Dutch Guards restored their assault. The battling among the back streets and houses before long disintegrated into a furious blade and clubbing "mÃÂªlÃÂ©e", yet the prevalence in Dutch capability before long told. The practiced French officer, Colonel de la Colonie, remaining on the plain adjacent recalled Ã¢ÂÂ "this town was the opening of the commitment, and the battling there was nearly as lethal as the remainder of the fight set up together."
