Subsequently, the handling of a good hoplite armed force without hired fighters or liberated helots was troublesome. Cleomenes expanded the quantity of full residents again and influenced the Spartan armed force to work with an expanded dependence on more daintily heavily clad phalangites of the Macedonian style. Be that as it may, a considerable lot of these reestablished natives were executed in the Battle of Sellasia and Nabis' legislative issues drove the rest of them into outcast. In outcome, the overwhelming troops were never again accessible in adequate numbers. This prompted a genuine decrease in Sparta's military power, and the point of Nabis changes was to restore a class of steadfast subjects fit for filling in also prepared phalangites (working in a nearby and profound arrangement, with a more extended lance than the hoplites'). Nabis' freedom of the oppressed helots was a standout amongst the most remarkable deeds in Spartan history. With this activity, Nabis disposed of a focal ideological mainstay of the old Spartan social framework and the central purpose behind complaint to Spartan extension by the encompassing "poleis" (city-states). Guarding against helot revolt had been, until this time, the focal worry of Spartan outside approach, and the need to secure against interior revolt had restricted adventurism abroad; Nabis' activity nullified this worry with a solitary stroke. His liberated helots got land from him and were married to well off spouses of the banished Spartan demos (all previous full natives) and widows of the rich first class, whose husbands had been slaughtered at his requests.
