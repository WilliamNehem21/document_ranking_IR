Two fiddles, a bow, a still shawm or "doucaine", three-opening channels, and a tabor drum with a drumstick were found all through the disaster area. These would have been utilized for the individual pleasure in the team and to give a cadence to chip away at the apparatus and turning the capstans on the upper decks. The tabor drum is the most punctual known case of its sort and the drumstick of a formerly obscure plan. The tabor funnels are significantly longer than any known models from the period. Their disclosure demonstrated that contemporary outlines, recently saw with some doubt, were in truth precise delineations of the instruments. Before the disclosure of the "Mary Rose" shawm, an early ancestor to the oboe, instrument students of history had been perplexed by reference to "in any case shawms", or "delicate" shawms, that were said to have a sound that was less harsh than before shawms. The still shawm vanished from the melodic scene some time in the sixteenth century, and the instrument found on the "Mary Rose" is the main enduring precedent. A generation has been made and played. Joined with a pipe and tabor, it gives a "viable bass part" that would have delivered "rich and full solid, which would have given amazing music to moving on board transport". Just a couple of other fiddle-type instruments from the sixteenth century exist, yet none of them of the sort found on the "Mary Rose". Generations of the two fiddles have been made, however less is known about their plan than the shawm since the neck and strings were absent.
