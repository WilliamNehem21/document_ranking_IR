Post drove in excess of 40 firemen, comprising of USFS, CCC, and BPR representatives, up the edge looking for an opening in the woodland to take shelter. Spot fires blew in front of Post and his teams keeping them from progressing further up the edge, yet they found a rough outcropping and lay inclined on the ground as the flame immersed them. Packed together on the outcropping, Post's men moved around to dodge the flares and USFS representative Paul Tyrrell (who later kicked the bucket) utilized his very own body to shield a few CCC firemen from freezing and to shield them from the flame. The flares and warmth all things considered drove five firemen to charge the blazes trying to get away to the opposite side of the firefront, yet just a single of them endure. A sum of nine firemen were murdered on the flame lines and six more passed on later from their consumes, while another 38 endured different wounds. The Blackwater Fire is tied for fourth including the best death toll by firemen on an out of control fire in U.S. history. It murdered progressively proficient wildland firemen in the U.S. than some other in the 103ÃÂ years between the Great Fire of 1910 and the Yarnell Hill Fire in 2013.
