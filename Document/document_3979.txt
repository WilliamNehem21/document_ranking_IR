In mid 1943, Japan was as yet accepted to be equipped for attacking, or if nothing else shelling, the Torres Strait islands, and NEA had just No.ÃÂ 7 Squadron, presently working from Horn Island, to counter the risk. It was strengthened in April by No.ÃÂ 84 Squadron, flying CAC Boomerang warriors. That month, No.ÃÂ 72 Wing was framed at Townsville, before sending to Merauke, New Guinea. Controlling No.ÃÂ 84 Squadron, No.ÃÂ 86 Squadron (flying Kittyhawks), and No.ÃÂ 12 Squadron (Vultee Vengeance plunge planes), the wing was in charge of Torres Strait's air barrier, just as hostile tasks against framework and transporting in Dutch New Guinea. In October, No.ÃÂ 84 Squadron changed over to Kittyhawks and exchanged to the recently framed No.ÃÂ 75 Wing, which was given obligation regarding units at Horn Island, Thursday Island, and Higgins Field on Cape York Peninsula. In February 1944, No.ÃÂ 75 Wing home office moved from Horn Island to Higgins Field, where it was before long joined by different units under its control, Nos.ÃÂ 7 and 23ÃÂ Squadrons; the last worked Vengeances until being announced non-operational in June, before re-furnishing with B-24 Liberators for obligation in North-Western Area. By May, NEA's structure of fight on the Australian terrain comprised of Nos.ÃÂ 7, 9, 13 (working Lockheed Venturas from Cooktown), 20 and 23ÃÂ Squadrons.
