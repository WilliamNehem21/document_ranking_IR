Like different elasmosaurids, "Elasmosaurus" would have had a slim, triangular skull. The nose was adjusted and nearly shaped a semi-circle when seen from above, and the premaxillae (which structure the front of the upper jaw) bore a low bottom at the midline. It is questionable what number of teeth "Elasmosaurus" had, because of the fragmentary condition of the fossils. It presumably had six teeth in each premaxilla, and the teeth protected there were framed like vast teeth. The quantity of premaxillary teeth recognized "Elasmosaurus" from crude plesiosauroids and most different elasmosaurids, which as a rule had less. The two teeth at the front were littler than the succeeding ones, and were situated between the initial two teeth in the dentaries of the lower jaws. The known teeth of the front piece of the lower jaw were vast teeth, and the teeth at the back of the jaws seem to have been littler. The dentition of elasmosaurids was by and large heterodont (sporadic all through the jaws), with the teeth ending up logically littler from front to back. The maxillae (biggest tooth bearing bone of the upper jaw) of elasmosaurids generally contained 14teeth, though the dentaries (the principle part of the lower jaws) typically contained 17 to 19. The teeth interlocked, and their tooth crowns were thin and adjusted in cross-area. The mandibular symphysis (where the two parts of the lower jaw associated) was very much hardened, with no noticeable suture.
