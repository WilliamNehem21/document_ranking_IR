The chart book and hub bone complex, comprising of the initial two neck vertebrae and explained with the back of the skull, was long, low, and on a level plane rectangular in side-see. The centra, or "bodies", of these vertebrae were co-hardened in the holotype example, which shows it was a grown-up. The neural curves of these vertebrae were slim and rather high, which gave the neural trench (the opening through the center of the vertebrae) a triangular layout when seen from the back. The lower some portion of the neural waterway was tight towards the back by the pivot, where it was a large portion of the expansiveness of the centrum. It ended up more extensive towards the front, where it was nearly a similar broadness as the centrum of the chart book. The neural curves were likewise more powerful there than in the pivot, and the neural channel was higher. The neural spine was low and coordinated upwards and back. The centra of the chart book and pivot were of equivalent length, and had a quadratic shape in side view. The surface (or feature) where the hub enunciated with the following vertebra had an oval blueprint, and an uncovering for the neural channel amidst its upper edge. A particular bottom kept running along the lower center of the map book and hub vertebrae.
