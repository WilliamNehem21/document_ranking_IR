In 1907 Messager came back to arrangement. His "comÃÂ©die lyrique" "Fortunio" was displayed at the OpÃÂ©ra-Comique with incredible achievement. Around the same time he was designated joint chief of the Paris OpÃÂ©ra, in charge of the creative bearing, with Frederick Broussan, earlier executive of the Lyons Opera, assuming responsibility for organization. The association kept going until 1913, however its prosperity was hampered by deficiency of assets and inward question. Messager settled on a strategy of making the OpÃÂ©ra "all the more truly French". He resuscitated Rameau's "Hippolyte et Aricie", without precedent for Paris since 1767, and exhibited unordinary French collection including FaurÃÂ©'s "PÃÂ©nÃÂ©lope". Outside musical show was not disregarded; Messager gave Paris its initially total "Ring" cycle, exhibited a Russian season featuring FÃÂ©lia Litvinne and Feodor Chaliapin, and led the French debut of Richard Strauss' "Salome". At the welcome of the Emperor Wilhelm II, Messager and Broussan took the OpÃÂ©ra organization to Berlin in 1908. Relations between the two co-executives were not constantly amicable; after the French government rejected Messager's acquiescence on no less than one event, he at long last reported it in November 1913, a year prior to his term of office was expected to lapse. He assented to return in January 1914 to lead "Parsifal"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ its first execution in Europe outside Bayreuth. His leading of the work won basic acclaim.
