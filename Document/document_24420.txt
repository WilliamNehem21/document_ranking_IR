Among leading musical figures at the premiere were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns, and Charles Gounod. GeneviÃ¨ve, suffering from an abscess in her right eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-SaÃ«ns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-MariÃ©'s performance was described by one critic as "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained of a lack of melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional OpÃ©ra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. LÃ©on Escudier in "L'Art Musical" called the music "dull and obscureÂ ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet ThÃ©odore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual OpÃ©ra-Comique "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".
