When Merwin became editor in 1945 he brought changes, but artist Earle K. Bergey retained the creative freedom he had come to expect given his relationship with Standard. Some argue that Bergey's covers became more realistic, and Merwin managed to improve the interiors of "Startling" to the point of being a serious rival to "Astounding", acknowledged leader of the field. Critics' opinions vary on the relative quality of the magazines of this era; Malcolm Edwards regards "Startling" as second only to "Astounding", but Ashley considers "Thrilling Wonder" to be "Astounding"s closest challenger in the late 1940s. Merwin's discoveries included Jack Vance, whose first story, "The World Thinker", appeared in the Summer 1945 issue. He also regularly published work by Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore, who wrote both under Kuttner's name and as "Keith Hammond": in a four-year period from 1946 to 1949 the writing team of Kuttner and Moore had seven novels published in "Startling", mostly science fantasy, a subgenre not common at that time. Notable novels that appeared in the late 1940s include Fredric Brown's "What Mad Universe" and Charles L. Harness's "Flight Into Yesterday", later published in book form as "The Paradox Men". Arthur C. Clarke's novel "The City and the Stars" first saw print in "Startling" in abbreviated form, in the November 1948 issue, under the title "Against the Fall of Night".
