"Egdon Heath" (1927) was Holst's first major instrumental work after "The Planets". Matthews outlines the music as "slippery and unusual [with] three primary components: a pulseless meandering tune [for strings], a miserable metal processional, and fretful music for strings and oboe." The secretive move towards the end is, says Matthews, "the most abnormal minute in a peculiar work". Richard Greene in "Music and Letters" depicts the piece as "a larghetto move in a siciliano musicality with a basic, stepwise, shaking song", however deficient with regards to the influence of "The Planets" and, on occasion, tedious to the audience. An increasingly prominent achievement was "A Moorside Suite" for metal band, composed as a test piece for the National Brass Band Festival titles of 1928. While composed inside the conventions of north-nation metal band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unquestionable engraving, "from the skipping 6/8 of the opening Scherzo, to the energetic melodic fourths of the finishing up March, the interceding Nocturne looking to some extent like the moderate moving parade of "Saturn"". 'A Moorside Suite' has experienced real revisionism in the article 'Ensemble Within: rehearing Holst's 'A Moorside Suite' by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 release of 'The Musical Times'. As with 'Egdon Heath' Ã¢ÂÂ appointed as an ensemble Ã¢ÂÂ the article uncovers the symphonic idea of this metal band work.
