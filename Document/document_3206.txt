The armed forces of the First Coalition incorporated the royal contingents and the infantry and mounted force of the different states, adding up to around 125,000 (counting three self-sufficient corps), a sizable power by eighteenth century measures yet a moderate power by the norms of the Revolutionary wars. Altogether, however, the president Archduke Charles' troops extended from Switzerland toward the North Sea and Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's, from the Swiss-Italian outskirt to the Adriatic. Habsburg troops contained the main part of the military, yet the dainty white line of Habsburg infantry couldn't cover the region from Basel to Frankfurt with adequate profundity to oppose the weight of their adversaries. Contrasted with French inclusion, Charles had a large portion of the quantity of troops covering a front that extended from Renchen close Basel to Bingen. Besides, he had concentrated the greater part of his power, told by Count Baillet Latour, among Karlsruhe and Darmstadt, where the conversion of the Rhine and the Main made an assault in all probability, as it offered a portal into eastern German states and eventually to Vienna, with great extensions crossing a moderately very much characterized waterway bank. To his north, Wilhelm von Wartensleben's self-ruling corps secured the line among Mainz and Giessen. The Austrian armed force comprised of experts, many moved from the fringe locales in the Balkans, and recruits drafted from the Imperial Circles.
