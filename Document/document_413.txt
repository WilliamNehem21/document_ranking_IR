Kurt Busch, who drove 107 laps (more than some other driver) was disappointed after his lap-298 accident: "How on the planet we can be so solid amid the day here and nearly in a moment go totally the other way is outside my ability to understand. We need to understand it eventually. I'm baffled and down the present moment, however we'll simply continue stopping along searching for the appropriate response." Newman, who drove the initial ten laps of the race, was upbeat notwithstanding resigning from the race: "We had a decent vehicle. We had recently gotten the two timing trickster and we would have been one of the 15 vehicles on the lead lap. Everyone at Penske Racing has been working superbly. We've quite recently got the chance to keep it up and remain centered." After completing the race in fifth spot (at that point the best completion for a Toyota vehicle) Vickers said it was "harsh" driving without the utilization of intensity directing that cut in and out however he felt Red Bull Racing Team had "the best vehicle" for the race. Stewart's group boss Greg Zipadelli was disillusioned his driver couldn't take the triumph: "On the off chance that we hadn't had a chance to win, I'd state that completing 6th and driving laps would be amazing, But sitting where we are at the present time, it appears that everything is stacked against us. We were presumably a second-or third-place vehicle even from a pessimistic standpoint, so it's frustrating." Eighth-place finisher Earnhardt said he thought he verified a second-place complete and was uninformed the pioneers had made pit stops. All things considered, he said was content with the manner in which his group ran the race.
