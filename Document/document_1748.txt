Biting the dust stands of "B. coccinea" were seen in 1989, and the growth "Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia" secluded as the reason in 1995. The sickness, a type of flying ulcer, showed at first as dead dry darker leaves and the tips of new development. Plants would bite the dust from the top downwards, with bigger branches influenced after some time. Under the external bark, orange and dark colored patches of rot spread out from leaf hubs until they enclose the stem, which at that point bites the dust. Blossom spikes might be influenced amid blooming season. In moist spells amid warm climate, white or pink spore ringlets are delivered on dead wood. One influenced stand checked more than three years from October 1989 to June 1992 demonstrated a 97% mortality of plants (contrasted and a pattern 40%). Agents Bryan Shearer and associates segregated another destructive pathogen that they recognized as a types of "Zythiostroma", anyway it seemed to conjure a safe reaction in the plant. This safe reaction, combined with the way that it had not been seen in the wild, persuaded it was anything but a noteworthy pathogen of the species. This species has since been renamed and named as "Luteocirrhus shearii".
