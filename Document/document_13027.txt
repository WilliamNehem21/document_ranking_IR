Getting ready for SRÃÂ 56 began in 1956, as indicated by San Diego Councilwoman Barbara Warden. The course was first added to the California State Highway System in 1959 as Legislative Route Number 278 (LRNÃÂ 278). The directing kept running from LRNÃÂ 2, which later progressed toward becoming USÃÂ 101, the whole distance east to LRNÃÂ 198, which is presently SRÃÂ 67. In the 1964 state parkway renumbering, LRNÃÂ 278 was renumbered SRÃÂ 56 and was assigned to keep running from I-5 to SRÃÂ 67. On DecemberÃÂ 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SRÃÂ 56 in their city plan expanding the whole distance east through the city to a northern augmentation of SR 125. In 1983, both the urban areas of San Diego and Poway bolstered the expansion of SRÃÂ 56 right to SRÃÂ 67, despite the fact that Poway needed the course moved and had hesitations about the road finishing off with their city. All things considered, there are no designs to build the bit of SRÃÂ 56 east of I-15; a few blood vessel streets interface the eastern end of the SR 56 expressway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CR S5), and Poway Road (CR S4).
