The "Persona" series takes place in modern-day Japan and focuses on a group of high school students, with the exception to this being "Eternal Punishment", which focused on a group of adults. The setting has been described as urban fantasy, with extraordinary events happening in otherwise normal locations. The typical setting used is a city, with a noted exception being the rural town setting of "Persona 4". Although they are typically stand-alone games that only share thematic elements, the "Persona" games share a continuity, with elements from previous games turning up in later ones. "Persona" and the "Persona 2" games shared narrative elements which were concluded with "Eternal Punishment", so "Persona 3" started out with a fresh setting and characters. The first in the series is "Persona", set in the year 1996. This is followed by the events of "Innocent Sin" and "Eternal Punishment" in 1999. At the end of "Innocent Sin", the main characters rewrite events to avert the destruction of Earth, creating the "Eternal Punishment" reality, with the original reality becoming an isolated Other Side. "Persona 3" and subsequent games stem from "Eternal Punishment". "Persona 3" is set from 2009 to 2010, and "Persona 4" is set from 2011 to 2012. The "Persona 4 Arena" games and "Dancing All Night" take place in the months following "Persona 4". "Persona Q" takes place in a separate enclosed world in which the characters of "Persona 3" and "4" are drawn into from their respective time periods. In contrast, "Persona 5" is set in a non-specific year referred to as "20XX".
