Given their solid execution in 1974 and Martin's notoriety for structure victors, the Rangers were the most loved in the AL West for 1975 over the three-time shielding title holder A's. The group failed to meet expectations, be that as it may, Jenkins going from 25 wins to 17 and other key players not working out quite as well as in 1974. After a moderate begin, the Rangers recouped to some degree, yet close to the finish of June got themselves 12 recreations behind the A's. Relations among Martin and the Ranger front office were stressed by off-field issues, including Martin's drinking and strife with a portion of the players, including Sundberg. As he lost control of his group, Martin struck Rangers voyaging secretary Bert Hawkins, supposedly to arrange a players' spouses' club. In July, after a question with Corbett about whether to sign free specialist catcher Tom Egan, Martin told the media that the proprietor, who had made a fortune selling plumbing channels, "knows as much about baseball as I do about pipe". Corbett started counseling the minority proprietors to choose whether to flame Martin, and educated the administrator of this. After one day, on July 20, after Martin requested the open location broadcaster to play "Express gratitude toward God I'm a Country Boy" amid the seventh inning stretch rather than "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" (as Corbett had educated), he was terminated.
