The awful rockmen and refuse men were generally paid by the ton of material evacuated, yet the quarrymen were paid by an increasingly confounded framework. Some portion of the installment was controlled by the quantity of slates the posse created, yet this could change extraordinarily as indicated by the idea of the stone in the area distributed to them. The men would subsequently be paid an additional aggregate of "poundage" per pound of slate delivered. "Deals" were let by the setting steward, who might concur a cost for a specific region of shake. In the event that the stone in the deal allotted to a posse was poor, they would be paid a higher poundage, while great shake implied a lower poundage. The primary Monday of consistently was "deal letting day" when these understandings were made among men and the board. The men needed to pay for their ropes and chains, for apparatuses and for administrations, for example, honing and fixing. Subs (propels) were paid each week, everything being settled up "upon the arrival of the enormous pay". In the event that conditions had not been great, the men could finish up owing the administration cash. This framework was not at last canceled until after the Second World War.
