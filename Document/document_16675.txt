In March 2018, Gaga supported the March for Our Lives gun-control rally in Washington, D.C. and released a cover of Elton John's "Your Song" for his tribute album "Revamp". Later that year, she starred as a struggling singer named Ally in Bradley Cooper's critically acclaimed musical romantic drama "A Star Is Born", a remake of the 1937 film of the same name. The film follows Ally's relationship with singer Jackson Maine (played by Cooper), which becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his. Cooper approached Gaga after seeing her perform at a cancer research fundraiser; a fan of Cooper's work, Gaga agreed to the project due to its portrayal of addiction and depression. "A Star Is Born" premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival in August 2018, and was released worldwide in October. Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" described it as "outrageously watchable" and wrote that "Gaga's ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level". "Time" Stephanie Zacharek similarly highlighted her "knockout performance" and found her "charismatic" without her usual makeup, wigs and costumes. Alongside her nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild for Best Actress, Gaga received the Critics' Choice and National Board of Review awards for the role.
