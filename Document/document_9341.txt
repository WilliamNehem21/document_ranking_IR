In 1999 a consolidated research group from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum analyzed some known wrecks in the harbor and in 2000, RIMAP and the ANMM inspected a site that gives off an impression of being one of the barricade vessels, somewhat secured by a different wreck of a twentieth century scow. The more established remains were those of a wooden vessel of around a similar size, and conceivably a comparative plan and materials as "Ruler Sandwich" ex "Try". Affirmation that Cook's previous ship had surely been in Newport Harbor started open enthusiasm for finding her disaster area. Be that as it may, further mapping indicated eight other eighteenth century wrecks in Newport Harbor, some with highlights and conditions likewise steady with "Try". In 2006 RIMAP reported that the disaster areas were probably not going to be raised. In 2016 RIMAP reasoned that there was a likelihood of 80 to 100% that the disaster area of "Try" was still in Newport Harbor, presumably one of a bunch of five wrecks on the ocean bottom, and intended to explore the boats and their antiquities further. They were looking for assets to assemble offices for dealing with and putting away recuperated articles.
