Merriam divided his "palustris-mexicanus" group in two "series" according to the color of the underparts (white or fulvous). Goldman divided his "palustris" group in two "sections"âa "couesi" section with "O.Â couesi" and six related species, and a "palustris" section with "O.Â palustris" only. He noted that the latter differed from the former in the generally darker, more brownish, longer fur, and larger sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate). As Weksler's 2006 analysis included only "O.Â couesi" and the marsh rice rat among species of "Oryzomys" in the strict sense, he could not test those groups. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred with Goldman's division, listing additional characters, and noted that the "palustris" group may be more semiaquatically adapted than the members of the "couesi" group are. In the latter, the fur is usually reddish-brown, as opposed to grayish-brown in the "palustris" group. Members of the "couesi" group have smaller sphenopalatine vacuities and a smaller sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) in the side of the skull above the molars, and a more highly developed anterolabial cingulum on the third lower molar (a crest at the front of the tooth). The hypothenar pad of the hindfoot, located on the sole far from the fingers, is present in the "couesi" group, but absent in the "palustris" group. Interdigital webbing may be more highly developed in the "palustris" group. Using morphological data, Voss and Weksler found a closer relationship between "O.Â couesi" and "O.Â gorgasi" to the exclusion of "O.Â palustris", but with low confidence. The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the "palustris" and "couesi" groups, but a Costa Rican sample (assigned to "O.Â couesi") was about as distant from the two groups as they were from each other.
