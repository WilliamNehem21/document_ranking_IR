Chauvel was elevated to colonel in 1913. On 3 July 1914, he cruised for England with his significant other and three kids to supplant Colonel James Gordon Legge as the Australian delegate on the Imperial General Staff. While he was all the while voyaging, the First World War broke out. On announcing for obligation at the War Office in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a link guiding him to accept direction of the first Light Horse Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) when it touched base in the United Kingdom. Chauvel ended up worried about moderate advancement on development of the AIF's proposed quarters on the Salisbury Plain. He made regular visits to the site and had a Royal Australian Engineers officer, Major Cecil Henry Foott, designated to the neighborhood staff to protect Australian interests. Persuaded that the cabins would not be prepared on schedule, and that Australian troops would thusly need to spend a winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas, Chauvel influenced the High Commissioner for Australia in London, previous Prime Minister Sir George Reid, to approach Lord Kitchener with a substitute arrangement of redirecting the AIF to Egypt, which was finished. Joined by Major Thomas Blamey, Chauvel cruised for Egypt on the sea liner on 28 November 1914, touching base at Port Said on 10 December 1914.
