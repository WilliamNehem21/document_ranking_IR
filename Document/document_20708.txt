The spores are roughly spherical, thick-walled, 3â6Â Âµm in diameter (although some specimens collected in the US range from 7.2 to 9.5Â Âµm), and are covered with minute spines or warts. The use of scanning electron microscopy has revealed that these ornamentations on the spores are typically 0.95Â Âµm long. Spore ultrastructure is distinctive among "Calvatia" species, and has been used to help verify taxonomic groupings and confirm the status of species within the genus. The capillitia (coarse, thick-walled hyphae in the gleba) are septate, with branches that are narrowed towards the tips; they are 3â8Â Âµm in diameter. When grown in pure culture in the laboratory, "C.Â sculpta" is, under certain conditions, able to grow structures called "mycelial strands". These are linear aggregates of hyphae whereby older "leading" hyphae become enclosed by coiled layers of newer "tendril" hyphae. Mycelial strands provide a conduit for transporting water and nutrients across non-nutrient material, allowing the fungus to reach new sources of food. They are also implicated in the formation of fruit bodies and sclerotia. The mycelia of "C.Â sculpta" can be induced to form mycelial strands when there is a permeable physical barrier between it and the agar substrate. The wide hyphae in the center of the mycelial strands contain protein-dense structures on their cell walls that are shaped like a torus. Their function is unknown.
