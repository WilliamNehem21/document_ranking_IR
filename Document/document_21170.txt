By mid October 1998, York were placed eighth in the Second Division. They slipped to the bottom third of the table after winning one point from a possible 21. Despite improved results over Christmas, York played 11 consecutive matches without a win. In mid March 1999, the club was just above the bottom four places, when Little was dismissed and player-coach Neil Thompson appointed caretaker manager. A flurry of transfers, including the departure of leading scorer Richard Cresswell to Premier League club Sheffield Wednesday for a club-record fee of Â£950,000, followed. After losing away to Manchester City on the last day of 1998â99, York dropped into the bottom four for the first time that season, and were relegated in 21st place. The club's trading loss for the season was Â£483,096, despite a record profit of Â£1,274,202 from lucrative transfers. Club historian David Batters said, "the stark reality was that the club had to sell to survive". In July 1999, the club and its real property assets, including the ground, were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH) for Â£165,000. Thompson was dismissed in February 2000 after a run of one win from 12 matches during the middle of 1999â2000. Former Hull City manager Terry Dolan took over, and York finished the season in 20th place after conceding only five goals in the last 12 matches. Losses for the season were Â£667,255, and the wage bill of Â£1,635,736 was twice that of 1995.
