The 1220 carucage, which was forced on both laymen and ministry, was gathered by an extraordinary commission, and was paid not into the Exchequer, yet to the Templar Order church in London, the New Temple. The Templars through their global association worked as investors in and between nations. The three men named to the commissionÃ¢ÂÂWilliam de Halliwell, a monk, William FitzBenedict, a London inhabitant, and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth, an Exchequer assistantÃ¢ÂÂwere in charge of representing the cash got, which added up to ÃÂ£3,000. The time allotment of the 1220 carucage accumulation was very short; the requests for the evaluations to be made were issued in August, however required the assessment to be gathered by Michaelmas in late September. The 1220 duty endeavored to take into account variety in land esteems, exempting desolate land from tax collection. The framework for the 1220 appraisals was less difficult than the 1217 duty, as furrow groups were checked to decide the land measure as opposed to requiring promises from citizens. This assessment accumulated around ÃÂ£5,500. There was some trouble in its gathering in any case, as certain regions did not pay, and various aristocrats would not pay, in any event at first. The 1220 carucage was required to pay for the resistance of Henry's properties in Poitou, southern France.
