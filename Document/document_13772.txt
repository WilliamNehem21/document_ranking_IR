Right off the bat 29 December, the ONUC Air Division propelled an unexpected ambush on the Kolwezi landing strip. The J-29 warrior planes strafed with their 20mm guns, as their 13.5mm rockets were inoperable in the cloudy skies. Five fuel dumps and the neighborhood authoritative structure were decimated. Katangese Air Force Commander Jeremiah Puren had, in any case, figured out how to empty six Harvard mentors before the assault happened. Hired fighter Jan Zumbach stayed with the other part of the flying corps in Portuguese Angola and did not intercede, enraging Puren, who was requested by General Moke to fall back to Jadotville. For the remainder of the battle the majority of the Katangese Air Force remained grounded, as Puren dreaded his Harvards would perform ineffectively against the UN's quicker J-29 planes. Against flying machine fire harmed three UN planes at Kolwezi, however their assaults in any case proceeded for the duration of the day and were stretched out to other Katangese landing strips, for example, those at Kamatanda and Ngule. Three further UN surveillance missions brought about the obliteration of six Katangese flying machine on the ground and one further execute, perhaps noticeable all around. As indicated by the UN, the air attacks against the Kantangese Air Force were finished "without death toll" on either side. Obliterating such a large amount of the Katangese Air Force at the beginning of the activity was key for the UN to succeed; if Katanga had the capacity to dispatch composed air assaults against UN supply airdrops, Grandslam would almost certainly fall flat.
