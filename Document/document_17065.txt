For the next twenty-five years following "Guillaume Tell" Rossini composed little, although Gossett comments that his comparatively few compositions from the 1830s and 1840s show no falling-off in musical inspiration. They include the "SoirÃ©es musicales" (1830â1835: a set of twelve songs for solo or duet voices and piano) and his Stabat Mater (begun in 1831 and completed in 1841). After winning his fight with the government over his annuity in 1835 Rossini left Paris and settled in Bologna. His return to Paris in 1843 for medical treatment by Jean Civiale sparked hopes that he might produce a new grand opera â it was rumoured that EugÃ¨ne Scribe was preparing a libretto for him about Joan of Arc. The OpÃ©ra was moved to present a French version of "Otello" in 1844 which also included material from some of the composer's earlier operas. It is unclear to what extent â if at all â Rossini was involved with this production, which was in the event poorly received. More controversial was the "pasticcio" opera of "Robert Bruce" (1846), in which Rossini, by then returned to Bologna, closely cooperated by selecting music from his past operas which had not yet been performed in Paris, notably "La donna del lago." The OpÃ©ra sought to present "Robert" as a new Rossini opera. But although "Othello" could at least claim to be genuine, canonic, Rossini, the historian Mark Everist notes that detractors argued that "Robert" was simply "fake goods, and from a bygone era at that"; he cites ThÃ©ophile Gautier regretting that "the lack of unity could have been masked by a superior performance; unfortunately the tradition of Rossini's music was lost at the OpÃ©ra a long time ago."
