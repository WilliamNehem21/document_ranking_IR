On October 6, 2012, Amaker was enlisted into his secondary school's debut corridor of distinction class. Amaker's 2012Ã¢ÂÂ 13 Harvard group entered the season influenced by the 2012 Harvard conning embarrassment. Rather than being the most loved as initially expected, the group was anticipated to complete second to Princeton by different media sources on the grounds that Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry pulled back because of the embarrassment. Casey and Curry had been first-group and second-group All-Ivy determinations for the 2011Ã¢ÂÂ 12 Ivy League men's ball season, separately. The two players pulled back with expectations of protecting their last year of athletic qualification following the examination. Amid the season, the group vanquished Boston College its fifth continuous triumph against Boston College Eagles men's ball, making Amaker an ideal 6Ã¢ÂÂ 0 against the Atlantic Coast Conference. The 2012Ã¢ÂÂ 13 Harvard group conquered the withdrawal of its senior co-commanders to rehash as 2013 Ivy League champions, which earned Harvard a trek to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. On March 21, fourteenth seeded Harvard earned the school's first NCAA Tournament triumph by a 68Ã¢ÂÂ 62 edge and its first triumph over a main 10 adversary when it crushed third seeded New Mexico (#10 AP Poll Ã¢ÂÂ #10 Coaches' Poll). Two evenings later, Harvard lost to Arizona 74Ã¢ÂÂ 51. Following the season, Amaker was accepted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2013. Amaker won the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (NSSA) Clarence "Enormous House" Gaines College Basketball Coach of the Year in Division I as the top minority mentor, the NABC Coach of the Year for District 13 and was again a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award. In August, Amaker was drafted into his fourth Hall of Fame (Washington Metro Basketball Hall of Fame).
