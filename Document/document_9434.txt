Manetho's "Aegyptiaca" doles out Neferirkare a rule of 20 years, yet the archeological proof currently proposes this is an overestimate. To start with, the harmed Palermo Stone jam "the time of the fifth steers tally" for Neferirkare's time on the position of authority. The cows check was an essential occasion gone for assessing the measure of expenses to be collected on the populace. By the rule of Neferirkare, this included tallying cows, bulls and little domesticated animals. This occasion is accepted to have been biennial amid the Old Kingdom time frame, that is happening once at regular intervals, implying that Neferirkare ruled no less than ten years. Given the state of the Palermo stone, this record must relate to his last year or be near it, with the goal that he governed close to eleven years. This is additionally substantiated by two cursive engravings left by bricklayers on stone squares from the pyramids of Khentkaus II and Neferirkare, the two of which likewise date to Neferirkare's fifth dairy cattle check, its most noteworthy known regnal year. At last, Verner has called attention to that a 20-year-long rule would be hard to accommodate with the incomplete condition of his pyramid in Abusir.
