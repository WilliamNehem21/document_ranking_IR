TÃÂ¸jner portrays the work as "Lichtenstein's best detailing of a counter-picture to the numerous blasts in his universe", noticing that the show is past its pinnacle in spite of the fact that it might appear to be at a crescendo. He likewise takes note of that "the tears are drawn with great Lichtenstein waxy completion" regardless of the encompassing water, which must be huge since "naturalistic defense" is missing. A November 1963 "Craftsmanship Magazine" survey expressed this was one of the "wide and incredible works of art" of the 1963 show at Castelli's Gallery. In any case, the name of the work was not generally known. In a December 1964 "Workmanship Magazine" audit of his October 24ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery appear, Lichtenstein was alluded to as the creator of "I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink" ("Drowning Girl"). As indicated by Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a "poetics of the absolutely dull, of uprooted commonness" bringing about a "picture solidified in reality", making it "notorious". Contrasting this with the source, Garrels says it is a rendering "in an improved vocabulary" created while Lichtenstein set aside his mechanical objectivity. As per "The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art", extraordinary instances of his formalization become "virtual reflection" when the watcher reviews that the theme is a component of a bigger work. In this manner, Lichtenstein strengthened a non-pragmatist perspective on funny cartoons and commercials, showing them as counterfeit pictures with moderate realistic strategies. Lichtenstein's amplification of his source material focused on the modesty of his themes as a proportional to mechanical business drawing, prompting suggestions about his announcements on present day modern America. Regardless, Lichtenstein seems to have acknowledged the American entrepreneur modern culture.
