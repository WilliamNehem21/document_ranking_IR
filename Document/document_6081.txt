The stone was at that point in a destroyed state when Rogberg portrayed the stone in 1763. Rogberg noticed that it had been utilized as a scaffold over a rivulet and as a result of this the runes had been worn out so much that a large portion of them were basically indecipherable, an explanation that is repudiated by later delineations. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the seventeenth century, all things considered, it was utilized as an extension. In an explorer's diary written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the base piece of the stone is delineated out of the blue, however the craftsman does not seem to have understood that the two sections had a place together. In 1822, Liljegren touched base to portray it. An enduring yet unsigned attracting is credited to Liljegren ("see representation"). In 1922, the runologist Kinander gained from a nearby rancher that somewhere in the range of 40 years sooner, the runestone had been seen walled into a scaffold that was a piece of the nation street, and the engraving had been upwards. Somebody had chosen to expel the runestone from the extension and put it alongside the street. Kinander needed to see the stone and was appeared huge worn out stone in the patio nursery of Eriksstad. Be that as it may, as indicated by Kinander it was impractical to locate any outstanding runes on what should be the runestone.
