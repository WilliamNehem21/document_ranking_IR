In 2011, Murphy performed in the stage monodrama "Misterman", written and directed by Enda Walsh, whom Murphy previously worked with on "Disco Pigs". The production was initially put on in Galway and
was then taken to St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. Murphy commented of the role, "The live nature of it makes it so dangerous. You're only there because of the good will of the audience, and that's compounded by its being a one-man show". His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Award and a Drama Desk Award. Sarak Lyall of the "International Herald Tribune" described Murphy's character Thomas Magill to be a "complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at allÂ â deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code", praising his ability to mimic wickedly. Lyall noted Murphy's "unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show "Misterman"", and documented that on one evening the "theater was flooded, not with applause but with silence", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance. He played the lead in the British horror film "Retreat" (2011), which had a limited release. He also appeared in the science fiction film "In Time" (2011), starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, which was poorly reviewed.
