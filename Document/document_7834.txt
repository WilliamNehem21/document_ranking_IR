Following his increase to the position of authority, Ramesses VI and his court may have visited Thebes on the event of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley or the Opet Festival, accompanying with the arrangements for Ramesses V's internment. Ramesses VI visited the city on in any event another event amid his rule, when he introduced his girl as Divine Adoratrice of Amun. The circumstance in the south of Egypt at the season of Ramesses VI's promotion was not by any means stable, as authenticated by records demonstrating that the laborers of Deir el-Bahari couldn't deal with the lord's tomb attributable to the nearness of "the adversary" in the region, a circumstance which happened over a time of no less than fifteen days amid Ramesses VI's first year on the honored position. This "foe" was supposed to have plundered and consumed the region of Per-Nebyt and the head of the Medjay of ThebesÃ¢ÂÂbasically the policeÃ¢ÂÂrequested the laborers to stay inactive and watch the ruler's tomb. It is misty who these foes were, the term could assign gatherings of Libyan Meshwesh, Libu and Egyptian crooks, or as the Egyptologist Jaroslav ÃÂernÃÂ½ guessed, an out and out common war between adherents of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, a speculation bolstered by Rice yet which has been unequivocally dismissed by Kitchen and, to a lesser reach out, by Grimal and van Dijk.
