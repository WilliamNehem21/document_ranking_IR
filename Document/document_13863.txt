Meeker spent piece of the winter of 1895Ã¢ÂÂ 1896 in London, recovering what he could from his interests there. In 1896, gold was found both in Alaska and in Canada, and when Meeker came back from the United Kingdom, he discovered his children, Marion and Fred, getting ready to leave for Cook Inlet, Alaska. They discovered all the beneficial cases had just been taken. All things considered, the Meeker family observed the finds as a conceivable street to money related recuperation, and established an organization to purchase and sell mining claims, however they thought minimal about the exchange. In 1897, Meeker and his children ventured to the Kootenay nation of southeastern British Columbia, where gold had been found. Notwithstanding the reality Meeker was matured 66, he attempted a full offer of the work. Both Meeker children recorded cases in Canada, yet the mines required extra venture. Meeker fund-raised to make a trip to New York to talk with his old contacts, where he got a bigger number of guarantees than money. On the arrival leg he neglected to fund-raise in visits in Illinois and Minneapolis and by July 1897, he was, thinking back to the Kootenays, working the case. At the point when the gold disclosure in the Klondike in northwestern Canada was exposed that year, Meeker saw that as a superior chance, and sent his child Fred to explore. Fred Meeker came back with a report in November; the Meekers tried to fund a mining undertaking to the Klondike, yet neglected to collect satisfactory cash from speculators.
