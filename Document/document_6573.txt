Amid the dÃÂ©tente of 1206Ã¢ÂÂ 1208, John concentrated on structure up his money related and military assets in anticipation of another endeavor to recover Normandy. John utilized a portion of this cash to pay for new collusions on Philip's eastern wildernesses, where the development in Capetian power was starting to concern France's neighbors. By 1212 John had effectively finished up unions with his nephew Otto IV, a contender for the crown of Holy Roman Emperor in Germany, just as with the checks Renaud of Boulogne and Ferdinand of Flanders. The intrusion plans for 1212 were delayed as a result of crisp English baronial agitation about administration in Poitou. Philip caught the activity in 1213, sending his senior child, Louis, to attack Flanders with the aim of next propelling an intrusion of England. John was compelled to delay his own intrusion intends to counter this danger. He propelled his new armada to assault the French at the harbor of Damme. The assault was a triumph, pulverizing Philip's vessels and any odds of an intrusion of England that year. John planned to abuse this preferred standpoint by attacking himself late in 1213, however baronial discontent again deferred his intrusion plans until mid 1214, in what was his last Continental battle.
