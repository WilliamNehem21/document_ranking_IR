Following Queen Alexandra's demise at Sandringham on 20 November 1925, the King and his family moved to the primary house. In 1932, George V gave the first of the regal Christmas messages from a studio raised at Sandringham. The discourse, composed by Rudyard Kipling, started, "I talk now from my home and from my heart to all of you". George V kicked the bucket in his room at Sandringham at 11.55 p.m. on 20 January 1936, his demise hurried by infusions of morphine and cocaine, to keep up the King's pride and to empower the declaration of his passing to be made in the next day's "Times". The King's body was moved to St Mary Magdalene's Church, a scene depicted by the late King's associate private secretary, "Tommy" Lascelles. "Next night we took him over to the little church toward the finish of the greenhouse. We saw the lych-door splendidly lit (and) the watchmen threw the pine box on their shoulders and laid it before the special stepped area. After a short administration, we left it, to be looked out for by the men of the Sandringham Estate." after two days, George's body was transported via train from Wolferton to London, and to its lying in state at Westminster Hall.
