Chandler had been disappointed with the sound quality at De Lane Lea, so he accepted the guidance of Kit Lambert and booked time at CBS Studios. On December 13, 1966, in the wake of taking a five-week break from account while they performed in Europe, the Experience reconvened at CBS. Helped by specialist Mike Ross, the band were particularly gainful amid the session, recording instrumentation and vocals for "Saucy Lady" and essential instrumental tracks for "Adoration or Confusion", "Would you be able to See Me", and "Third Stone from the Sun". Ross reviewed the effect of Hendrix's Marshall stacks: "It was so noisy you couldn't remain in the studioÃÂ ... I'd never heard anything like it in my life." When Ross asked Hendrix where he might want the amplifier set Hendrix answered: "Goodness, man, simply put a mic around twelve feet away on the opposite side of the studio. It'll sound incredible." Ross concurred, and with a Neumann U87 tube mic he recorded Hendrix's guitar playing in a huge room that, as indicated by Ross, "was completely indispensable to the extraordinarily amazing Experience sound." Ross noticed that contribution from Mitchell and Redding was limited, and he affirmed that Chandler was unmistakably "the one in control" of the sessions. The band played together live at CBS; the lead and reinforcement vocals were overdubbed. Regardless of his decreasing accounts, Chandler urged the Experience to record various takes of a tune, managing them the advantage of rehashed endeavors at an agreeable chronicle. With a live instrument track as the establishment of the chronicles, they shunned the regular routine with regards to sorting out pieces of a few takes to make one consistent piece. After the December 13 recording session, the band made their TV debut, on Britain's "Prepared Steady Go!"
