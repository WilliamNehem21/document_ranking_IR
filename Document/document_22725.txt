In 1944 Bodley published "Wind in the Sahara". By 1949 the book was in its seventh edition and had been translated into eight different languages. In 1945 he wrote the satirical novel "The Gay Deserters", which was inspired by his flight from the German army. It was not well received; Robert Pick from the "Saturday Review" wrote "it isn't even humorous at all". Bodley later said that his talents as a writer lay in non-fiction, adding that of "the many novels (...) and several plays [he] had written, four were published and two produced, and all failed to arouse any interest." He wrote an essay entitled "I Lived in the Garden of Allah", which was included in Dale Carnegie's 1948 self-help book "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living". In 1953 he wrote "The Warrior Saint", a biography on Charles de Foucauld. John Cogley from "The New York Times" said Bodley had "written a clean, poetic and frankly admiring account" of Foucauld's life. In 1955 he wrote the partly-autobiographical self-help book "In Search of Serenity". Elsie Robinson from "The Index-Journal" and Phyllis Battle from the "Tipton Tribune" gave favourable reviews, with Robinson calling it "a must for every rasped spirit". His next and final book, "The Soundless Sahara", was published in 1968; according to the book's back cover he spent part of his years living in Massachusetts, and the rest in either England or France. He provided information for the book "The Secret Lives of Lawrence of Arabia", by Phillip Knightley and Colin Simpson, which was published by Thomas Nelson in 1969. He died on 26 May 1970 in a nursing home in Bramley, Surrey.
