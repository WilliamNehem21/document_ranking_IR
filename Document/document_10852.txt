Gary Mulholland of "The Observer" considers the arrival of "Is This It" a "world-evolving minute" and notes that its effect was "prompt and emotional" on both music and clothing. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe recommends that the collection moved well known supposition from DJs and popular music to "thin pants and guitars", "the layout for shake 'n' come in the present day". Cap Gunn of "Truth" concurs and clarifies that it "caused an ocean change" in standard music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus calls attention to that the Strokes' prosperity made the business setting for "other new-falters" to thrive. "Moving Stone" composes that "Is This It" roused "a battered revolt" in Britain, driven by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and proceeded with its impact in the US on the achievement of groups like Kings of Leon. "The Observer" shares a comparative view and reasons that "a fine brood of beneficiaries", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been fruitful if the Strokes had not revived "shake's fixation on having a decent time". Jared Followill of Kings of Leon noticed that the collection was one of the primary reasons that he needed to get into a band; he expresses, "The title track was one of the first basslines I learnedÃÂ ... I was only 15 at the time."
