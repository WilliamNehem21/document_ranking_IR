A large portion of the impostors were expelled; be that as it may, Anna Anderson's case endured. Books and leaflets supporting her cases included Harriet von Rathlef's book "Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe" ("Anastasia, a Woman's Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe"), which was distributed in Germany and Switzerland in 1928, however it was serialized by the newspaper paper "Berliner Nachtausgabe" in 1927. This was countered by works, for example, "La Fausse Anastasie" ("The False Anastasia") by Pierre Gilliard and Constantin Savitch, distributed by Payot of Paris in 1929. Clashing declarations and physical proof, for example, examinations of facial attributes, which on the other hand upheld and negated Anderson's case, were utilized either to reinforce or to counter the conviction that she was Anastasia. Without any immediate narrative confirmation or strong physical proof, the topic of whether Anderson was Anastasia was for some a matter of individual conviction. As Anderson herself said in her own informal English, "You either trust it or you don't trust it. It doesn't make a difference. In no in any case at all." The German courts were unfit to choose her case somehow, and in the long run, following 40 years of consultation, decided that her case was "neither built up nor discredited". Dr. GÃÂ¼nter von Berenberg-Gossler, lawyer for Anderson's adversaries in the later long stretches of the lawful case, said that amid the German preliminaries "the press were in every case increasingly keen on revealing her side of the story than the contradicting seat's less impressive viewpoint; editors frequently pulled writers in the wake of announcing declaration conveyed close by and overlooked the rejoinder, bringing about the open only occasionally getting a total picture."
