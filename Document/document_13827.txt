The houses enable understudies to live helpfully with each other by sharing normally planned house tasks, taking an interest in the choice procedure, and, in a few, sharing the cooking obligations. Every unit houses a gathering of 10Ã¢ÂÂ 17 understudies, and is sorted out to advance a typical subject, generally shown by the center's name. As of the 2017Ã¢ÂÂ 2018 scholarly year, the SLUs comprise of The Peace and Justice House, The Citizens of the World House, The Sexuality and Gender Equality House, The House of Linguistic Diversity, The House of Spiritual Athletes, The Tree House, and The Interfaith House. The University possesses these houses; the communities, in this way, must pursue the University's living strategies. The centers do, in any case, choose their very own individuals and don't have Resident Advisers or staff in home like other on-grounds habitation corridors. They have a House Moderator who is chosen by Residential Life and experiences a similar preparing as a Resident Advisor. Toward the finish of each timetable year, each current and potential community must present a house proposition portraying its arrangements for topic advancement for the following scholastic year. The University Housing office places communities in houses each year on an aggressive premise. What's more the school offers Theme Houses, which don't need to experience the reestablishment procedure. They incorporate the Honors House (HoHo) and House of Black Culture.
