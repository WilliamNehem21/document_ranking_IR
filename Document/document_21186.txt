By mid February 2001, York were bottom of the Third Division table, but after losing only two of their last 16 matches they finished 2000â01 in 17th. They reached the FA Cup third round for the second time since 1986, but were beaten 3â0 by Premier League team Leicester City at Filbert Street. Record losses of Â£1,261,038 were reported in November 2001, before Craig announced in December that the club and the ground had been put up for sale for Â£4.5Â million. Craig later said Bootham Crescent would close by June 2002, and the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. The club was taken over by motor racing driver John Batchelor in March 2002. He pledged to give the Supporters' Trust (ST) two seats on the board and announced a sponsorship deal with Persimmon that would see an undisclosed amount split between the club and his racing team. By late March 2002, York were second from bottom, before a run of five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish 2001â02 in 14th place. They reached the FA Cup fourth round for the first time since 1986, losing 2â0 at home to Premier League team Fulham.
