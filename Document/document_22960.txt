Siward died more than a decade before the death of Edward the Confessor, but despite this the "Domesday Book" recorded 4 manors, 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire, owned directly by Earl Siward in 1066, all of them subsequently held by Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester. This land was stated to have been worth Â£212, while his son Waltheof was said to have held Â£136 worth of land across 9 counties. Domesday records give an incomplete picture of Siward's holdings. In total it recorded property worth Â£348 for Siward and his son, which on its own would compare poorly with the Â£2493 in value recorded to have been held by the family of the earls of Mercia. Of the latter, however, Morcar of Mercia, Earl of Northumbria on the day of King Edward's death, possessed land worth Â£968, while Tostig, exiled earl at the time, had land worth Â£491; both may have come into possession of some of Siward's land in the course of becoming Earls of Northumbria. Moreover, the counties that would become Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were largely omitted from the survey, while, besides being only very poorly documented, the lands in Yorkshire had been severely devastated and devalued during the Harrying of the North.
