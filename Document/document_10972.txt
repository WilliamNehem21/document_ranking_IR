Following the New York show, music faultfinder Alex Ross tweeted: "Triumphant Carnegie debut for the Oregon Symphony - best of Spring for Music up until now. Articulate Sylvan, unstable Vaughan Williams." On his blog, "The Rest Is Noise", Ross called the Symphony's execution "uncommon", a standout amongst the "most holding occasions of the ebb and flow season". In his two-page survey of Spring for Music for "The New Yorker", Ross dedicated more inclusion to the Oregon Symphony than the other included outfits and considered "Music for a Time of War" the celebration's highpoint. He complimented the ensemble for playing with "controlled power" and said of Symphony No. 4: "The Oregonians' angry version of that ensemble would have been amazing in any specific situation, yet as the capstone to a splendidly worked-out program it had breaking power." The survey contained an outline of Kalmar, "hair flying what not". Sedgwick Clark of "Melodic America" called the ensemble's execution of the Williams piece "emphatically burning ... with intrepid edge-of-situate temposÃÂ ... amazingly consulted by all." After Clark's survey was distributed, Ross posted on his blog that he and Clark agreed: the Symphony's execution was the most "astounding" of the period. Ross incorporated the Symphony's show on his rundown of the most critical traditional exhibitions of 2011. Allan Kozinn, music faultfinder for "The New York Times", considered the program "tormented" and "intriguing", and composed that Sylvan performed with his "trademark keenness". He called the woodwind and metal playing in "Sinfonia da Requiem" "great", explicitly featuring the "pointed" percussion in "Bites the dust Irae" and the "unpleasant" string tone in "Composition Aeternam". Like Ross, Kozinn thought Symphony No. 4 was performed "with an enraged, combustible vitality" that made a perfect completion of the program.
