The armada was back in Kiel by 15 August, where arrangements for the harvest time moves started. On 22Ã¢ÂÂ 24 August, the armada participated in landing practices in EckernfÃÂ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The moves were delayed from 31 August to 3 September when the armada facilitated vessels from Denmark and Sweden, alongside a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The moves continued on 8 September and kept going five more days. The ship took an interest in the uneventful winter journey into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The principal quarter of 1907 pursued the past example and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-assigned the High Seas Fleet. From the finish of May to early June the armada went on its mid year voyage in the North Sea, coming back to the Baltic by means of the Kattegat. This was trailed by the ordinary journey to Norway from 12 July to 10 August, after which the armada led the yearly harvest time moves, which kept going from 26 August to 6 September. The activities included landing practices in northern Schleswig with IX Corps. On 1 October 1907, "Konteradmiral" ("KAdm"Ã¢ÂÂ Rear Admiral) Ludwig von SchrÃÂ¶der got on "Preussen", assuming responsibility for the squadron, as Fischel had turned into the head of the "Marinestation der Nordsee" (Naval Station of the North Sea). The winter preparing voyage went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November.
