In June 1985, the first USA for Africa cargo jet carrying food, medicine, and clothing departed for Ethiopia and Sudan. It stopped "en route" in New York, where 15,000Â T-shirts were added to the cargo. Included in the supplies were high-protein biscuits, high-protein vitamins, medicine, tents, blankets and refrigeration equipment. Harry Belafonte, representing the USA for Africa musicians, visited Sudan in the same month. The trip was his last stop on a four-nation tour of Africa. Tanzanian Prime Minister Salim Ahmed Salim greeted and praised Belafonte, telling him, "I personally and the people of Tanzania are moved by this tremendous example of human solidarity."
One year after the release of "We Are the World", organizers noted that $44.5Â million had been raised for USA for Africa's humanitarian fund. They stated that they were confident that they would reach an initial set target of $50Â million (equivalent to $ million in 2019). By October 1986, it was revealed that their $50Â million target had been met and exceeded; CBS Records gave USA for Africa a check for $2.5Â million, drawing the total amount of money to $51.2Â million. USA for Africa's Hands Across America event had also raised a significant amount of moneyâapproximately $24.5Â million for the hungry in the US.
