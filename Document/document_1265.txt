It is conceivable that a gathering of Greek aerobatic entertainers, who professed to be from a spot "west of the oceans" (Roman Egypt, which the "Book of the Later Han" identified with the Daqin realm), were introduced by a lord of Burma to Emperor An of Han in 120 AD. It is realized that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks kept on being utilized after the Hellenistic time frame as performers and competitors. The "Book of the Later Han" expresses that Emperor An exchanged these performers from his field habitation to the capital Luoyang, where they gave an exhibition at his court and were compensated with gold, silver, and different blessings. Raoul McLaughlin noticed that the Romans knew Burma as "India Trans Gangem" (India Beyond the Ganges) and that Ptolemy recorded the urban communities of Burma. McLaughlin estimates that the Romans were pitching captives to the Burmese and this is the means by which the performers initially achieved Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China. Syrian performers were eminent in Western Classical writing, and Chinese sources from the second century BC to the second century AD notice them also.
