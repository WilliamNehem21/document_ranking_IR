By late February, Breckinridge inferred that the Confederate reason was miserable. Appointing the everyday activities of his office to his right hand, John Archibald Campbell, he started laying the basis for surrender. Davis wanted to proceed with the battle, yet Breckinridge asked, "This has been a grand epic. In God's name let it not end in sham." On April 2, Lee sent a wire to Breckinridge advising him that he would need to pull back from his position that night, and this would require the departure of Richmond. Requesting Campbell to sort out the trip of the Confederate bureau to Danville, Virginia, Breckinridge stayed in the city to regulate the demolition of offices and supplies to keep their utilization by the attacking government powers. All the while, he guaranteed that the Confederate files, both government and military, were caught flawless by the Union powers, guaranteeing that a full record of the Confederate war exertion would be saved for history. Upon his exit from the city, he requested that the extensions over the James River be singed. His child Clifton, at that point serving in the Confederate Navy at Richmond, surrendered his post and joined his dad as he moved southward to meet Davis.
