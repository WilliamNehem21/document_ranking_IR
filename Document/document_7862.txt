Amid the period when Garrow filled in as a counselor, the sugar grower of the West Indies held a lot of intensity in Parliament, enabling them to keep up an imposing business model on the advertising of sugar in England that brought extraordinary benefits. This industry was to a great extent gainful because of the utilization of slave work, to which Garrow had for some time been contradicted; when the sugar grower offered him a vocation dealing with the majority of their lawful and political business, he answered that "if your board would give me their entire livelihoods, and every one of their bequests, I would not be viewed as the backer of practices which I despise, and a framework which I hate". In 1806 Thomas Picton, the Governor of Trinidad, was accused of a solitary check of "making torment be unlawfully delivered" on a youthful free mulatto young lady; he was brought under the steady gaze of the Court of King's Bench under Lord Ellenborough. The court records raced to 367 pages, and Garrow was profoundly included as arraigning counsel; in reality, his opening discourse on 24 February 1806 is considered by Braby to be a standout amongst his best. The case fixated on whether Spanish law, which permitted torment, was still essentially at the season of the occurrence. The jury in the end concluded that it was not, and Ellenborough discovered Picton liable. Picton's guidance mentioned a retrial, which was allowed; the jury in the second preliminary in the end chose that Picton was guiltless.
