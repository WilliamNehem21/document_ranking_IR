At Ambohimanga, as in other rova destinations, the cardinal and vertical format of these different customary parts encapsulates two cosmological ideas of room that existed together in conventional Imerina. The more established framework represented sociopolitical request and depended on the idea of the four cardinal focuses emanating from a binding together focus. A later framework presented through the soothsaying of nautical Arabs administered the otherworldly request and put exceptional noteworthiness on the upper east. The sacrosanct eastern segments of Ambohimanga contained structures related with the reverence of the predecessors, including the illustrious tombs, bowls of blessed water utilized in imperial customs, and various "Ficus" and "Draceana" trees, which were representative of eminence. The northern segment of the site is the area of a yard where imperial decisions were passed on from on a conspicuous stone rock, in accordance with the Malagasy relationship between the northern cardinal point, manliness, and political power. The places of the illustrious spouses were once in the past situated in the southern segment of the site, a cardinal point generally connected with womanliness and otherworldly power. These contending cosmological frameworks are likewise reflected in the situation of the city's fundamental entryways at cardinal focuses, just as the northeastern doors saved for use by the sovereign and committed to their job in consecrated ceremonies.
