Batygin and Brown likewise discovered that the circles of the six eTNOs with semi-significant tomahawks more prominent than 250 AU and perihelia past 30 AU (Sedna, , and ) were adjusted in space with their perihelia in generally a similar heading, bringing about a bunching of their longitudes of perihelion, the area where they make their nearest ways to deal with the Sun. The circles of the six items were additionally tilted concerning that of the ecliptic and around coplanar, creating a grouping of their longitudes of climbing hubs, the headings where they each ascent through the ecliptic. They confirmed that there was just a 0.007% probability that this blend of arrangements was because of possibility. These six items had been found by six diverse studies on six distinct telescopes. That made it more uncertain that the bunching may be because of a perception inclination, for example, pointing a telescope at a specific piece of the sky. The watched bunching ought to be spread out in a couple of hundred million years because of the areas of the perihelia and the rising hubs changing, or precessing, at contrasting rates because of their fluctuated semi-real tomahawks and unconventionalities. \frac{1}{(1-e^2)^2}\sum_{k=5}^8 \frac{m_k a_k^2}{M a^2}cos^2(i)</math>
