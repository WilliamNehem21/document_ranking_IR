Despite the fact that "Savior" isn't in a specific key, Handel's tonal plan has been abridged by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as "a goal towards D major", the key musically connected with light and wonder. As the oratorio pushes ahead with different moves in key to reflect changes in mind-set, D major rises at huge focuses, principally the "trumpet" developments with their inspiring messages. It is the key in which the work achieves its triumphant completion. Without an overwhelming key, other incorporating components have been proposed. For instance, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has recommended that Handel utilized the gadget of the "rising fourth" as a binding together theme; this gadget most perceptibly happens in the initial two notes of "I realize that my Redeemer liveth" and on various different events. All things considered, Luckett discovers this proposal unrealistic, and states that "the solidarity of "Savior" is a result of nothing more arcane than the nature of Handel's consideration regarding his content, and the consistency of his melodic creative energy". Allan Kozinn, "The New York Times" music faultfinder, finds "a model marriage of music and textÃÂ ... From the delicate falling tune appointed to the opening words ("Comfort ye") to the sheer excitement of the "Glory be" melody and the fancy celebratory contrast that bolsters the end "So be it", scarcely a line of content passes by that Handel does not enhance".
