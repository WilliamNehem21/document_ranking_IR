Locals fused the characteristic highlights of the ridgeline and encompassing topography into their otherworldly conviction frameworks. Numerous Native American stories were thus joined into territorial pilgrim legends. The goliath stone soul Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a noticeable figure in numerous accounts, was credited with redirecting the course of the Connecticut River where it all of a sudden swings east in Middletown, Connecticut, after a few hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is likewise credited with killing a monster human-eating beaver who lived in an extraordinary lake that existed in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. As per local convictions as retold by European pilgrims, the carcass of the beaver stays obvious as the Pocumtuck Ridge bit of the Metacomet Ridge. Afterward, after Hobbomuck occupied the course of the Connecticut River, he was rebuffed to rest everlastingly as the unmistakable man-like type of the Sleeping Giant, some portion of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There is by all accounts a component of logical truth in a portion of these stories. For example, the incredible lake that the monster beaver was said to have possessed might just have been the post-frigid Lake Hitchcock, surviving 10,000 years prior; the mammoth beaver may have been a real ancient types of bearÃ¢ÂÂ measured beaver, "Castoroides ohioensis", that inhabited that time. Numerous highlights of the Metacomet Ridge district still bear names with Native American sources: Besek, Pistapaug, Coginchaug, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Totoket, Norwottuck, Hockanum, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, and others.
