"Remain in Light" features new wave, post-punk, worldbeat, dance-rock, and different types of funk, specifically afrofunk and avant-funk. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as a "dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics." It contains eight songs that possess a "striking free-associative feel" according to psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog, in that there is no long-lasting coherent thought process that can be followed in the stream-of-consciousness lyrics. David Gans instructed Byrne to be freer with his lyrical content by advising him that "rational thinking has its limits". The frontman included a bibliography with the album press kit along with a statement that explained how the album was inspired by African mythologies and rhythms. The release stressed that the major inspiration to the lyrics was Professor John Miller Chernoff's "African Rhythm and African Sensibility", which examined the musical enhancement of life in the continent's rural communities. The academic travelled to Ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how Africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns. One of the songs, "The Great Curve", exemplifies the African theme by including the line "The world moves on a woman's hips", which Byrne used after reading Professor Robert Farris Thompson's book "African Art in Motion". He additionally studied straight speech, from John Dean's Watergate testimony to the stories of African American former slaves.
