By January 1956 the author Ian Fleming had published three novelsâ"Casino Royale" in 1953, "Live and Let Die" in 1954 and "Moonraker" in 1955. A fourth, "Diamonds Are Forever", was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write "From Russia, with Love". He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in "Books and Bookmen" magazine: "I write for about three hours in the morningÂ ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have writtenÂ ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: "My muse is in a very bad wayÂ ... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." Fleming re-wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted.
