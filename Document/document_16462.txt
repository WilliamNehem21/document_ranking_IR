From the time that he had taken over as chief of the SS-HA, Berger had made considerable efforts to increase the amount of ideological training received by "Waffen-SS" personnel. In February 1943, in the wake of the German losses at Stalingrad, Berger again told Himmler that the SS needed stronger ideological training. As a result, the SS-HA issued a series of pamphlets on racial ideology, including "Der Untermensch" (The Sub-Human), which described certain peoples as spiritually and mentally lower than animals. Himmler and Berger also hosted representatives from the Wehrmacht who were keen to learn from SS expertise in ideological indoctrination. On 13 February, following an approach from "ReichsjugendfÃ¼hrer" (German Youth Leader) Artur Axmann for a "Waffen-SS" division to be raised from the Hitler Youth, Berger and Axmann were told the idea had been approved by Hitler and that they could commence planning. Berger implored Himmler to appoint him as the commander of this new division, but the "Reichsfuhrer" demurred, telling Berger not to be impatient. Also in February, Berger complained to Himmler that the dispersal of "Germanic" volunteers throughout the "Waffen-SS" was having significant negative effects on the recruiting of replacements in the occupied countries. In March 1943, "Wiking" was also upgraded to a panzergrenadier division.
