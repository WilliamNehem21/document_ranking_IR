While his therapy proceeded, Tippett was searching for a theme for a major workâan opera or an oratorioâthat could reflect both the contemporary turmoil in the world and his own recent catharsis. Having briefly considered the theme of the Dublin Easter Rising of 1916, he based his work on a more immediate event: the murder in Paris of a German diplomat by a 17-year-old Jewish refugee, Herschel Grynszpan. This murder triggered "Kristallnacht" (Crystal Night), a coordinated attack on Jews and their property throughout Nazi Germany on 9â10 November 1938. Tippett hoped that Eliot would provide a libretto for the oratorio, and the poet showed interest. However, when Tippett presented him with a more detailed scenario, Eliot advised him to write his own text, suggesting that the poetic quality of the words might otherwise dominate the music. Tippett called the oratorio "A Child of Our Time", taking the title from "Ein Kind unserer Zeit", a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer ÃdÃ¶n von HorvÃ¡th. Within a three-part structure based on Handel's "Messiah", Tippett took the novel step of using North American spirituals in place of the traditional chorales that punctuate oratorio texts. According to Kenneth Gloag's commentary, the spirituals provide "moments of focus and reposeÂ ... giving shape to both the musical and literary dimensions of the work". Tippett began composing the oratorio in September 1939, on the conclusion of his dream therapy and immediately after the outbreak of war.
