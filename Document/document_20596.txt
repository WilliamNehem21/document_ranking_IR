The deteriorating international situation by 1933, typified by Germany's rearmament and the expansion of Japan and Italy, convinced the British to announce funds for the carrier's construction in the 1934 budget proposals. The plans were finished by November 1934 and were tendered in February 1935 to Cammell Laird and Company Ltd., which calculated the cost of the hull at Â£1,496,250 () and the main machinery at approximately Â£500,000 (equivalent to Â£31,850,000 in 2016). The overall cost was estimated to be over Â£3Â million, making "Ark Royal" the most expensive ship ordered by the Royal Navy. Construction began on Job No.Â 1012 when "Ark Royal"s keel was laid down on 16 September 1935.
"Ark Royal" spent nearly two years in the builder's yard before being launched on 13 April 1937 by Lady Maud Hoare, wife of Sir Samuel Hoare, then First Lord of the Admiralty.

The carrier spent a year fitting out, was handed over to her first commander, Captain Arthur Power, on 16 November 1938, and was commissioned on 16 December. Although intended for the Far East, events in Europe during the carrier's construction, including the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and the Spanish Civil War in 1936, caused the Admiralty to mark her for deployment with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. After her crew joined at the end of 1938, "Ark Royal" underwent sea trials to prepare for service, during which the carrier proved capable of sailing above her theoretical speed, reaching over and in trials during May 1938 "Ark Royal" achieved with at a deep displacement of .
