Another fleet advance followed on 18â20Â October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4Â November, "Prinzregent Luitpold" took part in an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boatsâ and âthat had become stranded there. The fleet was reorganized on 1Â December; the four "KÃ¶nig"-class battleships remained in IIIÂ Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five "Kaiser"-class ships, including "Prinzregent Luitpold", were transferred to IVÂ Squadron. "Prinzregent Luitpold" became the flagship of the new squadron. In the Wilhelmshaven Roads on 20Â January 1917, the ship struck a steel hawser that became entangled in the ship's starboard propeller. In March, "Friedrich der Grosse" was replaced as the fleet flagship by the newly commissioned battleship . "Friedrich der Grosse" in turn replaced "Prinzregent Luitpold" as the flagship of IVÂ Squadron. Steadily decreasing morale and discontent with rations provoked a series of small mutinies in the fleet. On 6Â June and 19Â July, stokers protested the low quality of the food they were given, and on 2Â August, some 800Â men went on a hunger strike. The ship's officers relented and agreed to form a "Menagekommission", a council that gave the enlisted men a voice in their ration selection and preparation. One of the ringleaders of the protests, however, was arrested and executed on 5Â September.
