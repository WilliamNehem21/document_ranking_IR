Precarious clarified "Maxinquaye"s title in a meeting with Simon Reynolds: "Quaye, that is this race of individuals in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that is my mum's name, Maxine, and I've quite recently taken the E off"; Reynolds translated this as a "place name" like the Rastafarian thought of Zion. In another source, Tricky was accounted for as saying Quaye had likewise been his mom's surname. As indicated by Greg Kot, his mom's name gave the collection its title while her suicide, alongside his dad forsaking him and Tricky's absence of good sense as an adolescent, educated his "unsentimental handle on the real world", which was reflected in "Maxinquaye"s "crash of magnificence and viciousness". In the supposition of "Stylus Magazine"s Kenan Hebert, who called it "a record of fixation, doubt, offense, solipsism, and sociopathy", the melodies managing useless sexual connections and dread of closeness were given a Freudian edge by his mom's impact on the collection, including Tricky's reference to her on "Fallout".

I didn't have any children thenÃÂ ... so what am I discussing? Who am I discussing? My motherÃÂ ... used to compose verse however in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any chance. It's practically similar to she slaughtered herself to give me the chance, my verses. I can never comprehend why I compose as a female, I think I have my mum's ability, I'm her vehicle. So I need a lady to sing that."
