Through Caldwell more officers joined the protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes and Squadron Leader John Waddy, as well as Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham. During a series of meetings early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign "en masse", and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position correctedÂ ... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up."
Arthur also attempted to secure Cobby's support for the protest. The commander of No.Â 1 TAF had been the Australian Flying Corps' leading ace in World WarÂ I, as Caldwell was the RAAF's in World WarÂ II. Arthur reasoned that, although Cobby was partly to blame for the morale issue, "we felt that his value to our move, because of his name with the Public, together with Group Captain Caldwell, would give us a very considerable amount of public supportÂ ...Â he was the prima donna of one war, andÂ ... arm-in-arm with the prima donna of the next war, we would put up a reasonable front and attract a lot of attention in the headlines of the newspapers." Cobby refused to join in and later claimed to be unaware of the depth of feeling among the pilots.
