"Australia" received a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt (76Â mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun on a high-angle Mark II mount that was added in March 1915. This had a maximum depression of 10Â° and a maximum elevation of 90Â°. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12â14 rounds per minute. It had a maximum effective ceiling of . It was provided with 500 rounds. The 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, and two aft guns were removed at the same time. An additional 4-inch gun was fitted in during 1917 as an AA gun. It was mounted on a Mark II high-angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60Â°. It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only ; 100 rounds were carried for it.
"Australia" received a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. "Australia" was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.
