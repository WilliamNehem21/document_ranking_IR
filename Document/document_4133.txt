l. As indicated by Pausanias, Demosthenes himself as well as other people had pronounced that the speaker had taken no piece of the cash that Harpalus brought from Asia. He likewise portrays the accompanying story: Shortly after Harpalus fled from Athens, he was killed by the hirelings who were going to him, however some affirm that he was killed. The steward of his cash fled to Rhodes, and was captured by a Macedonian officer, Philoxenus. Philoxenus continued to look at the slave, "until he got the hang of everything about, for example, had enabled themselves to take hush-money from Harpalus." He at that point sent a dispatch to Athens, in which he gave a rundown of the people who had accepted hush money from Harpalus. "Demosthenes, in any case, he never referenced by any means, in spite of the fact that Alexander held him in unpleasant disdain, and he himself had a private fight with him." On the other hand, Plutarch trusts that Harpalus sent Demosthenes a container with twenty abilities and that "Demosthenes couldn't avoid the allurement, however conceding the present, ... he surrendered himself up to the enthusiasm of Harpalus." Tsatsos shields Demosthenes' guiltlessness, yet Irkos Apostolidis underlines the hazardous character of the essential sources on this issueÃ¢ÂÂHypereides and Dinarchus were at the time Demosthenes' political adversaries and informersÃ¢ÂÂand states that, notwithstanding the rich catalog on Harpalus' case, present day grant has not yet figured out how to achieve a sheltered end on whether Demosthenes was paid off or not.
