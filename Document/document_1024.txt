The officer of the Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific, Lieutenant General George Kenney, mentioned in late August 1943 that the RAAF dispatch a squadron of plunge planes to New Guinea for use against pinpoint focuses in the Huon Gulf territory. No. 24 Squadron was chosen for this job, and its 18 Vengeances were hurried to Tsili Airfield before team preparing was finished. Little of the squadron's supporting gear was dispatched as it was proposed that the arrangement would be brief. In the wake of touching base at Tsili on 2 September, the squadron flew its first battle mission on the seventh of the month. This activity was baffled by terrible climate, and the flying machine nearly came up short on fuel on their arrival trip because of challenges in finding their runway. An assault the following day was fruitful. On 18 September, No. 24 Squadron dispatched 14 flying machine as a feature of an assault on Japanese positions close Finschhafen in anticipation of an arrival by Australian Army powers. The squadron annihilated a Japanese radio station on the Tami Islands close Finschhafen zone on 21 September. It offered help for Australian Army units associated with the Huon Peninsula crusade amid late September and October. This included assuming a huge job in ending a noteworthy Japanese counter-assault amid right on time to mid October.
