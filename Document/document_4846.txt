Rand expressed "Night of January sixteenth" in 1933. She was 28 and had been in the United States for a long time subsequent to emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her solid enemy of Communist feelings had put her in danger. Rand had never composed a phase play, however had worked in Hollywood as a lesser screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' closet office. In September 1932, Rand sold a unique screenplay, "Red Pawn", to Universal Studios and quit RKO to complete her first novel, "We the Living". She composed the stage play with the desire for profiting from it while completing her novel. By 1934 her operator was endeavoring to sell the play and the novel, however both were over and over rejected. "Red Pawn" was retired and Rand's agreement for revamps on it lapsed. Rand's better half, performer Frank O'Connor, was getting just minor jobs with little pay, leaving the couple in money related troubles. With the remainder of her cash from "Red Pawn" depleted, Rand got an idea for her new play from Al Woods, who had created "The Trial of Mary Dugan" for Broadway. The agreement incorporated a condition that Woods could make changes to the content. Attentive that he would wreck her vision of the play to make an increasingly regular show, Rand turned Woods down.
