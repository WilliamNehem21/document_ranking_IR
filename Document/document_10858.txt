In 2003, she co-featured with Julia Roberts in "Mona Lisa Smile" in the job of Giselle. In a meeting with "The Daily Telegraph", she uncovered the explanation behind tolerating the job was "to play someone who feels sure about herself as a hot, wonderful lady". The film created for the most part basic surveys, with Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" depicting it as "priggish and reductive". Her next jobs were in littler autonomous movies: "Casa de los Babys" (2003), a tale around six American ladies restlessly holding up out their extensive residency necessities in a unidentified South American nation before getting their assenting infants, and "Criminal" (2004), a revamp of the Argentinian film "Nine Queens", with John C. Reilly and Diego Luna. Gyllenhaal plays a legitimate lodging supervisor compelled to support her abnormal sibling (Reilly) by enticing one of his exploited people. Gyllenhaal was welcome to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2004. She featured in the HBO film "Strip Search" (2004), where she depicted an American understudy in China associated with psychological oppression. For her job, Gyllenhaal needed to play out numerous scenes of full-frontal bareness as the film handled issues of strip looks.
