Native forms of the story additionally exist. In 1987, an older Aboriginal man from close-by Kingston related a variant of the story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal individuals and harmed others since they were taking his sheep. Dark colored at that point set up his plausible excuse by riding to Adelaide. Around the same time Hastings' record was imitated verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's "The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray". After three years, the South Australian Education Department distributed an Aboriginal examinations book for auxiliary understudies. It rehashed Hastings' form, and tailed it with an Aboriginal adaptation told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay region. Trevorrow depicted the misuse of Aboriginal specialists by white pilgrims, and expressed that when times were lean, Aboriginal individuals would take flour from landowners. He didn't name Brown, yet expressed that a pilgrim harmed some flour and rode for Adelaide to set up a vindication. Cultivate et al. note that in spite of the fact that these two records were comparative, the thing that matters was that Hastings depicted Brown as a casualty of Aboriginal assaults, while Trevorrow accentuated white misuse of Aboriginal individuals.
