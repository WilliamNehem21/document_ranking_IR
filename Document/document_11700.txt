Slidell came back to Washington in May 1846 and gave his assessment that dealings with the Mexican government were probably not going to be fruitful. Polk respected the treatment of his ambassador as an affront and a "sufficient reason for war", and he arranged to approach Congress for a presentation of war. In the interim, in late March, General Taylor had achieved the Rio Grande, and his military stayed outdoors over the stream from Matamoros, Tamaulipas. In April, after Mexican general Pedro de Ampudia requested that Taylor come back to the Nueces River, Taylor started a bar of Matamoros. An encounter on the northern side of the Rio Grande on April 25 finished in the demise or catch of many American officers, and ended up known as the Thornton Affair. Word did not achieve Washington until May 9, and Polk promptly assembled the Cabinet and acquired their endorsement of his arrangement to send a war message to Congress on the ground that Mexico had, as Polk place it in his message, "shed American blood on the American soil". Polk's message was made to show the war as a fair and vital guard of the nation against a neighbor that had since quite a while ago agitated the United States.
