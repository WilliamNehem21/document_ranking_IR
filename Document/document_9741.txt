Chief of naval operations Hipper's marauders set sail on 15 December 1914, and effectively barraged a few English towns; British destroyers escorting the first BCS had just experienced German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5:15ÃÂ a.m. also, battled an uncertain activity with them. Bad habit Admiral Sir George Warrender, directing the second Battle Squadron, had gotten a flag at 5:40 that the destroyer was connecting with foe destroyers, despite the fact that Beatty had not. The destroyer recognized the German reinforced cruiser and her escorts at about 7:00, however couldn't transmit the message until 7:25. Chief naval officer Warrender got the flag, as did "New Zealand", yet Beatty, on board "Lion", did not, despite the fact that "New Zealand" had been explicitly entrusted to transfer messages between the destroyers and the lead. Warrender endeavored to pass on Shark's message to Beatty at 7:36, however did not figure out how to reach until 7:55. On accepting the message, Beatty turned around course, and dispatched "New Zealand" to scan for "Roon". She was being redesignd by "New Zealand" when Beatty got messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 9:00. Beatty requested "New Zealand" to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
