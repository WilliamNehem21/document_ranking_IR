"Bharattherium bonapartei" is known from a total of eight isolated teeth. Among the seven teeth in their sample, Wilson and colleagues tentatively identified five as fourth lower molariforms (mf4)âbecause gondwanathere premolars and molars cannot be distinguished, they are collectively known as "molariforms"âone as a third lower molariform (mf3) and one as a lower incisor (i1). These determinations were made on the basis of comparisons with a sample of the South American gondwanathere "Sudamerica ameghinoi", in which all eight molariform positions are known. However, the large number of mf4s led Wilson and colleagues to suspect that the criteria used for distinguishing "Sudamerica" tooth positions may not apply directly to "Bharattherium". Prasad and colleagues did not assign their two "Bharattherium" teeth to any tooth position, but suggested that they may represent different tooth positions and that one may come from the upper and the other from the lower side of the jaw. As is characteristic of sudamericids, "Bharattherium" molariforms are hypsodont (high-crowned) and have a flat occlusal (chewing) surface atop a high tooth, with furrows that extend down the height of the tooth. "Bharattherium" molariforms are the smallest of any sudamericid; those of "Lavanify", for example, are about 35% larger. Unlike "Sudamerica" molariforms, those of "Bharattherium" taper towards the top.
