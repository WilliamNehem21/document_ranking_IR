Norris Yates, in his "The American Humorist" (1964), contended that Dooley is altogether dependent on the papers for data, and has comprehended them gravely. He composed that Mr. Dooley is proposed to be the inverse of the very much educated native looked for by the Progressive Movement, and that his remarks contain more truth than he knows. John O. Rees, in his diary article on Mr. Dooley, recommended that the barkeeper is expected to act in full consciousness of how phenomenal his words can be; he is developing what he has found in the papers, transforming it into a pointed story for the amusement and illumination of Hennessy, and himself. Dooley's clear misrenderings of the scholarly citations Hogan has probably amused him with are, most much of the time, too indicated possibly be negligible obfuscating from the uneducated personality, for instance insinuating Gray's "Epitaph" in expressing, while at the same time talking about high-society tattle, "Nobody needs to hear what Hogan calls, 'The short and basic embarrassments of poor people'." Although Mr. Dooley claims not to peruse books, this isn't valid as he surveys something like two, Roosevelt's story of his time in Cuba and Sinclair's "The Jungle". Every so often Hennessy is tricked into accepting what Dooley has spoken is truly along these lines, constraining the publican to disclose to his client that what he has said was "a joke. I drug it up."
