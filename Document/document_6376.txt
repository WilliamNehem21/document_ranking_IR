Pohl's strategy of distributing a story by another essayist in each issue prompted an arrangement called ""If"- firsts"; the first, Joseph L. Green's "Once Around Arcturus", about the romance between a man and lady of various planets, showed up in the September 1962 issue. A few of the essayists highlighted in the "If"- first arrangement, which were distributed from 1962 through 1965, turned out to be notable, including Alexei Panshin; the most noticeable was Larry Niven, whose first story, "The Coldest Place", showed up in December 1964. Niven later commented that the story was promptly obsolete; the plot depended on the revelation that the clouded side of Mercury was the coldest spot known to mankind, yet space tests had as of late found that Mercury did in truth turn nonconcurrently. Gardner Dozois additionally made his first deal to "If", with "The Empty Man", about a man controlled by an outsider, in the September 1966 issue, and Gene Wolfe's "Mountains Like Mice", around a surrendered gathering of pilgrims on Mars, showed up in the May 1966 issue. In fact this was not Wolfe's first deal, as he had just had "The Dead Man" distributed in the October 1965 issue of "Sir!", yet "Mountains Like Mice" had been composed prior.
