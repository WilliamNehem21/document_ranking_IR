Development of USÃÂ 113 to a partitioned interstate started during the 1950s in Dover. A significant part of the rest of the U.S. Roadway in Delaware was extended during the 1960s; the last area of two-path USÃÂ 113 in that state was extended in the mid-1990s. The Berlin sidestep turned into the principal segment of USÃÂ 113 in Maryland to be extended to an isolated thruway in the mid-1950s. In the mid 1970s, USÃÂ 113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was extended to an isolated parkway and the Snow Hill sidestep was developed, supplanting what might move toward becoming USÃÂ 113ÃÂ Business. The U.S. Expressway among Berlin and the Delaware state line was extended to a partitioned interstate around 2000. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is overhauling the final two-path bits of USÃÂ 113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-path separated parkway. USÃÂ 113's northern end was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Roadway was supplanted by DEÃÂ 1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to overhaul USÃÂ 113 to an interstate from Selbyville to Ellendale; a turnpike sidestep of Milford was dropped in 2008 due to network resistance.
