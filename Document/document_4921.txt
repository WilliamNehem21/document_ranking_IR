It created the impression that "Hard Luck Houtteman" had returned as the 1952 Detroit Tigers season started. On April 2, 1952, just before the season began, Art lost his seven-month-old girl in a car crash. In an April 26 matchup against the Cleveland Indians, with two outs in the base of the ninth, Houtteman was one out far from a no-hitter when he tossed a fastball that "should sink" however did not, which Harry hit for a solitary. Houtteman stated, "This was the main pitch I shook Ginsberg off the entire diversion", and for quite a long time a short time later, catcher Joe Ginsberg over and again said to Houtteman, "On the off chance that you'd tuned in to me, I'd have you in the Hall of Fame". Detroit won by a score of 13Ã¢ÂÂ 0. In the wake of losing his tenth amusement on June 22, administrator Red Rolfe moved Houtteman out of the beginning turn and into the warm up area. He completed the year with a 8Ã¢ÂÂ 20 record and a 4.36 ERA. His twentieth misfortune went ahead September 21 against the Indians, and he turned into the primary Tiger to lose 20 diversions since Bobo Newsom in 1941. His frustrating season prompted the likelihood of an exchange, with general chief Charlie Gehringer recognizing that Houtteman may be exchanged if the correct offer tagged along.
