Ruler Harris won the hurl and batted. At about 12:10ÃÂ pm before roughly 4,000 observers, A N Hornby and A. P. Lucas opened the England innings. They put on 125 for the main wicket before Spofforth bowled Lucas for 51 and Hornby not long after for 67. Hornby had given an opportunity amid his innings however Lucas did not. Ulyett and Harris steadied the innings after the two speedy wickets and included 85; Ulyett made 55 preceding succumbing to a running, jumping catch, and Harris made 41. Amid his innings, Harris edged a ball to wicket-guardian Murdoch, however Coulthard precluded him not; this was seen by the writers present and announced the next day. Spofforth cut up the wicket with his feet so gravely that it turned out to be hard to play, and Edwin Evans, bowling from the opposite end, pitched about each ball into the imprints. The loss of Ulyett and Harris with hardly a pause in between set off an unexpected breakdown as England lost 7/34 to be full scale for 267. Evans took 5/62 and Spofforth 5/93. The English batsmen were profitable against the bowling of Edwin Tindall, taking 79 keeps running from his 27 overs without losing a wicket. At stumps on the primary day, New South Wales were 2/53, with wicket-guardian and opening batsman Billy Murdoch on 28 and Hugh Massie on three.
