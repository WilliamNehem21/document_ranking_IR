"Supernature" got positive audits from music faultfinders. At Metacritic, which doles out a weighted mean rating out of 100 to audits from standard pundits, the collection got a normal score of 79, in light of 27 surveys, which designates "by and large positive surveys". In a survey evaluated four out of five stars, "The Guardian" said that the collection was "a reckless, excellent festival of adoration and moving". In an audit for PopMatters, Adrien Begrand said that "[a]lthough "Supernature" comes up short on the creative ability of "Felt Mountain" and the saucy splendor of "Dark Cherry", it doesn't pander to the pop group." Lauren Gitlin of "Moving Stone" said the collection was "[t]oxic and scrumptious" and that ""Supernature" will influence you to do terrible thingsÃ¢ÂÂand like it." However, Pitchfork Media analyst Nitsuh Abebe was less inspired, and composed that the collection's tunes "continue feeling like activities: excessively thick and melodic to work like move music, yet with tunes that won't stick as satisfyingly as pop." Michael Hubbard of musicOMH composed a survey for each tune on "Supernature", and despite the fact that he felt that it was an "inquisitive, as opposed to great, record", he reprimanded it for "growing dim at an early stage, with poor, low quality tunes toward the end which leave the audience feeling conned". AllMusic commentator Heather Phares called "Supernature" "Goldfrapp's most available collection" and named "Ooh La" as its best tune.
