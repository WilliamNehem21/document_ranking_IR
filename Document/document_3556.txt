Upon "Eraserhead" discharge, "Assortment" offered a negative survey, calling it "a sickening terrible taste work out". The survey communicated doubt over the film's long incubation and portrayed its finale as unwatchable. Looking at "Eraserhead" to Lynch's next film "The Elephant Man", Tom Buckley of "The New York Times" felt that while the last was a well-made film with a cultivated cast, the previous was definitely not. Buckley called "Eraserhead" "dimly vainglorious", and felt that the film's repulsiveness angles stemmed exclusively from the presence of the distorted tyke instead of from its content or exhibitions. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of "The Atlantic" felt that "Eraserhead" showed that Lynch was "a standout amongst the most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in the motion pictures". Rose portrayed the film as being strongly close to home, finding that dissimilar to past surrealist films, for example, Luis BuÃÂ±uel's 1929 work "Un Chien Andalou" or 1930's "L'Age d'Or", Lynch's symbolism "isn't connecting with us from his movies; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 audit for the "Chicago Tribune", Michael Wilmington depicted "Eraserhead" as novel, feeling that the film's "power" and "bad dream lucidity" were an aftereffect of Lynch's tender loving care in its creation because of his inclusion in such a significant number of jobs amid its generation. In the 1995 article "Awful Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks", pundit Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that "Eraserhead" spoke to Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the chief's aesthetic ability declined as his fame developed, and stood out the film from "Wild on a fundamental level"Ã¢ÂÂ Lynch's latest element film around thenÃ¢ÂÂsaying "even the most careless examination of "Eraserhead" with "Wild on a basic level" uncovers a creative decay so abrupt that it is difficult to envision a similar individual making the two movies".
