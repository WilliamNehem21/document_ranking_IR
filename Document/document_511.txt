In its initial three years, the school was housed in numerous areas before coming back to the first townhouse expanding on Courtland Street. In 1843, the City Council assigned $23,000 to procure a structure for the school at the northeastern corner of East Fayette and Holliday Streets, (over the road from the later Baltimore City Hall, built 1867-1875), and the site of the present War Memorial Plaza, developed 1917-1925). The remodeled new school building was the previous old "Gathering Rooms", a Greek Revival engineering metro milestone, worked in 1797 by draftsmen Robert Cary Long, Sr. what's more, Col. Nicholas Rogers (progenitor proprietor of the home which moved toward becoming Druid Hill Park) to suit get-togethers for Baltimore's social world class at the Baltimore Dancing Assembly, which had started during the 1780s. what's more, the site of the primary private library organization of Baltimore. The school was nearby to the popular Holliday Street Theater, where the sonnet "The Defense of Fort McHenry", presently known as the ""Star Spangled Banner"" composed by Frederick and Georgetown legal counselor and beginner writer, Francis Scott Key, (1779-1843), was first performed on its phase in October and November 1814, after the Battle of Baltimore, with the British Royal Navy and Army assault on Baltimore amid the War of 1812, (presently known as "Safeguards' Day") on September 12-13-14, 1814. In spite of the fact that it was not intended to house a scholarly foundation, the school would involve this structure for a long time.
