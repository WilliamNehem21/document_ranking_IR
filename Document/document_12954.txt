Churchill's view was that Coward would help out the war exertion by engaging the troops and the home front than by knowledge work: "Proceed to sing to them when the firearms are terminating Ã¢ÂÂ that is your activity!" Coward, however frustrated, pursued this counsel. He visited, acted and sang relentlessly in Europe, Africa, Asia and America. He composed and recorded war-themed prevalent tunes, including "London Pride" and "Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans". His London home was destroyed by German bombs in 1941, and he took up impermanent habitation at the Savoy Hotel. Amid one air assault on the territory around the Savoy he joined Carroll Gibbons and Judy Campbell in extemporaneous supper club to divert the hostage visitors from their apprehensions. Another of Coward's wartime ventures, as essayist, star, arranger and co-executive (nearby David Lean), was the maritime film show "In Which We Serve". The film was prevalent on the two sides of the Atlantic, and he was granted a privileged endorsement of legitimacy at the 1943 Academy Awards function. Quitter played a maritime chief, putting together the character with respect to his companion Lord Louis Mountbatten. Lean proceeded to coordinate and adjust film adaptations of a few Coward plays.
