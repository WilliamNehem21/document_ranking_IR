One of the new firms to enter the field was the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company; the association's accomplices, siblings Otway and Gray Latham, Otway's companion Enoch Rector, and their boss, Samuel J. Tilden Jr., looked to join the notoriety of the Kinetoscope with that of prizefighting. This prompted a progression of critical improvements in the movie field: The Kinetograph was then fit for shooting just a 50-foot-long negative (proof recommends feet was the longest length really utilized). At 16 outlines for each foot, this implied a greatest running time of 20 seconds at 40 outlines for every second (fps), the speed most habitually utilized with the camera. At the rate of 30 fps that had been utilized as far back as 1891, a film could keep running for very nearly 27 seconds. Hendricks distinguishes "Sandow" as having been shot at 16 fps, as does the Library of Congress in its online index, where its length is recorded as 40 seconds. Indeed, even at the slowest of these rates, the running time would not have been sufficient to suit an agreeable trade of fisticuffs; 16 fps, also, might have been thought to give too herky-jerky an enhanced visualization for delight in the game. The Kinetograph and Kinetoscope were altered, conceivably with Rector's help, so they could oversee filmstrips multiple times longer than had recently been utilized.
