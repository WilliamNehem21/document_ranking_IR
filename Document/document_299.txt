He is viewed as a standout amongst the most powerful Kannada artists of the Hoysala period. A non-conventionalist, he has been classified "artist of artists" and an "artist for the majority".

Harihara is credited with building up the local "ragale" meter. The soonest wonderful biographer in the Kannada language, he composed an account of Basavanna called "Basavarajadevara ragale", which gives fascinating insights concerning the hero while not continually fitting in with mainstream views of the time. Credited to him is a gathering of 100ÃÂ poems called the "Nambiyanana ragale" (likewise called "Shivaganada ragale" or "Saranacharitamanasa" Ã¢ÂÂ "The heavenly pool of the lives of the lovers") after the holy person Nambiyana. In the "sataka" meter he composed the "Pampa sataka", and in the "ashtaka" meter, the "Mudige ashtaka" in around 1200.
