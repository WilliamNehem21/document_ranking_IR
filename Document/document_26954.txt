Billy Vaughn covered "Here We Go Again" on his 1967 "Ode to Billy Joe" instrumental album, as did Dean Martin on his 1970 album "My Woman, My Woman, My Wife". Glen Campbell's version appeared on his 1971 album "The Last Time I Saw Her", Eddy Arnold's on his 1972 album "Lonely People", and George Strait's on his 1992 album "Holding My Own". Steagall performed it with Reba McEntire on his 2007 "Here We Go Again" album, but she did not include it on her 2007 duets album "", which was released four weeks later. Their collaboration was favorably reviewed, and McEntire was said to reinvigorate this country standard by Nathalie Baret of "ABQ Journal". Martin's version was 3:07, and it later appeared on compilation albums, starting with the 1996 "Dean Martin Gold, Vol. 2". It has appeared on a handful of other Martin compilation albums. Campbell's version was only 2:26. Strait's version is 2:53 and appears later on his 2004 "Greatest Collection" at a 2:55 length. Steagall's version with McEntire (who Steagall discovered at a 1974 county fair) is 3:10. R&B and boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield recorded a version for his 1997 album "The Red One". Peters and Lee made a version of the song on their 1976 on their "Serenade" album. Joe Dolan produced a 1972 single of the song that he included on his 1976 album "Golden Hour Of Joe Dolan Vol. 2" and several of his greatest hits albums.
