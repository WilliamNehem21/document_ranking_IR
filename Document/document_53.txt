The valley of Jackson Hole remained essentially in private proprietorship when John D. Rockefeller, Jr. what's more, his better half visited the area in the late 1920s. Horace Albright and Rockefeller talked about approaches to save Jackson Hole from business misuse, and in outcome, Rockefeller began purchasing Jackson Hole properties through the Snake River Land Company with the end goal of later turning them over to the National Park Service. In 1930, this arrangement was uncovered to the inhabitants of the locale and was met with solid objection. Congressional endeavors to keep the development of Grand Teton National Park wound up putting the Snake River Land Company's property in limbo. By 1942 Rockefeller had turned out to be progressively restless that his obtained property may never be added to the recreation center, and kept in touch with the Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes that he was thinking about pitching the land to another gathering. Secretary Ickes prescribed to President Franklin Roosevelt that the Antiquities Act, which allowed Presidents to set aside arrive for assurance without the endorsement of Congress, be utilized to set up a national landmark in Jackson Hole. Roosevelt made the Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943, utilizing the land gave from the Snake River Land Company and including extra property from Teton National Forest. The landmark and park were nearby one another and both were directed by the National Park Service, yet the landmark assignment guaranteed no financing designation, nor gave a dimension of asset assurance equivalent to the recreation center. Individuals from Congress more than once endeavored to have the new national landmark canceled.
