The town of Abergynolwyn was worked to house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the town a slope with winding house was laid seventy five percent of the route along the mineral augmentation. The twisting house for the grade remained on the tight edge, with the mineral line going through it. The two-track slant dropped over a separation of . At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a support connect. Following the extension, short lines expand toward the east from a wagon turntable to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a composition slate plant (later a woodworker's yard). The principle branch at that point split to shape a capacity circle, with a further wagon turntable and a more drawn out branch serving the houses and school toward the north east. The fundamental branch proceeded with north, crossing the primary street at that point going between the two principle porches in the town before closure in a turntable and a last short line associating with the Capel Jerusalem church. The town slant was lifted amid the early long periods of safeguarding, to give truly necessary rail to supplant the current track. The winding house was wrecked in 1968 to enable realignment of the railroad to frame the augmentation to Nant Gwernol.
