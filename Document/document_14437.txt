On 19 April 1991, the Hartwig family sued the Navy for "deliberate and careless punishment of passionate misery" under the Federal Tort Claims Act. On 30 June 1992 the Hartwigs included another tally of enthusiastic trouble to the claim, after the Navy sent a letter to Hartwig's folks welcoming the dead mariner to join the U.S. Maritime Reserve. The Hartwigs sued for enthusiastic misery so as to stay away from the impediments forced by the "Feres" Doctrine. The DoD requested an expulsion of the Hartwigs' suit on grounds of sovereign invulnerability, yet in May 1993, US District Judge Paul R. Matia decided in Cleveland that the Hartwigs' suit could continue. After disclosure, the legislature again moved for expulsion. On 26 January 1999 Magistrate Judge David Perelman issued a suggestion to give rejection in light of the fact that quite a long while of revelation had uncovered that criticism was basic to the Hartwigs' cases, and that unadulterated maligning claims were banished by sovereign invulnerability. The Hartwig family documented protests, yet on 10 November 1999 District Judge Solomon Oliver, Jr. embraced the suggestion to expel, deciding that "anyway destructive the administration's activity may have been, they can't frame the premise of a case against the United States."
