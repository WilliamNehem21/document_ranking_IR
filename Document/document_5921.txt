In the wake of moving towards "various decision content answers" and a confused ongoing interaction framework, the group chose to disentangle the amusement and set the 2007 Independent Games Festival as a due date to finish everything. With this time weight, they constrained themselves to remove a great deal of what they felt was unneeded intricacy, conveying the amusement to its center. In the wake of expelling a considerable lot of what they chose were incidental components they at that point included back in the cooking framework, which they felt fit well with the remainder of the amusement, just as a guide framework. They at that point built up the amusement world and story in a generally direct way, making essential structures of every locale and after that returning to fill in subtleties. They felt this enabled them to make fascinating thoughts toward the start of the diversion and after that round them out and resolve them toward the end. One of these thoughts was that of the "refrain"; Holowka acknowledged partially through improvement that he had been utilizing a similar twelve-note succession transposed into various keys all through the music, and understood that the possibility of an inescapable melodic subject to the world fit with the story. The amusement additionally incorporates a dimension and liveliness proofreader; a few mods have been made for the diversion.
