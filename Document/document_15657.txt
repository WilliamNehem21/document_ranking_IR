Lambert's corpse rapidly began to putrefy. There was no question of his body being returned to Leicester, and so on 22 June, it was placed inside an elm coffin, 6Â feet 4Â inches long, 4Â feet 4Â inches wide and 2Â feet 4Â inches deep (193Â cmÂ Ã 132Â cmÂ Ã 71Â cm), built on wheels to allow it to be moved. The coffin was so large that to wheel it out of the inn and to the newly opened burial ground at the rear of St Martin's Church, the window and wall of his apartment were demolished. A suitably sized grave had been dug, with a sloping approach to avoid the need to lower the coffin from above, but on 23 June, it nonetheless took almost half an hour for twenty men to pull Lambert's enormous coffin into the grave.
Lambert's friends paid for a large gravestone, inscribed:In Remembrance of that Prodigy in Nature.<br>DANIEL LAMBERT.<br>a Native of Leicester:<br>who was possessed of an exalted and convivial Mind<br>and in personal Greatness had no Competitor<br>"He measured three Feet one Inch round the Leg"<br>"nine Feet four Inches round the Body"<br>"and weighed"<br>"Fifty two Stone eleven Pounds!"<br>He departed this Life on the 21st of <br>Aged 39 years<br>"As a Testimony of Respect this Stone is erected by his Friends in Leicester"
