On 20Â March 1937, Hughes was granted a five-year short-service commission as a pilot officer in the RAF. Like some of his compatriots, he refused to exchange his dark-blue RAAF uniform for the lighter-coloured RAF one. He undertook advanced flying instruction at No.Â 2 Flying Training School in Digby, Lincolnshire. Slated to fly bombers, he appealed and in July was posted as a fighter pilot to No.Â 64 Squadron, which operated Hawker Demons out of RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk. The squadron was transferred to RAF Church Fenton, Yorkshire, in May 1938. Hughes was promoted to flying officer on 19Â November. No.Â 64 Squadron subsequently received Bristol BlenheimÂ 1F twin-engined fighters, and completed its conversion to the type in January 1939.
Hughes was promoted to acting flight lieutenant in November 1939 and became a flight commander in the newly formed No.Â 234 Squadron, which, like No.Â 64 Squadron, came under the control of No.Â 13 Group in the north of England. On establishment the previous month at RAF Leconfield, East Yorkshire, No.Â 234 Squadron was equipped with Blenheims, Fairey Battles and Gloster Gauntlets; it began re-arming with Supermarine Spitfires in March 1940 and was operational two months later. The commanding officer, Squadron Leader Richard Barnett, rarely flew, and Hughes assumed responsibility for overseeing conversion to the Spitfire. "More experienced and more mature" than his fellow pilots, according to historian Stephen Bungay, the Australian "effectively led" No.Â 234 Squadron. By this time, Hughes had acquired a young Airedale Terrier known as Flying Officer Butch, who sometimes flew with himâagainst regulations. He had also met and begun dating Kathleen ("Kay") Brodrick of Hull. On 19Â June, Hughes and his squadron transferred to RAF StÂ Eval, Cornwall, under the jurisdiction of the newly formed No.Â 10 Group in south-west England.
