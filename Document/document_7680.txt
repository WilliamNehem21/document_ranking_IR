Deciding the phylogeny of subfossil lemurs has been risky in light of the fact that investigations of morphology, formative science, and atomic phylogenetics have once in a while yielded clashing outcomes. All examinations concur that the family Daubentoniidae (counting the goliath yes) veered first from different lemurs at any rate 60ÃÂ million years prior. The connection between the rest of the families has been less clear. Morphological, formative, and sub-atomic examinations have offered support for lumping the four sloth lemur genera of the family Palaeopropithecidae with the family Indriidae (counting the indri, sifakas, and wooly lemurs). The situation of family Megaladapidae has been progressively disputable, with likenesses in teeth and skull highlights recommending a cozy association with family Lepilemuridae (sportive lemurs). Sub-atomic information, rather, demonstrate a closer relationship to family Lemuridae. Moreover, a connection between family Archaeolemuridae and family Lemuridae has been proposed, in view of morphological and formative attributes, yet molar morphology, the quantity of teeth in the specific toothcomb, and atomic investigation bolster a closer association with the indriidÃ¢ÂÂ sloth lemur clade. Other subfossil lemurs, including the monster affirmative yes and "Pachylemur", are all the more effectively put because of solid likenesses with existing lemurs (the yes and ruffed lemurs, separately).
