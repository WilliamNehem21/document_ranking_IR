Davis had enrolled Cosey to furnish his music with sounds from the electric blues and Jimi Hendrix, whose utilization of contortion and the E-level tuning was shared by Cosey. As per Charles Shaar Murray, he evoked the guitarist's echoic, free jazz-motivated performances while Lucas performed in the way of Hendrix's increasingly expressive musicality and blues tunes; Cosey's guitar was isolated to one side channel and Lucas' to one side on "Agharta". Jazz researcher Stuart Nicholson composed that Davis used his guitarists in a way which understood the "influxes of symphonious mutilation" Hendrix had investigated in his very own music. In Murray's view, the collection conjured his impact on the trumpeter more unequivocally than some other of his records; Nicholson believed it to be the "nearest guess" to the music they could have recorded together. Davis veered from concise and expressive performances to unsentimental moans, which proposed he was all the while grieving Hendrix's 1970 demise, Murray construed. That year, Davis had begun playing with a wah-wah pedal joined to his trumpet so as to imitate the register Hendrix accomplished on his guitar. The pedal made what "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" (2006) portrayed as "floods and ebbs in a pleasingly static line, enabling Miles to fabricate enormous melismatic minor departure from a solitary note". When of the show, he had created what Philip Freeman called "another tone, the wiggly, sparkling strips of sound that are heard on "Agharta"", where his wah-wah handled performances frequently sounded wild eyed and melancholic, as "contorted floods of crude agony".
