By from the get-go in August, the McKinley battle had chosen a methodology: claim to work and built up ranchers. McKinley, on the earnest counsel of his consultants, by the center of that month had chosen that the money question must be tended to promptly, and the crusade machine started the way toward producing a huge number of distributions and sending several speakers into the field. The leaflets contained statements or articles from McKinley, individuals from Congress, and money related specialists on why a bimetallic standard would be ruinous to the nation. Theodore Roosevelt, at that point an individual from the New York City Police Commission, saw train units brimming with paper being dispatched when he visited the Chicago central station in August. To help the individuals who did not peruse English, there were handouts in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Yiddish, German, Polish, Norwegian, Italian, Danish, and Dutch. Pre-composed articles were sent to periodicals, and the crusade paid for amicable papers to be sent to a huge number of natives the nation over for the term. Five million families got McKinley battle materials on a week after week premise. Among the surrogates conveyed for McKinley's sake was paper editorial manager Warren G. Harding, paid to make addresses crosswise over Ohio. The future president established a positive connection and after three years was chosen to the Ohio State Senate, starting his political ascent.
