The group composed each character to exemplify an amusement hero original; Michael typifies covetousness, Franklin desire and Trevor craziness. Houser felt Michael and Trevor were composed to compare one another, with Michael "like the criminal who needs to compartmentalize and be a hero a portion of the time" and Trevor "the crazy person who isn't a wolf in sheep's clothing". He thought about that the three lead characters helped move the amusement's story into more unique region than its forerunners, which generally pursued a solitary hero ascending through the positions of a criminal black market. Ned Luke depicted Michael, Shawn "Solo" Fonteno depicted Franklin and Steven Ogg depicted Trevor. Fonteno first ended up mindful of the acting occupation through his companion DJ Pooh, who dealt with "San Andreas" and was engaged with "Amazing Theft Auto V"s music creation. At the point when Luke's specialist instructed him with respect to the throwing call, he at first did not have any desire to try out for the part since it was in a computer game. In the wake of perusing the tryout material and becoming familiar with the task, he ended up intrigued. He reflected, "I went following perusing the material from 'I'm not doing it' to 'no one else is doing it'. It was simply splendid". Amid the underlying tryout process, Ogg saw an on-set science among him and Luke, which he felt helped safe them the jobs. "Whenever [Luke] and I went in the room together we quickly had something", he clarified. While the on-screen characters realized their tryouts were for Rockstar Games, it was not until they marked contracts that they learnt it was a "Fantastic Theft Auto" title.
