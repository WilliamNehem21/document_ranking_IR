Eusebius and others: According to Eusebius, who utilized the record of the third century history specialist Porphyry, Antiochus X was launched out from the capital by Philip I in 220 SE (93/92 BC) and fled to the Parthians. Eusebius included that following the Roman victory of Syria, Antiochus X surrendered to Pompey, wanting to be reestablished on the honored position, yet the general population of Antioch paid cash to the Roman general to keep away from a Seleucid rebuilding. Antiochus X was then welcomed by the general population of Alexandria to administer mutually with the girls of Ptolemy XII, yet he passed on of sickness before long. This record has been addressed by numerous researchers, for example, Hoover and Bellinger. The story told by Eusebius contains true mistakes, as he composed that around the same time Antiochus X was crushed by Philip I, he surrendered to Pompey, while in the meantime Philip I was caught by the legislative leader of Syria Aulus Gabinius. Be that as it may, Pompey touched base in Syria just in 64 BC, and left it in 62 BC. Aulus Gabinius was selected legislative head of Syria in 57 BC. Additionally, the piece of Eusebius' record in regards to the surrender to Pompey echoes the destiny of Antiochus XIII; the author is by all accounts confounding the destiny of Antiochus X with that of his child. The second century student of history Justin, composing dependent on crafted by the primary century BC antiquarian Trogus, additionally befuddled the dad and child, as he composed that Antiochus X was delegated ruler of Syria by the Roman general Lucullus following the annihilation of Tigranes II in 69 BC.
