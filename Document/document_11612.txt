The sauropod fossil today known as "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" was found in May 1898 by mud specialists in the zone around Fletton toward the south of Peterborough and east of the Great Northern Railway. Pits in this district uncover the fossil-rich sedimentary rocks of the marine Oxford Clay, which is of center Callovian age and today viewed as one of the great geographical arrangements of British fossil science. The sauropod fossil potentially originates from NPBCL pit No. 1, which was the northernmost pit worked by the New Peterborough Brick Company Limited, and which created the most vertebrate fossils. The revelation was conveyed to the consideration of Leeds, who, after removal, took the sauropod example to Eyebury, the Leeds' family home. In mid-August, after some cleaning and fixing of the example, geologist Henry Woodward visited Eyebury and created a real existence measured illustration of the remaining parts for introduction at the British Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting. Following this introduction, on 17 August 1898, Henry Woodward came back with American scientist Othniel Charles Marsh, who believed the sauropod to be firmly identified with the North American taxon "Diplodocus". Alfred Leeds offered the sauropod to the British Museum of Natural History (BMNH, presently contracted as NHMUK) for ÃÂ£250, which would compare to about ÃÂ£30,529 in 2017. The NHMUK had before in 1890 and 1892 purchased the First and Second Collections of Alfred Leeds, individually. Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the NHMUK, had "extraordinary delight" to prescribe to the Trustees of the NHMUK the fossil be acquired. The buy was endorsed on 25 February 1899, alongside the buy of arranged different stays for simply over ÃÂ£357 (~ÃÂ£43,596 now), where the Leeds sauropod picked up the promotion number BMNH R3078 (presently NHMUK R3078).
