The Brazilian Air Force (the ForÃ§a AÃ©rea Brasileira or "FAB") sent five fixed-wing aircraft and three helicopters to the region for an extensive search and rescue (SAR) operation. As many as 200 personnel were reported to be involved in the operation, among them a group of Kayapo people familiar with the forest. The crash site of Gol Flight 1907 was spotted on 30Â September by the air force, at coordinates , east of Peixoto de Azevedo, near Fazenda JarinÃ£, a cattle ranch. It was reported that rescue personnel were having difficulty reaching the crash site due to the dense forest. The Brazilian airport operating company, Infraero, at first indicated the possibility of five survivors, but a later statement from the Brazilian Air Force, based on data collected by their personnel who rappelled to the crash site, and local police who assisted in the SAR effort, confirmed that there were no survivors. Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva declared three days of national mourning.
