Originator Nomura said that he needed Tidus' garments and assistants to recommend an association with the ocean. Tidus' attire has an unmistakable blue theme; his blitzball crew logo, in view of a fish snare, is an amalgam of the letters "J" and "T" (the primary letters of Tidus' name and that of his dad, Jecht). Since a player can change Tidus' name, the character isn't alluded to by name in capable of being heard exchange; be that as it may, a character in Dream Zanarkand utilizes Tidus' name in a discourse box. The main other in-amusement appearance of his name is "Tidu" in Spiran content on the nameplate of an Auroch storage in the Luca arena. Before "Conclusive Fantasy X"s discharge, Tidus was referred to the media as Tida. In mid 2001, PlayOnline changed the character's name to "Tidus". Since his name is never spoken in "Definite Fantasy X", its proposed articulation has been discussed. Meetings with James Arnold Taylor and spoken exchange in the English renditions of "Dissidia Final Fantasy", "Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy", and "Kingdom Hearts" (with appearance appearances by the character) demonstrate that it is articulated (); in the English variant of "Kingdom Hearts II", Tidus' name is articulated (). As indicated by Taylor, it was articulated amid the restriction of "Conclusive Fantasy X" on the grounds that the storyteller of an early English trailer articulated it that way.
