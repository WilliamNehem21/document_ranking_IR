Whedon utilizes a few perplexing impacts to increase the truth of the circumstances in the scene to the point that they appear to be strange. The long opening shot of Buffy getting back home and discovering Joyce was taped with one hand-held camera in consistent development as she strolls through the house to the telephone and back to her mom once more. The catches on Buffy's telephone are strangely vast, an impact that Whedon included on the grounds that he encountered it when his mom passed on. Buffy is so confused by the paramedic revealing to her that Joyce is dead that she can just concentrate on his mouth trying to comprehend what he is stating. The camera utilizes her point of view and just the base piece of the paramedic's face is in view. Rather than a typical "over-the-bear" see, Buffy is shot at a similar stature as the paramedic's shoulder, scarcely crushed into the edge as though to depict her, as indicated by Whedon, as caught by the real world. Kristine Sutherland expressed that the content was "astonishing", explicitly at catching the separation: "It's not something you can process. I mean mortality is simply not part of your vocabulary when no doubt about it."
