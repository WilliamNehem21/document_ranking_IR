Regardless of speaking to another vessel, the "Undertaking"- A was a similar model that had been utilized since 1979. Ineffectively respected by before impacts specialists as a result of its confounded wiring and mass, the "Enterprise"s hairline breaks were puttied and sanded down, and the inner hardware was revamped. The new model's running lights were coordinated to comparative forces, sparing the impacts craftsmen time in light of the fact that the lights would look right with just a solitary go, rather than three passes required beforehand (for the sensor vault, running lights, and window lights). One tragic side-effect of the fixes was the loss of the model's particular pearlescent completion. The detailed sheen was never obvious on screen (lighting plans avoided reflections while taping so the ship could be appropriately embedded into impacts shots) thus when the model was repainted with regular systems the impact was lost. The Bird of Prey had been harmed from work in "The Voyage Home", where the ship should fly around the sun. To propose scorches, the model had been painted with dark tinged elastic concrete, with the desire that this application would rub off. The concrete rather sat on the model and prepared itself to the model surface, and must be cleaned off.
