The primary European guest to distribute a record of QuiriguÃÂ¡ was English modeler and craftsman Frederick Catherwood, who achieved the remains in 1840. The past landowner, by the surname of PayÃÂ©s, had related the presence of the remnants to his children and to Carlos Meiney, a Jamaican Englishman inhabitant in Guatemala. The senior PayÃÂ©s had as of late kicked the bucket and passed the land to his children and, since neither Meiney nor PayÃÂ©s' children had visited the land containing the remains, they welcomed John Lloyd Stephens and Catherwood to go along with them on their first outing to the site. Stephens had different obligations to take care of, however Catherwood had the capacity to go with the PayÃÂ©s siblings to QuiriguÃÂ¡. Because of unfriendly conditions he was just ready to remain a brief span at the vestiges, yet made illustrations of two of the stelae, which were distributed with a short record of Catherwood's visit in John Lloyd Stephens' book "Occurrences of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan" in 1841. QuiriguÃÂ¡ was the principal site that Stephens and Catherwood could profess to have found themselves. A more extended record of the remnants was made in 1854 by Dr. Karl Scherzer.
