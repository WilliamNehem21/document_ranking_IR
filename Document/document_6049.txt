In 1928, the Trubia Factory, under Major of the Artillery Victor Landesa Domenech, structured and started creation of a model of another shielded tractor; these were named after him, as the Landesa. The unarmed tractor completed creation in 1930 and experienced a progression of tests. Somewhere in the range of 1931 and 1932 the vehicle experienced a progression of updates in the processing plant and was later sent to Madrid for further testing, where it passed tastefully in April 1932. Landesa, who had as of now been elevated to Lieutenant Colonel, started a preseries of three vehicles, motored by the L-2000 motor, structured by Daimler-Benz. Eventually, two were created and set for testing with the Spanish Republican Army, and another nine were requested with utilizing them to tow ÃÂ koda against air ship guns. At the same time, the Trubia Factory started to design a heavily clad and outfitted form of the vehicle for the Spanish Army. Two were created by 1934, in spite of the fact that the Trubia Factory experienced inconveniences in delivering the L-2000 motors; therefore, they were not fueled by the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. They were equipped with a solitary automatic rifle.
