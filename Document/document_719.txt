The following year, the California Highway Commission declined to have the Campo street improved. Be that as it may, the HighwayÃÂ 94 relationship, just as the Campo-Potrero and HighwayÃÂ 80 councils of business raised worries about the wellbeing of the youngsters going to class in the transports along the street. In 1952, the Southern California board of trustees of the state Chamber of Commerce prescribed to the California Highway Commission that RouteÃÂ 94 be augmented to four paths from the Wabash Freeway to Jamacha. In JuneÃÂ 1953, the Commission affirmed an eight-path interstate for RouteÃÂ 94 from Home Avenue in San Diego to Palm Avenue around La Mesa. The nearby Board of Education additionally gave their endorsement, which was required in light of the fact that the interstate would be based ashore that was for a proposed school. However, the following month, State Senator Fred Kraft condemned the proposition since he trusted that it would be excessively costly and would not lessen blockage in the long haul. Endorsement reached out to the intersection with USÃÂ 80 by October 1953; the part from eighteenth Street to Wabash Boulevard followed in November 1954. Soon thereafter, a toll street that would have burrowed under the Laguna Mountains and skirted RouteÃÂ 94 was proposed by the region Board of Supervisors. The state distributed $3.48ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars) for making SRÃÂ 94 an interstate from College Avenue to Campo Road in OctoberÃÂ 1954.
