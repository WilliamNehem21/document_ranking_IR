The government did not approve a public memorial service for the deaths of Diá»m and Nhu until 1968. In 1971, several thousand mourners gathered at Diá»m's purported gravesite. Catholic prayers were given in Latin. Banners proclaimed Diá»m as a saviour of the south, with some mourners having walked into Saigon from villages outside the capital carrying portraits of Diá»m. Madame Thiá»u, the First Lady, was seen weeping at a requiem mass at Saigon's basilica. Several cabinet members were also at the grave and a eulogy was given by a general of the ARVN. According to the eulogy, Diá»m died because he had resisted the domination of foreigners and their plans to bring great numbers of troops to Vietnam and widen a war which would have destroyed the country. Thiá»u sponsored the services, and it was widely seen as a means of associating himself with Diá»m's personal characteristics. Diá»m frequently refused to follow American advice and was known for his personal integrity, in contrast to Thieu, who was infamous for corruption and regarded as being too close to the Americans. However, Thiá»u's attempts to associate himself with Diá»m's relative independence from United States influence was not successful. According to General Maxwell Taylor, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, ""there was the memory of Diá»m to haunt those of us who were aware of the circumstances of his downfall. By our complicity, we Americans were responsible for the plight in which the South Vietnamese found themselves"".
