After the 1929 season, Paschal was, alongside Wilcy Moore and Johnny Grabowski, some portion of an exchange for catcher Bubbles Hargrave to the St. Paul Saints of the American Association (AA). In one 1930 diversion against the Toledo Mud Hens, Paschal had four hits and four RBI in a 23Ã¢ÂÂ 4 win that broke the AA record for most runs scored in an amusement. In 144 diversions, Paschal completed the 1930 season with 204 hits, 10 grand slams, and a .350 batting normal. The accompanying season, Paschal played 121 amusements to hit .336, while his normal in 1932 was .325 of every 147 diversions. Amid one diversion in the 1932 season, Paschal had three pairs and three singles, tying the AA record for most hits in an amusement. His aptitudes declined amid the 1933 season; in 130 amusements he hit only .272 with seven homers. He left St. Paul and marked as a free operator with the Knoxville Smokies on December 30, 1933. The "St. Petersburg Evening Independent" revealed a couple of months after the fact that Paschal was "attempting to keep his activity" in the minors. He was discharged by Knoxville and marked with the Scranton Miners of the New YorkÃ¢ÂÂ Penn League. After a couple of diversions with the Miners, Paschal returned home to North Carolina, where he acknowledged an administrative employment for a semi-proficient baseball crew in Catawba County.
