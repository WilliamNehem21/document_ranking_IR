Like different fairywrens, the wonderful fairywren is remarkable for its stamped sexual dimorphism, guys receiving an exceptionally obvious rearing plumage of splendid brilliant blue appearing differently in relation to dark and dim darker. The brilliantly hued crown and ear tufts are conspicuously included in reproducing shows. The reproducing male has a brilliant blue temple, ear coverts, mantle and tail, dark colored wings, and dark throat, eye band, bosom and bill. Females, immatures, and non-rearing guys are a plain grovel shading with a lighter underbelly and a grovel (females and immatures) or dull grayish blue (guys) tail. The bill is dark colored in females and adolescents and dark in guys after their first winter. Juvenile guys shed into rearing plumage the principal reproducing season in the wake of bring forth, however inadequate shedding some of the time leaves leftover caramel plumage that takes one more year or two to consummate. Both genders shed in harvest time in the wake of rearing, with guys expecting a shroud non-reproducing plumage. They shed again into marital plumage in winter or spring. Rearing guys' blue plumage, especially the ear-coverts, is exceedingly glowing a result of the smoothed and wound surface of the barbules. The blue plumage likewise reflects bright light unequivocally, thus might be much progressively noticeable to different fairywrens, whose shading vision stretches out into this piece of the range.
