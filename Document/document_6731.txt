He joined the Romanian Army and was selected officer of the Saxon National Guard, a local army shaped of the German-talking individuals of SiebenbÃÂ¼rgen. In this job he restricted the Hungarian socialist progressive legislature of BÃÂ©la Kun, which battled against Romania in 1919. Amid a fight at the Tisza waterway against Kun's powers, Phleps resisted direct requests and was along these lines court-martialled.
