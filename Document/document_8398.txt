"Bits of gossip" has been acclaimed by music faultfinders since its discharge. Robert Christgau, checking on in "The Village Voice", gave the collection "An" and depicted it as "increasingly reliable and progressively unpredictable" than its antecedent. He included that it "hops directly out of the speakers at you". "Moving Stone" magazine's John Swenson trusted the exchange among the three vocalists was one of the collection's most satisfying components; he expressed, "Notwithstanding the wearisome postponement in completing the record, "Bits of gossip" demonstrates that the accomplishment of "Fleetwood Mac" was no fluke." In a survey for "The New York Times", John Rockwell said the collection is "a wonderful circle, and one expectations the open considers in this way, as well", while Dave Marsh of the "St. Petersburg Times" asserted the melodies are "as amazingly polished as anything at this moment". Robert Hilburn was less responsive and called "Gossipy tidbits" a "frustratingly uneven" record in his audit for the "Los Angeles Times", while Juan Rodriguez of "The Gazette" proposed that, while the music is "crisper and more clear", Fleetwood Mac's thoughts are "somewhat increasingly obfuscated". The collection completed fourth in "The Village Voice"s 1977 Pazz and Jop faultfinders' survey, which totaled the votes of several unmistakable commentators.
