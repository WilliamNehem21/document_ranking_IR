By 1919, James had kicked the bucket in office and Governor Augustus Owsley Stanley was chosen to his empty seat. The disruptive denial issue and ongoing Republican gains in the state made the Democratic gubernatorial essential exceptionally compelling. Stanley was the pioneer of the gathering's enemies of prohibitionists. Prohibitionists, driven by previous representative J. C. W. Beckham, did not bolster James D. Dark, who moved toward becoming representative when Stanley went to the Senate and was looking for re-appointment. At the season of Black's race as lieutenant senator in 1915, he had favored the prohibitionists; he was picked to keep running with Stanley to adjust the gathering's ticket, so the counter prohibitionists did not by any stretch of the imagination trust him either. Endeavoring to join the gathering and keep a Republican triumph, Black welcomed Barkley, who had not been connected to either pioneer regardless of his help for restriction, to be impermanent executive of the 1919 state Democratic tradition. Barkley's tradition address assaulted Republicans and applauded the Democrats' record without making reference to denial, however numerous in the Beckham group would not acknowledge Black, and he was vanquished in the general race by Republican Edwin P. Morrow. Leading the tradition acquainted Barkley with state political pioneers outside the First District.
