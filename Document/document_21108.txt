I-94 enters Michigan from Indiana south of New Buffalo. The freeway runs northeasterly through rural Michiana farmland in the southwestern corner of the Lower Peninsula and parallels the Lake Michigan shoreline about inland. I-94 traverses an area just east of the Warren Dunes State Park as the freeway runs parallel to the Red Arrow Highway, a former routing of US HighwayÂ 12 (USÂ 12) named after the 32nd Infantry Division (Red Arrow Division). The freeway crosses its companion highway south of St. Joseph; Red Arrow turns northward carrying the business loop for Benton Harbor and St. Joseph (Business Loop I-94, BL I-94). The Interstate curves further inland to bridge the St. Joseph River near Riverview Park. East of Benton Harbor, I-94 meets the Napier Avenue interchange, where USÂ 31 merges onto the freeway. East of the Southwest Michigan Regional Airport, I-94/USÂ 31 meets the southern end of I-196; USÂ 31 departs the I-94 freeway to follow I-196, and I-94 continues its course away from Lake Michigan.
South of Coloma, the trunkline turns eastward and roughly follows the Paw Paw River on a course that takes it south of Watervliet and Hartford. Between the latter two cities, the freeway transitions from northeastern Berrien County into western Van Buren County. It curves around and between Lake Cora and Threemile Lake near the junction with the northern end of M-51. About further east, I-94 crosses M-40 south of Paw Paw. Continuing eastward, the Interstate runs south of Mattawan before entering western Kalamazoo County.
