Albeit no warships secured the escort, Commodore Dance realized that posts could, from a separation, botch an extensive East Indiaman for a ship of the line. He raised banners that showed that his armada included piece of the Royal Navy squadron working in the Indian Ocean at the time and shaped into a line of fight. Despite the fact that Linois' boats were obviously prevalent, the British response scared him and he rapidly severed battle. Move proceeded with his ploy, seeking after Linois for two hours until the body of the escort was sheltered. Ruler George III knighted Dance for his strength and different commercial and devoted associations granted him huge totals of cash, while both Linois' very own officers and the Emperor Napoleon by and by rebuked the French chief of naval operations for his inability to press the assault against a more fragile and incredibly significant adversary. In spite of the fact that he stayed in order of the squadron for an additional two years and had some minor accomplishment against undefended dealer ships, he endured a series of annihilations and uncertain commitment against more fragile British maritime powers. Unexpectedly, Linois was caught at the Action of 13 March 1806 by a numerically prevalent British fight squadron that he confused with a vendor escort.
