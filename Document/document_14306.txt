Amid the introduction of proof against her, Mary separated and pointed critically at Walsingham saying, "the majority of this is crafted by Monsieur de Walsingham for my annihilation", to which he answered, "God is my observer that as a private individual I have done nothing dishonorable of a fair man, and as Secretary of State, nothing unbefitting my obligation." Mary was discovered blameworthy and the warrant for her execution was drafted, yet Elizabeth delayed to sign it, in spite of weight from Walsingham. Walsingham wrote to Paulet asking him to discover "some approach to abbreviate the life" of Mary to assuage Elizabeth of the weight, to which Paulet answered resentfully, "God prohibit that I should make so foul a wreck of my inner voice, or leave so extraordinary a blotch to my poor successors, to shed blood without law or warrant." Walsingham made courses of action for Mary's execution; Elizabeth marked the warrant on 1 February 1587 and endowed it to William Davison, who had been selected as junior Secretary of State in late September 1586. Davison passed the warrant to Cecil and a privy board assembled by Cecil without Elizabeth's information consented to do the sentence when was handy. Inside seven days, Mary was guillotined. On becoming aware of the execution, Elizabeth asserted not to have endorsed the activity and that she had not implied Davison to part with the warrant. Davison was captured and detained in the Tower of London. A lot of Elizabeth's dismay was little since he was missing from court, at home sick, in the weeks just when the execution. Davison was in the end discharged in October 1588, on the requests of Cecil and Walsingham.
