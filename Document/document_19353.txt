The authenticity of the 1975 album was questioned by a reviewer of the remastered version of The Band's "Music from Big Pink", issued in 2000. Dave Hopkins noted that "Katie's Been Gone", which appears as a bonus track on the "Big Pink" reissue, is the same recording that appeared on "The Basement Tapes", but now "in stereo and with improved sound quality beyond what the remastering process alone would provide". Hopkins declared, "The cat's out of the bag: 'Katie' and the other Band-only tracks on "The Basement Tapes" must have been intentionally muddied in the studio in 1975 so that they would fit better alongside the Dylan material recorded in the basement with a home reel-to-reel." Heylin also takes exception to Robertson's passing off The Band's songs as originating from the basement sessions. By including eight Band recordings to Dylan's sixteen, he says, "Robertson sought to imply that the alliance between Dylan and The Band was far more equal than it was: 'Hey, we were writing all these songs, doing our own thing, oh and Bob would sometimes come around and we'd swap a few tunes.'" Heylin asserts that "though revealing in their own right, The Band tracks only pollute the official set and reduce its stature."
