William II kicked the bucket in a chasing mishap on 2 August 1100. His more youthful sibling Henry quickly rode to Winchester and had himself delegated lord before his senior sibling, Robert Curthose, could guarantee the royal position. Despite the fact that Urse did not validate the contract Henry issued after he caught the position of royalty, Urse was at court in the blink of an eye a while later. At the point when Robert Curthose attacked England in 1101 trying to take the English position of royalty, Urse bolstered Henry. Urse was available at the court held at Winchester on 2 August 1101, when a harmony settlement was sanctioned between the siblings. Amid Henry's rule, the lord regranted Urse's properties to him, with some of them presently conceded as an occupant in-boss when already Urse had held those grounds as an under-inhabitant, and not straightforwardly from the ruler. Urse's properties at Salwarpe were recently held by Roger of Montgomery, however were allowed to Urse as an immediate occupant of the lord when Roger's child, Robert of Belesme, was prohibited in 1102. Urse kept on bearing witness to a large number of Henry's sanctions until 1108, despite the fact that he didn't utilize the title of "constable" in those contracts.
