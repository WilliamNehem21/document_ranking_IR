Horrocks kept on serving in the military after the war, at first as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, getting substantive advancement to lieutenant-general in 1946, with position predated to 29 December 1944. He quickly told the British Army of the Rhine, until he became sick in August 1948; he was invalided out of the administration from the get-go in January 1949 by the waiting impacts of the injuries he had gotten in North Africa. Elevated to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the King's Birthday Honors that year, he filled in as Honorary Colonel of a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Artillery. In 1949 he was named Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, a post customarily held by resigned officers; this arrangement was affirmed on the promotion of Elizabeth II in 1952. Dark Rod has the obligation of directing the organization of the House of Lords, controlling admission to it, and partaking in functions. In 1957, Horrocks had the bizarre obligation of requesting Vivien Leigh out of the House when she intruded on procedures to argue that the St James' Theater be spared from annihilation. On different events, on the grounds that the Black Rod needed to stay set up amid long discussions, Horrocks eased his fatigue by finishing football pools coupons. This had the upside of looking like note-taking to the amassed masters. Horrocks held the post of Black Rod until 1963.
