Following a couple of months, Elgar left the specialist to set out on a melodic profession, giving piano and violin exercises and working infrequently in his dad's shop. He was a functioning individual from the Worcester Glee club, alongside his dad, and he went with artists, played the violin, created and orchestrated works, and led out of the blue. Pollitzer trusted that, as a musician, Elgar could be one of the main soloists in the nation, however Elgar himself, having heard driving virtuosi at London shows, felt his own violin playing did not have a full enough tone, and he surrendered his aspirations to be a soloist. At twenty-two he took up the post of director of the chaperons' band at the Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum in Powick, from Worcester. The band comprised of: piccolo, woodwind, clarinet, two cornets, euphonium, three or four first and a comparative number of second violins, intermittent viola, cello, twofold bass and piano. Elgar trained the players and composed and orchestrated their music, including quadrilles and polkas, for the irregular blend of instruments. "The Musical Times" stated, "This functional experience turned out to be of the best an incentive to the youthful artist. ... He gained a useful learning of the capacities of these distinctive instruments. ... He in this way became more acquainted with personally the tone shading, the intricate details of these and numerous different instruments." He held the post for a long time, from 1879, making a trip to Powick once per week. Another post he held in his initial days was educator of the violin at the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.
