In 837, Theophilos choseÃ¢ÂÂat the asking of the hard-squeezed BabakÃ¢ÂÂto exploit the Caliphate's distraction with the concealment of the Khurramite revolt and lead a noteworthy battle against the outskirts emirates. He gathered an extremely substantial armed force, somewhere in the range of 70,000 battling men and 100,000 altogether as per al-Tabari, and attacked Arab region around the upper Euphrates practically unopposed. The Byzantines took the towns of Sozopetra and Arsamosata, assaulted and looted the farmland, removed payoff from a few urban areas in return for not assaulting them, and crushed various littler Arab powers. While Theophilos returned home to praise a triumph and be acclaimed in the Hippodrome of Constantinople as the "unique hero", the exiles from Sozopetra started touching base at Mu'tasim's capital, Samarra. The caliphal court was insulted by the mercilessness and sass of the assaults: not just had the Byzantines acted in open agreement with the Khurramite rebels, however amid the sack of SozopetraÃ¢ÂÂwhich a few sources guarantee as Mu'tasim's very own originÃ¢ÂÂevery male detainee were executed and the rest sold into servitude, and some hostage ladies were assaulted by Theophilos' Khurramites. Theophilos' battle was not able, be that as it may, to spare Babak and his adherents, who in late 837 were constrained from their mountain fortresses by the general Afshin. Babak fled to Armenia, however was sold out to the Abbasids and kicked the bucket of torment.
