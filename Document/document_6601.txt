The epic's language is seen as overflowing with naming and item situations. Postmodern scholar Fredric Jameson calls it "a sort of advertised up name-dropping ... [where] an all encompassing nature with the designs ... [creates] class status as an issue of knowing the score instead of having cash and power". He likewise calls it "postmodern nominalism" in that the names express the new and elegant. This name-dropping shows how corporate greed has made and named new items and encounters and renamed (or re-made) some that previously existed. This naming incorporates nationalities; there are eight references to nationality (or region) in the initial three pages. Zeidner composed that the novel's "new century is unsettlingly transitional making it hard to keep up an individual character". One character contends that "there will before long be no national personality left Ã¢ÂÂ¦ [as] all experience [will be] discounted, by the otherworldly hand of advertising, to value point minor departure from something very similar." This is compared against the recording that contains no clues of timeframe or area. Globalization is spoken to by characters of differing nationalities, simplicity of universal travel, convenient moment correspondence, and business monoculture unmistakable crosswise over worldwide markets. For instance, Gibson composes how one 'yes or no' choice by Cayce on the logo will affect the lives of the general population in remote spots who will make the logos and how it will contaminate their fantasies.
