As per David Prior, maker of the consequent two-plate uncommon release, the underlying stripped down version "was just reluctantly consented to by Fincher on the grounds that I required additional time on the reward material. The studio was bolted into their discharge date, so Fincher enabled that form to be discharged first. It had nothing to do with Fincher 'twofold plunging his own film before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with purchasing more opportunity for the exceptional version". He expressed that the showy cut would just be accessible on the single-circle release. Earlier explained further: "No one needs fans feeling like they're being exploited, and I realize that twofold plunging makes that impression. That is the reason it was so essential to me that customers be told there was another rendition coming. For this situation it truly was two difficult situations circumstance, and postponing the second discharge was done carefully to support the last item... In any case, this is an aspiring task, effectively the most broad I've at any point dealt with, and owing to a great extent to studio disasters that I can't generally expound on, I didn't have enough time to do it appropriately. In this way Fincher got me the additional time by consenting to an amazed discharge, which I'm appreciative for". In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.
