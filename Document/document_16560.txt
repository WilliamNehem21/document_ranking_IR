Despite the report produced by the Office of Intelligence Research, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version of the history of the Ãrbenz government and the coup was not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Ãrbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who was in the process of completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Schneider published "Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954" in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the "ComitÃ©" was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the "ComitÃ©", nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that he gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.
