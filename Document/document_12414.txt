In any case, in 1978 Ronald Lightbown, Keeper of Metalwork at the V&A Museum, dismissed this hypothesis on elaborate grounds, taking into account that the glass more likely than not been made just quickly before it showed up in Charles VI's stock in 1391. He says that "in 1380 figure-style was a delicately undulating, streaming style, with slim extended figures and much utilization of serpentine or bending folds in the drapery, and with trailing dresses finishing off with twisted Gothic fix lines"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂa style that can be found in the smaller than expected of the crowning ceremony of CharlesÃÂ VI in 1380 outlined previously. Conversely, Lightbown says "the figures on the container are wide, some may even be called stocky, with delicate drapery of round and hollow structure, or of smooth, tight blueprints. The folds are cylindrical and the stitches of the robes are honest with no waving, trailing plots. The style in reality is the 'Italianate' way which created in France because of contact with 'trecento' craftsmanship, and not the simply Northern Gothic International way." This view was dismissed in 1981 by Neil Stratford, previous Keeper of Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, who indicated various original copy enlightenments in a comparable style that date from sooner than 1390. John Cherry, another previous Keeper of the medieval accumulations at the British Museum, still exhibits the more established dating in a work of 2010, and the British Museum site dates the container to "about 1370Ã¢ÂÂ 1380".
