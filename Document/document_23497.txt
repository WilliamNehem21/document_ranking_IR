Much of the music Tippett composed following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the "Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli" (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's birth. The "Fantasia" would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though "The Times"s critic lamented the "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writingÂ ... there was so much going on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a "difficult" composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the premiÃ¨re by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the "Sonata for Four Horns" (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premiÃ¨red by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in "The Times", writing that it "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.
