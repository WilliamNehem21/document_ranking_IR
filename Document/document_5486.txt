In mid 1940, Farnsworth Wright was supplanted as proofreader of "Odd Tales" by Dorothy McIlwraith, who likewise altered "Short Stories". McIlwraith had no specific mastery in the loathsomeness field and, in spite of the fact that she was a capable proofreader, the Wright period is commonly considered to have been "Odd Tales" prime. With Wright's takeoff, "Obscure" rapidly turned into the main magazine in its little field. "Obscure" procured a stable of normal authors, a significant number of whom were likewise showing up in "Astonishing", and every one of whom were alright with the meticulousness that Campbell requested even of a dream plot. Visit benefactors included L. Ron Hubbard, Theodore Sturgeon, and L. Sprague de Camp, who, in a joint effort with Fletcher Pratt, contributed three anecdotes about an existence where enchantment works by sensible standards. The accounts were later gathered as a major aspect of Pratt and de Camp's "Incompleat Enchanter" arrangement; John Clute has remarked that the title of one of them, "The Mathematics of Magic", is "consummately expressive of the terms under which enchantment found simple notice in "Obscure"". Different stories still viewed as works of art incorporate "They" by Heinlein, "Smoke Ghost" by Fritz Leiber, alongside a few stories in Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser arrangement, and "Issue With Water" by H.L. Gold. "Obscure's" impact was expansive; as per Ashley, the magazine made the cutting edge class of imagination, and sci-fi researcher Thomas Clareson proposes that by pulverizing the class limits among sf and dream it permitted stories, for example, Simak's City arrangement to be composed. Clareson additionally suggests that "Cosmic system Science Fiction" and "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction", two of the most essential and effective sci-fi and dream magazines, were immediate relatives of "Obscure".
