After his administration with the Navy, Armstrong came back to Purdue. His recently earned great yet not extraordinary evaluations currently improved, lifting his last Grade Point Average (GPA) to a decent yet not exceptional 4.8 out of 6.0. He swore the Phi Delta Theta club, and lived in its society house. He composed and co-coordinated two musicals as a feature of the all-understudy revue. The first was a variant of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves", co-coordinated with his better half Joanne Alford from the Alpha Chi Omega sorority, with melodies from the Walt Disney film, including "Some time or another My Prince Will Come"; the second was titled "The Land of Egelloc" ("school" spelled in reverse), with music from Gilbert and Sullivan yet new verses. He was director of the Purdue Aero Flying Club, and flew the club's air ship, an Aeronca and two or three Pipers, which were kept at close-by Aretz Airport in Lafayette, Indiana. Flying the Aeronca to Wapakoneta in 1954, he harmed it in a harsh arriving in a rancher's field, and it must be pulled back to Lafayette on a trailer. He was a baritone player in the Purdue All-American Marching Band. After ten years he was made a privileged individual from Kappa Psi national band privileged clique. Armstrong graduated with a Bachelor of Science qualification in Aeronautical Engineering in January 1955. In 1970 he finished his Master of Science certificate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC). He would in the end be granted privileged doctorates by a few colleges.
