Among present day and twentieth-century researchers, Cuthbert Girdlestone states that the concerto "is in all regards one of [Mozart's] most prominent; we would fain say: "the" best, were it not difficult to pick between four or five of them." Referring to the "dim, grievous and enthusiastic" nature of the concerto, Alfred Einstein expresses that "it is difficult to envision the demeanor on the essences of the Viennese open" when Mozart debuted the work. The musicologist Simon P. Keefe, in an exposition of the majority of Mozart's piano concertos, composes that the No. 24 is "a climactic and finishing work in Mozart's piano concerto "oeuvre", immovably connected to its forerunners, yet definitively rising above them in the meantime." The decision of the Mozart researcher Alexander Hyatt King is that the concerto is "not just the most heavenly of the entire arrangement yet in addition one of the best pianoforte concertos ever formed". Arthur Hutchings' view is that "whatever esteem we put upon any single development from the Mozart concertos, we will discover no work more prominent as a concerto than this K. 491, for Mozart never composed a work whose parts were so without a doubt those of 'one dynamite entirety'."
