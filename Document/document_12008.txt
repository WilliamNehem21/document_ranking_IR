In spite of the fact that visitor performing artist Leonard Nimoy was hesitant to return in the wake of finishing his three-scene responsibility on the demonstrate that had finished with the season's tenth scene, he returned for the season finale when the makers "basically rung him and argued". They talked about their arrangements for the character, and "disclosed to him it was a story we couldn't tell without him." He "charitably concurred." "Over yonder" denoted Nimoy's longest appearance on "Periphery", a more extended and "considerably more involv[ed]" shoot of approximately seven days was required. In spite of Leonard Nimoy's arranged exit from the show, the show's makers have said that nothing is last in the "Periphery" world. Pinkner remarked that Nimoy's retirement from acting clearly obstructs his character's conceivable return in any case, "if Leonard returns, there is a story set up that we'd love to tell." Wyman expounded that "I believe any reasonable person would agree that you have not encountered the remainder of William Bell". At the point when the makers revealed to Nimoy their thoughts for Bell's storyline in the third season, he returned for some concise voice and liveliness work in the scene "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide".
