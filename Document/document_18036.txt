Under German occupation, the professions of Polish journalists and writers were virtually eliminated, as they had little opportunity to publish their work. The Underground State's Department of Culture sponsored various initiatives and individuals, enabling them to continue their work and aiding in their publication. Novels and anthologies were published by underground presses; over 1,000 worksÂ were published underground over the course of the war. Literary discussions were held, and prominent writers of the period working in Poland included, among others, Krzysztof Kamil BaczyÅski, Leslaw Bartelski, Tadeusz Borowski, Tadeusz Boy-Å»eleÅski, Maria DÄbrowska, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, JarosÅaw Iwaszkiewicz, future Nobel Prize winner CzesÅaw MiÅosz, Zofia NaÅkowska, Jan Parandowski, Leopold Staff, Kazimierz Wyka, and Jerzy Zawieyski. Writers wrote about the difficult conditions in the prisoner-of-war camps (Konstanty Ildefons GaÅczyÅski, Stefan Flukowski, Leon Kruczkowski, Andrzej Nowicki and Marian PiechaÅa), the ghettos, and even from inside the concentration camps (Jan Maria Gisges, Halina GoÅczowa, Zofia GÃ³rska (Romanowiczowa), Tadeusz HoÅuj, Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski and Marian Kubicki). Many writers did not survive the war, among them Krzysztof Kamil BaczyÅski, WacÅaw Berent, Tadeusz Boy-Å»eleÅski, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, Stefan KiedrzyÅski, Janusz Korczak, Halina Krahelska, Tadeusz Hollender, Witold Hulewicz, Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski, WÅodzimierz Pietrzak, Leon Pomirowski, Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer and Bruno Schulz.
