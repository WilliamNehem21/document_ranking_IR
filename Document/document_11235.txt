Locke expressed "A few Thoughts Concerning Education" in light of his companion Samuel Clarke's question on the most proficient method to instruct his child, so the content's "main point", as Locke states toward the start, "is the means by which a youthful noble man ought to be raised from his early stages." This training "won't so flawlessly suit the training of "girls"; however where the distinction of sex requires diverse treatment, it will be no hard issue to recognize" (Locke's accentuation). This section recommends that, for Locke, training was essentially the equivalent for peopleÃ¢ÂÂthere were just little, evident contrasts for ladies. This translation is bolstered by a letter he kept in touch with Mrs. Clarke in 1685 expressing that "since in this manner I recognize no distinction of sex in your brain relating ... to truth, excellence and compliance, I think well to have no thing changed in it based on what is [writ for the son]." Martin Simons expresses that Locke "proposed, both by suggestion and unequivocally, that a kid's instruction ought to be along the lines previously pursued by certain young ladies of the savvy polished classes." Rather than sending young men to schools which would overlook their individual needs and show them little of significant worth, Locke contends that they ought to be educated at home as young ladies as of now were and "ought to learn valuable and important artworks of the house and domain." Like his contemporary Mary Astell, Locke trusted that ladies could and ought to be educated to be normal and righteous.
