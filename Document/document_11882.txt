Between August 1943 and February 1945, the thirteenth Airborne Division stayed in the United States and did not serve abroad or take an interest in any airborne activities, as it started preparing to turn into a battle prepared development. In correlation, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had been alloted as dynamic battle developments to serve abroad in Europe, the eleventh Airborne Division was planned to be sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations, and the seventeenth Airborne Division had been relegated as the United States vital hold arrangement. Amid this period, the exercises of the division fundamentally included airborne preparing, just as participating in a few preparing works out. In any case, while airborne preparing for the initial four American airborne divisions was led amid 1943, the thirteenth experienced extensive troubles when it went to its turn for preparing. By the most recent couple of long stretches of 1943 the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had led airborne activities and completed their preparation, and had then been exchanged to Europe; to guarantee the divisions could direct airborne tasks, a larger part of the vehicle flying machine accessible in the United States had been sent with them, and much more were exchanged to Europe as substitutions after the American airborne arrivals in Normandy in June 1944. Therefore, not very many transport airplane were accessible for use by the thirteenth, and the first preparing activity for the division that had been planned for June 1944 must be delayed until 17 September, and afterward indeed until 24 September.
