They see Michael running bare from the pool and pursue him; when they guide him to quit running, Michael distinguishes himself as a criminologist. In the interim, in the "green reality", Accountant Marcus Ananyev (Elijah Alexander) leaves his home and makes a telephone call. Marcus then strolls over to his vehicle and attempts to begin it, yet sees a bomb in the vehicle's motor and flees right away before it detonates. Before long, at the police headquarters, Michael and Bird reveal to Marcus that they will ensure him. Marcus' better half, Alina (Ayelet Zurer), comes into the station, where Marcus clarifies what has occurred. Soon after conversing with Marcus and Alina, Michael and Bird take the couple to a lodging for transitory haven. In the "red reality", Michael sees Hannah tidying up and pressing things before they move to Oregon. Before long, Michael takes Vega to meet his private source (CI), Jake (Steve Lawrence), with whom he will work after Michael leaves. Jake does not have any desire to work with Vega for an obscure reason, however gives the pair a tip about a distribution center.
