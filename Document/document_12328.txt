Benjamin was the first U.S. representative to affirm the Jewish confidence. In 1845, David Yulee, conceived David Levy, had been confirmed for Florida, however he denied Judaism and in the long run formally changed over to Christianity. As a grown-up, Benjamin was a neglectful Jew, who was not an individual from a synagogue and took no part in mutual undertakings. He once in a while discussed his religion freely, yet was not embarrassed about it. A portion of the accounts recounted Benjamin that address his confidence originate from Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who related that Benjamin conveyed a location in a San Francisco synagogue on Yom Kippur in 1860, however whether this happened is available to address as Wise was not there and it was not announced in the city's Jewish paper. One statement from Senate banter that remaining parts "some portion of the Benjamin legend", as indicated by Evans, pursued a mention to Moses as a more liberated of slaves by a Northern representative, implying that Benjamin was an "Israelite in Egyptian dress". Benjamin should have answered, "The facts demonstrate that I am a Jew, and when my progenitors were getting their Ten Commandments from the quick hand of divinity, in the midst of the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the predecessors of my adversary were crowding swine in the woodlands of Great Britain."
