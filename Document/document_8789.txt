The head piece is made of iron, presently rusted. The top contains an imprint, and demonstrates the rusted impression of what used to be a woven and likely vivid or designed texture. From ear to ear around the brow runs an overlaid diadem in the picture of a shrub wreath, a customary image of triumph. Each side contains thirteen components, every one of three leaves and two berries. The leaves are worked in repoussÃÂ©, and emerge in solid alleviation with about straight dividers. Over the focal point of the diadem is a rosette; it demonstrates a blossom with two lines, every one of six petals, and an external beaded fringe. The beading and the external line of petals are in white silver, standing out from the overlaying of the internal column, the foundation, and the focal bolt securing the rosette to the head piece. A limited fluted strip filling in as a peak, smooth silver with beaded edges, keeps running down the center of the head piece from the rosette to the neck monitor. The relative straightforwardness and mediocrity of artisanship communicated by the peak and rosette may reflect fixes made locally, far from the extravagance workshops of Antioch; not at all like with the diadem, for instance, the foundation of the rosette was not painstakingly punched down, however was straightened with a rounded instrument and now exhibits as a progression of rings.
