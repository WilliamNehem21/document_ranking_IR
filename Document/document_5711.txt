At Handschuhsheim, Klenau told a mounted detachment that incorporated the six squadrons of the fourth Cuirassiers Regiment "Hohenzollern", two squadrons of the third Dragoon Regiment "Kaiser", six squadrons of the 44th Hussar regiment "Szeckler", and four squadrons of the French "ÃÂ©migrÃÂ©" regiment "Allemand". On 24 September 1795, seeing the French, with five units and a regiment of Chasseurs overpowering the troops of General Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza, Klenau immediately composed his own detachment into three segments and assaulted. In a fight winning charge, Klenau's detachment (around 4,000 men) scattered the French divisions of Charles Pichegru's Army of the Upper Rhine, under the direction of General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour. His mounted force got Dufour's whole division in the open, scattered Dufour's six squadrons of Chasseurs, and chop down Dufour's infantry. With lost 193 men and 54 steeds, the Austrians perpetrated more than 1,500 French setbacks, including 1,000 slaughtered; they additionally caught eight firearms, nine ammo caissons and their groups, and General Dufour himself. In the activity, General of Brigade Dusirat was injured, as was Dufour before his catch. Extra Austrian misfortunes included 35 men and 58 ponies murdered, six officers, 144 men and 78 steeds injured, and two men and three steeds missing. For his job in this adventure, Klenau was elevated to colonel and granted the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. At Handschuhsheim, as he had prior at Zemon, Klenau showed his "higher military calling," setting up himself as a fearless, steady, and snappy reasoning field officer.
