As indicated by Nancy Keefe Rhodes of "Stone Canoe", a U.S. artistic diary, the film's crowds are probably going to have the predisposition that human dealing isn't subjection in a similar sense that the Atlantic slave exchange was, and numerous individuals trust that subjugation was abrogated quite a while back with so much instruments as the U.S. Liberation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes composes that society presently utilizes "subjugation" in current settings just as an analogy, with the goal that references to genuine contemporary servitude can be rejected as metaphor, and she portrays the film's objective as to "recover the first term [slavery] and persuade us that what's going on now is the thing that happened at that point: very sorted out and unavoidable, deliberate, exceptionally productive andÃÂ ... completely as coercive and wantonly unfeeling." Rhodes says that "bondage" has begun to be utilized in its unique sense again as of late, yet that groups of onlookers' perspectives on contemporary subjugation are in any case affected by the slave-like symbolism in such movies as "Hustle and Flow" (2005) and "Dark Snake Moan" (2007). The Academy Award-winning "Hustle and Flow" depicts a pimp as the saint, while "Dark Snake Moan" highlights Christina Ricci as a youthful nymphomaniac; the showcasing for "Dark Snake Moan" focused on suggestive, sexualized slave symbolism, including a sparsely clad Ricci in chains. As per Rhodes, Bilheimer "rescue[s] current slaves from portrayal as outlandish animals, to reestablish their mankind" and enable groups of onlookers to identify with them. For this reason, Bilheimer recounts accounts of people with regards to their networks and families. While Bilheimer had recently done broad social equity work with religious associations, he didn't convert in the film, regardless of the numerous open doors the film managed him to do as such.
