Tilden went through the following four years as the hypothetical Democratic applicant in 1880. In 1879, he declined to keep running for another term as senator and concentrated rather on structure support for the 1880 presidential designation. He thought about a large number of his previous companions (counting Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware) adversaries now for their help of the Electoral Commission, and tried to keep the "extortion of '76" in the spotlight and polish his own future application by having his congressional partners examine the occasions of the post-decision moving. For ten months starting in May 1878, the Potter Committee, led by Democratic Congressman Clarkson Nott Potter of New York, examined claims of extortion and debasement in the states which had challenged appointive votes in 1876. As opposed to deliver convincing proof of Republican misbehavior, as Tilden's supporters trusted, the board of trustees absolved Tilden of bad behavior, however revealed clashing proof that indicated state race authorities of the two gatherings in a negative light. This, and Tilden's declining wellbeing, made numerous Democrats question his office. All things considered, Tilden's assumed capacity to convey New York, joined with his political association and individual fortune, made him a genuine contender.
