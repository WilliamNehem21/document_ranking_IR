The Kirkwood Formation is in South Africa, and numerous fossils of various species and genera have been found in it, with "Paranthodon" being the principal revealed. The arrangement is of a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age, with the most seasoned stores from the Tithonian, about 145.5 million years back, and the most youthful rocks being from the Valanginian, around 130 million years prior. The particular vertebrate-bearing segment of the development is roughly level with the upper district of the Sundays River Formation, which has been dated to 139 to 131 mya dependent on microfossils. An expansive wide range of creature bunches have been found in the arrangement, including dinosaurs, no less than two distinctive sphenodontian reptiles, numerous teleost angles, a couple crocodylians, some frog examples, and furthermore turtles. Nonetheless, a lot of the material of the Kirkwood development just incorporates segregated teeth or halfway and fragmentary bits of bone. Dinosaurs of the development incorporate a basal tetanuran, the crude ornithomimosaurian "Nqwebasaurus", the sauropod "Algoasaurus", a potential titanosaurian, numerous ornithischians including "Paranthodon", a variety of iguanodontian, and a "hypsilophodontid" (the family Hypsilophodontidae is never again viewed as a characteristic gathering). Different extra sauropod taxa have been found, including a basal eusauropod, a brachiosaurid, a dicraeosaurid and a determined diplodocid.
