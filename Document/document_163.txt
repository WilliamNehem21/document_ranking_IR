In spite of the fact that ex-Confederates were commonly a sheltered casting a ballot alliance for Democrats, Goebel couldn't intensely depend on them in view of his dad's connections to the Union. Likewise, in 1895, Goebel had executed John Sanford, an ex-Confederate, in a duel originating from an individual debate between the two men. This made him especially nefarious to Brown supporter Theodore Hallum, a companion of Sanford's, who said of Goebel at a crusade rally in Bowling Green "[W]hen the Democratic Party of Kentucky, in tradition gathered, sees fit in its shrewdness to name a yellow canine for the governorship of this extraordinary state, I will bolster him Ã¢ÂÂ yet lower than that you will not drag me." Goebel endeavored to relieve his tepid help from ex-Confederates by seeking the dark vote, long given to the Republicans, however he needed to do as such cautiously to keep away from further estranging his very own gathering base. In contrast to different Democrats, Goebel had not casted a ballot on the Separate Coach Bill, a law that required blacks and whites to utilize isolated railroad offices. Most blacks contradicted the bill, and Goebel endeavored to stay quiet on the issue, yet when squeezed, he conceded in a crusade occasion in Cloverport that he bolstered the bill and would restrict its nullification. In like manner, Taylor had attempted to evade the issue of the Separate Coach Bill to abstain from annoying the "lily white" part of his gathering, however seven days after Goebel took a situation for the bill, Taylor emerged as an opponent of it. This denoted a defining moment in the crusade, as blacks, at first cool toward Taylor, presently effectively bolstered him.
