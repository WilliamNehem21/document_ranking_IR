Paetus was an inadequate leader and endured an embarrassing thrashing at the Battle of Rhandeia in 62, losing the armies of XII "Fulminata" instructed by Calvisius Sabinus and IV "Scythica" directed by Lucius Funisulanus Vettonianus. The order of the troops was come back to Corbulo, who the next year drove a solid armed force into Melitene and past into Armenia, dispensing with the majority of the territorial governors he suspected were star Parthian. At long last in Rhandeia, Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a harmony understanding. The area of Rhandeia fit both Tiridates I and Corbulo. It spoke to Tiridates I since that is the place his military had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation; then again, it engaged Corbulo in light of the fact that he was going to clear out the reputation rife with scandal earned before in a similar area. At the point when Tiridates I touched base at the Roman camp he removed his imperial diadem and put it on the ground close to a statue of Nero, consenting to get it back just from Nero in Rome. Tiridates I was perceived as the vassal ruler of Armenia; a Roman army would stay in the nation for all time, in Sophene while Artaxata would be remade. Corbulo left his child in-law Lucius Annius Vinicianus to go with Tiridates I to Rome so as to confirm his very own loyalty to Nero.
