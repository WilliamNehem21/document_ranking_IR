He exchanged to the Royal Australian Air Force as a flight lieutenant in March 1921, getting to be one of its unique twenty-one officers.

Squadron Leader Cole was presented on England in 1923Ã¢ÂÂ 24 to go to RAF Staff College, Andover, coming back to Australia in 1925 to progress toward becoming Director of Personnel and Training.
