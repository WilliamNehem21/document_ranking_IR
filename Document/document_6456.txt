Subtleties from the VrbaÃ¢ÂÂ Wetzler report started to show up somewhere else in the media. On 4 June 1944 the "New York Times" covered the "merciless homicide" of Hungary's Jews. On 16 June the "Jewish Chronicle" in London ran a story by Isaac Gruenbaum of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem with the feature "Bomb concentration camps"; the essayist had unmistakably observed the VrbaÃ¢ÂÂ Wetzler report. Likewise on 16 June the BBC's German administration revealed the homicide in March of the Czech family camp, and referenced the second Czech gathering the VrbaÃ¢ÂÂ Wetzler report showed would be killed nearby 20 June, with a notice that "[a]ll those in charge of such slaughters from top downwards will be reprimanded." A 22-line story on page five of the "New York Times", "Czechs report slaughter", gave an account of 20 June that 7,000 Jews had been "hauled to gas chambers in the infamous German death camps at Birkenau and OÃÂwiÃÂcim [Auschwitz]". Walter Garrett, the Swiss journalist, of the Exchange Telegraph, a British news organization, sent four dispatches to London on 24 June with subtleties from the report, including Vrba's gauge that 1,715,000 Jews had been killed. Garrett got the data from George Mantello.
