The hidden coal measures all through the ward were an important wellspring of fuel. Radcliffe as of now had a built up material industry before the entry of steam control. The principal recorded occurrence of coal getting in the North West of England was in 1246, when Adam de Radeclyve was fined for burrowing "de minera" on normal land in the Radcliffe region. Coal outcroppings were normal; as of late as 1936 individuals from the open were seen diverting extensive bits of coal from a crease uncovered by the landslip caused when the Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal ruptured at Ladyshore. Mining was at first constrained to chime pits until the entry of steam motors, which alongside improved ventilation, made conceivable a lot further pits. The most punctual known neighborhood utilization of such a motor was in 1792 at Black Cat Colliery. The area of Radcliffe was once home to the same number of as 50ÃÂ pits, yet with the special cases of Outwood Colliery and Ladyshore Colliery, all were either depleted or shut before the finish of the nineteenth century. Amid the 1926 General Strike many striking excavators wrongfully took coal from uncovered creases around the Coney Green zone of the town, to pitch to neighborhood housewives. During the 1950s toward the north of the town the National Coal Board did some open cast mining close Radcliffe Moor Road, however the last lawful occasion of coal mining in Radcliffe was somewhere in the range of 1931 and 1949, near Bury and Bolton Road.
