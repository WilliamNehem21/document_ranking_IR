The general population of the Marshall Islands highlighted Auriga in the legend of DÃÂ¼mur, which recounts to the account of the making of the sky. Antares in Scorpius speaks to DÃÂ¼mur, the most seasoned child of the stars' mom, and the Pleiades speak to her most youthful child. The mother of the stars, Ligedaner, is spoken to by Capella; she lived on the island of Alinablab. She disclosed to her children that the first to achieve an eastern island would turn into the King of the Stars, and asked DÃÂ¼mur to give her come access his kayak. He won't, as did every one of her children thusly, aside from Pleiades. Pleiades won the race with the assistance of Ligedaner, and turned into the King of the Stars. Somewhere else in the focal Caroline Islands, Capella was designated "Jefegen uun" (varieties incorporate "efang alul", "evang-el-ul", and "iefangel uul"), signifying "north of Aldebaran". Distinctive names were noted for Auriga and Capella in Eastern Pacific social orders. On Pukapuka, the figure of present day Auriga was classified "Te Wale-o-Tutakaiolo" ("The place of Tutakaiolo"); in the Society Islands, it was designated "Faa-nui" ("Great Valley"). Capella itself was designated "Tahi-anii" ("Unique Sovereign") in the Societies. "Hoku-lei" was the name for Capella yet may have been the name for the entire group of stars; the name signifies "Star-wreath" and alludes to one of the spouses of the Pleiades, called "Makalii".
