SRÂ 78 runs concurrently with SRÂ 79 across the headwaters of the San Diego River and through the hamlet of Wynola, briefly entering Cleveland National Forest before reaching Julian and entering the town as Washington Street. The route, still concurrent with SRÂ 79, turns east onto Main Street and travels through downtown Julian before SRÂ 79 diverges south towards Cuyamaca and SR 78 heads northeast as Banner Road. The road intersects with County Route S2 (CRÂ S2) at a junction called Scissors Crossing; CRÂ S2 runs concurrently in a wrong-way concurrency. Shortly afterwards, SRÂ 78 enters Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and is designated as a scenic highway for its length in the state park. Although this route travels many miles south of the town of Borrego Springs, it provides access to the town via CR S3. SR 78 travels through the town of Ocotillo Wells before exiting the state park and entering Imperial County.
In Imperial County, SRÂ 78 intersects with SR 86, running concurrently with it southwest of the Salton Sea and northwest of San Felipe Creek. SRÂ 78 passes through the desert community of Elmore Desert Ranch before entering the city of Westmorland. The route, still concurrent with SRÂ 86, enters into the city of Brawley as Main Street, where SRÂ 86 splits to the south towards El Centro. SRÂ 78 continues north onto the Brawley Bypass, a freeway that passes to the north of downtown Brawley. SR 111 runs concurrently with SRÂ 78 for a short duration before the latter exits from the freeway and continues east.
