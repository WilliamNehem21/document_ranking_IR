Writer Alan Bennett was especially rebuffed by "Witchfinder". In his normal section in "The Listener", distributed eight days after the film's discharge, Bennett clarified how he felt blood and gore movies ought to dependably be "punctuated by paunch giggles" and assaulted Reeves' totally humorless motion picture as "the most constantly savage and ethically spoiled film I have seen. It was a debasing background by which I mean it made me feel messy." Although Reeves was rankled, his reaction showed that he trusted Bennett's response was confirmation that his choice to incorporate such outrageous viciousness was the right way to deal with the material. In his letter distributed in "The Listener", Reeves noted: "Definitely the most improper thing in any type of diversion is the molding of the group of onlookers to acknowledge and appreciate violenceÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ¦ Violence is horrendous, debasing and ignoble. Seeing that one is going to indicate it on the screen by any means, it ought to be exhibited all things consideredÃ¢ÂÂand the more individuals it stuns into sickened acknowledgment of these certainties the better. I wish I could have seen Mr. Bennett hysterically endeavoring to wash away the 'messy' feeling my film gave him. It would have been evidence of the way that "Witchfinder General" fills in as proposed."
