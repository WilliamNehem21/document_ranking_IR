A few pieces of the State Apartments were totally wrecked in the 1992 flame and this territory was modified in a style called "Downesian Gothic", named after the designer, Giles Downes. The style contains "the somewhat stripped, cool and precise intelligibility of innovation sewn into a reinterpretation of the Gothic custom". Downes contends that the style keeps away from "colorful enhancement", underlining a natural, streaming Gothic structure. Three new rooms were constructed or renovated by Downes at Windsor. Downes' new sledge bar top of St George's Hall is the biggest green-oak structure worked since the Middle Ages, and is enlivened with brilliantly shaded shields commending the heraldic component of the Order of the Garter; the plan endeavors to make a hallucination of extra stature through the gothic woodwork along the roof. The Lantern Lobby highlights streaming oak sections shaping a vaulted roof, impersonating an arum lily. The new Private Chapel is moderately little, just ready to fit thirty admirers, however consolidates building components of the St George's Hall rooftop with the Lantern Lobby and the ventured curve structure of the Henry VIII church vaulting at Hampton Court. The outcome is an "uncommon, consistent and firmly shaped net of tracery", supplementing the new recolored glass windows remembering the flame, planned by Joseph Nuttgen. The Great Kitchen, with its recently uncovered fourteenth century rooftop lamp sitting nearby Wyatville's chimneys, smokestacks and Gothic tables, is additionally a result of the reproduction after the flame.
