The extensive size of "Deinosuchus" has by and large been perceived notwithstanding the fragmentary idea of the fossils doled out to it. Be that as it may, evaluations of how extensive it truly was have shifted significantly throughout the years. The first gauge from 1954 for the sort example of the then-named ""Phobosuchus riograndensis"" depended on a skull of and a lower jaw of since quite a while ago, reproduced with comparable extents to the Cuban crocodile giving a complete evaluated length of . In any case, this remaking is at present viewed as erroneous. Utilizing progressively total remains, it was assessed in 1999 that the size accomplished by examples of "Deinosuchus" differed from with loads from . This was later confirmed when it was noticed that most known examples of "D. rugosus" ordinarily had skulls of about with evaluated complete lengths of and loads of . A sensibly all around saved skull example found in Texas showed the creature's head estimated about , and its body length was evaluated at . Be that as it may, the biggest fragmentary survives from "D. riograndensis" were 1.5 occasions the span of those of the normal "D. rugosus" and it was resolved that the biggest people of this species may have been up to long and maybe weighed as much as .
