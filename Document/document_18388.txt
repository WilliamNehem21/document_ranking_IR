The hardback edition of "The Time Traveler's Wife" was published in the United States in September 2003 by MacAdam/Cage and in the United Kingdom by Random House on 1 January 2004. MacAdam/Cage initiated an "extensive marketing drive", including advertising in "The New York Times" and "The New Yorker" and a promotional book tour by Niffenegger. As a result, the novel debuted at number nine on the "New York Times" bestseller list. After popular crime writer Scott Turow, whose wife is a friend of Niffenegger, endorsed it on "The Today Show", the first print run of 15,000 sold out and 100,000 more copies were printed. In Britain, the book received a boost from its choice as a "Richard & Judy" book club recommendationânearly 45,000 copies were sold in one week. It was named the 2003 Amazon.com Book of the Year. A December 2003 article in "The Observer" reported that although "a tiny minority of American reviewers" felt that the novel was "gimmicky", it was still "a publishing sensation". At that point, the novel had been sold to publishers in 15 countries. As of March 2009, it had sold almost 1.5 million copies in the United States and 1 million in the United Kingdom. The success of "The Time Traveler's Wife" prompted almost every major publishing firm to attempt to acquire Niffenegger's second novel, "Her Fearful Symmetry", which has been called "one of the most eagerly sought-after works in recent publishing history". It garnered her an advance of US$5 million from Scribner's.
