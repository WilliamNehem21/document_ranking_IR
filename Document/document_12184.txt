As the Battle of Britain got going in July 1940, Hughes partook in No.ÃÂ 234 Squadron's originally affirmed flying triumphs. He and his segment of two different Spitfires shot down a German Junkers JuÃÂ 88 assaulting guards close Lands End on 8ÃÂ July, and another south-east of Plymouth amid a day break watch on 28ÃÂ July. A common case for a JuÃÂ 88 on 27ÃÂ July couldn't be affirmed as obliterated; after a pursuit over the water at statures as low as , the German got away, in spite of being struck in the motors and cockpit, and was acknowledged to the segment as "harmed". German records, made accessible post-war, affirm that a Junkers 88A guided by Leutnant Ruckdeschel, was lost on this day. On 1ÃÂ August, Hughes was approved from No.ÃÂ 234 Squadron to help set up the main Gloster Gladiator-prepared unit to work amid the Battle of Britain, No.ÃÂ 247 (China British) Squadron in Plymouth. That day, he wedded Kay Brodrick, who compared him to Errol Flynn, in the register office at Bodmin, Cornwall. Aside from Flying Officer Butch, the observers were outsiders; Kay arrived alone, and nobody from No.ÃÂ 234 Squadron could visit. Barnett was exchanged out of No.ÃÂ 234 Squadron on 13ÃÂ August, and Hughes took transitory order until the landing of Squadron Leader Joe "Spike" O'Brien four days after the fact. At this point the battling was increasing over southern England, and the squadron migrated from StÃÂ Eval to RAF Middle Wallop, Hampshire, on 14ÃÂ August. Very quickly after Hughes handled the "Luftwaffe" besieged the landing strip; a few ground staff and non military personnel laborers were murdered, however No.ÃÂ 234 Squadron's Spitfires got away harm.
