Malone expressed that Todd trusts that he doesn't merit absolution, which adds to him grasping his most exceedingly bad characteristics, something Malone felt worked better because of Howarth's acting decisions, which kept Todd from securing recovery effectively. Malone felt the most imperative piece of Todd's recovery was to have him re-stand up to Marty so as to more readily manage the reality he started her assault. Just as having Todd hazard his opportunity from jail and spare Marty from an auto collision, Todd gives his own blood to Marty to guarantee she endures. After a year, he chances his life to spare Patrick, Marty's darling, from death; this demonstration prompts Todd's assumed passing. In spite of having the character long to be thought of as an OK individual, the journalists felt his great deeds ought to never make him feel any less shocking for having assaulted Marty. At first, Howarth deviated, and did not believe the storylines to be redemptive. "[Todd's] not being recovered by any stretch of the imagination," he said. "Todd, from my perspective, is searching for an approach to conquer this anger so he can live in the public eye once more. Starting now and into the foreseeable future, his danger will be superficially, not detonating. It's all the more intriguing if his savagery is superficially and that he play against it. That is the place the nuance is."
