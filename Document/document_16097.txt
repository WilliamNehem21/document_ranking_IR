As his daughters approached womanhood, Liszt felt that a change in their lives was called for and in 1855 he arranged (over their mother's bitter protests) for them to move to Berlin. Here they were placed in the care of Franziska von BÃ¼low, whose son Hans was Liszt's most outstanding pupil; he would take charge of the girls' musical education while Frau von BÃ¼low supervised their general and moral welfare. Hans von BÃ¼low, born in 1830, had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner's "Lohengrin" at Weimar in August 1850, and had decided to dedicate his life to music. After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses, BÃ¼low studied with Liszt, who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist. BÃ¼low was quickly impressed by Cosima's own skill as a pianist, in which he saw the stamp of her father, and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other. Liszt approved the match, and the marriage took place at St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. During their honeymoon, along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich. This visit was repeated the following year, when Cosima, on taking her leave, shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration: "[S]he fell at my feet, covered my hands with tears and kisses ... I pondered the mystery, without being able to solve it".
