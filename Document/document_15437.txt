There are several subspecies differing in plumage shade or size, although the differences are clinal, and races interbreed where their ranges meet. The small, pale former subspecies ("obsoleta, peroplasta, perpallida, presaharica, spatzi, arabica" and "buchanani") found in the mountains of North Africa, the Arabian peninsula and southwest Asia are now normally split as a separate species, the pale crag martin, following German ornithologist Jean Cabanis, who first formally described these birds, but the changes in size and colour are continuous, and the forms often intergrade where they meet, so the evidence for separate species is not strong. The southern forms of the rock martin can weigh more than twice as much as the smallest northern subspecies of pale crag martin. The average weight for "P.Â f.Â fusciventris" is 22.4Â g (0.79Â oz) against 10Â g (0.35Â oz) for "P.Â o.Â obsoleta". The robust, large-billed southernmost forms ("P. f. fuligula", "P. f. pretoriae", and "P. f. anderssoni") are sufficiently different from dark, fine-billed "P. f. fusciventris" that the latter could also be regarded as a potentially different species. However, Rhodesian ornithologist Michael Irwin collected specimens from southern Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) which were dark above like "P. f. fusciventris" and rich reddish below like "P. f. fuligula". This led him to suggest that the two groups had previously been isolated, but were probably hybridising following secondary contact.
