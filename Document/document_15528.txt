Moore's publisher Henry Vizetelly began to issue unabridged mass-market translations of French realist novels that endangered the moral and commercial influence of the circulating libraries around this time. In 1888, the circulating libraries fought back by encouraging the House of Commons to implement laws to stop "the rapid spread of demoralising literature in this country". However, Vizetelly was brought to court by the National Vigilance Association (NVA) for "obscene libel". The charge arose due to the publication of the English translation of Zola's "La Terre". A second case was brought the following year to force implementation of the original judgement and to remove all of Zola's works. This led to the 70-year-old publisher becoming involved in the literary cause. Throughout Moore stayed loyal to Zola's publisher, and on 22 September 1888, about a month before the trial, wrote a letter that appeared in the "St. James Gazette". In it Moore suggested that it was improper for Vizetelly's fate to be determined by a jury of "twelve tradesmen", explaining that it would be preferable to be judged by three novelists. Moore pointed out that the NVA could make the same claims against such books as "Madame Bovary" and Gautier's "Mademoiselle de Maupin", as their morals are equivalent to Zola's, though their literary merits might differ.
