As the Cold War warmed up, pressures created between the Church in Indonesia and the Indonesian Communist Party (, or PKI). Soegijapranata trusted that the PKI was gaining ground with the poor through its guarantees of specialists' rights in a socialist drove association. To battle this, he worked with different Catholics to set up work gatherings, open to the two Catholics and non-Catholics. He trusted that these would engage specialists and consequently limit the PKI's impact. One such work aggregate was Buruh Pancasila, which was framed on 19ÃÂ June 1954; through the association Soegijapranata advanced the state rationality of Pancasila, truly "the five principles". The next year the Church Representatives Conference of Indonesia (, or KWI), perceiving Soegijapranata's commitment to poor people, place him accountable for building up social-bolster programs all through the archipelago. On 2ÃÂ November 1955, he and a few different priests issued an announcement reprimanding socialism, Marxism, and realism, and requesting that the administration guarantee reasonable and fair treatment for all residents. Relations among Indonesia and the Netherlands kept on being poor, explicitly as to control of West Papua, verifiably under Dutch control yet asserted by Indonesia. Soegijapranata solidly upheld the Indonesian position; West Papua was attached in 1963.
