Having gained no ground in Rome, Momolo and Marianna Mortara came back to Bologna toward the beginning of December 1858, and soon thereafter moved to Turin, in Piedmont. The caseÃ¢ÂÂan enemy of Catholic "marketing expert's fantasy", to cite KertzerÃ¢ÂÂhad at this point turned into a huge discussion in both Europe and the United States, with voices over the social range clamoring for the Pope to return Edgardo to his folks. Mortara turned into a "cause cÃÂ©lÃÂ¨bre" for Jews as well as for Protestant Christians too, especially in the United States, where hostile to Catholic feeling proliferatedÃ¢ÂÂ"The New York Times" distributed in excess of 20 articles looking into the issue in December 1858 alone. In Britain, "The Spectator" exhibited the Mortara case as proof that the Papal States had "the most noticeably bad government on the planetÃ¢ÂÂthe most wiped out and the most egotistical, the cruelest and the meanest". The Catholic press both in Italy and abroad undauntedly guarded the Pope's activities. The ace Church articles regularly took on an unmistakably against Semitic character, charging for instance that if inclusion in Britain, France or Germany was basic this was not really an amazement "since at present the papers of Europe are in great part in the hands of the Jews". Scazzocchio proposed that the press storm assaulting the Church was in reality counter-beneficial for the Mortara family's motivation, as it incensed the Pope and in this way steeled his purpose not to settle.
