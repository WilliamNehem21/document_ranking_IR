On 25 January 1941 Wilkinson got the opportunity of the town of Jarrow, and in May 1946 was granted a privileged doctorate by the University of Manchester. Her name has been celebrated in The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls in Ealing, West London, in the Ellen Wilkinson Primary School and Children's Center in Newham, East London, and in the Ellen Wilkinson Estate, a 1950s Felling Urban District Council lodging venture at Wardley, when part of her Jarrow voting public now in Gateshead Metropolitan Borough. Also, the Ellen Wilkinson High School in Ardwick, which joined Wilkinson's old school, bore her name for certain years prior to its conclusion in 2000. The Ellen Wilkinson Building in the University of Manchester's grounds houses portions of the Manchester Institute of Education and different offices. A blue plaque records the site of Wilkinson's origination at 41 Coral Street, and another, in the fundamental quadrangle of the old college structures, records Wilkinson's participation there in 1910 to 1913. In October 2015 Wilkinson was shortlisted by a Manchester town lobby board as one of six contender to be the subject of the city's first female statue in over a century. In October 2016 Wilkinson was picked in an open vote to turn into the main female statue in Middlesbrough. Her name and picture and those of 58 other ladies' suffrage supporters are scratched on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London that was divulged in April 2018.
