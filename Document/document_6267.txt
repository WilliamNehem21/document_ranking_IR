Manson singled out "Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis)" as his main tune on the collection and said that it depicts each individual's longing for self-completion. The tune's flanged arpeggiated harmonies incorporates with overwhelming guitar chugs and string twisting amid the chorale and highlights an optigan. Suffocated In Sound depicted the tune as "a sparkling minute" in the collection. "President Dead" is a guitar-driven tune exhibiting John 5's specialized abilities. It opens with an example of Don Gardiner's "ABC News Radio" communicate declaring the passing of John F. Kennedy and accents both the principal stanza and guitar solo with a mellotron. The tune is 3:13 long, which is an intentional numerological reference to outline 313 of the Zapruder filmÃ¢ÂÂthe edge showing the snapshot of effect of the deadly head shot which murdered Kennedy. "In the Shadow of the Valley of Death" is a contemplative melody with Adam at his most candidly powerless. The tune is separated into two sections. The principal divide comprises of tests and a 'passing circle' on a straightforward strum from a 1952 Gibson acoustic guitar. In the second part the examples and 'demise circle' are supplanted by a low register guitar and drums over culled harmonies. "Cruci-Fiction in Space" further investigates the Kennedy death, proposing that people have advanced from monkeys to men to weapons. It's organization is moderate and substantial; dispossessed of "speed or multifaceted design." Its center 8 has a blended meter drum beat in 4/4 time with two extra eighth notes toward the end; "it doesn't begin in 4/4, it doesn't finish in 4/4, so it's confounding." "A Place in the Dirt" is another individual tune, portrayed by Adam's self-investigation of his place in Holy Wood.
