Opeth returned home in 2004 to begin composing new material for its eighth collection, and before the year's over, they had completed the process of composing it. Opeth's European mark, Music for Nations, shut its entryways in 2005, and after dealings with different names, the band marked with Roadrunner Records. ÃÂkerfeldt said the essential explanation behind marking with Roadrunner was the name's wide appropriation, guaranteeing the collection would be accessible at bigger chain retailers. At the point when news released that the band was marked to Roadrunner, who overwhelmingly worked with pattern arranged shake and metal, a few fans blamed the band for selling out. "To be completely forthright," ÃÂkerfeldt stated, "that is such an affront after 15ÃÂ years as a band and 8ÃÂ records. I can't trust we haven't earned every single Opeth fan's validity after such a long time. That is to say, our melodies are 10ÃÂ minutes long!" The band practiced for three weeks before entering the studio, the first run through the band practiced since the 1998 collection, "My Arms, Your Hearse". Amid practice, keyboardist Wiberg joined Opeth as a full-time part. Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in ÃÂrebro, Sweden, from March 18 to June 1, 2005, and discharged the subsequent "Apparition Reveries" on August 30, 2005, to basic approval and business achievement. The collection appeared at numberÃÂ 64 in the US, and number nine in Sweden, higher than any past Opeth discharge. Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the collection ten out of ten, one of just 21ÃÂ albums to accomplish an ideal rating from the site. Bar Smith of "Decibel" magazine called "Phantom Reveries" "painfully excellent, now and then shamelessly fierce, frequently a mix of both".
