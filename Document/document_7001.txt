There is a further little board in Lisbon of a female head, luxuriously or majorly dressed, which originally showed up in 1907 with the Joseph board when it was recorded in the stock of Leo Nardus at Suresnes. The figure may speak to Saint Catherine of Alexandria, and from both the edge of her fabric and the way that the stream behind her future parallel to that in the outside of the London board it tends to be accepted that she was bowing. In the Stockholm drawing she is precluded, or just hints of her dress appeared. The Joseph board has a bit of a view through a window to an outside scene; if the other female is dared to bow, the trees over the conduit lines up with those in the London board. Some craftsmanship history specialists, including Martin Davies and John Ward, have been moderate to permit the Catherine board as a component of the altarpiece, however it is without a doubt by van der Weyden or a close contemporary devotee. Proof against this connection incorporates the way that the embellishment of the window to one side of the Gulbenkian female holy person is plain, while that beside Saint Joseph is chamfered. Such an irregularity in a solitary van der Weyden work is bizarre. The boards are of equivalent thickness (1.3ÃÂ cm) and of close indistinguishable size; the Saint Catherine board measures , the Saint Joseph .
