A 2006 investigation of the atomic DNA of the pittas was the first to analyze most agents of the family, and discovered proof of three noteworthy clades of pitta. In light of the examination the pittas were part into three genera. The principal clade, utilizing the family name "Erythropitta", included six species that had recently been considered firmly related dependent on outside highlights. They are for the most part commonly little species with little tails, broad measures of dark red or red on the underparts, and greenish or somewhat blue backs. The second sort, "Hydrornis", incorporates variable Asian species. These species are brought together morphologically in showing sexual dimorphism in their plumage, just as in having obscure adolescent plumage (in every one of the animal varieties up to this point considered). This sort incorporates the eared pitta, which had frequently been set into its very own class, "Anthocincla", because of its evidently crude attributes. The third class, "Pitta", is the most far reaching. Most species in this family have green upperparts with a blue wing-fix, dim upperparts and cinnamon-buff underparts. This clade contains all the transitory pitta species, and it is suspected that a considerable lot of the pitta species from islands are gotten from transient species. This division of the pittas into three genera has been received by the International Ornithological Congress' (IOC) "", the "Handbook of the Birds of the World's" HBW Alive agenda, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (which pursues the HBW Alive agenda).
