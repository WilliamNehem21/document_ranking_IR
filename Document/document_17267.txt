Janet Nelson suggests that there was conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s. She points out that the contemporary "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", produced under court auspices in the 890s, does not mention Edward's military successes. These are only known from the late tenth century chronicle of Ãthelweard, such as his account of the Battle of Farnham, in which in Nelson's view "Edward's military prowess, and popularity with a following of young warriors, are highlighted". Towards the end of his life Alfred invested his young grandson Ãthelstan in a ceremony which historians see as designation as eventual successor to the kingship. Nelson argues that while this may have been proposed by Edward to support the accession of his own son, on the other hand it may have been intended by Alfred as part of a scheme to divide the kingdom between his son and grandson. Ãthelstan was sent to be brought up in Mercia by ÃthelflÃ¦d and Ãthelred, but it is not known whether this was Alfred's idea or Edward's. Alfred's wife Ealhswith was ignored in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" in her husband's lifetime, but emerged from obscurity when her son acceded. This may be because she supported her son against her husband.
