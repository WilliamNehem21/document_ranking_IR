In the principal volume of the tenth version of "Systema Naturae" (1758), Carl Linnaeus, the organizer of present day binomial classification, made the variety "Lemur" to incorporate three species: "Lemur tardigradus" (the red thin loris, presently known as "Loris tardigradus"), "Lemur catta" (the ring-followed lemur), and "Lemur volans" (the Philippine colugo, presently known as "Cynocephalus volans"). In spite of the fact that the expression "lemur" was at first proposed for lorises, it was before long connected to the endemic Malagasy primates, which have been known as "lemurs" from that point forward. The name gets from the Latin expression "lemures", which alludes to the "spirits of the dead" from Roman folklore. As per Linnaeus' very own clarification, the name was chosen due to the nighttime action and moderate developments of the slim loris. Being comfortable with crafted by Virgil and Ovid and seeing a relationship that fit with his naming plan, Linnaeus adjusted the expression "lemur" for these nighttime primates. In any case, it has been normally and dishonestly accepted that Linnaeus was alluding to the apparition like appearance, intelligent eyes, and spooky cries of lemurs. It has additionally been theorized that Linnaeus may likewise have realized that the some Malagasy individuals have held legends that lemurs are the spirits of their precursors, yet this is improbable given that the name was chosen for thin lorises from India.
