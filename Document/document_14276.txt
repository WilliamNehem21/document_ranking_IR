Before the beginning of development of the DRR, in the desire for setting aside some cash by purchasing officially existing trains for the fascination, Walt Disney endeavored to purchase a lot of measure ridable little trains from William "Billy" Jones, however after Jones declined his offer, Disney concluded that he needed the railroad's moving stock to be greater and produced using scratch. For this errand, Disney again swung to Roger Broggie, who was certain that he and the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop group could utilize the structure for Disney's 1:8-scale little "Lilly Belle" train and extend it to fabricate the DRR's trains. The definite size of the moving stock for the new railroad was resolved after Disney saw a lot of tight measure Oahu Railway and Land Company traveler autos that had as of late touched base at the Travel Town Museum, whose measurements Disney observed to be positive. The size of the plan for the DRR's traveler vehicles, in light of the limited measure traveler autos at the Travel Town Museum, was ostensibly 5:8-scale when contrasted with the extent of moving stock. A similar scale was additionally picked for the steam trains anticipated the DRR, and when its trains and traveler autos were finished and combined with its restricted check track, the railroad had almost indistinguishable extents to those of an ordinary standard measure railroad.
