In the ensuing years, "In Utero" has continued to perform commercially and gather critical praise. In a 2003 "Guitar World" article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the album's release, Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross argued that "In Utero" was "a far better record [than "Nevermind"] and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then "In Utero" is that lost pearl." That same year, Pitchfork Media placed "In Utero" at number 13 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s. In 2004 "Blender" ranked it at number 94 in its "100 Greatest American Albums of All Time" list, while in 2005, "Spin" placed it at number 51 on its "100 Greatest Albums 1985â2005" retrospective. "Rolling Stone" has ranked it at number 435 on its list "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time", and number 7 on its list the "100 Best Albums of the Nineties". In 2005, "In Utero" was ranked number 358 in "Rock Hard" magazine's book of "The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time". "In Utero" has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over five million units, and has sold 4,258,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. To commemorate the album's 20th anniversary, DGC reissued "In Utero" in several different formats in September 2013. The album was also included in the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die".
