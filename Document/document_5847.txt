The insult hit home in an America where the log lodge was viewed as a major aspect of the national legacy; however generally few lived in one by 1840, many had dwelled in one before throughout everyday life, or had guardians who had. Alexis de Tocqueville, the French ambassador who visited America during the 1830s, chronicled them as the pioneer's first staying. Hard juice was viewed as a beverage of the regular man. The Whigs chose to invest heavily in the lodge and juice the Democrats had scorned. The beginnings of how this came to be are unsure, however the most regularly rendered form of occasions has, in January 1840, Pennsylvania Whig usable Thomas Elder thinking of making log lodges an image of the Harrison/Tyler battle. Robert Gray Gunderson, in his record of the 1840 decision, portrayed how one was shown at a Harrisburg sanction meeting on January 20, and "inside the month, lodges, [rac]coons, and juice progressed toward becoming images of resurgent Whiggery". John Gasaway, in his doctoral postulation on the interchanges in the 1840 crusade, noticed that Harrison was known as the "log lodge and hard juice competitor" in one paper as right on time as December 20, 1839, and that pictures of Harrison and humble houses was considered to have secured date as far back as the War of 1812.
