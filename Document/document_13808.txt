At this point, the remainder of the bleeding edge between Albert to past Dernancourt was additionally being intensely assaulted. In the north, forward troops of the 48th Battalion were terminating persistently from the railroad line. Assaulted by components of III Battalion, 229 RIR (III/229 RIR) upheld by "minenwerfers" terminating from a thicket south of Albert, the 48th Battalion effectively beat off each German strike. This was in spite of being gotten in enfilade by an assault rifle sited on the scaffold where the AlbertÃ¢ÂÂ Amiens street crossed the railroad line. Leane coordinated ordnance onto the wood south of Albert from which the "minenwerfers" were terminating. This was a similar wood whereupon the S.O.S. line of the tenth AFA Brigade had been laid. Similarly as the Germans were gathering for a restored ambush, a stray British shell detonated a weapons dump, dispersing froze troops of II/229 RIR, a considerable lot of whom were then shot somewhere around the Australians. The 48th lost just three officers and 59 men amid the day's battling. Careful about sending fortifications from his help line down the presented slant to the railroad line, Leane just sent four men with two Lewis firearms forward amid the sunlight hours. Amid the day, the privilege of the 48th was relentlessly stretched out to enable the 47th Battalion to move directly thus.
