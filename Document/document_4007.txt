As the UK prepared itself for Operation Sea Lion, the German intend to attack, various home safeguard legions were raised under the regiment's hues. The eighth Battalion was framed from the National Defense Companies and comprised of men excessively old, excessively youthful or unfit for dynamic administration, and the more youthful unexpected from this legion later shaped the 70th Battalion. The ninth and tenth Battalions were likewise raised, the previous serving in Northern Ireland, the last in south Wales and after that Lincolnshire. The eleventh Battalion was made in October 1940 from a re-assignment of the 50th (Holding) Battalion, and 32,000 men in 19 forces of the Home Guard wore the identifications of the regiment. As the risk of attack subsided, a large portion of these home safeguard contingents were disbanded, the eighth and 70th in 1942, the ninth in 1943, and the Home Guard in 1945. In February 1942, the eleventh Battalion stopped to have any association with the regiment when it was changed over to the 118th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The tenth Battalion was changed over to defensive layer in 1942 and turned into the 159th Regiment in the Royal Armored Corps, however it held the Glosters' top identifications. It was sent to India in October where, in March 1943, it changed over back to infantry and returned to the regiment's tenth Battalion.
