"Slaughter Them All" highlights mind boggling riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM groups played at high speed. The collection is viewed as pivotal in the whip metal beginning since it presented quick percussion, low-register harmonies, and destroying prompts the class. Hammett played some pentatonic examples notwithstanding his very fast performances. Ulrich received a twofold time catch design that would turn into a backbone on Metallica's resulting collections. Hetfield's vocals developed from the melodic moan on "No Life 'til Leather" to a harsh edged bark, and the whole band played quicker and all the more precisely on "Execute Them All". Music author Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's exhibitions were about virtuosic, on account of the smooth-sounding bass of the previous and the exact picking aptitudes of the last mentioned. As per writer Chuck Eddy, the adolescent melodious way to deal with themes, for example, fighting, viciousness and life out and about gives the collection a "credulous appeal". The melodic methodology on "Slaughter Them All" was as opposed to the glitz metal groups who commanded the graphs in the mid 1980s. As a result of its insubordinate nature and Metallica's road appearance, it spoke to fans who were not into the standard of hard shake.
