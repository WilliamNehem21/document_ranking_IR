In 2017, the British scientist David E. Sharpen and Holtz called attention to that (like different theropods) there was no motivation to trust that the forelimbs of "Baryonyx" had the capacity to pronate (crossing the span and ulna bones of the lower arm to turn the hand), and in this manner make it ready to lay or stroll on its palms. Laying on or utilizing the forelimbs for headway may have been conceivable (as demonstrated by tracks of a resting theropod), however in the event that this was the standard, the forelimbs would most likely have indicated adjustments for this. Sharpen and Holtz moreover proposed that the forelimbs of spinosaurids don't appear to be ideal for catching prey, yet rather seem like the forelimbs of burrowing creatures. They proposed that the capacity to burrow would have been helpful while exhuming homes, burrowing for water, or to achieve a few sorts of prey. Sharpen and Holtz likewise trusted that spinosaurids would have swam and plunged in water instead of submerging themselves, because of their sparsity of oceanic adjustments. A 2018 investigation of lightness (through reproduction with 3D models) by the Canadian scientist Donald M. Henderson found that indirectly related theropods glided just as the tried spinosaurs, and rather bolstered they would have remained by the shorelines or shallow water instead of being semi-oceanic.
