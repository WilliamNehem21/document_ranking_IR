In January 1915, Lloyd showed up at the Crystal Palace where she engaged more than ten thousand troops. Toward the finish of that year, she played out her solitary war tune, "Presently You've Got your Khaki On", formed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a lady who found the military uniform provocative and believed that wearing it made the normal pot-bellied refined man resemble a muscle-conditioned fighter. Lloyd's sibling John showed up with her dramatic dressed as a trooper and described the tune. Following this, she sang the officially settled melodies "On the off chance that You Want to Get On in Revue", which delineated a young lady who offered sexual favors to advance her showy vocation, and "The Three Ages of Woman", which investigated men from a lady's point of view. She only from time to time visited amid the war, yet quickly performed in Northampton, Watford and Nottingham in 1916. Before that year's over, she had endured a mental meltdown which she accused on her boisterous remaining burden and a postponed response to Hurley's demise. Amid the war years, Lloyd's open picture had weakened. Her biographer Midge Gillies suspected that Lloyd's rough association with Dillon and expert reprimands in open had left the artist feeling like "somebody's mom, as opposed to their sweetheart."
