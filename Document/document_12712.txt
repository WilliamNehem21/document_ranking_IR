The Allies neglected to react enough to a few admonitions of Japanese action off the east shore of Australia preceding the assault; they just overlooked the alerts or clarified them away. They credited the ineffective assault on the tanker "Wellen" on 16 May to a solitary submarine, and expected it had withdrawn Australian waters following the assault. The principal observation flight went unnoticed, and despite the fact that FRUMEL caught the report and disseminated it to Allied commandants on 30 May, Muirhead-Gould evidently did not respond. New Zealand maritime specialists distinguished radio prattle between the Japanese submarines on 26 and 29 May, and in spite of the fact that they couldn't decode the transmissions, radio heading finding showed that a submarine or submarines were moving toward Sydney. The Allies considered dispatching an enemy of submarine watch in light of the 29 May fix, yet were unfit to do as such as all enemy of submarine art were at that point focused on securing a northbound troop guard. The main reaction to the second observation trip on 29 May was the starting of inquiry planes. No other safeguard measures were established. Despite the fact that the diminutive person assault on Diego Suarez in Madagascar happened on the morning of 31 May (Sydney time), the Allies sent no cognizant to other direction districts, as they trusted that Vichy French powers had propelled the assault.
