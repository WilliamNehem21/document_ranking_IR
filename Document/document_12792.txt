In an August 1, 1835, letter, Patterson recommended that Sully make a front-side plan comprising of Liberty situated on a rock, holding a "freedom shaft" in her correct hand bested by a "pileus", the headgear given by the Romans to a liberated slave. He likewise requested that Sully make a turn around configuration comprising of a "falcon flying, and ascending in flight, in the midst of the group of stars sporadically scattered of twenty-four stars". Patterson mentioned that the fowl seem regular; he reprimanded the bird plans at that point being used on the country's coinage as being unnatural principally due to the shield put on the falcon's bosom. Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass arranged a sketch dependent on Patterson's origination, however endured a stroke, abandoning him incompletely deadened. Later in 1835, Christian Gobrecht was employed at the Mint as a designer, bite the dust sinker, and colleague etcher to Kneass. Albeit ostensibly a subordinate, Gobrecht would perform a significant part of the etching work for the Mint until Kneass' demise in 1840, when Gobrecht was selected boss etcher.
