The Middlesex coroner, Wynne Baxter, trusted that Stride had been assaulted with a quick, unexpected activity. She was all the while holding a parcel of cachous (breath refreshing desserts) in her left hand when she was found, demonstrating that she had not had sufficient energy to guard herself. A food merchant, Matthew Packer, inferred to private investigators utilized by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee that he had sold a few grapes to Stride and the killer; in any case, he had told police that he had closed his shop without seeing anything suspicious. At the examination, the pathologists expressed unequivocally that Stride had not held, gulped or devoured grapes. They depicted her stomach substance as "cheddar, potatoes and farinaceous powder [flour or processed grain]". All things considered, Packer's story showed up in the press. Packer's portrayal of the man did not coordinate the announcements by different observers who may have seen Stride with a man without further ado before her homicide, however everything except two of the depictions contrasted. Joseph Lawende went through Miter Square with two other men in the blink of an eye before Eddowes was killed there, and may have seen her with a man of around 30 years of age, who was pitifully dressed, wore a topped top, and had a reasonable mustache. Boss Inspector Swanson noticed that Lawende's depiction was a close match to another given by one of the observers who may have seen Stride with her killer. Notwithstanding, Lawende expressed that he would not have the capacity to recognize the man once more, and the two other men with Lawende were unfit to give depictions.
