A few researchers, for instance Frank Stenton, creator of the standard history of Anglo-Saxon England, alongside Keynes and Abels, see the Second Decimation as a gift of regal demesne. In Abels' view ÃÂthelwulf looked for reliability from the nobility and church amid the ruler's pending nonattendance from Wessex, and showed a feeling of dynastic frailty additionally clear in his dad's liberality towards the Kentish church in 838, and in an "energetic consideration" in this period to ordering and reconsidering illustrious family histories. Keynes recommends that "ÃÂthelwulf's motivation was probably to procure divine help with his battles against the Vikings", and the mid-twentieth century history specialist Eric John sees that "a lifetime of medieval investigations instructs one that an early medieval ruler was never so political as when he was on his knees". The view that the destruction was a gift of the ruler's very own domain is upheld by the Anglo-Saxonist Alfred P. Smyth, who contends that these were the main grounds the ruler was qualified for estrange by book. The student of history Martin Ryan lean towards the view that ÃÂthelwulf liberated a tenth piece of land claimed by laymen from common commitments, who could now invest houses of worship under their very own support. Ryan considers it to be a piece of a crusade of religious commitment. As indicated by the student of history David Pratt, it "is best translated as a vital 'tax break', intended to energize participation in cautious measures through a fractional reduction of illustrious contribution". Nelson expresses that the demolition occurred in two stages, in Wessex in 854 and Kent in 855, mirroring that they stayed separate kingdoms.
