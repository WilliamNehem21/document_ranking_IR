His memorial service was one of the biggest in the South, and New Orleans hung itself in grieving as his body lay in state in the City Hall for a few days. An Executive Committee chose to accentuate Davis' connections to the United States, so an American national banner was set over the Confederate banner amid the survey, and many crossed American and Confederate banners close-by. Davis wore another suit of Confederate dark texture Jubal Early had given him, and Varina set a sword Davis had conveyed amid the Black Hawk War on the coffin. A typical design amid the underlying memorial service was a little American banner in grieving, with a representation of Davis in the inside. The Grand Army of the Republic had an unmistakable job, despite the fact that the Grand Marshall was John G. Glynn, leader of the Louisiana National Guard, and Georgia Governor John Gordon (leader of the recently sorted out United Confederate Veterans) was privileged Grand Marshall. While the central government formally disregarded Davis' passing, many church ringers rang in the south, Confederate veterans held numerous parades, and Senators and congressmen crossed the Potomac River to join previous Confederate authorities and commanders in praising Davis in Alexandria, Virginia.
