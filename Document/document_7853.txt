The content was refined amid creation, and the inconsistent mechanical sharks constrained Spielberg to shoot numerous scenes with the goal that the shark was just alluded to. For instance, for a great part of the shark chase, its area is shown by the drifting yellow barrels. The opening had the shark eating up Chrissie, however it was changed so it would be shot with Backlinie being hauled and yanked by links to reproduce an assault.

As Spielberg put it years after the fact, "The film went from a Japanese Saturday early showing blood and guts movie to a greater degree a Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get spine chiller." In another meeting, he comparatively announced, "The shark not working was a boon. It influenced me to turn out to be more similar to Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen." The acting ended up critical for influencing groups of onlookers to trust in such a major shark: "The more phony the shark looked in the water, the more my tension guided me to increase the naturalism of the exhibitions."
