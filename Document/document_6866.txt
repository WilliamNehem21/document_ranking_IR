This would have been attached to an intuitive music track, which would have begun off straightforward with a little ball and become progressively intricate and full as it got bigger. Actually, the group discovered they couldn't actualize this contracting technician because of memory confinements, and further discovered that with the intuitive music idea, it was terrible to shrivel down and hear the music relapse to a less complex structure. The contracting idea just as the intelligent music approach were hence dropped. The model was finished inside around a half year, in time for the year's Japan Media Arts Festival for show. Takahashi likewise exhibited the diversion for an inside survey, driving Namco to green light the amusement's full advancement.
