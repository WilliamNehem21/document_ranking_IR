The graphics and flight mechanics were the most praised aspects. Tom Guise from "Computer and Video Games" heralded the game's flight system and freedom as captivating and stated that "Nights into Dreams" is the "perfect evolution" of a "Sonic" game. Scary Larry of "GamePro" said flying using the analogue joystick "is a breeze" and that the gameplay is fun, enjoyable, and impressive. He gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics and a 5 out of 5 in every other category (sound, control, and FunFactor). "Entertainment Weekly" said its "graceful acrobatic stunts" offer "a more compelling sensation of soaring than most flight simulators". "Edge" praised the game's analogue controller and called the levels "well-designed and graphically unrivaled", but the reviewer expressed disappointment in the limited level count compared to "Super Mario 64", and suggested that "Nights" seemed to prioritise technical achievements and Saturn selling points over gameplay with as clear a focus as "Sonic". Martin Robinson from Eurogamer opined that the flight mechanics were a "giddy thrill". Colin Ferris from Game Revolution praised the graphics and speed of the game as breathtaking and awe-inspiring, concluding that it offered the best qualities of the fifth-generation machines. "GameFan" praised the combination of "lush graphics, amazing music, and totally unique gameplay". "Next Generation" criticised the speed, saying that the only disappointing aspect was the way "it all rushes by so fast". However, the magazine praised the two-player mode and the innovative method of grading the player once they completed a level. "Electronic Gaming Monthly"s four reviewers were impressed with both the technical aspects and style of the graphics, and said the levels are great fun to explore, though they expressed disappointment that the game was not genuinely 3D and said it did not manage to surpass "Super Mario 64".
