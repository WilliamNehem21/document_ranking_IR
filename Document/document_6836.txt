"KÃÂ¶nigsberg" was requested under the agreement name ""Ersatz" " and was set down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel on 12 January 1905. She was propelled on 12 December 1905, when the "OberbÃÂ¼rgermeister" of KÃÂ¶nigsberg, Siegfried KÃÂ¶rte, initiated the ship, after which fitting-out work started. She was dispatched into the High Seas Fleet for ocean preliminaries on 6 April 1907. Her preliminaries were hindered toward the start of June when she was entrusted with escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht amid three cruising regattas including Kiel Week. The two ships at that point traveled the North Sea and halted at Nordkapp, where from 3 to 6 August, Wilhelm II met Czar Nicholas II of Russia. In the wake of coming back to Germany, "KÃÂ¶nigsberg" continued her ocean preliminaries, which endured from 9 August to 9 September. She visited her namesake city from 21 to 23 September and was later appointed to the armada exploring powers to supplant the cruiser on 5 November. Right now, "KÃÂ¶nigsberg" was again used to escort Wilhelm II's yacht, this time in organization with the new defensively covered cruiser and the dispatch watercraft on a visit to Britain. The boats ceased in Portsmouth and the Thames, and were visited by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.
