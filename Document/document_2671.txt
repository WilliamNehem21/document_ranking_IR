Shelley's expressed point in "Meanders" is to bring issues to light of the political circumstance in Italy and to persuade perusers to help the progressives in their battle for autonomy. She tends to her perusers as English natives, contending that they specifically "should identify in [the Italians'] battles; for the desire with the expectation of complimentary establishments everywhere throughout the world has its source in England". On a general dimension, she explains a "resistance to monarchical government, objection to class refinement, extreme aversion of subjection and war and their attending savageries" like that in her chronicled books "Valperga" (1823) and "Perkin Warbeck" (1830). The focal topic of the second voyage is "the oppression of Austrian and French dominion, and the maltreatment of ecclesiastical and religious expert". The answer for Italy's issues, as indicated by Shelley, is not one or the other "oppression" nor "upheaval" yet rather "quiet intercession". At last, it is the exercises gained from history that Shelley feels are the most critical, which is the reason she looks at the over a wide span of time. "Meanders" verbalizes the "Whiggish philosophy of political gradualism", and is like Wollstonecraft's "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792) in that it contends that "a reorganization of culture is important to change harsh and corrupting force relations".
