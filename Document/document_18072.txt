To avoid typecasting in historical dramas, Winslet sought out films set in contemporary times. She found it in the science fiction romance "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (2004), in which she played the neurotic and impetuous Clementine, a woman who decides to erase memories of her ex-boyfriend (played by Jim Carrey). Unlike her previous assignments, the role allowed her to display the quirky side to her personality. Gondry encouraged Carrey and Winslet to improvise on set, and to keep herself agile she practised kickboxing. "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" proved to be a modest financial success and several critics regarded it as one of the best films of the 21st century. Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" considered it to be a "uniquely funny, unpredictably tender and unapologetically twisted romance" and thought that Winslet was "electrifying and bruisingly vulnerable" in it. A journalist for "Premiere" magazine credited her for abandoning her "corseted English rose persona", and featured it as the 81st greatest film performance of all time. Winslet considers it to be a favourite among her roles, and she received Best Actress nominations at the Oscar and BAFTA award ceremonies. She has said that the film marked a turning point in her career and prompted directors to offer her a wide variety of parts.
