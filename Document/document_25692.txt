Louis-FranÃ§ois Bertin was 66 in 1832, the year of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son Ãdouard Bertin, a student of the painter, or via Ãtienne-Jean DelÃ©cluze, Ingres' friend and the "Journal"'s art critic. In either case the genesis of the commission is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the "Le Moniteur Universel" until 1823, when the "Journal des dÃ©bats" became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The "Journal" supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.
It was completed within a month, during Ingres' frequent visits to Bertin's estate of retreat, Le ChÃ¢teau des Roches, in BiÃ¨vres, Essonne. Ingres made daily visits, as Bertin entertained guests such as Victor Hugo, his mistress Juliette Drouet, Hector Berlioz, and later Franz Liszt and Charles Gounod. Ingres later made drawings of the Bertin family, including a depiction of his host's wife and sketches of their son Armand and daughter-in-law, CÃ©cile. The portrait of Armand evidences his physical resemblance to his father.
