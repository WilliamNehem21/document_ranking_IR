To move every one of the stones, Byne and Steilberg had a street worked to the Tagus, and a freight boat connected to a fixed link was relegated to ship stones over. An old World War I channel railroad was gotten to transport stones from the religious community to the ship; its rails could be laid into any of the structures. Men drove the little rail autos along the limited measure tracks; the stones were then lifted into the ship by crane, and another crane lifted them out of the ship into trucks. One of the most serious issues that Byne experienced was that Spain's three excelsior industrial facilities couldn't make enough pressing material to keep the carton pressing team provided. At a certain point, understanding that the stones were probably going to be utilized in California as outer cladding for auxiliary steel dividers, Steilberg recommended the confronting surface of each stone be cut to a "facade" of the thickness of for simpler pressing and sending, however Hearst needed to hold the credibility of the full-sized stones. Byne and Steilberg made a decision about specific dividers and utility structures useless and left them in Spain. Steilberg returned home toward the finish of March.
