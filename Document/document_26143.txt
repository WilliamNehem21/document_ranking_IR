From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-SaÃ«ns composed "mÃ©lodies", writing more than 140. He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of "Lieder". Unlike his protÃ©gÃ© FaurÃ©, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career â "MÃ©lodies persanes" ("Persian Songs", 1870) and "Le Cendre rouge" ("The Red Ash Tree", 1914, dedicated to FaurÃ©). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-SaÃ«ns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: "you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable." Most of the "mÃ©lodies" are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including "Le lever du soleil sur le Nil" ("Sunrise over the Nile", 1898) and "Hymne Ã  la paix" ("Hymn to Peace", 1919), are for voice and orchestra. His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy.
