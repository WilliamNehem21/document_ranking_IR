After the First World War, Crawford came back to live in England, and was deactivated from the New Zealand Army in April 1919. Searching for work, he kept in touch with Surrey offering to play for them on the off chance that they discovered him some work thus, yet the board of trustees, while composing that they would be satisfied on the off chance that he played for the district once more, proved unable "see [their] approach to discover him business". Crawford may have been mulling over playing proficient cricketÃ¢ÂÂincomprehensible for a previous Public School cricketerÃ¢ÂÂhowever rather looked for some kind of employment at Repton, his old school. It is hazy what his situation at Repton was as of now; he appears to have had no authority cricketing job and it is conceivable he filled in as an instructor basically to keep up his beginner status. Regardless, Crawford just stayed at Repton until the finish of the scholastic year; his short stay may have been the consequence of poor outcomes by the cricket group. In any case, Burns proposes: "Another sign that the school was not so much cheerful to be related with the Surrey rebel, whose things additionally incorporated a uninterested war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket group, the Repton Pilgrims, was framed in 1921, Crawford was separated from everyone else among the school's previous recognized players not to be made a part. He was not welcome to join the club until 1952."
