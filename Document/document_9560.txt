Different echoes of the hues and examples incorporate the red of Paul's robes against the velvet of his seat and the overhanging drapery.

The impact has been portrayed as a ""visit de compel" of symphonic colourism", and a high purpose of his mixing of red and ochre colors. Titian utilizes an assortment of brushstrokes. While the pope's robes are painted with extremely general terms, his cape ("mozzetta"), maturing face and obvious hand were caught in moment detail with slender brushes, with his hairs rendered at the dimension of individual strands.
