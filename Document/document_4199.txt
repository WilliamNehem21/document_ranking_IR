Green kept running into issues with Go Man Go's enlistment. Around then, the AQHA had two kinds of enrollment, the Appendix and the Tentative. Reference section enrolled ponies were the posterity of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-enlisted Quarter Horses or Appendix-enlisted Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was initially enrolled in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-enlisted horse. The best approach to progress out of the Appendix into the Tentative library was to qualify on execution grounds and pass an adaptation examination led by the AQHA. Go Man Go absolutely qualified under the execution criteria, yet his compliance was with the end goal that he took after a Thoroughbred more than he looked like a Quarter Horse. Green realized that so as to expand his stud chargesÃ¢ÂÂthe cost paid for the privilege to breed a horse to a stallionÃ¢ÂÂGo Man Go expected to procure a standard enlistment number rather than his Appendix number. So Green engaged the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the expert to grant Tentative numbers to steeds paying little respect to adaptation test results. In both 1956 and 1957, the council declined to make a move, holding on to assess the nature of Go Man Go's first foals before settling on a choice. At long last, in 1958, they granted Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative vault.
