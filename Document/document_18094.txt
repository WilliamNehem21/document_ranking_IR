However, a 2006 study by Carlos IbÃ¡Ã±ez and colleagues found that "M.Â nattereri" in fact included several cryptic species with highly distinguished DNA sequences characteristics, even though morphological differences were small or nonexistent. One, which they recorded in the southern Iberian Peninsula, was identified as "M.Â escalerai". Populations in the mountains of northern Spain represent another species (now known to be "Myotis crypticus"), which is now also known from the Alps. A 2009 study using data from the mitochondrial genes cytochrome "b" and ND1 found that "M.Â escalerai" is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco previously included in "M.Â nattereri" (now known to be "Myotis" "zenatius"), and more distantly to other members of the "Myotis nattereri" group. "M.Â escalerai" and "M. zenatius" are estimated to have diverged about 2 million years ago. Later in 2009, "M.Â escalerai" was also recorded for the first time from France. One 2011 study found a fifth putative species in the complex (""Myotis" sp.Â C"), occurring in the Italian peninsula and most closely related to "M. crypticus", but another study published in the same year included these populations in "M. crypticus". The latter study, by I. Salicini and colleagues, used sequences from six nuclear genes to confirm the distinctiveness of "M.Â escalerai" and its close relationship with "M."Â "zenatius".
