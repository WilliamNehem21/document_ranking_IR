Stengel attempted to stay under the radar amid the 1949 Yankee spring preparing at St. Petersburg, Florida, however there was extensive media consideration as Stengel carried tenderfoots starting with one position on the field then onto the next, and interminably rearranged his lineup. He had the benefit of decreased desires, as DiMaggio, the Yankee genius, was harmed with a bone goad in his heel, and few picked New York to win the flag. There were different wounds once the season started, and Stengel, who had at first arranged a traditionalist, stable lineup in his first American League season, was compelled to ad lib. In spite of the fact that platooning, playing right given hitters against left given pitchers and the invert, against whom they are all things considered increasingly ready to hit, had been known for certain years, Stengel advanced it, and his utilization gave the training its name, instituted by a sportswriter and obtained from football. For instance, in the early piece of the 1949 season, Stengel may against right handers play Bobby Brown at third base and Cliff Mapes and Gene Woodling in the outfield. Against left handers, Stengel may play Billy Johnson at third with Johnny Lindell and Hank Bauer in the outfield.
