An essayist for "The Washington Post" remarked that "genuine flight oddities will like the dashing and propelled moves". As indicated by Gaudiosi, devoted players will adapt "about optimal design and trick flying"; he believed the last to be "hard stuff, even with green bands directing you". So also, Buchanan portrayed the Hoops courses as "unbelievably requesting", and Atkin refered to that mode's Trick trouble level as "incredibly extreme". Weave and John Nolan composed that individuals who "love to circle around the skies of "Pilot test program 5" will go bananas for" the aerobatics; yet the pair remarked that battle pilot training program players "may get somewhat tense once the amazing force wears off." However, Atkin trusted that just those "perpetually discontent without something to shoot at" could be frustrated by the absence of battle: different players will "be too caught up with arranging airborne ballet performances, pulling off outrageous aerobatic stunts, or simply getting a charge out of a peaceful take off down the edge line to miss that stuff". In like manner, Ware called the peaceful ongoing interaction "invigorating", and Buchanan expressed, "If [you are] a fight tired veteran of air battle sims, "Flight Unlimited" may be only the kind of [rest and relaxation] you need."
