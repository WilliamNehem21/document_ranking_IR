James Nesbitt was conceived on 15 January 1965 in Ballymena, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. His dad, James "Jim" Nesbitt, was the dean of the grade school in Lisnamurrican, a village close Broughshane, while his mom, May Nesbitt, was a government employee. Jim and May as of now had three little girlsÃ¢ÂÂMargaret, Kathryn and Andrea. Nesbitt's three sisters all in the end moved toward becoming educators. The family lived in the house abutting the one-room school where Nesbitt was one of 32 understudies instructed by Jim; different students were every one of ranchers' kids. Nesbitt grew up "totally" around ladies, and invested a ton of energy alone, "kicking a ball against a divider". He had aspirations to play football for Manchester United, or to turn into an educator like his dad. The family was Protestant, and Lisnamurrican was in "Paisley nation". The Nesbitts spent Sunday nights singing songs around the piano. Jim walked in the Ballymena Young Conquerors woodwind band and Nesbitt went along with him playing the flute. After the Drumcree clashes, they quit walking with the band. The family's home in the wide open left them to a great extent unaffected by The Troubles, in spite of the fact that Nesbitt, his dad, and one of his sisters barely got away from a vehicle bomb blast outside Ballymena County Hall in the mid 1970s.
