In 1960 Tippett moved to a house in the Wiltshire village of Corsham, where he lived with his long-term partner Karl Hawker. By then Tippett had begun work on his second major opera, "King Priam". He chose for his theme the tragedy of Priam, mythological king of the Trojans, as recorded in Homer's "Iliad", and again he prepared his own libretto. As with "The Midsummer Marriage", Tippett's preoccupation with the opera meant that his compositional output was limited for several years to a few minor works, including a "Magnificat" and "Nunc Dimittis" written in 1961 for the 450th anniversary of the foundation of St John's College, Cambridge. "King Priam" was premiÃ¨red in Coventry by the Covent Garden Opera on 29 May 1962 as part of a festival celebrating the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral. The production was by Sam Wanamaker and the lighting by Sean Kenny. John Pritchard was the conductor. The music for the new work displayed a marked stylistic departure from what Tippett had written hitherto, heralding what a later commentator, Iain Stannard, refers to as a "great divide" between the works before and after "King Priam". Although some commentators questioned the wisdom of so radical a departure from his established voice, the opera was a considerable success with critics and the public. Lewis later called it "one of the most powerful operatic experiences in the modern theatre". This reception, combined with the fresh acclaim for "The Midsummer Marriage" following a well-received BBC broadcast in 1963, did much to rescue Tippett's reputation and establish him as a leading figure among British composers.
