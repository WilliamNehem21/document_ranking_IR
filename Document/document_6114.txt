"Temeraire" presently continued her past obligations barring the French at Brest. Overwhelming climate incurred significant damage, driving her to put into Torbay for broad fixes after her long watches, fixes which in the long run added up to ÃÂ£9,143. Amid this time Harvey was regularly missing from his direction, more often than not taking care of his obligations as Member of Parliament for Essex. He was incidentally supplanted by Captain William Kelly on 27 August 1804, and he thusly was prevailing by Captain George Fawke on 6 April 1805. Harvey came back to his ship on 9 July 1805, and it was while he was in order that the strengthened Rochefort squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder caught and assaulted a Franco-Spanish armada at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. The French authority, Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, was obstructed in his endeavor to join the French powers at Brest, and rather cruised south to Ferrol, and afterward to Cadiz. At the point when updates on the Franco-Spanish armada's area achieved the Admiralty, they named Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson to assume responsibility for the barring power at Cadiz, which at the time was being told by Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Nelson was advised to pick whichever ships he got a kick out of the chance to serve under him, and one of those he explicitly picked was "Temeraire".
