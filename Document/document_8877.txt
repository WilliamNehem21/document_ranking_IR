Regardless of the American concerns, the IJN was not going to assault the Allied supply lines and Cam Ranh Bay was not a noteworthy armada base. Starting at 1 January 1945, both the "Ise"- class war vessels and the modest number of other Japanese warships in the district were positioned at or close Singapore, and just escort vessels worked from Cam Ranh Bay. While expansive quantities of flying machine were situated in Japanese-held regions flanking the South China Sea in January 1945, generally few prepared pilots were accessible to work them. As of now the Imperial General Headquarters was thinking about a noteworthy hostile against the supply line to Lingayen Gulf, yet on 20 January 1945 it chose to focus Japan's guarded endeavors on the territory around the home islands and just direct deferring activities somewhere else. Therefore, the Japanese powers in the South China Sea district at the season of the assault were centered around planning to oppose future Allied assaults. The Japanese trusted that US powers could conceivably arrive in Indochina once the freedom of the Philippines was finished, and were additionally worried about conceivable assaults on the zone by the British-drove South East Asia Command. With an end goal to all the more likely arrange the Japanese powers in the South East Asia area, all Imperial Japanese Army and Navy units were set under the general control of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group in January 1945. This order was driven by "Gensui" Count Hisaichi Terauchi from his base camp in Singapore.
