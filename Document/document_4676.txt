The Mopan populace has been evaluated at somewhere in the range of 10,000 and 20,000 individuals at the season of contact. In 1692 the Council of the Indies requested that the Manche ChÃÂ¼ol and the Mopan be managed unequivocally. The populace endured the impacts of war and infection, and the couple of survivors were moved into Spanish "reducciones" in southeastern PetÃÂ©n, before being moved to pilgrim settlements in different pieces of PetÃÂ©n. In 1695 the provincial specialists chose to follow up on an arrangement to interface the territory of Guatemala with YucatÃÂ¡n, and warriors directed by Jacinto de Barrios Leal, leader of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala, vanquished a few ChÃÂ¼ol people group. The most vital of these was SakbÃÂ¼ajlan on the LacantÃÂºn River in eastern Chiapas, presently in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra SeÃÂ±ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695. This was one piece of a three-pronged assault against the autonomous occupants of PetÃÂ©n and neighboring Chiapas; a second gathering cooperated with Barrios Leal having walked from Huehuetenango. The third gathering, under Juan DÃÂ­az de Velasco, walked from Verapaz against the Itza. Barrios Leal was joined by Franciscan minister Antonio Margil who filled in as a counselor just as his own questioner and cleric to his troops. The Spanish assembled a fortress and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish officers. Mercederian minister Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his individual Mercederians purified through water a few hundred Lakandon ChÃÂ¼ols in the next months and set up contacts with neighboring ChÃÂ¼ol people group.
