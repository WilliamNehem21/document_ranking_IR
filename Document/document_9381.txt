William S. Andrews of Syracuse was a 69-year-old judge, noted for his grant, who had been on the Court of Appeals since 1917. The child of Charles Andrews, a previous Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, William Andrews is best recalled today since he composed a sentiment in "Palsgraf". In that contradict, he was joined by Judges Frederick E. Crane and John F. O'Brien. Andrews started with a short recitation of actualities: that a railroad worker had carelessly removed the bundle, the substance of which the trainman was ignorant, and the consequent blast broke the scale and harmed the offended party, "an expecting traveler". Andrews noticed the basic distinction among the judges concerning the law of carelessness: regardless of whether there must be an obligation to the offended party, the break of which harmed her, and whether, when there is a demonstration that is a risk to the wellbeing of others, its practitioner ought to be "at risk for all its proximate outcomes, even where they result in damage to one who might for the most part be believed to be outside the span of threat". Andrews trusted that if there was a careless demonstration, the proximate reason for damage to the offended party, that ought to set up obligation.
