Following her landing in Edmonton, she stated, Brownlee had called herÃ¢ÂÂremarking that "a little birdie" had disclosed to him that she was around the local areaÃ¢ÂÂand welcomed her to his home to meet his family; she before long turned into a normal guest there. She claimed that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the head grasped her hand and asked her what she knew "about existence". On her reaction that she knew likely as much as any young lady of eighteen, he welcomed her out the following night for what she assumed would be some counsel. Rather, he drove her west of town on Highway 16 and stopped on a side street before requesting that her have intercourse with him. He said that he had been frantically enamored with her from the begin, that he was desolate, that he and his better half had not lived respectively as man and spouse in quite a while, that his significant other (an invalid) would be jeopardized by a pregnancy, and that he couldn't be chief any more extended except if MacMillan consented to engage in sexual relations with him. He disclosed to her that in the event that she denied him, he would be compelled to continue his sexual association with his better half, and this would probably slaughter her. MacMillan responded dreadfully, and inquired as to whether there was whatever else she could do to help Brownlee and his better half; he answered that there was definitely not.
