The title was changed to "Exciting Wonder Stories" to coordinate the remainder of the "Exciting" line. The principal issue showed up in August 1936Ã¢ÂÂfour months after the last Gernsback "Miracle Stories" showed up. "Miracle Stories" had been month to month until the last few Gernsback issues; "Exciting Wonder" was propelled on an every other month plan. In February 1938 Weisinger requested peruser input in regards to the possibility of a buddy magazine; the reaction was certain, and in January 1939 the main issue of "Frightening Stories" showed up, rotating a very long time with "Exciting Wonder". After a year "Exciting Wonder" went month to month; this kept going less than eighteen months, and the every other month plan continued after April 1941. Weisinger left that late spring and was supplanted at both "Alarming" and "Exciting Wonder" by Oscar J. Companion, a mash essayist with more involvement in Westerns than sci-fi, however he had distributed a novel, "The Kid from Mars", in "Alarming Stories" simply the prior year. In mid-1943 the two magazines went to a quarterly timetable, and toward the finish of 1944 Friend was supplanted in his turn by Sam Merwin, Jr. The quarterly calendar endured until well after World War II finished: "Exciting Wonder" came back to an every other month plan with the December 1946 issue and again substituted with "Alarming" which went every other month in January 1947. Merwin left in 1951 so as to turn into an independent editorial manager, and was supplanted by Samuel Mines, who had worked for Ned Pines since 1942.
