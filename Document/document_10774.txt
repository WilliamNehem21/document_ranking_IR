With their expectations of Commonwealth domain status through a settlement with Britain darkening, Smith and the RF started to genuinely consider the option of a republic as ahead of schedule as December 1966, after the "Tiger" talks. Republicanism was exhibited as a way to illuminate Rhodesia's asserted protected status, end vagueness in regards to ties with Britain and inspire official outside acknowledgment and acknowledgment. Smith's legislature started investigating a republican constitution in March 1967. The Union Jack and Rhodesia's Commonwealth-style national bannerÃ¢ÂÂa ruined Sky Blue Ensign with the Union Jack in the cantonÃ¢ÂÂwere formally supplanted on 11 November 1968, the third commemoration of UDI, by another national banner: a green-white-green vertical triband, accused midway of the Rhodesian crest. After the electorate casted a ballot "yes" in a June 1969 choice both to another constitution and to the relinquishing of emblematic connections to the Crown, Smith proclaimed Rhodesia a republic on 2 March 1970. The 1969 constitution presented a President as head of express, a multiracial senate, separate highly contrasting constituent rolls (each with capabilities) and a component whereby the quantity of dark MPs would increment in accordance with the extent of pay charge incomes paid by dark residents. This procedure would stop once blacks had indistinguishable number of seats from whites; the proclaimed objective was not lion's share rule, but instead "equality between the races".
