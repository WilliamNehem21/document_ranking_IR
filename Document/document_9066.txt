The sightseers experienced issues discovering great adversaries; most province sides turned them down, despite the fact that Yorkshire played two informal matches against them. There was a great deal of terrible will, exacerbated by the Australians' entry in England at short notice, to some degree surprisingly. This was increased by an English discernment that the Australians came every now and again to amplify their benefits; at the time, demonstrable skill was disapproved of. In his collection of memoirs Lord Harris stated, "They asked nobody's altruism in the issue, and it was felt this was a rude method for rushing in on our game plans; and the outcome was they played barely any districts and were not commonly perceived ... We believed we needed to make a challenge against too visit visits". Harris at first evaded the group and endeavored to keep away from correspondence and gatherings with them. An endeavor to mastermind a diversion against an English XI for the Cricketers' Fund was turned down, and open promotions in the papers were disregarded. W.G. Elegance was thoughtful to the Australians and felt that they were not to fault for the uproar. He endeavored to mastermind an amusement for them at Lord's, yet was repelled by the Marylebone Cricket Club, who gave the reason that the ground was not accessible.
