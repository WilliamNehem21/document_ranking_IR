In the wake of venturing out to Rome to get his pallium, the image of his position as a diocese supervisor, William found that Thurstan had landed before him, and had introduced a body of evidence against William's race to Pope Callixtus II. There were four protests to William's decision: first that he was chosen in the ruler's court; second that the part of Canterbury had been constrained and was reluctant; third that his sanctification was unlawful in light of the fact that it was not performed by Thurstan; and fourth that a priest ought to be chosen to the see of Canterbury, which had been established by Augustine of Canterbury, a priest. Notwithstanding, King Henry I and the Emperor Henry V, Henry I's child in-law, influenced the pope to disregard the inconsistencies of the decision, with the stipulation that William vowed to comply "everything that the Pope forced upon him." At the finish of the visit the pope precluded the power from claiming Canterbury over York, rejecting the Canterbury house of God section's alleged ecclesiastical archives as phonies. The result was as per most before ecclesiastical decisions on the power issue, which included not favoring one side and along these lines fortifying ecclesiastical amazingness. William came back to England, and was enthroned at Canterbury on 22ÃÂ July 1123.
