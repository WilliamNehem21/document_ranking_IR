Kahne appeared in victory lane in front of the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season, which earned him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear: "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: "I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points." Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: "I screamed, âWeâve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel looseâ and they said, we do not have a wheel loose, we know we got them tight."
