The political and military parity in the district changed drastically amid the rule of Amut-piÃÂ¾el II; Shamshi-Adad I had kicked the bucket by around 1775 BC, and his realm deteriorated, while Yasmah-Adad was expelled from his position of authority and supplanted with Zimri-Lim. Yarim-Lim I picked up the high ground and transformed his kingdom into the incomparable power in the Levant; Qatna was compelled to regard the outskirts and interests of Yamhad. In Mari, Zimri-Lim, who was Yarim-Lim's protÃÂ©gÃÂ©, wedded Amut-piÃÂ¾el II's sister and Yasmah-Adad's widow Dam-Ã¡Â¸ÂªuraÃ¡Â¹Â£i, and this appeared to fulfill the ruler of Qatna, as his relations with Mari were never threatening. In 1772 BC, the Banu-Yamina clans rebelled against Zimri-Lim, who approached Qatna for help; Amut-piÃÂ¾el II sent his troops to DÃÂ«r-Yahdun-Lim (presumably present day Deir ez-Zor) to help Mari, yet when he requested Mariote military help sometime in the not too distant future, Zimri-Lim faltered as Yarim-Lim I was explicitly against such a dispatch. At the point when Qatna endeavored to build up a partnership with Eshnunna, Mari, which was at war with Eshnunna, captured the delivery people on the affection that Zimri-Lim dreaded for their security; in all actuality, the lord of Mari was most likely following up in the interest of Yamhad to keep Qatna from setting up such a union.
