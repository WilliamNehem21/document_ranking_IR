Hirst was reviewed for the last Test and assumed an indispensable job. "Wisden" said that he bowled just as he had in 1901 as he achieved an early batting breakdown. In spite of the fact that Australia recuperated, he had figures of five for 77. With Len Braund, Hirst then helped England to dodge the pursue on, scoring 43 and as indicated by "Wisden" "hitting with the most extreme opportunity." Hirst accepting a further wicket as Australia were expelled for 121. Britain, requiring 263 to win, were 48 for five at one point however an innings of 104 from Gilbert Jessop gave England a shot. Hirst scored 58 not out, making a forceful begin yet backing off to score mostly from singles in the later phases of the innings as wickets were lost. The ninth wicket fell with 15 required when Rhodes joined Hirst. It has been guaranteed that Hirst said to Rhodes, "We'll get them in singles", however neither one of the batsmans could recall those words being said and not every one of the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen held their nerve to take England to a one-wicket triumph. "Wisden" portrayed Hirst as playing "an extraordinary diversion", noticed the coolness of his play under strain and said that "Hirst's innings was in its path nearly as amazing as Jessop's".
