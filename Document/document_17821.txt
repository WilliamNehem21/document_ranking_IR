Less than two months after City stayed up, Jewell left to join Sheffield Wednesday, to be replaced by his assistant, Chris Hutchings. The club entered the Intertoto Cup, the first time they had competed in a European competition, in which they were defeated by FC Zenit Saint Petersburg in the semi-finals. Richmond gave Hutchings more money than Jewell to spend in the transfer market, and Bradford paid a club record Â£2.5Â million for David Hopkin and Â£1.5Â million for Ashley Ward, and signed Italian striker Benito Carbone on wages of Â£40,000 per week. Richmond also continued to re-develop the ground, which increased the capacity to 25,136, but later referred to his spending as his "six weeks of madness". In their second season in the Premier League, City struggled for form and Hutchings was sacked after a start to the season in which he recorded just one victory from 12Â leagueÂ games. Under new manager Jim Jefferies, the club were unable to avoid relegation, which was confirmed with a 2â1 defeat at Everton, when they missed two penalties, before finishing the season with just 26Â points.
Jefferies was sacked in December 2001 following a training ground rift with captain McCall. Nicky Law was appointed his successor, and the club finished the season in 15th place. During the summer, with debts of nearly Â£13Â millionâas a result of the collapse of ITV Digital and the fall-out from Richmond's self-proclaimed "six weeks of madness"âthe club were forced into administration. The players were all released, but Carbone waived much of the money owed to him, to help the club survive under new owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. City fulfilled their fixtures during the 2002â03 season but finished 19th.
