Marine well evolved creatures achieved their most noteworthy decent variety amid the Miocene, for example, with baleen whales with more than 20 perceived Miocene genera in contrast with just six surviving genera. Such decent variety exhibited a perfect setting to help a super-predator, for example, megalodon. Before the finish of the Miocene, numerous types of mysticetes had become wiped out; enduring species may have been quicker swimmers and along these lines increasingly slippery prey. Besides, after the conclusion of the Central American Seaway, tropical whales diminished in assorted variety and plenitude. The annihilation of megalodon associates with the decrease of numerous little mysticete heredities, and it is conceivable that it was very reliant on them as a sustenance source. Furthermore, a marine megafauna termination amid the Pliocene was found to have disposed of 36% of all vast marine species including 55% of marine warm blooded creatures, 35% of seabirds, 9% of sharks, and 43% of ocean turtles. The annihilation was specific for endotherms and mesotherms in respect to poikilotherms, inferring causation by a diminished sustenance supply and in this way predictable with megalodon being mesothermic. Megalodon may have been too expansive to even think about sustaining itself on the declining marine sustenance assets. The cooling of the seas amid the Pliocene may have limited the entrance of megalodon to the polar districts, denying it of the vast whales which had relocated there.
