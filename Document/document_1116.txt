The religious feelings of both Somerset and Northumberland have demonstrated subtle for students of history, who are isolated on the earnestness of their Protestantism. There is less uncertainty, in any case, about the religious enthusiasm of King Edward, who was said to have perused twelve sections of sacred writing every day and appreciated messages, and was remembered by John Foxe as a "genuine pixie". Edward was delineated amid his life and a while later as another Josiah, the scriptural lord who wrecked the icons of Baal. He could be vainglorious in his enemy of Catholicism and once requested that Catherine Parr induce Lady Mary "to go to no longer to remote moves and good times which don't turn into a most Christian princess". Edward's biographer Jennifer Loach alerts, be that as it may, against tolerating too promptly the devout picture of Edward passed on by the reformers, as in John Foxe's compelling "Demonstrations and Monuments", where a woodcut delineates the youthful ruler tuning in to a lesson by Hugh Latimer. In the early piece of his life, Edward adjusted to the overall Catholic works on, including participation at mass: however he wound up persuaded, affected by Cranmer and the reformers among his mentors and retainers, that "genuine" religion ought to be forced in England.
