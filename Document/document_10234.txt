Demise is over and over referenced as a characteristic, albeit pitiless movement: "Development", the storyteller states, "cherishes demise more than it adores you or me." A section in the second part of the book portrays a frog being "sucked dry" by a "goliath water bug" as the storyteller watches; this important remorselessness demonstrates request throughout everyday life and passing, regardless of how troublesome it might be to watch.

More than one insectÃÂ ... is an attack on all human excellence, all desire for a sensible god." While she stays attracted to the eventually disgusting and irreverent normal world, she likewise questions her place in it. The storyteller states, "I had thought to live by the side of the rivulet so as to shape my life to its free stream. Be that as it may, I appear to have achieved a point where I should take a stand. It looks just as the rivulet isn't lightening me however hauling me down."
