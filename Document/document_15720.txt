As the VerdejaÂ 1 program dissolved, Captain Verdeja began to design a successor taking into consideration lessons learned during the opening campaigns of the Second World War. The new design featured a redesigned engine bay at the rear of the chassis, which meant moving the drive sprocket to the rear as well. The movement of the engine's location allowed for better cooling of the vehicle's motor and the fighting compartment, as well as allowing the turret to be moved forward. The vehicle's armor was also increased substantially by between five and ten millimetres. This new tank was not approved for production or further development due to continued postponement of the production of the VerdejaÂ 1 for reasons which included offers by the German government to supply the Panzer IV's engine for the VerdejaÂ 1. Although production of the new vehicle finally began in 1942, it was not until August 1944 that the VerdejaÂ 2 prototype was delivered. The program was delayed by the incorporation of twenty Panzer IV Ausf. H's and ten SturmgeschÃ¼tz IIIs into the Spanish Army in late 1943, as well as failed attempts to procure one hundred more Panzer IVs and even Panthers and Tigers during 1944. With these new vehicles integrated into the army and the fiscal problems which plagued the VerdejaÂ 1, the VerdejaÂ 2 remained unimproved until 1950, when there was an attempt to fit a Pegaso Z-202 engine. Despite this, the Verdeja remained on factory grounds until 1973, when it was transferred to the Infantry Academy of Toledo.
