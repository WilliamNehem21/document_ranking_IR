During Sony's press conference at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show Capcom announced that a special edition of the game, "Biohazard 5: Alternative Edition", would be released in Japan for the PlayStation 3 in the spring of 2010. This edition supports the PlayStation Move accessory and includes a new scenario, "Lost in Nightmares", where Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine infiltrate one of Umbrella Corporation co-founder Oswell E. Spencer's estates in 2006. Another special edition of the game, "Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition", was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in North America and Europe. "Gold Edition" includes "Lost in Nightmares" and another campaign-expansion episode, "Desperate Escape", where players control Josh Stone and Jill Valentine as they assist Chris and Sheva. The edition also includes the previously released Versus mode, four new costumes and an alternate Mercenaries mode with eight new playable characters, new items and maps. Like "Alternative Edition", "Gold Edition" supports the PlayStation Move accessory with a patch released on September 14, 2010. The Xbox 360 version of "Gold Edition" came in a DVD with a token allowing free download of all DLC, while the PlayStation 3 version had all of the new content on a single Blu-ray disc. On November 5, 2012, "Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition" was placed on the PlayStation Network as a free download for PlayStation Plus users during that month.
