Around 1670, the congregation was revamped, an exhibition was worked at the western end of the nave, and the cut reredos and a huge wooden Royal emblem, presently at the west end of the nave, were procured in the meantime. An assessment report toward the finish of the eighteenth century remarked on the messy transept dividers, and the need to introduce what could be compared to a steers lattice to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich red hangings in the congregation had before pulled in the consideration of a criminal. The expanding gathering prompted the substitution of the seats and the development of exhibitions down the two sides of the structure in 1829, yet a progressively broad modifying was embraced in 1878Ã¢ÂÂ 80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The displays were evacuated and the two external walkways were included amid this period, a church was changed over to a vestry and enhancements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The expense of these works has been assessed as among ÃÂ£16,000 and more than ÃÂ£18,000 (). Later advancements incorporated the use of ÃÂ£13,000 () somewhere in the range of 1963 and 1968 to battle deathwatch insects discovered amid overhauling, enhancements to the warming framework, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the congregation.
