The city's objective was to make a blended use improvement with green space and moderate lodging. By April 2017, an exceptional board had limited the look for an arrangement and site engineer down to five recommendations. In May 2017, the Barry organization chose a proposition called Cloud Hill by the Nashville-based Mathews Company and supported by music maker T Bone Burnett. The proposed redevelopment of the 21-section of land site included music and workmanship space, a network focus, open park space, and moderate lodging. The impression of the baseball field and outfield would have been transformed into the Great Lawn, a green space pleasing beginner baseball and soccer. Renderings demonstrated the guitar scoreboard and a part of the outfield divider unblemished. The arrangement, which anticipated last endorsement by Metro Parks and the Metro Council, was met with worries by residents and gatherings whom liked to see the property reestablished completely to parkland and the site's Civil War history saved. Different concerns were raised over the absence of straightforwardness in the city's arranging procedure and the privatization of openly possessed land. Cloud Hill's designers dropped their arrangements in January 2018 after archeologists confirmed that undisturbed territories on the edge of the Greer property, however not part of the arena itself, were the plain internment locales of slaves compelled to manufacture Fort Negley. City hall leader Barry communicated her craving that the site respect the historical backdrop of the individuals who kicked the bucket assembling the stronghold.
