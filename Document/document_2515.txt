The two young ladies look out contemplatively from underneath the outstretched arms of Mrs. Bricklayer. The caps that the youngsters wear are attracted such a way, that they structure radiances around their heads, a touch Blake additionally utilizes in "Tunes of Innocence and of Experience" to demonstrate the intrinsic and celestial visionary limit of the kid (see for instance "The Ecchoing Green" and "The Little [B]oy Found"). The kids' eyes are openÃ¢ÂÂ"they" are taking a gander at what a fine morning it is and aching to participate in it. They can't take an interest, nonetheless, for they are under the stifling impact of Mrs. Bricklayer. As opposed to the youngsters' corona like caps Mrs. Bricklayer wears a vast cumbrous hood. Her eyes are sad to such a degree, that they have all the earmarks of being closed. Blake regularly attracts Urizen's eyes along these lines to connote the visual impairment of his discerning and realist 'Single vision.' See for instance plates 1, 9 and 22 of "The Book of Urizen" and plate 11 of "For Children: The Gates of Paradise" where Urizenic 'Matured Ignorance,' wearing extensive displays, indiscriminately takes away the freedom of a tyke accordingly keeping its creative trip in the first part of the day dawn. Amusingly at that point, Mrs. Artisan is the main individual in the representation who is "not" seeing what a fine morning it is. She looks down at the hard accurate earth, disregarding the unending and heavenly life around her. (accentuation Mitchell's)
