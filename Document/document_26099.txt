After Wimp Sanderson was forced out as coach of Alabama in 1992, Amaker was under consideration to replace him. In 1993, he was the leading candidate to assume the head coaching job at Northwestern when Bill Foster stepped aside to serve as interim athletic director, but at age 27, he declined the job when it was offered, noting that he had only been married one year and saying "It boiled down to us looking at a situation where we were extremely flattered, but a situation that wasn't right for us now." That summer Amaker was one of two college basketball members of the 10-man selection committee for the United States Olympic Team. In 1994, he was on the short list to replace Kevin O'Neill, who left Marquette for a job at Tennessee. In 1995, USC was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach Charlie Parker, who replaced George Raveling following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach Steve Lavin at UCLA in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because athletic director Rick Taylor sought a candidate with Division I head coaching postseason experience.
