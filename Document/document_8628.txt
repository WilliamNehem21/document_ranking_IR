Keith Wilson (Don Marshall), his significant other Dorothy (Janee Michelle), their girl Lisa (Venetta Rogers), and Keith's supervisor, Larry Tate (David White), visit the home of the Stephens family, with whom Lisa is to put in a couple of days while Keith is away on a work excursion for Larry. The Wilsons are African-American and the majority of different characters are white, including the Stephens family: Darrin (Dick Sargent), his better half Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), their little girl Tabitha (Erin Murphy), and their child Adam (David Lawrence). Tabitha is happy to have the capacity to put in a couple of days with Lisa and says they will incidentally be sisters. Darrin is another of Larry's workers at publicizing organization McMann and Tate. Darrin is endeavoring to arrive a million-dollar account from Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer), who claims a toy organization. Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens living arrangement unannounced to see whether Darrin has any dim privileged insights. Whenever Mr. Brockway arrives, Samantha is watching out for Adam upstairs, so Lisa answers the entryway. At the point when Lisa says her dad works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha's sister, Mr. Brockway leaves, saying he has seen enough.
