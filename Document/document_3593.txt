, there is a claim in advancement to decide the legitimate holder of the PRE stud book. The UniÃÂ³n de Criadores de Caballos EspaÃÂ±oles (UCCE or Union of Spanish Horse Breeders) has conveyed a case to the most elevated European Union courts in Brussels, charging that the Ministry of Spain's exchange of the first PRE Libro de Origen (the official stud book) from the "Cria Caballar" to ANCCE was unlawful. In mid 2009, the courts chose sake of UCCE, clarifying that the "Cria Caballar" shaped the "Libro de Origin". Since it was shaped by an administration substance, it is against European Union law for the stud book to be exchanged to a private element, a law that was broken by the exchange of the book to ANCCE, which is a non-legislative association. The court found that by giving ANCCE sole control of the stud book, Spain's Ministry of Defense was acting in a biased way. The court held that Spain must offer authorization to keep up a breed stud book (called a "Libro GenealÃÂ³gico") to any worldwide affiliation or Spanish national affiliation which demands it. In view of the Brussels court choice, an application has been made by the Foundation for the Pure Spanish Horse to keep up the United States stud book for the PRE. , Spain has not renounced ANCCE's entitlement to be the sole holder of the PRE stud book, and has rather reaffirmed the association's status.
