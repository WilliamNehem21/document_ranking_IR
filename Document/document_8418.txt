In 1807, Desha was chosen to the first of six back to back terms in the U.S. Place of Representatives. A Democratic-Republican, he was viewed as a warmonger, supporting the War of 1812. In 1813, he volunteered to serve in the war and told a division at the Battle of the Thames. Coming back to Congress after the war, he was the main individual from the Kentucky congressional assignment to contradict the disagreeable Compensation Act of 1816. About each other individual from the appointment was vanquished for re-appointment after the vote, yet Desha's restriction to the demonstration helped him hold his seat. He didn't look for re-appointment in 1818, and made a fruitless keep running for representative in 1820, losing to John Adair. By 1824, the Panic of 1819 had demolished Kentucky's economy, and Desha made a second battle for the governorship solely on guarantees of help for the state's huge indebted person class. He was chosen by a vast dominant part, and obligation alleviation partisans caught the two places of the General Assembly. After the Kentucky Court of Appeals upset obligation help laws supported by Desha and most of the governing body, the officials annulled the court and made a substitution court, to which Desha named a few obligation alleviation partisans. The current court would not recognize the authenticity of the move, and amid a period known as the Old Court Ã¢ÂÂ New Court debate, two courts after all other options have run out existed in the state.
