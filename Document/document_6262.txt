Point du Sable settled on the north bank of the Chicago River near its mouth sooner or later during the 1780s. The most punctual known record of Point duSable living in Chicago is a passage that Hugh Heward made in his diary on May10, 1790, amid an adventure from Detroit crosswise over Michigan and through Illinois. Heward's gathering ceased at Point duSable's home enroute to the Chicago portage; they swapped their kayak for a pirogue that had a place with Point duSable, and they purchased bread, flour, and pork from him. Perrish Grignon, who visited Chicago in around 1794, portrayed Point duSable as an expansive man and well off dealer. Point du Sable's granddaughter, Eulalie Pelletier, was conceived at his Chicago River settlement in 1796. In 1800 Point duSable sold his homestead to John Kinzie's frontman, Jean La Lime, for 6,000 livres. The bill of offer, which was rediscovered in 1913 out of a chronicle in Detroit, laid out the majority of the property Point duSable claimed just as a significant number of his belongings. This incorporated a house, two stables, a pony drawn factory, a bakehouse, a poultry house, a dairy, and a smokehouse. The house was a log lodge loaded up with fine furnishings and canvases.
