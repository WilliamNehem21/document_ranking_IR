"Gone for Goode" incorporated a few storylines, and even accurate bits of exchange, adjusted straight from "Crime: A Year on the Killing Streets". One of the greatest story bends from the primary season was the homicide of 11-year-old Adena Watson, which is presented in "Gone for Goode" and goes on for five scenes until "Three Men and Adena". The case depended on the homicide of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace, which made up a noteworthy piece of Simon's book. The Watson case, similar to the Wallace case, eventually goes unsolved. A subplot from "Gone for Goode" and "Child of a Gun" included the examination concerning Calpurnia Smith, an old lady associated with killing five spouses so as to gather their extra security arrangements. This depended on the genuine instance of Geraldine Parrish, who was likewise blamed for executing five spouses for protection cash, and was in the end sentenced for three for their homicides. Another multi-scene curve included the close deadly shooting of Patrolman Chris Thormann, which leaves the officer daze. This was likewise adjusted from genuine life occasions in Simon's book, in spite of the fact that "Crime" journalists included the bit of Steve Crosetti thinking about the case literally dependent on his dear fellowship with the person in question.
