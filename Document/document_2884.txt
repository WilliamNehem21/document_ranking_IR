In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-coordinated sentimental dramatization "Hamari Adhuri Kahani". Written by Mahesh Bhatt, the film recounts to the narrative of Vasudha, a single parent caught in an oppressive marriage, who has an additional conjugal illicit relationship. Shubha Shetty-Saha of "Late morning" remarked that Vidya "has demonstrated to us what she's equipped for in her prior motion pictures. Yet, here, saddled with an exhausting, obsolete, tearful character, there was not a lot even she could do". Vidya next assumed the piece of a cop in "Te3n" (2016), a spine chiller roused by the 2013 South Korean film "Montage", co-featuring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She related to her character's "quiet animosity" and attracted to playing a character who directions regard. NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee censured the choice to charge Vidya's crucial job as an uncommon appearance and noticed how much her essence profited the film. Rajeev Masand was condemning of the film's anticipated conclusion, however composed that Vidya "is dependably strong each time she's on screen, raising her forehead, twisting her lip to successfully impart beyond what words can". She at that point depicted the performing artist Geeta Bali in various melodies for "Ekk Albela", a Marathi language biopic of Bhagwan Dada.
