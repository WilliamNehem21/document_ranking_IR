Frustrated by her terminating from "Dr. Vegas", Adams, at 30 years of age, considered searching for an elective profession in the wake of completing work on the sole venture she was marked to. It was the autonomous parody dramatization "Junebug", which had a generation spending plan of under $1 million. Coordinated by Phil Morrison, the film included Adams as Ashley Johnsten, a peppy and garrulous pregnant lady. Morrison was awed by Adams' capacity to not scrutinize her character's intrinsically great intentions. She found an association with Johnsten's confidence in God, and invested energy with Morrison in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (where the film is set), going to chapel. She portrayed making the film as "the mid year I developed into myself", and in the wake of coloring her hair red for the part, she chose to not return to her normal blonde shading. "Junebug" debuted at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where Adams won an uncommon jury prize. Tim Robey of "The Daily Telegraph" marked the film a "little, calm wonder" and composed that Adams had given "a standout amongst the most carefully amusing and grievous exhibitions it's at any point been my pleasure to audit". Ann Hornaday of "The Washington Post" opined that her "brilliant depiction" mirrored the film's "profoundly humanist heart". Adams got her first Academy Award assignment, for Best Supporting Actress, and won an Independent Spirit Award.
