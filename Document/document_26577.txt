The Inaccessible rail is endemic to the uninhabited Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha group in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. The island is in area and has a temperate wet oceanic climate with high rainfall, limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds. The rail is found in almost all habitats on the island and at all altitudes, from sea-level to . It reaches its highest densities in fields of tussock grass ("Spartina arundinacea"), with 10 birds per hectare, and in tussock grass mixed with ferns ("Blechnum penna-marina") and sedges, with 15 birds per hectare. This habitat is found close to the shore and surrounds most of the island on the steep cliffs. The Inaccessible Island rail can also be found in upland fern-bush heath, dominated by wind-stunted tree-ferns ("Blechnum palmiforme") and in the island forest in the central plateau which is dominated by Island Cape myrtle ("Phylica arborea")âwhich can reach where shelteredâand "Blechnum palmiforme". In both these habitats the population is estimated to be two birds per hectare. It will also forage among boulders on the beaches, but has not been found in the short dry grasses on the cinder cones (the scientists making the observations cautioned that this does not mean that they never use the habitat). It frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed.
