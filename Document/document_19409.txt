Six "God of War" soundtracks have been commercially released and have featured several composers, including Gerard K. Marino, Ron Fish, Winifred Phillips, Mike Reagan, Cris Velasco, Winnie Waldron, Marcello De Francisci, Jeff Rona, Tyler Bates, and Bear McCreary. On March 1, 2005, "God of War: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game" was released on CD by SIE as an exclusive product for the Sony Connect Music Store. It has been praised for its well-developed orchestral themes, and the creative use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation. The composers were also praised for avoiding the production of never-ending action themes. "God of War II: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game" was released on CD by SIE on April 10, 2007. Praised as strong, the album features ominous orchestral pieces, and each composer's contributions are slightly more distinctive than the previous soundtrack. "God of War III: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game" was released on CD by SIE and Sumthing Else on March 30, 2010. It was also included as downloadable content in the "God of War III Ultimate Edition" and "Ultimate Trilogy Edition" collections. The soundtrack was praised as an orchestral success and the best score in the series at that time.
