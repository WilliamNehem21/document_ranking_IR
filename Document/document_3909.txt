The Manchester United club shop has had six unique areas since it was first opened. Initially, the shop was a little cottage close to the railroad line that keeps running nearby the ground. The shop was then moved along the length of the South Stand, ceasing first inverse where away fans enter the ground, and after that dwelling in the structure that would later turn into the club's marketing office. A flood in the club's fame in the mid 1990s prompted another move, this opportunity to the forecourt of the West Stand. With this move came an incredible development and the change from a little shop to a "megastore". Alex Ferguson opened the new megastore on 3 December 1994. The latest moves came in the late 1990s, as the West Stand expected space to extend to a second level, and that implied the devastation of the megastore. The store was moved to an impermanent site inverse the East Stand, before relocating to the ground floor of the extended East Stand in 2000. The floor space of the megastore was possessed by United's pack supports, Nike, who worked the store until the expiry of their sponsorship bargain toward the finish of July 2015, when proprietorship returned to the club.
