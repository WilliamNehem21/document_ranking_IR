The Germans and Austro-Hungarians wanted to transport munitions down the Danube to the Ottoman Empire, so on 24 December 1914, "Bodrog" and the minesweeper "Almos" escorted the steamer "Trinitas" loaded with munitions, the patrol boat "b" and two tugs from Zemun past Belgrade towards the Iron Gates gorge on the SerbianâRomanian border. The convoy ran the gauntlet of the Belgrade defences unharmed, but when it reached Smederevo it received information that the Russians had established a minefield and log barrier just south of the Iron Gates. It turned back under heavy fire, and withdrew as far as PanÄevo without serious damage to any vessel. "Bodrog" returned to base, and the monitor was sent to guard the munitions and escort the convoy back to Petrovaradin. In January 1915, British artillery arrived in Belgrade, further bolstering its defences, and "Bodrog" spent the first months of the year at Zemun. On 23 February, LSL Kosimus BÃ¶hm took command. On 1 March, "Bodrog" and several other vessels including the monitor were relocated to Petrovaradin. After the commencement of the Gallipoli campaign, munitions supply to the Ottomans became critical, so another attempt was planned. On 30 March, the steamer "Belgrad" left Zemun, escorted by "Bodrog" and "Enns". The convoy was undetected as it sailed past Belgrade at night during a storm, but after the monitors returned to base, "Belgrad" struck a mine near VinÄa, and after coming under heavy artillery fire, exploded near Ritopek. On 22 April 1915, a British picket boat that had been brought overland by rail from Salonika was used to attack the Danube Flotilla anchorage at Zemun, firing two torpedoes without success.
