A fight solidified "Huntley-Brinkley" journalist later said that no military activity he had seen had ever alarmed or exasperates him as much as what he found in Birmingham. Two away picture takers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had recently worked with the "Montgomery Advertiser" and was currently working "Forever" magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press. Moore was a Marine battle picture taker who was "bumped" and "sickened" by the utilization of kids and what the Birmingham police and local groups of fire-fighters did to them. Moore was hit in the lower leg by a block implied for the police. He took a few photographs that were imprinted "Throughout everyday life". The primary photograph Moore shot that day demonstrated three young people being hit by a water fly from a high-weight firehose. It was titled "They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out". A shorter form of the inscription was later utilized as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's memoir. The "Life" photograph turned into a "time characterizing picture" and was contrasted with the photograph of Marines raising the U.S. banner on Iwo Jima. Moore speculated that the film he shot "was probably going to crush in the national mind any thought of a 'decent southerner'." Hudson commented later that his solitary needs that day were "making pictures and remaining alive" and "not getting bit by a puppy."
