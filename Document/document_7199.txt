On 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first lesson in ZÃÂ¼rich. Straying from the predominant routine with regards to putting together a message with respect to the Gospel exercise of a specific Sunday, Zwingli, utilizing Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his understanding amid the lesson, known as the strategy for "lectio continua". He kept on perusing and decipher the book on ensuing Sundays until he achieved the end and afterward continued in a similar way with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, lastly the Old Testament. His thought processes in doing this are not clear, yet in his messages he utilized admonishment to accomplish moral and clerical improvement which were objectives practically identical with Erasmian change. At some point after 1520, Zwingli's philosophical model started to advance into a particular structure that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Researchers don't concur on the procedure of how he built up his own one of a kind model. One view is that Zwingli was prepared as an Erasmian humanist and Luther assumed an unequivocal job in changing his religious philosophy. Another view is that Zwingli did not give much consideration to Luther's religious philosophy and in certainty he thought about it as a major aspect of the humanist change development. A third view is that Zwingli was not a total devotee of Erasmus, however had separated from him as right on time as 1516 and that he autonomously built up his philosophy.
