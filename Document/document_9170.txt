Toward the start of 2004, General Ricardo Sanchez, head of Multinational Force Iraq (MNFÃ¢ÂÂ I), asserted that the US had "gained critical ground in Anbar Province." However, CPA assets for the area were lacking. A unit authority in Fallujah was designated just $200,000 every month, when he evaluated that it would cost at any rate $25 million to restart the city's industrial facilities, which utilized a huge number of specialists. By February, radical assaults were quickly expanding. On 12 February, United States Central Command (CENTCOM) administrator General John P. Abizaid and Major General Chuck Swannack, the 82nd Airborne's boss, were assaulted while driving through Fallujah. On 14 February, in an occurrence named the "Valentine's Day Massacre", guerillas overran a police headquarters in downtown Fallujah, killing 23 to 25 policemen and liberating 75 detainees. The following day, the Americans terminated Fallujah's police boss for declining to wear his uniform and captured the civic chairman. In March, Keith Mines expressed, "there is anything but a solitary appropriately prepared and prepared Iraqi security officer in the whole Al Anbar area." He included that security was altogether reliant on American warriors, yet those equivalent fighters aroused Sunni patriots. That equivalent month General Swannack gave a preparation on Anbar where he discussed improved security, pronounced the insurrection there was everything except completed, and finished up "the future for Al Anbar in Iraq stays extremely splendid."
