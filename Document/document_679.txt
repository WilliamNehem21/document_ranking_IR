In 1983, Carlo D'Este composed that the most legitimate spot for a British assault would have been out of the Orne bridgehead, on the extraordinary eastern flank of the Allied lodgement. An assault there had been dismissed by Montgomery, Dempsey and O'Connor as farfetched. A few authors portrayed the goal of Epsom as an assault to make progress, while others have proposed that the task had different targets. In 2004, Williams composed that because of ULTRA captures, Montgomery knew about Rommel's arrangement to assault towards Bayeux and that Epsom was planned to thwart it. Wilmot in 1952 composed that the task was proposed to draw the I SS Panzer Corps and the recently arrived II SS Panzer Corps into fight around Caen. Hart composed that Montgomery needed to keep the activity and keep German reinforced powers from moving from toward the west against the US First Army or being diminished and shaping a hold. The landing of the II SS Panzer Corps was an impetus for Operation Epsom, which holding the activity by driving the German order to utilize the II SS Panzer Corps against VIII Corps. Hastings wrote in 1985 that "no rational officer" would mount an assault as large as Epsom without "each expectation of getting through the German barriers, or if nothing else of making the adversary make considerable withdrawals". D'Este composed that "No measure of misrepresentation can hide that the genuine item had been a short pincer development to defeat Caen".
