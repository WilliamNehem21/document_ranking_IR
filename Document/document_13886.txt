Edgardo came back to the Catechumens on 22 October, and was visited by his folks regularly throughout the following month. Likewise with Momolo's first round of visits, two distinct renditions developed of what occurred. As indicated by Edgardo's folks, the kid was clearly threatened by the ministers around him and dedicated himself completely to his mom's arms when he initially observed her. Marianna later stated: "He had shed pounds and had turned pale; his eyes were loaded up with terrorÃÂ ... I disclosed to him that he was brought into the world a Jew like us and like us he should dependably stay one, and he answered: "'Si, mia cara mamma", I will always remember to state the "Shema" consistently.'" One report in the Jewish press portrayed the clerics revealing to Edgardo's folks that God had picked their child to be "the messenger of Christianity to his family, committed to changing over his folks and his kin", and that they could have him back in the event that they likewise moved toward becoming Christians. The ministers and nuns at that point bowed and appealed to God for the transformation of the Mortara family unit, inciting Edgardo's folks to leave in dread.
