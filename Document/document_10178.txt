Mint Director Henry Linderman expressed in 1873 of Peale, "Despite the fact that Mr. Peale without a doubt got the collaboration of [Patterson and others], the developments and upgrades were particularly Mr. Peale's. I have most likely whatever on that point. They were of practically limitless incentive to the open administration." George G. Evans, in his late nineteenth century history of the Mint, portrayed Peale, "his mellowness, respectability, courteous bearing and high good and mental culture comprised him a model officer". Walter Breen considered Peale, "splendid yet corrupt". Burdette composes of Peale and his impact on the Mint, "amid the age from around 1830 to 1855, the best impact to tasks and creation originated from exclusive: Benjamin Franklin Peale. He was the quintessential 'mechanical engineer' of the day when this term included inventive structure, arranging, development and improvement of working processesÃÂ ... While he had the total help of mint chiefs Moore and Patterson, he was likewise held in high regard by the normal mint laborers and Philadelphia's logical tip top. Consequences of a large number of his thoughts kept going a century or more, until development in populace made nineteenth century building inadequate for present day coinage needs." According to Bowers, "today Peale is one of a few Mint individuals who can be seen from a wide range of edges, every point of view in some cases driving certain authors to make generally contrasting determinations."
