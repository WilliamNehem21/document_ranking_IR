Although "xx" had been highly anticipated by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound would have been entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was "baffled" by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I have to be a bit more private." At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the Â£20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album "Coexist". When "Coexist" debuted in September 2012, "xx" was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on "NME"s list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by "Rolling Stone", who found its music radical as "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" during popular music's period of maximalism.
