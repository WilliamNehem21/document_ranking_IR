By April 2008, Zinta had finished shooting for Jahnu Barua's show "Har Pal". Around the same time she assumed the main job of Chand in Deepa Mehta's Canadian film "Paradise on Earth", a Punjabi language otherworldly show dependent on the genuine story of a youthful Indian lady who, after an orchestrated marriage to a non-occupant Indian man from Canada, relocates to Toronto and turns into a casualty of extreme household misuse. Communicating her craving for "another sort of acting test", Zinta portrayed Mehta as one chief she was yearning to work with to satisfy it. To plan for the part, she read and watched a few books and documentaries on abusive behavior at home. As the film was to be shot completely in Punjabi, a language that was thoroughly strange to her, she learnt it in a compressed lesson of fifty days. She was passionate amid the creation of the film: "I never realized a character would influence me so profoundly. I've turned out to be totally pulled back and contemplative... I can't snap out of the character." She in the end called it her most testing task, as it helped her "shed everything that Preity Zinta was about." "Paradise on Earth" was first screened at a few film celebrations and, upon discharge, accumulated vocation best surveys for Zinta. Her execution earned her the Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress at the 2008 Chicago International Film Festival, for "her solid yet unobtrusive execution as a lady attempting to keep her fantasies in spite of ruthless substances." Among different honors, she was recognized with Best Actress assignments at a few honor works in Canada, including the Genie Award by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, and the Vancouver Film Critics Circle.
