The ship cruised from Jacksonville with 27 or 28ÃÂ men and a payload of provisions and ammo for the Cuban dissidents. On the St. Johns River and not exactly from Jacksonville, "Commodore" struck a sandbar in a thick haze and harmed its structure. Despite the fact that towed off the sandbar the next day, it was stranded again in Mayport and again harmed. A break started in the engine compartment that night and, because of failing water siphons, the ship ground to a halt about from Mosquito Inlet. As the ship took on more water, Crane portrayed the motor room as taking after "a scene as of now taken from the center kitchen of hades." "Commodore"s rafts were brought down in the early hours of the morning on January 2, 1897 and the ship at last sank at 7ÃÂ a.m. Crane was one of the last to leave the ship in a dinghy. In a difficulty that he described in the short story "The Open Boat", Crane and three other men (counting the ship's Captain) fumbled off the bank of Florida for multi day and a half before attempting to arrive the dinghy at Daytona Beach. The little vessel toppled in the surf, constraining the depleted men to swim to shore; one of them passed on. Having lost the gold given to him for his adventure, Crane wired Cora Taylor for help. She went to Daytona and came back to Jacksonville with Crane the following day, just four days after he had left on the "Commodore".
