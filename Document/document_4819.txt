The Washington Naval Treaty, marked in February 1922, incredibly decreased the tonnage took into account capital ships in the signatory countries. The bargain additionally founded a ban on new warship development; battlecruisers dropped under this included one class each from Japan, the United States, and Great Britain: the "Amagi" class, the and the G3 class, individually. The bargain allowed for war vessel and battlecruiser bodies right now under development to be changed over into plane carrying warships, yet just if these new bearers were held under a 27,000-ton limit. Taking into account that the "Amagi" class were intended to dislodge at full burden in their battlecruiser design, this would have been a somewhat troublesome removal to acquire. Nonetheless, the Americans additionally had a similar issue when planning a transformation of their "Lexington" class, so a special case, led by US Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., was added to the bargain that gave the five signatories the choice of changing over up to two capital ships that were under development to 33,000-ton plane carrying warships. This brought about the United States and Japan rapidly reordering two ships each. Japan picked "Amagi" and "Akagi", the two ships closest to finishing, for transformation.
