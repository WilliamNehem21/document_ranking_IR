After one long keep running in "The Heiress", Richardson showed up in another, RCSherriff's "Home at Seven", in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank agent who fears he may have submitted murder. He later reproduced the part in a radio communicate, and in a movie variant, which was his sole endeavor into bearing for the screen. When he had assumed himself into a job in a long run, Richardson felt ready to work amid the daytime in movies, and made two others in the mid 1950s close to the movie of the Sherriff piece: "Outsider of the Islands", coordinated via Carol Reed, and David Lean's "The Sound Barrier", discharged in 1951 and 1952 individually. For the last he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his trademark enjoying for exchanging between current jobs and the works of art, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in "Three Sisters" in 1951. He headed a solid cast, with RenÃÂ©e Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, yet commentators found the generation feebly coordinated, and some felt that Richardson neglected to camouflage his constructive identity when playing the inadequate Vershinin. He didn't endeavor Chekhov again for in excess of a fourth of a century.
