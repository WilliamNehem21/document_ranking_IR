Godwin had a long lasting enthusiasm for language and correspondence (as is obvious in Gonsales' different methods for speaking with his hireling Diego on St Helena), and this was the theme of his "Nuncius inanimatus" (1629). The language Gonsales experiences on the Moon bears no connection to any he knows about, and it takes him months to get adequate familiarity to discuss legitimately with the occupants. While its vocabulary seems constrained, its potential outcomes for significance are duplicated since the importance of words and expressions likewise relies upon tone. Imagined dialects were an imperative component of prior fantastical records, for example, Thomas More's "Ideal world", FranÃÂ§ois Rabelais' "Gargantua and Pantagruel" and Joseph Hall's "Mundus Alter et Idem", all books that Godwin knew about. P. Cornelius, in an investigation of designed dialects in fanciful travel accounts from the seventeenth and eighteenth hundreds of years, suggests that an ideal, sanely composed language is demonstrative of the Enlightenment's logic. As H. Neville Davies contends, Godwin's fanciful language is more immaculate than for example More's in one viewpoint: it is spoken on the whole Moon and has not experienced the Earthly scattering of dialects brought about by the fall of the Tower of Babel.
