Both the Americans and the British misunderstood the nature of "Canadien" (as French Canadians were then known) society. The feudal nature of "Canadien" society with the "seigneurs" and the Catholic Church owning the land led the British to assume the "habitants"Â â as the tenant farmers who made up the vast majority of Quebec's population were knownÂ â would deferentially obey their social superiors while the Americans believed that the "habitants" would welcome them as liberators from their feudal society. In fact, the "habitants", despite being tenant farmers, tended to display many of the same traits displayed by the farmers in the 13 colonies who mostly owned their land, being described variously as individualistic, stubborn, and spirited together with a tendency to be rude and disrespectful of authority figures if their actions were seen as unjust. Most of the "habitants" wanted to be neutral in the struggle between Congress vs. the Crown, just wanting to live their lives in peace. Carleton's romanticized view of "Canadien" society led him to exaggerate the willingness of the "habitants" to obey the "seigneurs" as he failed to understand that the "habitants" would only fight for a cause that they saw as being in their own interests. A large number of the "Canadiens" still clung to the hope that one day Louis XVI would reclaim his kingdom's lost colony of New France, but until then, they wanted to be left alone.
