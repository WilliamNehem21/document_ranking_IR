The accounts themselves were planned as looks into the "Radiance" universe, including data on the internal operations of the outsider Covenant, just as insights about components of the back-story that were heretofore undisclosed. Jarrard clarified that "The narratives that occur off camera, the parallel occasions to the circular segments that our fans know from the current mediums, are the accounts we truly needed to tell." Jarrard further depicted this as an endeavor to move far from the tale of the Master Chief, the focal character of the establishment, and spotlight rather on what they accepted to be the center subjects that lay behind the amusement universe, for example, keeping up expectation despite overpowering chances and humankind's battle for survival; topics that stretched out past "...ÃÂ a hereditarily upgraded super officer grabbing two firearms and kicking some outsider handle." The four stories that wound up in the last production were "the most intriguing to [Bungie], and the authors of [the novel]". In spite of the fact that Bungie made the story curves present in the "Radiance Graphic Novel", the studio depicted the significance of giving a system to every story that the different specialists and scholars could tell without risking their very own voice. Craftsman Simon Bisley said that "the pressure was to make the characters look especially as they do in the diversion. Past that point I was without given rein to decipher the content and the activity" in light of what was given to the specialists and authors.
