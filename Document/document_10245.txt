Crowley and Germer needed to see Smith evacuated as leader of the Agape Lodge, trusting that he had turned into a terrible impact on its individuals. Parsons and Helen kept in touch with them to protect their tutor however Germer requested him to remain down; Parsons was delegated as transitory leader of the Lodge. Some veteran Lodge individuals detested Parsons' impact, worried that it supported over the top sexual polyandry that was religiously inconvenient, however his alluring speeches at Lodge gatherings guaranteed his notoriety among most of devotees. Parsons before long made the Thelemite diary "Oriflamme", in which he distributed his very own verse, however Crowley was unimpressedparticularly because of Parsons' depictions of medication useand the venture was before long retired. Helen brought forth Smith's child in April; the tyke was named Kwen Lanval Parsons. Smith and Helen left with Kwen for a two-room lodge in Rainbow Valley in May. Simultaneously in England, Crowley attempted a visionary examination of Smith's introduction to the world outline and arrived at the resolution that Smith was the manifestation of a divine being, enormously adjusting his estimation of him. Smith stayed doubtful as Crowley's investigation was apparently purposely concocted to support Parsons, urging Smith to venture down from his job in the Agape Lodge and training him to take a thoughtful retreat. Declining to take orders from Germer any more, Smith left the O.T.O. ParsonsÃ¢ÂÂwho stayed thoughtful and well disposed to Smith amid the contention and was exhausted of Crowley's "shocking self love, awful taste, awful judgment, and pedanticism"Ã¢ÂÂ stopped cabin exercises and surrendered as its head, yet pulled back his abdication in the wake of getting a conciliating letter from Crowley.
