Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh before long demonstrated unequipped for reestablishing request to the undeniably violent area. By 935, the troops were revolting over absence of pay, and Bedouin strikes had recommenced. In the meantime, Takin's child Muhammad and the financial chairman Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali al-Madhara'iÃ¢ÂÂthe beneficiary of a tradition of civil servants that had taken care of the region's accounts since the season of Ibn Tulun and amassed gigantic richesÃ¢ÂÂundermined Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and desired his position. Infighting broke out among the troops between the Easterners ("Mashariqa"), mostly Turkish officers, who bolstered Muhammad ibn Takin, and the Westerners ("Maghariba"), presumably Berbers and Black Africans, who sponsored Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh. With the help this season of the previous vizier and examiner general of the western areas al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat, whose child was hitched to one of Ibn Tughj's girls, Ibn Tughj was yet again named the legislative leader of Egypt. Playing it safe, Ibn Tughj sorted out an attack of the nation via land and ocean. In spite of the fact that Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh had the capacity to postpone the development of the military, Ibn Tughj's armada took Tinnis and the Nile Delta and proceeded onward to the capital Fustat. Outflanked and crushed in fight, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh fled to the Fatimids. The triumphant Muhammad ibn Tughj entered Fustat on 26 August 935.
