Caracciola's leap forward year was in 1926. The debut German Grand Prix was held at the AVUS track on 11 July, yet the date conflicted with a progressively lofty race in Spain. The recently combined organization Mercedes-Benz, aware of fare contemplations, picked the last race to run their principle group. Hearing this, Caracciola took a short leave from his activity and went to the Mercedes office in Stuttgart to request a vehicle. Mercedes consented to loan Caracciola and Adolf Rosenberger two 1923 2-liter M218s, if they enter not as works drivers but rather independents. Rosenberger began well before the 230,000ÃÂ spectators, however Caracciola slowed down his motor. His riding technician, Eugen Salzer, hopped out and pushed the vehicle to kick it off, however when they started moving they had lost over a moment to the pioneers. It began to rain, and Caracciola passed numerous autos that had resigned in the poor conditions. Rosenberger lost control at the North Curve on the eighth lap when attempting to pass a slower vehicle, and collided with the timekeepers' container, killing every one of the three inhabitants; Caracciola continued driving. In the mist and downpour, he had no clue which position he was in, yet set out to continue driving so he could in any event complete the race. When he completed the twentieth and last lap, he was astonished to find that he had won the race. The German press named him "Regenmeister", or "Rainmaster", for his ability in the wet conditions.
