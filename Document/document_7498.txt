The 2011Ã¢ÂÂ 12 Harvard group crushed then-positioned Florida State (#22 AP Poll Ã¢ÂÂ #20 Coaches' Poll) on November 25, 2011 for the school's second win over a positioned group in the program's history, and the most elevated positioned rival in the Coaches' Poll that Harvard had vanquished up to that point. On December 5, 2011, Harvard showed up in either the AP Poll (25) or Coaches' Poll (24). It left Brown as the main residual Ivy League school to have never been positioned in the AP Poll and leaves just seven schools that have played Division I b-ball since the AP Poll started that have never been positioned in it. Harvard was the principal Ivy League group positioned in the Coaches' Poll since the 2009Ã¢ÂÂ 10 Cornell Big Red and the primary Ivy League group positioned in the AP Poll since the 1997Ã¢ÂÂ 98 Princeton Tigers, who completed eighth in the survey. By January 2, the group accomplished rankings of 22 in the AP Poll and 21 in the Coaches' Poll. The group was additionally positioned 21st in the Coaches' Poll on February 6. The group set up another record for single-season wins just as single-season non-association wins and tied the record for gathering diversion wins. Amaker was chosen by the U.S. B-ball Writers Association as the 2011Ã¢ÂÂ 12 Men's District I (ME, VT, NH, RI, MA, CT) Coach of the Year. He won the NABC Coach of the Year for District 13 and was again a finalist for both the Ben Jobe Award and the Hugh Durham Award. On March 6, 2012, Harvard earned its originally offer to the NCAA Tournament since 1946.
