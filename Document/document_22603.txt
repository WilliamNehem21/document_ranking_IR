Their FA Cup success was the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the dominant club in England. They won the First Division for the first time in 1930â31; Arsenal performed strongly in a free-scoring title race with Aston Villa, recording several heavy wins (including 7â1 against Blackpool, 7â2 v Leicester City, and 9â1 v Grimsby Town, which remains a club record for the top flight). Arsenal won the title with two games to spare, and finished the season having scored 127 league goals (another club record), though Aston Villa managed to score 128, which is still a record for the most goals in an English top flight season.
The following season, 1931â32, Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1â0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again in the second half to win the match 2â1. Arsenal's pain was compounded by the fact that Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931â32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.
