Before the finish of April 1942, Waddy had scored four-and-a-half triumphs over adversary air ship. Advanced flying officer, he accomplished four "slaughters" in a solitary foray on 12ÃÂ May 1942, wrecking two Junkers JuÃÂ 52 load planes and two escorting BfÃÂ 110s from a German air transport caravan working among Crete and North Africa. He was granted the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for this activity, gazetted on 2ÃÂ October. The reference commended his "skillful airmanship as a military pilot" and his "extraordinary bravery and dedication to obligation". Not long after guaranteeing a triumph over a Messerschmitt BfÃÂ 109 on 22ÃÂ May, Waddy was presented on another RAF unit, No.ÃÂ 260 Squadron, flying Kittyhawks. He represented two foe flying machine in June, before being doled out to No. 4 Squadron, South African Air Force, with which he demolished a BfÃÂ 109 in September. In October, Waddy started flying SpitfireÃÂ Vs in No.ÃÂ 92 Squadron RAF. He asserted a further three triumphs with his most recent unit before being presented back on Australia on 19ÃÂ November 1942. His last count of fifteen-and-a-half triumphs made him a standout amongst the best Allied military pilots in the Desert War, and second just to Caldwell among the RAAF unforeseen.
