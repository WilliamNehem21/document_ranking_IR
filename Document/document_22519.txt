Many aspects of "Las Meninas" relate to earlier works by VelÃ¡zquez in which he plays with conventions of representation. In the "Rokeby Venus"âhis only surviving nudeâthe face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although "often described as looking at herself, [she] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early "Christ in the House of Martha and Mary" of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are clear that this is the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of "Los Borrachos" of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god Bacchus and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early "bodegones", the figures look directly at the viewer as if seeking a reaction.
