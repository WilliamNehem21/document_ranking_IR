Khan changed his choice to act in movies in April 1991, refering to it as an approach to get away from the melancholy of his mom's passing. He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to seek after a full-time vocation in Bollywood, and was immediately marked to four movies. His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut "Dil Aashna Hai", and by June, he had begun his first shoot. His film debut was in "Deewana", which was discharged in June 1992. In it he featured close by Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. "Deewana" turned into a film industry hit and propelled Khan's Bollywood vocation; he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his execution. Likewise discharged in 1992 were Khan's first movies as the male lead, "Chamatkar", "Dil Aashna Hai", and the satire "Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman", which was his first of numerous joint efforts with the performing artist Juhi Chawla. His underlying film jobs saw him play characters who showed vitality and excitement. As indicated by Arnab Ray of "Day by day News and Analysis", Khan brought another sort of going about as he might have been "sliding down stairs on a section of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, conveying to the screen the sort of physical energyÃÂ ... instinctive, serious, deranged one minute and cloyingly innocent the following."
