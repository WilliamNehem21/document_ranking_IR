In anticipation of the Soviet intrusion of Manchuria, the military turned out to be a piece of the second Far Eastern Front after the Far Eastern Front was part on 5 August. For the intrusion, the military had a quality of 240 tanks and self-moved firearms and 1,270 weapons and mortars, and involved an area. It numbered 54,000 men out of an ostensible quality of 59,000. The military's three rifle divisions were at around 90% of their ostensible quality, with around 9,000 to 10,000 men each; the third and twelfth Divisions were marginally bigger than the 396th. The 101st Fortified Region numbered 6,000 men and was nearly at full quality. The military included three tank detachments (the 73rd, 74th, and 258th) and three self-impelled mounted guns forces. Front leader Army General Maxim Purkayev at first requested that the military guard the Blagoveshchensk region from Japanese assault, in collaboration with the Amur Flotilla's Zee-Bureysk Brigade and separate units of waterway ships. At the point when the fundamental Soviet assaults made progress, the military was to dispatch a strike intersection of the Amur River, lessen or detach the Japanese Sakhalian, Aihun, and Holomoching braced locales and safeguards around Sunwu, and advance south through the Lesser Khingan Mountains to Qiqihar and Harbin. The front's hostile activities were later referred to in Soviet historiography as the Sungari Offensive.
