"The entire folkie thing was still truly sketchy to usÃ¢ÂÂit wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd thought of something like 'Regal Canal', and you'd state, 'This is so excellent! The articulation!' ... He recalled excessively, recollected such a large number of tunes excessively well. He'd approached Big Pink, or wherever we were, and haul out some old tuneÃ¢ÂÂand he'd prepared for this. He'd drilled this, and afterward turned out around here, to demonstrate us." Songs recorded at the early sessions included material composed or made famous by Johnny Cash, Ian and Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, just as conventional melodies and guidelines. Connecting every one of the accounts, both new material and old, is the manner by which Dylan reconnected with customary American music.
