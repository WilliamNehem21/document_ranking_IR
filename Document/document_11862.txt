Eidelman expressed that he discovers sci-fi the most fascinating and energizing kind to form for, and that Meyer guided him to regard the film as a new beginning, instead of illustration on old "Star Trek" subjects. Eidelman needed the music to help the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he endeavored to make an air that mirrored the outsider and perilous setting, presenting extraordinary instruments for shading. Other than utilizing percussion from around the globe, Eidelman regarded the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language interpretation for "to be, or not to be" (""taH pagh, taHbe"") being rehashed out of sight. Spock's subject was intended to be an ethereal partner to the theme for Kirk and the "Undertaking", went for catching "the passionate sparkle in the chief's eye". Kirk's inside situation about what's on the horizon was resounded in the primary topic: "It's Kirk taking control one final time and as he watches out into the stars he has the flash again [...] But there's an uncertain note, since it's critical that he doesn't confide in the Klingons. He wouldn't like to go on this outing despite the fact that the sparkle is there that overwhelmed him." For the climactic fight, Eidelman begins the music unobtrusively, building the power as the fight advances.
