Straczynski saw "taking a seat and uncovering [the] story" as an arrival to his journalistic roots. He likewise drew on his experience composing wrongdoing dramatization for the procedural components of the plot. Straczynski said he had assembled such a great amount of data about the case that it was hard to work out how to tell it. To give the story a chance to create at its very own pace, he set the venture aside to enable himself to overlook the less basic components and bring into center the parts he needed to tell. He depicted what he saw as two overlaid triangles: "the principal triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You begin with her, and her story gets more extensive and more extensive and starts having sway from a wide range of spots. The overlay on that was a topsy turvy triangle with the base on top, which is the display of Los Angeles around thenÃ¢ÂÂ1928. Furthermore, it starts getting smaller and smaller toward the base, weighing down on her." Once Straczynski saw this structure, he believed he could compose the story. He abstained from concentrating on the outrages of the Wineville kills for recounting to the story from Collins' point of view; Straczynski said she was the main individual in the story without a concealed plan, and it was her industriousnessÃ¢ÂÂjust as the inheritance the case left all through California's legitimate frameworkÃ¢ÂÂthat had pulled in him to the venture. He stated, "My expectation was basic: to respect what Christine Collins did."
