Before the MexicanâAmerican War, when this area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail. This trail extended from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, one of the few places where the Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern USÂ 491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.
Before 1926, all of modern USÂ 491 existed as state routes. In New Mexico, USÂ 666 absorbed a portion of State Road 32 (NMÂ 32) from Gallup to Shiprock, and completely replaced NMÂ 121 from Shiprock to the Colorado state line. The portion in Colorado was numbered State HighwayÂ 108 (SHÂ 108) from the New Mexico state line to Cortez, and SHÂ 10 from Cortez to Utah. At the time, SHÂ 10 traversed the southern portion of Colorado. While most of this route was absorbed by the U.S. Highway System, a portion of it still exists. In Utah, the route was originally numbered State Route 9 (SRÂ 9), which also included what is now USÂ 191 from Monticello to Crescent Junction. Utah has since re-used the SRÂ 9 designation for a different road.
