In 1987, the British biologist Anthony S. Cheke found the depicted shading example of "N. borbonicus" remiscent of "Psittacula" parrots, however considered "N. francicus" to be founded on befuddled reports. In 2001 the British author Errol Fuller proposed Dubois' record of "N. borbonicus" could either have alluded to a generally unrecorded species or have been deluding, and discovered "N. francicus" to be "a standout amongst the most questionable of every single theoretical specie". In 2007, Hume recommended that Rothschild had related "N. borbonicus" with the Rodrigues parrot since he had erroneously consolidated Dubois' record into his portrayal of the last mentioned; he expressed the Rodrigues parrot additionally had red plumage (however it was all-green), and had been referenced by Dubois (who never visited Rodrigues). Rothschild additionally ascribed the locating of "N. francicus" to Dubois, rehashing the shading design he had portrayed before for the Rodrigues parrot, and this lead Hume to presume that the name "N. francicus" depended exclusively on "the tangled creative ability of Lord Rothschild". Hume included that if Dubois' portrayal of "N. borbonicus" depended on a parrot endemic to RÃÂ©union, it might have been gotten from the Alexandrine parakeet ("Psittacula eupatria"), which has a comparable colouration, aside from the red tail.
