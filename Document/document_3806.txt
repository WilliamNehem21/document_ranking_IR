"Dendrocollybia racemosa" is a saprobic species, which means it infers supplements by separating dead or passing on tissue. Its natural product bodies develop on the all around rotted survives from agarics, frequently suspected to be "Lactarius" or "Russula", in spite of the fact that the hosts' characters are regularly indistinct because of a propelled condition of rot. A recent report utilized sub-atomic investigation to affirm "Russula crassotunicata" as a host for "D.ÃÂ racemosa". This "Russula" has a long and constant rot period, and, in the Pacific Northwest district of the United States where the examination was led, gives an "about all year substrate for mycosaprobic species". "Dendrocollybia" is one of four agaric genera obligately connected with development on the natural product groups of other organisms, the others being "Squamanita", "Asterophora", and "Collybia". "Dendrocollybia" is likewise discovered less generally in profound coniferous duff, in gatherings or little bunches. The organism can shape sclerotia in the embalmed host natural product bodies, and may likewise grow legitimately from their sclerotia in soil. The organism is broadly conveyed in mild areas of the Northern Hemisphere, yet once in a while gathered "most likely because of its little size, disguise shading, and propensity to be inundated in its substrate." In North America, where the appropriation is confined to the Pacific Northwest, natural product bodies are found in the pre-fall to harvest time, frequently after an overwhelming fruiting period for different mushrooms is finished. In Europe, it is known from the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and Belgium. "Dendrocollybia racemosa" is in the Danish, Norwegian, and British Red Lists.
