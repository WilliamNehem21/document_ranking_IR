After her return to Japan, "HÅshÅ" was transferred to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board "HÅshÅ". On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both "HÅshÅ" and "RyÅ«hÅ" were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, "HÅshÅ" was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, "HÅshÅ" shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.
In order to service new and larger aircraft like the Nakajima B6N "Jill" torpedo bomber and the Yokosuka D4Y "Judy" dive bomber, the flight deck was extended over at each end to a total length of from 27 March to 26 April 1944. "HÅshÅ" also received new arresting gear and a new crash barrier. The additional weight high up in the ship adversely affected her stability and she was restricted from operations in bad weather lest she capsize. At some point during the war the ship's 14Â cm guns were removed and she received about twenty 25-millimeter Type 96 autocannons in single mounts. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 50Â°, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The 15-round magazines needed to be changed frequently, and the maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute.
