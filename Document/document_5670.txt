As the circumstance for the Swedish armed force in Pomerania crumbled amid the winter of 1675Ã¢ÂÂ 76, the armada, with "Kronan" as lead, was requested to ocean again in a urgent endeavor to alleviate the hard-squeezed Swedish land powers. The climate was strangely cold and substantial pieces of the Baltic were frosted in. The armada, presently under the direction of the prepared ocean officer Claes Uggla, was obstructed by ice when it came to DalarÃÂ¶ on 23 January. The Privy Councilor Erik LindschÃÂ¶ld had been doled out by the King to help with the endeavor, and he thought of removing the armada of the ice to achieve the untamed ocean. Several neighborhood laborers were requested out to open a tight channel through the ice with saws and picks to the harbor at ÃÂlvsnabben, more than 20ÃÂ km (12ÃÂ mi) away. On achieving the maritime station on 14 February, after three weeks, it worked out that the greater part of the ocean outside the inward skerries was solidified too. A tempest hit the firmly stuffed boats and the resulting development of the ice pulverized the frame of the supply vessel "Leoparden", sinking it. A Danish power had figured out how to achieve the untamed waters more distant off and watched the immobilized Swedish boats from a separation. At the point when temperatures fell significantly further, the undertaking was pronounced miserable and LindschÃÂ¶ld surrendered the endeavor.
