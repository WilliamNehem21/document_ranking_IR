The 40-page first issue was discharged in print and carefully on August 20, 2014. Jamie McKelvie and Chip Zdarsky gave workmanship to two retailer-selective variation covers. These variations were authorized legitimately by the retailers. Not at all like most funnies sold in the immediate market, unsold duplicates of this issue could be come back to the distributer. This strategy enabled retailers to put in higher requests without going for broke. Evaluated deals were just shy of 35,000 duplicates, making it the 61st smash hit comic book for the month. Because of re-arranges, the issue sold out at the merchant level upon the arrival of discharge. A second printing was declared the following day and was discharged on September 24, 2014, a similar day as issue two. Counting deals for the second printing, the main issue sold around 41,000 duplicates. Notwithstanding the standard print form, a bigger "magazine" rendition with eight extra pages of craftsmanship was accessible for an additional expense. This rendition, which was not returnable, was evaluated to have sold an extra 8300 duplicates. By and large, "The Fade Out" #1 would do well to deals than anything Brubaker and Phillips had recently done together. Brubaker suspects the numbers were higher halfway on the grounds that they had built up a following, and mostly in light of the fact that retailers had turned out to be increasingly strong of Image books all in all.
