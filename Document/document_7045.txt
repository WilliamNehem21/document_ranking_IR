The ventures of the C&SF have been portrayed as a feature of "emergency and reaction" cycles that "overlooked the ramification for the full framework, accepted sureness of things to come, and prevailing with regards to illuminating the transitory emergency, yet get under way conditions that overstate future emergencies". The last venture, to construct a waterway to rectify the twisting floodplain of the Kissimmee River that had generally nourished Lake Okeechobee which thusly sustained the Everglades, started in 1962. Marjory Stoneman Douglas later composed that the C&SF ventures were "interrelated idiocy", delegated by the C-38 waterway.

Loss of living space has made the district experience an extraordinary decline of waterfowl, swimming flying creatures, and amusement fish. The recovered floodplains were taken over by horticulture, bringing composts and bug sprays that washed into Lake Okeechobee. Indeed, even before the waterway was done, preservation associations and game angling and chasing bunches were requiring the reclamation of the Kissimmee River.
