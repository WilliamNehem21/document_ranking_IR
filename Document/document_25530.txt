"Political Animals and Animal Politics" was the first edited collection devoted to the "political turn in animal ethics", and the first "book-length attempt at seeking to define the contours" of this literature. According to Siobhan O'Sullivan, the book may have been the first time that "political turn in animal ethics"âa phrase that had been used at European conferences for a number of yearsâappeared in print. This "animal political philosophy" is identified by the editors as an academic literature at the meeting point of animal ethics, political philosophy and real-world (but theory-driven) politics. Wissenburg and Schlosberg posit that this literature, though at one time only a small part of more morally focused animal ethics, has developed into a separate field of enquiry in its own right. They single out two key texts: Robert Garner's 2013 "A Theory of Justice for Animals" (Oxford University Press) and Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's 2011 "Zoopolis" (Oxford University Press). Recognising the editors' identification of the political turn in animal ethics, Garner, writing with O'Sullivan and Alasdair Cochrane, argues that the literature is both made distinct and unified by its focus on justice; contributions to this literature, these authors argue, "imagine how political institutions, structures and processes might be "transformed" so as to secure justice for both human and nonhuman animals. Put simply, the essential feature of the political turn is this "constructive" focus on justice."
