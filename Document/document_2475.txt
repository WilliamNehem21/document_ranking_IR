Swiss botanist Carl Meissner portrayed "Banksia sceptrum" in 1855, in view of an example gathered by James Drummond north of the Hutt River at some point amid 1850 or 1851. The species name "sceptrum" "staff" alludes to the noticeable bloom spikes. In his 1856 course of action of the variety, there were 58 portrayed "Banksia" species. Meissner isolated Brown's "Banksia verae", which had been renamed "Eubanksia" by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four arrangement dependent on leaf properties. He put "B.ÃÂ sceptrum" in the arrangement "Quercinae". George Bentham distributed a careful correction of "Banksia" in his milestone production "Greenery Australiensis" in 1870. In Bentham's course of action, the quantity of perceived "Banksia" species was decreased from 60 to 46. Bentham characterized four areas dependent on leaf, style and dust moderator characters. "Banksia sceptrum" was put in area "Orthostylis". In his 1891 work "Revisio Generum Plantarum", German botanist Otto Kuntze tested the nonexclusive name "Banksia" L.f., in light of the fact that the name "Banksia" had recently been distributed in 1775 as "Banksia" J.R.Forst and G.Forst, alluding to the variety presently known as "Pimelea". Kuntze proposed "Sirmuellera" as an option, republishing "B.ÃÂ sceptrum" as "Sirmuellera sceptrum". The test fizzled, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally moderated in 1940.
