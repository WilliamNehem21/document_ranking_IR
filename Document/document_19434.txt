After winning only three of their first 10 matches of 2010â11, Foyle resigned as manager in September 2010, and was replaced with Tamworth manager Gary Mills the following month. Improving form saw York challenge for the play-offs, and by mid March 2011 they were sixth in the tableâone place away from a play-off spot. They won only three of 10 matches in the run-in and missed out on the play-offs to finish the season in eighth place. York reached the FA Cup third round for the second consecutive year, and lost 2â0 to Premier League team Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. York won three of the opening seven matches in 2011â12 and were only once below a play-off place from early October 2011, finishing the season in fourth place. Playing a passing style of football but producing results when needed, they earned 83 points that seasonâthe second highest in the club's history. York drew 1â1 at home to Mansfield Town in the play-off semi-final first leg and won the second leg 1â0 after extra time at Field Mill. They then beat Newport County 2â0 at Wembley Stadium in the 2012 FA Trophy Final, which was the first time the club had won a national knockout competition. A week later, they returned to Wembley Stadium for the play-off final, beating Luton Town 2â1, with goals from Ashley Chambers and Matty Blair. The club was promoted to League Two, returning to the Football League after an eight-year absence. In between the two matches, City of York Council granted planning permission for a new community stadium to be built at Monks Cross.
