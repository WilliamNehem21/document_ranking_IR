The adsorption behaviour of nihonium on gold surfaces in thermochromatographical experiments is expected to be closer to that of astatine than that of thallium. The destabilisation of the 7p subshell effectively leads to a valence shell closing at the 7sÂ 7p configuration rather than the expected 7sÂ 7p configuration with its stable octet. As such, nihonium, like astatine, can be considered to be one p-electron short of a closed valence shell. Hence, even though nihonium is in group 13, it has several properties similar to the group 17 elements. (Tennessine in group 17 has some group-13-like properties, as it has three valence electrons outside the 7sÂ 7p closed shell.) Nihonium is expected to be able to gain an electron to attain this closed-shell configuration, forming the â1 oxidation state like the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine). This state should be more stable than it is for thallium as the SO splitting of the 7p subshell is greater than that for the 6p subshell. Nihonium should be the most electronegative of the metallic group 13 elements, even more electronegative than tennessine, the period 7 congener of the halogens: in the compound NhTs, the negative charge is expected to be on the nihonium atom rather than the tennessine atom. The â1 oxidation should be more stable for nihonium than for tennessine. The electron affinity of nihonium is calculated to be around 0.68Â eV, higher than thallium's at 0.4Â eV; tennessine's is expected to be 1.8Â eV, the lowest in its group. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150Â kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around â159Â kJ/mol.
