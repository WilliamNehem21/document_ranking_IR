Edmund proceeded with his training at Burney's Academy, and progressed toward becoming head kid. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (at that point in the West Riding of Yorkshire, presently in Cumbria), where he stayed for a long time. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton researcher. Toward the finish of his course in 1832 he was granted a Worts Traveling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which empowered him to travel abroad for a long time's investigation. Right now his companion from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the conclusion that Whewell was persuasive in picking up this honor for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the level of MA in 1836. Amid his time abroad he went in Germany and southern France, concentrating Romanesque and early Gothic engineering. He had expected to travel further into northern France, yet his visit was shortened in Paris inferable from "weakness and disease". Edmund returned home to Lancaster late in 1835, having by then chosen to turn into a designer. In December he composed a letter to William Whewell saying that he had "at long last resolved to receive the Profession of Architecture". A few sources express that Sharpe was articled to the planner Thomas Rickman. Sharpe visited Rickman for a couple of days in 1832 and related with him later. He may have been "going about as an examination right hand" while on the Continent, yet Hughes states "there is no proof to recommend that Sharpe invested more energy with Rickman, or served any sort of formal apprenticeship with him".
