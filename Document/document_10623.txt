At 04:45 on 23 April, following two days of poor perceivability and frigid climate, British troops of the Third Army (VI and VII corps), assaulted toward the east along an estimated front from Croisilles to Gavrelle on the two sides of the Scarpe. The 51st Division assaulted on the northern side in substantial battling on the western edges of Roeux Wood and the synthetic works. To their left side, the 37th Division, assaulted the structures west of Roeux Station and picked up the line of their targets on the western slants of Greenland Hill, north of the railroad. On the left of the fundamental British assault the 63rd Division, gained quick ground against Gavrelle and verified the town. Toward the south of the Scarpe and east of Monchy-le-Preux the 29th Division picked up the western slants of the rising ground known as Infantry Hill. The Cojeul waterway denoted a divisional limit inside the VI Corps. GuÃÂ©mappe on the north side of the stream was the goal of the fifteenth Division, assaulting east from Wancourt towards Vis-en-Artois. The goal was instructed by the higher ground on the south bank and it was not until the 50th Division caught the ascent on the south side of the Cojeul that the town was taken. A few decided German counter-assaults were made and by the morning of 24 April, the British held GuÃÂ©mappe, Gavrelle and the high ground sitting above Fontaine-lez-Croisilles and Cherisy; the battling around Roeux was ambivalent.
