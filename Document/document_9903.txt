The armada reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it directed a false assault on the harbor on 12 August. Amid its voyage in the North Sea, the armada tried different things with remote telecommunication on an extensive scale and searchlights during the evening for correspondence and acknowledgment signals. Following coming back to Kiel, the armada started arrangements for the harvest time moves, which started on 29 August in the Baltic. The armada moved toward the North Sea on 3 September, where it partook in a noteworthy landing task, after which the boats took the ground troops from the IX Corps that took an interest in the activities to Altona for a motorcade for Wilhelm II. The boats at that point led their own motorcade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. After three days, the armada came back to the Baltic by means of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it partook in further landing tasks with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the moves arrived at an end. The I Squadron went on its winter preparing journey, this opportunity toward the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.
