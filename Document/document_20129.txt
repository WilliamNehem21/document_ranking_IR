"P. lujiatunensis", named in 2006 by Chinese paleontologist Zhou Chang-Fu and three Chinese colleagues, is one of the oldest-known species, based on four skulls from the lower beds of Yixian Formation, near the village of Lujiatun. While this bed has been dated differently by different authors, from 128Â Ma in the Barremian stage, to 125Â Ma in the earliest Aptian, revised dating methods have shown them to be about 123 million years old. "P. lujiatunensis" was contemporaneous with another psittacosaurid species, "Hongshanosaurus houi", which was found in the same beds. It is potentially synonymous with "H. houi"; Sereno (2010), who proposed that "Hongshanosaurus" is a synonym of "Psittacosaurus", opted to leave "P. lujiatunensis" and "H. houi" separate species due to the inadequacies of the latter's type specimen. One nearly complete skeleton of "P. lujiatunensis" from the same lower beds of the Yixian Formation had previously been classified in its own species, "Psittacosaurus major", named for the large size of its skull by Sereno, Zhao and two colleagues in 2007. You and colleagues described an additional specimen and concurred that it was distinct from "P. lujiatunensis". "P. major" was originally characterised by a proportionately large skull, which was 39% of the length of its torso, compared to 30% in "P. mongoliensis", and other features. However, a 2013 study utilising morphometric analysis showed that the supposed differences between "P. lujiatunensis" and "P. major" were due to differences in preservation and crushing. The study concluded that both represented a single species.
