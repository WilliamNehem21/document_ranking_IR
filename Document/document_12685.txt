The key dates of the arrangement incorporate the 1866 assortment which comes up short on the witticism "In God We Trust", of which just two are known; one sold at sale in 2005 for $1,207,500. Another irregularity is the 1870 struck at San Francisco (1870-S), of which the mintage isn't known as their striking was not recorded in that mint's records. Those records show that in May 1870, the San Francisco Mint returned two dollar switch bites the dust to Philadelphia as erroneously sent without mint imprint, and got two legitimate substitutions. There is no record of any 1870-dated front passes on for the dollar being sent to San Francisco; all things considered, the coins exist. Breen, writing in 1988, records twelve models known, which he guesses may have been introduction pieces, intended to be embedded in a foundation. One sold at closeout for $1,092,500 in 2003. A comparative secret goes to the 1873-S, which regardless of the expressed mintage of 700, isn't known to exist. Two of the pieces were routinely sent to Philadelphia for examination at the 1874 gathering of the United States Assay Commission, however obviously were not safeguarded. Breen proposes that the rest of the mintage may have been dissolved alongside old silver coins.
