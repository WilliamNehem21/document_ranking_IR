The evening of 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3 June 1969, "Melbourne" and her escorts were engaged with against submarine preparing practices in the South China Sea. In anticipation of propelling a Tracker, Stevenson requested "Evans" to the plane watchman station, helped the destroyer to remember "Melbourne"s course, and educated the transporter's navigational lights to be conveyed to full brightness. "Evans" had played out the move multiple times through the span of the night. "Evans" was situated on "Melbourne"s port bow, yet started the move by turning starboard, towards the transporter. A radio message was sent from "Melbourne" to "Evans" scaffold and Combat Information Center, cautioning the destroyer that she was on an impact course, which "Evans" recognized. Seeing the destroyer make no move and on a course to put herself under "Melbourne"s bow, Stevenson requested the bearer difficult to port, flagging the turn by both radio and alarm impacts. At around a similar time, "Evans" swung hard to starboard to keep away from the moving toward bearer. It is unsure which send started to move first, yet each ship's scaffold team guaranteed that they were educated of the other ship's turn after they initiated their own. In the wake of having barely gone before "Melbourne", the turns immediately put "Evans" back in the transporter's way. "Melbourne" hit "Evans" amidships at 3:15ÃÂ am, cutting the destroyer in two.
