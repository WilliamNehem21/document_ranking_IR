For instance, the episode with the "powhitetrash" young ladies happens in section 5, when Maya was ten years of age, a long time before Angelou's describing of her assault in part 12, which happened when Maya was 8. Walker clarifies that Angelou's motivation in setting the vignettes along these lines is that it pursued her topical structure. Angelou's editorial manager, Robert Loomis, concurs, expressing that Angelou could rework any of her books by changing the request of her actualities to have an alternate effect on the peruser. Hagen sees Angelou's structure to some degree in an unexpected way, concentrating on Maya's voyage "to build up a beneficial self-idea", and states that she structures the book into three sections: landing, visit, and takeoff, which happen both geologically and mentally. In any case, Hagen takes note of that as opposed to starting "Confined Bird" sequentially, with Maya and Bailey's landing in Stamps, Angelou starts the book a lot later sequentially by relating a humiliating background at chapel, an episode that exhibits Maya's lessened feeling of self, weakness, and absence of status. Hagen clarifies that Angelou's motivation is to exhibit Maya's adventure from weakness to her sentiments of worth picked up by turning into a mother toward the finish of the book.
