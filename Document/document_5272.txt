In 1206 William was responsible for the maritime powers in the Cinque Ports and told the armada that attacked Poitou. Regardless of whether he went with the armada or remained in England after it cruised is misty; as per two historiansÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ F. W. Creeks and R. W. PowellÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ it is more probable he remained. From 1206 until 1215 he was successfully leader of King John's naval force, and created Portsmouth as an imperial dockyard. In 1208 William was placed responsible for guaranteeing that no boats cruised without imperial consent. That year he likewise managed the maritime arrangements made by the Cinque Ports.

Amid May 1208 an imperial request was issued that William's appointees in every one of the seaports ought to catch any boats in the ports that were from outside nations, barring Denmark, Norway and different nations that did not restrict John's conciliatory endeavors. A hole in the legislative records does not permit a point by point perspective on William's exercises for the following years, until 1212, when William is appeared a considerable lot of indistinguishable obligations from prior. He was responsible for fix of certain boats and the development of a vast new ship, named the "Deulabenit", claimed by the lord. William was additionally in charge of inspiring exclusive trader ships into regal administration. These boats were utilized in the maritime activity of the Battle of Damme at Zwyn in 1213, when an armada under William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, annihilated a significant French maritime power and sacked the town of Damme.
