"The New York Times" called "Fez" Fish's "tribute to 1980s gaming ... lovingly, almost excessively, devoted to the golden age of Nintendo". Arthur Gies of "Polygon" described its aesthetics as "so retro it hurts", citing its pixelated look, chiptune soundtrack, and ways of clueing the player without explicit guidance. Gies felt that though "8-bit nostalgia" was outmoded, "Fez" showed an understanding of its influences and was the "most authentic" of the style. Jeremy Parish of "1UP.com" called the game's minimalism "admirable" and likened its art style to that of "Cave Story". "Kotaku" described "Fez" nostalgic manner as "the video game aesthetic". Oli Welsh of "Eurogamer" lamented how "retro pixel art" became an indie game clichÃ© during the game's development, but felt that "Fez" transcended such stereotypes through its dedication to the wonderment of early Nintendo titles. "Fish clearly worships the Nintendo of his boyhood", he wrote. Welsh likened "Fez" to a 1970s, peace-loving, surrealist version of "" as imagined by Shigeru Miyamoto, and foresaw its social status as "the darling of a certain indie clique" with "studied hipster cool". "Edge" described the game as "a place built from gaming's history", whose playfulness makes it "an unexpected heir to "Super Mario Bros."" with levels like well-crafted toys, and IGN video review said the game "drags the 8-bit era into the future".
