The band trusted that "home life [w]as the foe of shake 'n' roll" and that to deal with the collection, they expected to expel themselves from their ordinary family-arranged schedules. With "Another Europe" rising toward the finish of the Cold War, they picked Berlin, in the focal point of the rejoining mainland, as a wellspring of motivation for a progressively European melodic tasteful. They recorded at Hansa Studios in West Berlin, close to the as of late opened Berlin Wall. A few acclaimed records were made at Hansa, including two from David Bowie's "Berlin Trilogy" with Eno, and Iggy Pop's "The Idiot". U2 touched base on 3ÃÂ October 1990 on the last trip into East Berlin on the eve of German reunification. While searching for open festivals, they erroneously wound up joining an enemy of unification dissent by Communists. Hoping to be enlivened in Berlin, U2 rather observed the city to discourage and melancholy. The breakdown of the Berlin Wall had brought about a condition of discomfort in Germany. The band observed their East Berlin inn to be inauspicious and the winter ungracious, while Hansa Studios' area in a SS dance hall added to the "awful vibe". Muddling matters, the studios had been ignored for quite a long time, driving Eno and Lanois to import recording hardware.
