Worked in 3807 or 3806 BC, the track was a walkway comprising principally of boards of oak laid start to finish, upheld by crossed pegs of powder, oak, and lime, crashed into the hidden peat. The boards, which were up to wide, long and not exactly thick, were sliced from trees up to 400ÃÂ years old and in width, felled and split utilizing just stone tomahawks, wooden wedges, and hammers. The length, straightness, and absence of forks or branches in the pegs propose that they were taken from coppiced forest. Longitudinal log rails up to long and in width, made of generally hazel and birch, were set down and held set up with the pegs, which were driven at an edge over the rails and into the peat base of the marsh. Scores were then sliced into the boards to fit the pegs, and the boards were laid along the X shapes to frame the walkway. In certain spots a second rail was set over the first to carry the board above it level with the remainder of the walkway. A portion of the boards were then settled with thin, vertical wooden pegs driven through gaps cut close to the finish of the boards and into the peat, and at times the earth, underneath. At the southern end of the development littler trees were utilized, and the boards split over the grain to use the full breadth of the storage compartment. Sections of other tree species including holly, willow, poplar, dogwood, ivy, birch, and apple have additionally been found.
