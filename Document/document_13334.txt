Winslet had four film discharges in 2006. She originally showed up in "All the King's Men", a political spine chiller set in 1940s Louisiana, highlighting Sean Penn and Jude Law. She had the supporting impact of the affection enthusiasm to Law's character. The film got negative surveys for its absence of political knowledge and story cohesiveness, and neglected to recover its US$55 million speculation. Her next discharge, the show "Little Children", was better gotten. In view of the novel of a similar name, the film recounts to the tale of Sarah Pierce, a miserable housewife who takes part in an extramarital entanglements with a wedded neighbor (played by Patrick Wilson). Winslet was tested by the job of a wanton mother, as she didn't comprehend or regard her character's activities. Scenes expecting her to be threatening towards the youngster on-screen character playing her little girl demonstrated irritating for her. Having brought forth two kids, Winslet was on edge about the simulated intercourses in which she must be bare; she took on the test to introduce a positive picture for ladies with flawed bodies. A. O. Scott of "The New York Times" composed that Winslet effectively "enlists each glint of Sarah's pride, self-uncertainty and want, motivating a blend of acknowledgment, pity and concern". With another Academy Award for Best Actress selection, Winslet, at 31, turned into the most youthful entertainer to gather five Oscar designations.
