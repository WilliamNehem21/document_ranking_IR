Fielding drew inspiration from many literary sources and traditions as well as from his own life. The structure and plot of "The Author's Farce" are similar to those of George Farquhar's "Love and a Bottle" (1698), in that both plays describe the relationship between an author and his landlady. The plays only deal with the same generalised idea however; the particulars of each are different. Fielding also drew on the Scriblerus Club's use of satire and the humour common to traditional Restoration and Augustan drama. Many of Luckless's situations are similar to those found within various traditional British dramas, including Buckingham's "The Rehearsal" (1672), a satirical play about staging a play. It is possible that Pope's "Dunciad Variorum", published on 13 March 1729, influenced the themes of the play and the plot of the puppet show. The Court of Nonsense in the puppet show are related to the Court of Dulness in "The Dunciad" and the Court of Nonsense in John Dryden's "Mac Flecknoe". The Scriblerus Club style of humour as a whole influences "The Author's Farce", and it is possible that Fielding borrowed from Gay's "Three Hours after Marriage" (1717) and "The Beggar's Opera" (1728). In turn, Fielding's play influenced later Scriblerus Club works, especially Pope's fourth book of his revised "Dunciad" and possibly Gay's "The Rehearsal at Goatham".
