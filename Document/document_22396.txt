The planned major trial for the campaign of reprisals never took place, but a series of smaller trials was held instead in Padua between April and June 1947 for SS "BrigadefÃ¼hrer" Willy Tensfeld, KapitÃ¤nleutnant Waldemar Krummhaar, the 26th "Panzer" Division's "Generalleutnant" Eduard Crasemann and SS "GruppenfÃ¼hrer" Max Simon of the 16th SS "Panzergrenadier" Division "ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS". Tensfeld was acquitted; Crasemann was sentenced to 10 years; and Simon was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted. Simon's trial was the last held in Italy by the British. By 1949, British military tribunals had sentenced 230 Germans to death and another 447 to custodial sentences. None of the death sentences imposed between the end of 1946 and 1948 were carried out. A number of officers, all below the rank of General, including Kappler, were transferred to the Italian courts for trial. These applied very different legal standards to the British â ones which were often more favourable to the defendants. Ironically, in view of the repeated attempts by many senior "Wehrmacht" commanders to shift blame for atrocities onto the SS, the most senior SS commanders in Italy, Karl Wolff and Heinrich Himmler's personal representative in Italy, SS "StandartenfÃ¼hrer" Eugen Dollmann, escaped prosecution.
