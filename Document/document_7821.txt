The administration of the new Dominion of Canada (set up 1867), under Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, has made an arrangement with the Hudson's Bay Company to buy Rupert's LandÃ¢ÂÂhuge tracts of land in northern North America. The French-speaking MÃÂ©tisÃ¢ÂÂindividuals who are half Native, half white, and occupy portions of Rupert's LandÃ¢ÂÂdebate that their property can be sold to the Canadians without their assent. In the Red River settlement, the MÃÂ©tis, driven by Louis Riel, evade political manoeuverings with respect to Lieutenant Governor William McDougall and a portion of the English-talking pilgrims, while catching Fort Garry. After an outfitted standoff at English-talking pilgrim John Schultz's home, the MÃÂ©tis proclaim a temporary government and vote Riel their leader, with a considerably number of French and English delegates. Schultz escapes from jail and gathers together various men with the aim of liberating the detainees from Fort Garry, yet when Riel releases the detainees, Schultz's men set out for home. In transit, various them pass Fort Garry, where they are caught and detained. One of the detainees, Thomas Scott, persistently squabbles with the watchmen, giving them racial sobriquets. In the long run, the temporary government convicts him of injustice and executes him by terminating squad. The rest of the detainees are discharged, and the temporary government goes into arrangements with Ottawa, which results in the establishing of the region of Manitoba. They are unfit to get an acquittal for the execution of Scott, in any case. The Canadian armed force arrives, apparently to keep the harmony. Riel escapes to the U.S., and the anglophone populace accept administration.
