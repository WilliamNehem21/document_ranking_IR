"The Digital Fix"s Ryan Poxon gave "CRUSH3D" a score of seven out of ten and called it a "puzzle game that genuinely surprised me at how brain teasing the game actually is." 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it a score of 6.6 out of 10 and said, "For a puzzle game, "Crush 3D" is a good choice for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it was a few years ago, itâs still a decent game to check out. If you never saw the PSP version or havenât played games like Fez or Echochrome, Iâd recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." However, "Digital Spy"s Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: "Despite the five-year gap between releases, "Crush 3D" takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very little in the way of brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, "Crush 3D" gets it right where it counts." In Japan, "Famitsu" gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.
