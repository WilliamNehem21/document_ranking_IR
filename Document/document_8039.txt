Ward's preliminary started at the Old Bailey on 28 July. He was accused of living off the income of Keeler, Rice-Davies and two different whores, and with getting ladies under 21 to engage in sexual relations with different people. The push of the indictment's case identified with Keeler and Rice-Davies, and turned on whether the little commitments to family costs or credit reimbursements they had given to Ward while living with him added up to his living off their prostitution. Ward's estimated salary at the time, from his training and from his likeness, had been around ÃÂ£5,500 every year, a significant aggregate around then. In his talks and examination of observers, the indicting counsel Mervyn Griffith-Jones depicted Ward as speaking to "the very profundities of prurience and evil". The judge, Sir Archie Marshall, was similarly threatening, attracting specific regard for the way that none of Ward's alleged society companions had been set up to talk up for him. Towards the finish of the preliminary, news came that Gordon's conviction for attack had been toppled; Marshall did not reveal to the jury that Gordon's observers had turned up and affirmed that Keeler, a key arraignment observer against Ward, had given false proof at Gordon's preliminary.
