Martinengo had been sick for quite a while before his passing and had left the music of San Marco in a delicate state. The choir had been ignored and the organization disregarded. At the point when Monteverdi touched base to take up his post, his foremost duty was to enlist, train, discipline and deal with the artists of San Marco (the "capella"), who added up to around 30 artists and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be expanded for real occasions. Among the enlisted people to the choir was Francesco Cavalli, who participated in 1616 at 14 years old; he was to stay associated with San Marco for a mind-blowing duration, and was to build up a nearby relationship with Monteverdi. Monteverdi additionally looked to extend the repertory, including not just the customary "a cappella" collection of Roman and Flemish writers, yet in addition instances of the advanced style which he supported, including the utilization of continuo and different instruments. Aside from this he was obviously expected to make music for all the significant banquets of the congregation. This incorporated another mass every year for Holy Cross Day and Christmas Eve, cantatas to pay tribute to the Venetian Doge, and various different works (a considerable lot of which are lost). Monteverdi was additionally allowed to acquire pay by giving music to other Venetian holy places and for different benefactors, and was oftentimes appointed to give music to state meals. The Procurators of San Marco, to whom Monteverdi was legitimately dependable, demonstrated their fulfillment with his work in 1616 by raising his yearly pay from 300 ducats to 400.
