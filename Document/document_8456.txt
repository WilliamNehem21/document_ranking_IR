The skull of "Catopsbaatar" was pudgy, with a wide edge over the front. It was shorter along the midline than along the edges, on the grounds that the nuchal peak at the back of the head bended inwards at the center, making an indention at the rear edge of the skull when seen from above. The zygomatic curves were firmly extended to the sides, with the skull width (over the curves) around 85 percent of the skull length. The front of the circles (eye attachments) were further back than in different djadochtatheriids, bringing about a progressively extended nose (65 percent of the skull length) and little circles. The premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) expanded under 66% of the length of the nose before the eyes, shorter than that of "Kryptobaatar". The premaxilla comprised of parts of the face and the sense of taste; djadochtatheriids had a premaxillary edge on the limit between the two (obvious when seeing the skull from underneath). The palatal piece of the premaxilla was inward, with numerous haphazardly orchestrated supplement foramina (openings). The nasal boneÃ¢ÂÂwhich shaped the upper piece of the noseÃ¢ÂÂwas moderately wide (getting to be more extensive towards the back), and its front was secured with unpredictably separated vascular foramina. The suture between the nasal and frontal bones was less pointed advances in the center than were those of "Catopsbaatar's" relatives.
