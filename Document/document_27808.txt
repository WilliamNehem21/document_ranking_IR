The design of the "St Vincent" class was derived from that of the previous , with a slight increase in size, armour and more powerful guns, among other minor changes. "Vanguard" had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1910 her crew numbered 753 officers and ratings.
"Vanguard" was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Babcock & Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 17 December 1909, she unofficially reached a top speed of from , although she must have been lightly loaded to reach this speed. "Vanguard" carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .
The "St Vincent" class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mk XI guns in five twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated 'A', 'X' and 'Y', from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were 'P' and 'Q' respectively. The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat armament, comprised twenty BL Mk VII guns. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline turrets and the wing turrets in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450Â mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.
