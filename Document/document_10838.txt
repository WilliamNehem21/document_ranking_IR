The rammerman's position was of extraordinary worry, as slamming was viewed as the most hazardous piece of stacking the firearm. The smash was utilized to initially push the shot and afterward the powder packs into the weapon's breech. The slam speed utilized for the shot was a lot quicker ( every second) than that utilized for the lighter powder sacks ( every second), except there was no security gadget on the smash cylinder to keep the rammerman from inadvertently pushing the powder packs at the quicker speed. Overramming the powder packs into the firearm could expose the exceedingly combustible powder to unnecessary rubbing and pressure, with a subsequent expanded threat of untimely burning. Likewise, if the sacks were pushed excessively far into the weapon, a hole between the last pack and the groundwork may keep the powder from touching off when the firearm was discharged, causing a failure to discharge. None of "Iowa"s rammermen had any preparation or involvement in smashing nonstandard five-sack loads into the weapons. Muddling the errand, as the rammerman was pushing the powder sacks, he was additionally expected to at the same time work a switch to close the powder lift entryway and lower the powder raise vehicle. "Iowa" crew members later expressed that Turret Two's middle weapon rammer would at times "take off" wildly all alone at fast. Moreover, Backherms had never worked the slam amid a live fire shoot.
