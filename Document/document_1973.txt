Paine's "Time of Reason" started enough indignation in Britain to start a progression of government arraignments as well as a flyer war. Around 50 ominous answers showed up somewhere in the range of 1795 and 1799 alone and nullifications were all the while being distributed in 1812. Huge numbers of these reacted explicitly to Paine's assault on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was indicted for printing Part II, it turned out to be clear its dissemination had far surpassed that of Part I). In spite of the fact that commentators reacted to Paine's examination of the Bible, they didn't for the most part address his particular contentions. Rather, they upheld an exacting perusing of the Bible, refering to the Bible's long history as proof of its power. They likewise issued "muckraking" assaults against Paine, depicting him "as an adversary of legitimate idea and of the ethical quality of not too bad, edified individuals". Protesters, for example, Joseph Priestley who had embraced the contentions of the "Privileges of Man" got some distance from those exhibited in "The Age of Reason". Indeed, even the liberal "Expository Review" was wary of Paine's cases and removed itself from the book. Paine's deism was just unreasonably radical for these increasingly moderate reformers and they dreaded being tarred with the brush of fanaticism.
