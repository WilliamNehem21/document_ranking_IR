Several studies attempted to explain how these sympatric species could have reduced direct competition. Donald Henderson, in 1998, argued that "Ceratosaurus" co-occurred with two separate potential species of "Allosaurus", which he denoted as "morphs": a morph with a shortened snout, a high and wide skull, and short, backwards-projecting teeth, and a morph characterized by a longer snout, lower skull, and long, vertical teeth. Generally speaking, the greater the similarity between sympatric species regarding their morphology, physiology, and behavior, the more intense competition between these species will be. Henderson came to the conclusion that the short-snouted "Allosaurus" morph occupied a different ecological niche from both the long-snouted morph and "Ceratosaurus": The shorter skull in this morph would have reduced bending moments occurring during biting, thus increased bite force, comparable to the condition seen in cats. "Ceratosaurus" and the other "Allosaurus" morph, though, had long-snouted skulls, which are better compared to those of dogs: The longer teeth would have been used as fangs to deliver quick, slashing bites, with the bite force concentrated at a smaller area due to the narrower skull. According to Henderson, the great similarities in skull shape between "Ceratosaurus" and the long-snouted "Allosaurus" morph indicate that these forms engaged in direct competition with each other. Therefore, "Ceratosaurus" might had been pushed out of habitats dominated by the long-snouted morph. Indeed, "Ceratosaurus" is very rare in the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry, which contains the long-snouted "Allosaurus" morph, but appears to be more common in both Garden Park and the Dry Mesa Quarry, in which it co-occurs with the short-snouted morph.
