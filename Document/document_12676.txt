Contending as a Third Division side, Norwich crushed two First Division rivals en route, strikingly a 3Ã¢ÂÂ 0 success against the Manchester United "Busby Babes". City lost the semi-last simply after a replay against another First Division side, Luton Town. The group of 1958Ã¢ÂÂ 59ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ including Terry Bly who scored seven objectives in the run, and Ken Nethercott who played the greater part of the second 50% of one match in objective regardless of a separated shoulderÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ is today very much spoken to in the club Hall of Fame. The "59 Cup Run" as it is currently referred to locally, "stays as one of the really extraordinary periods in Norwich City's history".

In the 1959Ã¢ÂÂ 60 season, Norwich were elevated to the Second Division in the wake of completing second to Southampton, and accomplished a fourth-place complete in the 1960Ã¢ÂÂ 61 season. From 1960, Norwich spent the following 12ÃÂ seasons in the second level, with completions of fourth in 1961 and 6th in 1965 being among the most eminent.
