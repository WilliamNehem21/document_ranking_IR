The 1899 Australian visit saw Trumble score 1,183ÃÂ runs and take 142ÃÂ wickets; he was just the second Australian, after George Giffen, to score 1,000ÃÂ runs and take 100ÃÂ wickets in an English season as a feature of a visiting group. In the Test arrangement, Trumble took 15ÃÂ wickets at a normal of 25.00 and made 232ÃÂ runs at a normal of 38.66. "Wisden" said of Trumble's batting that season, "[Trumble] played so reliably well as to clarify that on the off chance that he had not been a bowler he would have been an extraordinary batsman". Dry pitches saw his bowling normal tumble off a little from the 1896 visit yet "Wisden" expressed that he "bowled very just as in 1896" and "[he] never appeared to be anything but difficult to hit, and at whatever point the ground gave him least advantageÃÂ ...ÃÂ he was fatal". Australia won the Second Test by 10ÃÂ wickets and with different Tests completing in draws, they held the Ashes in a one Test to nil arrangement triumph. Trumble played especially well in the Third Test at Headingley, where he took 5ÃÂ wickets for 60ÃÂ runs and was the most noteworthy run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These endeavors drove him to accomplish the number 1 positioning in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he held it for the following 5 years).
