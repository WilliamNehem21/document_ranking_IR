Two US Navy submarines assaulted areas in the Japanese home islands amid June and July 1945. On 20 June touched base off Japan's northern islands under the direction of Commander Gene Fluckey. For this watch the submarine had been fitted with a test rocket launcher planned for shore bombardments. Not long after 12 pm on 22 June the submarine terminated 12 rockets at Shari in north-east Hokkaido. "Thorn" at that point continued north, and on 2 July shelled Kaiyo in south-east Sakhalin with its deck weapon. This assault decimated three sampans docked in the town, harmed a seal rookery and made a few flames break out. The following day the submarine terminated more rockets at Shisuka. A gathering of eight men from "Thorn" was arrived on the east bank of Sakhalin on 23 July and planted decimation charges on a railroad track. Not long after the men started paddling back to the submarine the charges were activated by a passing train; 150 individuals, including regular folks, were slaughtered. On 24 July, "Spike" terminated 32 rockets at Shiritori and 12 rockets at Kashiho. As the submarine came back to put together it shelled Chiri with respect to 25 July and Shibertoro the following day. The assault on Shibertoro focused on a shipyard building sampans, and obliterated 35 recently fabricated vessels.
