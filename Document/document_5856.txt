In 1976 Jacques showed up in a limited time promoting film for British Rail, which set her against dashing driver Jackie Stewart in a race to London. From 1976 onwards Sykes and Jacques seemed together in the stage play "A Hatful of Sykes", both in the UK and universally. Throughout the diverse visits relations between the two stars turned out to be progressively stressed and Sykes changed the demonstration a few times to guarantee he got more approval than Jacques. While showing up in Blackpool in 1977 Jacques' wellbeing ended up tricky as she experienced joint pain and ulcerated legs, which required every day dressing. Since a changing area was organized that stayed away from her expecting to utilize stairs, Sykes blamed her for getting uncommon treatment. At the point when the show moved to Rhodesia (presently Zimbabwe), Sykes "started to act rather strangelyÃÂ ... what's more, he even denounced HattieÃÂ ... of not having the capacity to convey a legitimate feed line". When the show showed up in Brighton in 1979 the connection between the two "was quickly disintegrating", and, despite the fact that the pair applauded each other openly, Jacques felt harmed by Sykes' treatment of her. In spite of the distinctions, the pair recorded the seventh arrangement of "Sykes" in 1979, andÃ¢ÂÂin April 1980Ã¢ÂÂthe TV film "Rhubarb"; despite the fact that her part was a little one, she looked "somewhat shaky on her feet", as per Merriman.
