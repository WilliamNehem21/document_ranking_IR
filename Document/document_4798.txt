In April 1945, Waddy joined Caldwell, Arthur, Gibbes and four other senior pilots of No.ÃÂ 1 TAF in an activity that wound up known as the "Morotai Mutiny". The eight endeavored to leave their payments in challenge at the assignment of the RAAF's contender squadrons to clearly useless ground assault missions. Prior that month, Waddy had asked his insight officer to create a "benefit and misfortune articulation" for No.ÃÂ 80 Squadron, covering the period 1ÃÂ October 1944 to 31ÃÂ March 1945, so as to "draw out the way that the use by the squadron was not adjusted for by the accomplishments of the Squadron". In that time, Waddy had lost eleven pilots with the unit, including seven to foe activity. Arthur had delivered a comparable "asset report" for No.ÃÂ 81 Wing. Both had turned out to be baffled with the absence of consideration paid by better officers than their worries in regards to the value of No.ÃÂ 1 TAF tasks. At the ensuing investigation into occasions on Morotai, Justice John Vincent Barry cleared the pilots of blame over the episode, finding their intentions in offering their acquiescences to be true. Waddy kept on driving No.ÃÂ 80 Squadron until giving over direction on 1ÃÂ June 1945. For his administration in the Pacific, he was referenced in despatches and granted the US Air Medal, the previous declared on 25ÃÂ June 1946 and the last on 1ÃÂ July 1948.
