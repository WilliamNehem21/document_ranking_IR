In 1924 and 1925, McNair and Summerall shielded McNair's work when it was censured amid the proceeding with discussion about the eventual fate of the Army Air Service. The leader of the Air Service, Major General Mason Patrick, contended that the McNair board's discoveries thought little of the abilities of plane air ship, and that the information the load up had incorporated was off base. Accordingly, Major General Frank W. Coe, the head of the Coast Artillery Corps, called attention to that McNair's board included both Coast Artillery and Air Service officers, and that explores different avenues regarding airplane had included coast big guns officers as eyewitnesses. Likewise, the aircrews that took an interest in the McNair board tests had the chance to give info and voice worry over the board's strategies and ends. Coe finished up his contention by prescribing that the McNair board's discoveries be endorsed by the Army as its official position on the issue of waterfront mounted guns versus planes for shore protection. Coe's suggestion was not pursued; consequent boards and advisory groups kept on researching and discussion the issue. What's more, the discussion proceeded on the bigger inquiry of whether the Air Service ought to remain a part of the Army or become a different part of the military.
