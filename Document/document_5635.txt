Amid the nineteenth century the artistic creation was now and again connected with Quentin Massys and Hugo van der Goes. In the mid 1930s, in view of x-radiographs, workmanship student of history Alan Burroughs ascribed the Boston painting to Dieric Bouts "under the supervision" of van der Weyden. He later modified his supposition to van der Weyden, yet workmanship history specialists stayed uncertain regarding which of the four board adaptations was the first or prime rendition and which were duplicates. Infrared reflectography has uncovered underdrawing in the Boston form which contains overwhelming redrafting and re-working. This is missing in different variants, solid proof the Boston board is prime. The way to deal with the underdrawing is fundamentally the same as the compositions where attribution to van der Weyden is set up, for example, the "Drop from the Cross" in Madrid, and the "Miraflores Altarpiece" in Berlin. They are developed with brush and ink, with the most consideration given to the blueprints of the figures and draperies. Bring forth is utilized to show regions of profound shadow. In each, the underdrawing is a working representation, subject to consistent corrections, which proceeded even in the wake of painting had started. The illustration of Mary is like the Louver's silverpoint attracting of 1464 credited to his circle. Both are of a sort van der Weyden was engrossed with, appearing "progressing refinement and accentuation on [Mary's] youthfulnessÃÂ ... [which is] detectable all through his work".
