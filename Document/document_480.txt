The rooftops, which had not been supplanted since 1913, were modified with compressed wood stomachs, 30,000 new red dirt tiles were introduced, and the stones from the beautiful curves were reinserted. The wing of the harmed heavenly attendant was reestablished; Stanford University contracted William Kreysler and Associates to make another sponsorship framework to verify this blessed messenger and three other mosaic holy messengers to the base of the vault, which included supplanting the first holding materials (a feeble lime mortar), with steel edges that secured the mosaics to the dividers and with a more grounded polymer tar. The renovators found a bit of the first mosaic from the vestibule divider, which had a "Chi Rho" plan, in the establishment, and embedded it into the Communion Table in the chancel, connecting the present structure with the pre-1906 church. The Victorian light fixtures were fixed and revamped, and the transept galleries, which had been shut for a long time since they were proclaimed perilous, were revived, after the bogus entryways on the south side of every gallery were supplanted by crisis exits and associated with existing staircases on the opposite side of the divider. Another sprinkler framework and another sound framework was additionally introduced. Stanford Memorial Church was rededicated by minister Robert C. Gregg on November 1, 1992.
