When White Plains turned into the area seat of Westchester in 1759, the street between the town and the city of New York (at that point incorporating just Manhattan) turned into a critical course and was built up as the White Plains Post Road. Prior to 1797, the fundamental street making a beeline for focuses north and east out of Manhattan went by means of Kingsbridge along the old Boston Post Road. Another extension over the Harlem River (the first Harlem Bridge) was opened in 1797, shortening the course out of Manhattan. This likewise migrated the Boston and White Plains Post streets to another arrangement along Third Avenue and Boston Road. The White Plains Post Road isolated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the way to Boston traveling east and the way to White Plains traveling north. The old White Plains Post Road generally pursued the arrangement of present day "White Plains Road", which was spread out in 1863. (The first post street was toward the east of the advanced road). The White Plains Post Road proceeded with north through Olinville, Wakefield, and Mount Vernon, where the course moved east to advanced White Plains Post Road, experiencing Bronxville and Scarsdale to White Plains.
