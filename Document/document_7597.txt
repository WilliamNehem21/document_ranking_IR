Lee Tergesen played Officer Chris Thormann, a patrolman who is shot in the head and blinded. His better half, Eva Thormann, was depicted by Edie Falco, whom Fontana cast subsequent to watching her execution in "Laws of Gravity" (1992). Fontana was so awed with Falco's work in "Manslaughter" that he later cast her in his HBO arrangement "Oz". Film and theater on-screen character Moses Gunn's last execution before his demise was as Risley Tucker, a homicide suspect addressed for 12 hours by Pembleton and Bayliss in "Three Men and Adena". A few other remarkable performing artists showed up all through the main period of "Manslaughter", including Gwen Verdon, Luis GuzmÃÂ¡n, Paul Schulze, Walt MacPherson, Bai Ling, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Steve Harris, Alexander Chaplin, N'Bushe Wright, and Baltimore producer John Waters. Larry Gilliard, Jr., who later featured as street pharmacist D'Angelo Barksdale in "The Wire", showed up in the "Manslaughter" scene "A Dog and Pony Show". Mel Proctor, at that point the home group activities commentator for the Washington Bullets, made his first of five visitor exhibitions in "Child of a Gun" as repeating correspondent character Grant Besser. Investigator Tom Pellegrini, the reason for the Tim Bayliss character, made an on-screen appearance in "Phantom of a Chance" as the cop who found Adena Watson's body.
