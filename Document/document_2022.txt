After the strike on Yarmouth, a few of the III Squadron war vessels created issues with their condensers. This included "KÃÂ¶nig Albert"; tubing should have been supplanted in each of the three primary condensers, which required broad dockyard work. The ship went into drydock in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven on 29 May, two days before the remainder of the armada left for the Battle of Jutland. Work on the ship was not finished until 15 June, and accordingly, "KÃÂ¶nig Albert" was the main German man of war in dynamic administration to miss the fight. On 18 August 1916, "KÃÂ¶nig Albert" participated in an activity to barrage Sunderland. Naval commander Scheer endeavored a rehash of the first 31 May arrangement: the two workable German battlecruisersÃ¢ÂÂand Ã¢ÂÂ increased by three quicker gunboats, were to assault the waterfront town of Sunderland trying to draw out and obliterate Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. Scheer would trail behind with the remainder of the armada and offer help. Scheer turned north in the wake of accepting a bogus report from an airship about a British unit in the territory. Subsequently, the assault was not completed, and by 14:35, Scheer had been cautioned of the Grand Fleet's methodology thus turned his powers around and withdrew to German ports.
