The soonest known composed adaptation of the Laws of Cricket, dating from 1744, does exclude a lbw rule. At the time, batsmen in English cricket utilized bended bats, which made it far-fetched that they would probably stand legitimately before the wickets. Be that as it may, a condition in the 1744 laws enabled umpires to make a move if the batsman was "standing unjustifiable to strike". Cricket bats were changed to end up straighter over the next years, permitting batsmen to stand nearer to the wickets. Consequently, a few players purposely started to hinder the ball from hitting the wickets. Such strategies were censured by journalists and an update of the laws in 1774 decided that the batsman was out in the event that he intentionally prevented the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg. In any case, pundits noticed that the umpires were left the troublesome assignment of deciphering the aims of batsmen. The 1788 adaptation of the laws never again required the umpires to assess the batsman's aim; presently a batsman was lbw in the event that he halted a ball that "pitch[ed] straight". Further elucidation of the law came in 1823, when a condition was included that "the ball must be conveyed in a straight line to the wicket". The vagueness of the wording was featured when two noticeable umpires differ about whether the ball needed to go in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket, or between the wickets at either end of the pitch. In 1839 the MCC, by then in charge of drafting the Laws of Cricket, embraced the last understanding and discounted the batsman lbw if the ball contributed between the wickets and would have hit the stumps.
