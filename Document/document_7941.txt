Eight plates of horn, most likely diminished and twisted and proposed to be from dairy cattle, were sliced to fit the eight spaces made by the iron edge. No horn presently endures, yet mineralized follows on the iron strips safeguard the grain design. The plates were fitted over the iron, in this way concealing it, and adjoined at the focal point of each strip. The joins were covered up by further bits of horn that were sliced to the width of the iron strips and put on top. The three layersÃ¢ÂÂiron at the base, trailed by two layers of hornÃ¢ÂÂwere held together by a progression of bolts: iron bolts set from inside the cap, and bolts made of, or covered in, silver, with fancy heads in the state of a twofold headed hatchet, set all things considered, separated. Hints of horn on the back expansion of the nose-to-scruff band, and on the back forehead band, propose that the material was additionally utilized for a neck watch. These recommend that bits of horn, stretching out from the focal point of the temples band to the base of the back nose-to-scruff band, would have met every augmentation of the sidelong band at a 5ÃÂ° edge, contacting them from the focal point of the forehead band.
