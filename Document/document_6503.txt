The principal point pursues from essential properties of the genuine numbers: "L" has a supremum and "R" has an infimum, which are effectively observed to be equivalent; being a genuine number it either lies in "R" or in "L", yet not both since "L" and "R" should be disjoint. The second point sums up the 0.999.../1.000... pair got for "p"ÃÂ =ÃÂ "0", "p"ÃÂ =ÃÂ "1". Actually one need not utilize a similar letter set for all positions (so that for example blended radix frameworks can be incorporated) or think about the full accumulation of conceivable strings; the main essential focuses are that at each position a limited arrangement of images (which may even rely upon the past images) can be browsed (this is expected to guarantee maximal and insignificant decisions), and that creation a legitimate decision for any position should result in a substantial vast string (so one ought not permit "9" in each position while denying an interminable progression of "9"s). Under these suppositions, the above contention demonstrates that a request protecting guide from the accumulation of strings to an interim of the genuine numbers can't be a bijection: either a few numbers don't compare to any string, or some of them relate to more than one string.
