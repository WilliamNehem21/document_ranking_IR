The tomb landmark adjusted to the conditions forced by the Calimala and coordinated with the inside of the Baptistry. The divider tomb was required to be put between two existing Corinthian segmentsÃ¢ÂÂthose between Ghiberti's North Doors and the western tribuneÃ¢ÂÂestablishing 33% of one of the octagonal dividers, close to the special raised area and confronting Ghiberti's East Doors. The setting keeps the tomb landmark from light, particularly when the Baptistry's entryways are shut, which is typically the situation. It would be considerably darker were it not for the "screen" back divider distending from the Baptistry divider. The white and dark colored (and whitish-darker) marble further coordinates the structure with the polychromatic white and green of the Baptistry inside. A few researchers acknowledge the hued sketch of Buonaccorso Ghirberti as proof that the "first destroyed polychromy" of the tomb was progressively coordinated, in spite of the fact that others fight that the sketch is excessively off base. The covering's communication with the segments and pride of being bolstered by the Baptistry cornice make the tomb landmark further "married to the engineering" around it, regardless of whether the marriage is morganatic. Aside from the model on the stone casket, the various etched figures are in high alleviation.
