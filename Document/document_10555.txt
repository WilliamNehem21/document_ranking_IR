Ferrier went through two months in University College Hospital. Thus, she missed her CBE inauguration; the strip was conveyed to her at the emergency clinic by a companion. Then, her sister discovered her a ground-floor loft in St John's Wood, since she would never again have the capacity to arrange the numerous stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home toward the beginning of April, yet after just seven weeks was compelled to come back to clinic where, regardless of two further tasks, her condition kept on breaking down. From the get-go in June she heard that she had been granted the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the main female vocalist to get this respect since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she composed that this "unimaginable, wondrous news has accomplished more than anything to make me feel so much better". This letter, dated 9 June, is most likely the last that Ferrier marked herself. As she debilitated she saw just her sister and a couple of dear companions, and, in spite of the fact that there were brief times of reprieve, her decrease was unremitting. She kicked the bucket at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, matured 41; the date for which, while still cheerful of recuperation, she had embraced to sing Frederick Delius' "A Mass of Life" at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was incinerated a couple of days after the fact, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private administration. She left a home worth ÃÂ£15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard watches was "not a fortune for a world-acclaimed artist, even by the guidelines of the day".
