Berry was religious just as common, and gathered relics as distinctly as different kinds of items. By 1397 both of his children had kicked the bucket, he was in his late fifties, and he had started to think about his tomb, at long last choosing to manufacture another "Sainte Chapelle" in his capital of Bourges to house it. His gathering of relics included articles professed to be the wedding band of the Virgin Mary, a glass utilized at the Wedding at Cana, a bit of the Burning Bush and numerous others. Anyway the provenance of the Holy Thorn, just as its centrality to the Passion of Christ more likely than not given it a unique status. The crown from which the thistle came had been purchased in 1239 by Louis IX, both a holy person and King of France, from the Latin Emperor in Constantinople, Baldwin II, alongside a segment of the True Cross. Both had been in Constantinople since the Muslim Conquest of the Holy Land in the seventh century, and may in all likelihood be similar relics that Bishop Paulinus of Nola found in Jerusalem in 409. There are various other thistle relics said to have originated from the relic in the Paris "Sainte Chapelle", including the far littler Salting Reliquary in the British Museum, a French pendant of around 1340.
