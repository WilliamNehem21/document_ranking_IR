"Bellerophon" came back to ocean in May 1795 following three months tied down in the Solent. She had been at Spithead on 1 May, when the 98-firearm burst into flames and exploded, with "Bellerophon" safeguarding twelve men. Still with the Channel Fleet, she joined a squadron directed by Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis which was watching off Ushant. The squadron had touched base on station on 7 June, and the next day caught an escort of eight French traders off Belle ÃÂle. The squadron stayed in the zone until 16 June, when a post on "Bellerophon" detected a huge armada toward the east-south-east. This was the Brest armada, comprising of thirteen boats of the line, two frigates, two brigs and a shaper, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse. Intensely dwarfed, Cornwallis requested a retreat, however the "Bellerophon" and cruised curiously gradually and he wound up being consistently updated by the French. Keeping his boats together, Cornwallis requested "Bellerophon" to take up position at the leader of his line, later clarifying that "The Bellerophon I was happy to keep in some measure as a save, having reason at first to assume there would be full event for the most extreme efforts of us allÃÂ ... I thought about that transport a fortune coming up, having known about her previous achievements, and watching the soul showed by all ready when she passed me, joined to the energy and action shewed by Lord Cranstoun amid the entire cruize."
