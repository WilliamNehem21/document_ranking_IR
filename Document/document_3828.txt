George noticed that "Banksia oblongifolia" demonstrated impressive variety in propensity, and in 1987 Conran and Clifford isolated the taxon into two subspecies. In looking at populaces in southern Queensland, they revealed that the two structures were unmistakable in development propensity and natural surroundings, and that they didn't locate any middle of the road shapes. New South Wales botanists Joseph Maiden and Julius Henry Camfield had gathered this taller type of "B.ÃÂ oblongifolia" in Kogarah in 1898, and given it the name "Banksia latifolia" assortment "minor"Ã¢ÂÂ "B.ÃÂ latifolia" being a distributed name by which "B.ÃÂ robur" was knownÃ¢ÂÂbefore Maiden and Ernst Betche renamed it "Banksia robur" assortment "minor". This name (confusingly) in this manner turned into the name for the taller assortment. They characterized assortment "oblongifolia" as a multistemmed bush high, with leaves long and wide, and bloom spikes high. The living space is marshes and bog outskirts, or once in a while sandstone edges. Assortment "minor" is a taller bush high with surrenders over to long and spikes high. It is an understory plant in sclerophyll woodlands, related with "Eucalyptus signata" and "Banksia spinulosa" var. "collina". Both subspecies happen all through the range. Be that as it may, George dismissed the assortments, expressing the fluctuation was nonstop.
