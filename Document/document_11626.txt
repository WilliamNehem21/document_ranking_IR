A few analysts of the Macintosh Classic concentrated on the processor execution and absence of development spaces. Liza Schafer of "Home Office Computing" applauded the Classic's usability and cost, yet censured the showcase in light of the fact that a full US letter page ( ÃÂ 11ÃÂ inches) would not fit at full size, and cautioned the individuals who required top of the line illustrations and work area distributing capacities against purchasing the Classic. Schafer finished up: "The Classic's esteem is more amazing than its execution, yet its execution will make you chip away at that novel, database, or spreadsheet." "PC Week" censured the absence of a quicker processor, expressing, "The 7.8ÃÂ MHz speed is satisfactory for content applications and constrained designs work, however it isn't reasonable for power clients. In that capacity, the Classic is suitable as a home PC or for restricted registering out and about." Similarly, "PC User's" audit closed, "The moderate processor and absence of development spaces on the Macintosh Classic balance the low costs". "MacWEEK" depicted it as a "fine, modest swap for the Macintosh Plus that best typifies the first Macintosh vision six and a half years after the fact". "PC Gaming World" was progressively incredulous, questioning that customers would buy a high contrast PC with no hard drive that was just marginally quicker than the Mac Plus.
