Discussions about the national banner happened again in 1917 amid the Vilnius Conference. Two hues, green and red, were picked dependent on their pervasiveness in society craftsmanship. Craftsman Antanas ÃÂ½muidzinaviÃÂius enlivened the gathering corridor with little red and green banners. In any case, the agents disliked the plan as it was excessively dim and bleak. At that point Tadas Daugirdas recommended including a restricted piece of yellow (to symbolize the rising sun) in the middle of the red (mists lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and woods). Notwithstanding, the representatives chose that the issue ought to be settled by an exceptional commission, made out of BasanaviÃÂius, ÃÂ½muidzinaviÃÂius, and Daugirdas. On 19 April 1918, they presented their last convention to the Council of Lithuania. The banner should be a tri-shading (yellow at the top, green in the center, and red at the base) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the center. The Council acknowledged the proposition, yet the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did exclude any notice of the crest. It embraced the national banner that is utilized today. Any of the discussions neglected to create a recorded banner. Exchanges of the national banner proceeded; its rivals thought about gold as an improper shading, since the mix of yellow, green, and red did not pursue the current standards of heraldry. Be that as it may, no progressions were made amid the between war period.
