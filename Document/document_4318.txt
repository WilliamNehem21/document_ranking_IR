Following half a month, Waters started to picture another idea. The three new pieces from 1974's visit were no less than a beginning stage for another collection, and "Sparkle On You Crazy Diamond" appeared a sensible decision as a highlight for the new work. For the most part an instrumental twenty-minute-in addition to piece like "Echoes", the opening four-note guitar express helped Waters to remember the waiting phantom of previous band-part Syd Barrett. Gilmour had made the expression totally unintentionally, yet was empowered by Waters' sure reaction. Waters needed to part "Sparkle On You Crazy Diamond", and sandwich two new melodies between its two parts. Gilmour deviated, however was outvoted three to one. "Welcome to the Machine" and "Have a Cigar" were scarcely hidden assaults on the music business, their verses working conveniently with "Sparkle On" to give an able rundown of the ascent and fall of Barrett; "In light of the fact that I needed to get as close as conceivable to what I feltÃÂ ... that kind of indefinable, unavoidable despairing about the vanishing of Syd." "Raving and Drooling" and "You Gotta Be Crazy" had no spot in the new idea, and were put aside until the accompanying collection, 1977's "Creatures".
