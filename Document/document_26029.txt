In December 1944, JevÄeviÄ's 3,000 remaining fighters joined ÄujiÄ's Chetniks, Dimitrije LjotiÄ's Serbian Volunteer Corps, and the remnants of Milan NediÄ's Serbian Shock Corps, which were under the command of "SS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer und General der Waffen-SS" (SS General) Odilo Globocnik, the Higher SS and Police Leader of the Adriatic Littoral. Despite this, they attempted to contact the western Allies in Italy in an effort to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia. They were all blessed by Serbian Orthodox bishop Nikolaj VelimiroviÄ upon his arrival in Slovenia. On 11 April 1945, a detachment of JevÄeviÄ's Chetniks, along with three regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, marched into south-western Croatia with the aim of linking up with the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps of Pavle ÄuriÅ¡iÄ, which was marching across Bosnia in an attempt to reach Slovenia. The relief effort came too late, because the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps had already been defeated by NDH forces at the Battle of LijevÄe Field near Banja Luka, after which ÄuriÅ¡iÄ was captured and killed. The relief force then marched north to Slovenia, where it fought the Partisans before retreating into Austria. These Chetniks were subsequently captured by the Allies and repatriated to Yugoslavia, where they were summarily executed by the Partisans. JevÄeviÄ remained highly influential among the Chetniks until the end of the war.
