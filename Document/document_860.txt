"GamePro" remarked that the 32X's numerous info and power lines make it "as muddled as setting up your VCR" and noticed some execution glitches with the model, for example, stops and overheating, however communicated certainty that the creation models would perform well and gave the extra their general endorsement.

The survey gave it one out of five stars.
