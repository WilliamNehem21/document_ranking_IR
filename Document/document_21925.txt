In 2005, excavations of the causeway leading up to Sahure's pyramid yielded new relief fragments which showed indisputably that pharaoh Sahure and his consort, queen Meretnebty, were Neferirkare's parents. Indeed, these reliefsâdiscovered by Verner and Tarek El Awadyâdepict Sahure and Meretnebty together with their two sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre. While both sons are given the title of "king's eldest son", possibly indicating that they were twins, Ranefer is shown closer to Sahure and also given the title of "chief lector-priest", which may reflect that he was born first and thus given higher positions. Since Ranefer is known to have been the name of Neferirkare before he took the throne, as indicated by reliefs from the mortuary temple of Sahure (see below), no doubt subsists as to Neferirkare's filiation. Nothing more is known on Netjerirenre, an observation which led Verner and El-Awady to speculate that he could have attempted to seize the throne at the unexpected death of Neferirkare's son and successor Neferefre, who died in his early twenties after two years on the throne. In this conjectural hypothesis, he would be the ephemeral Shepseskare. Finally, the same relief as well as another one record a further four sons of Sahure, Khakare, Horemsaf, Raemsaf and Nebankhre but the identity of their mother is unknown, so that they are therefore at least half-brothers to Neferirkare.
