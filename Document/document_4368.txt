After the fruitless activity the Swedish armada secured off Trelleborg, where King Charles was holding up with new requests to recover Gotland. The armada was to decline battle with the partners in any event until they achieved the northern tip of ÃÂland, where they could battle in inviting waters. After the Swedish armada left Trelleborg on 30 May, the associated armada before long interacted with it and started seeking after the Swedes. At this point the partners had been fortified by a little squadron and now totaled 42 vessels, with 25 substantial or medium boats of the line. The fortifications likewise carried with them another leader, Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the ablest maritime strategists of his time. Tromp, who likewise was a Lieutenant-Admiral in the Dutch naval force, was made Admiral-General of the Danish naval force on 8 May 1676. The two armadas cruised north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of ÃÂland in a solid storm. The harsh breezes were no picnic for the Swedish boats. Many lost poles and competes. The Swedes, framing a scarcely strong fight line, endeavored to cruise in front of Tromp's boats, planning to get among them and the shore, in this way putting themselves on the partnered armada's windward side and picking up the strategic favorable position of holding the climate gage. The Dutch boats of the unified armada figured out how to cruise nearer to the breeze and quicker than the remainder of the power, and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, grabbing the climate gage. Later that morning the two armadas shut on one another, and were soon inside terminating range.
