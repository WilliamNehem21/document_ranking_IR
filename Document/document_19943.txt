Government funding, however, consistently fell short of actual requirements. Subsidisation of the yeomanry by its members, particularly the officers, was common practice throughout its existence, and not only during those periods when corps were maintained at their own expense. Lord Plymouth paid Â£6,200 () to equip a troop of Worcestershire Yeomanry in 1832, and the Earl of Dudley was reputed to have spent Â£4,000 (approximately ) per year on the same corps between 1854 and 1871. The second Duke of Buckingham and Chandos was said to have been bankrupted in 1848 in part by the massive contribution he made to his regiment, which received no government funding between 1827 and 1830. In 1882, it was calculated that officers paid an average of Â£20 each () and the men up to Â£5 each () towards the cost of their regiments, giving a total subsidy of Â£61,500 () in a year when the government voted a Â£69,000 budget () for the yeomanry. Twenty years later, the annual cost of being a yeomanry officer was estimated to be Â£100 () in excess of the pay and allowances received by the officer. This willingness to support itself with private funding was another major factor in the yeomanry's survival after its usefulness in suppressing civil disorder disappeared.
