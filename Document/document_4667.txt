No additional data was pending until 2000, while amid a RaidiÃÂ³ TeilifÃÂ­s ÃÂireann meet a previous IRA part, Liam Sutcliffe, asserted he had set the bomb which exploded in the Pillar. During the 1950s Sutcliffe was related with a gathering of dissenter volunteers driven by Joe Christle (1927Ã¢ÂÂ 98), who had been ousted from the IRA in 1956 for "rashness". In mid 1966 Sutcliffe discovered that Christle's gathering was arranging "Task Humpty Dumpty", an assault on the Pillar, and offered his administrations. As indicated by Sutcliffe, on 28 February he put a bomb inside the Pillar, coordinated to go off in the early hours of the following morning. The dangerous was a blend of gelignite and ammonal. It neglected to explode; Sutcliffe says that he returned promptly the following morning, recuperated the gadget and upgraded its clock. On 7 March, in the blink of an eye before the Pillar shut throughout the afternoon, he climbed the inward stairway and set the repaired bomb close to the highest point of the pole before returning home. He learned of the achievement of his central goal the following day, he says, having dozed undisturbed as the night progressed. Following his disclosures, Sutcliffe was addressed by A Garda SÃÂ­ochÃÂ¡na (the Irish police) however not charged. He didn't name others engaged with the activity, aside from Christle and his sibling.
