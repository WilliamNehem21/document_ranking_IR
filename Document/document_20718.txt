Having been a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects since 1848, Sharpe was awarded its Royal Gold Medal in 1875. This was presented to him by SirÂ George Gilbert Scott, largely in recognition of his writings. In addition to those recorded above they include: "The Architectural History of StÂ Mary's Church, New Shoreham" (1861), "An Account of the Churches visited during the Lincoln Excursion of the Architectural Association" (1871), "The Mouldings of the Six Periods of British Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation" (1871â74), "The Ornamentation of the Transitional Period of British Architecture AD 1145â90" (1871), "The Ornamentation of the Transitional Period in Central Germany" (1877), and "The Churches of the Nene Valley, Northamptonshire" (published posthumously in 1880). Other writings by Sharpe were published in "The Builder" and "The Architect". He also delivered papers to the Architectural Association, and to the Royal Institute of British Architects. Among other subjects, he argued for restraint in the use of colour in the decoration of churches, in the painting of walls and the stonework, and in the stained glass. He was very critical of recent restorations of medieval churches, which had been a major occupation of architects during the previous 20Â years, and was particularly caustic about the removal of whitewash from the interior of churches, and the damage thus caused to the underlying stonework. Between January 1874 and February 1875 Sharpe published "The Architecture of the Cistercians", which dealt in considerable detail with the design and functions of Cistercian monasteries built in the 12th and 13thÂ centuries in Britain and in Europe, most of which he had visited. In addition, Sharpe attended several meetings of the Archaeological Institute, and was a Vice-President of the British Archaeological Association.
