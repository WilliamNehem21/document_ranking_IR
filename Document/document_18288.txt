The first bomb penetrated a room in the western wing where Diá»m was reading a biography of George Washington. The bomb failed to detonate, which gave Diá»m enough time to seek shelter in a cellar in the eastern wing. He was joined there by his elder brother Archbishop Pierre Martin NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Thá»¥c, younger brother NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Nhu, Madame Nhuâwho sustained an arm fracture while running toward the cellarâand their children. Elsewhere within the palace, three servants and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop where he had been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and although they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions. Quá»c's aircraft was damaged by fire from a minesweeper, forcing him to eject over the Saigon River and land in NhÃ  BÃ¨, suffering minor facial injuries in the landing. He was arrested by a nearby naval patrol, and before being taken away for interrogation reportedly asked, "did I kill that filthy character?" Cá»­ believed the attack had been successful and managed to safely flee to Cambodia. Commenting on the attack, a US Air Force officer opined: "with that weather, they did a hell of a job".
