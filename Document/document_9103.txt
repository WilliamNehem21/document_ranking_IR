In 1924, one of Independence Hall's outside entryways was supplanted by glass, permitting some perspective on the chime notwithstanding when the structure was shut. At the point when Congress instituted the country's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve made their vows of selection before the Liberty Bell. When the war began, the chime was again an image, used to sell war bonds. In the beginning of World War II, it was expected that the ringer may be in risk from saboteurs or foe shelling, and city authorities thought about moving the chime to Fort Knox, to be put away with the country's gold stores. The thought incited a tempest of dissent from around the country, and was relinquished. Authorities at that point considered structure an underground steel vault above which it would be shown, and into which it could be brought down if essential. The task was dropped when thinks about found that the burrowing may undermine the establishments of Independence Hall. On December 17, 1944, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry offered to recast the chime at no expense as a motion of Anglo-American fellowship. The chime was again tapped on D-Day, just as in triumph on V-E Day and V-J Day.
