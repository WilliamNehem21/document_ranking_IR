The internal sanctuary is gotten to by a little staircase driving into a demolished house of prayer with five statue specialties. The sanctuary and offering corridor were encompassed by storerooms; as somewhere else in the sanctuary, there were a greater number of storerooms toward the north than south. The "antichambre carrÃÂ©e" a square waiting room isolated the house of prayer from the offering lobby. The room measures on each side, and is the littlest such chamber from the Old Kingdom. It has been generally decimated. It was initially entered through an entryway on its eastern side, and contained two extra entryways prompting the offering corridor and storeroom. The room contained a solitary section made of quartzite pieces of which have been found in the south-west piece of the sanctuary quarried from the Gabel Ahmar stone quarry close Heliopolis. Quartzite, being an especially hard stone a 7 on the Mohs hardness scale was not normally utilized in compositional tasks. It was utilized sparingly as a structure material at certain destinations Old Kingdom locales in Saqqara. The hard stone is related with the sun religion, a characteristic improvement brought about by the tinge of the material being sun-like. Remainders of a rock false entryway bearing an engraving concerning the spirits of the occupants of Nekhen and Buto marks what little of the offering lobby has been protected. A square from the entryway has been shown in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
