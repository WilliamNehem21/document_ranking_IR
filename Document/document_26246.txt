In an interview with "Famitsu", Naora described that the game was generally designed to be a "bright, fresh "Final Fantasy"." The main reason was that the team had dealt extensively with dark and "weird" imagery with "VII". The designers felt a need to invert the atmosphere of previous games in the series, which had feelings of "light emerging from darkness". This decision was easy for the developers to make, because most of them had worked on "Final Fantasy VII" and felt that a new direction was acceptable. The world designs were also developed with the knowledge that most of the staff were now used to computer graphics, which was not the case with "Final Fantasy VII". The developers also noted that with "Final Fantasy VIII", they attempted to "mix future, real life and fantasy." As part of a theme desired by Kitase to give the game a foreign atmosphere, various designs were given to its locations using the style of internationally familiar places, while also maintaining a fantasy atmosphere. Inspiration ranged from ancient Egyptian and Greek architecture, to the city of Paris, France, to an idealized futuristic European society. Flags were also given to some factions, their designs based on the group's history and culture.
