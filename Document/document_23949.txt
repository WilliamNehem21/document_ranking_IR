There have been numerous attempts to decipher the "rongorongo" script of Easter Island since its discovery in the late nineteenth century. As with most undeciphered scripts, many of the proposals have been fanciful. Apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to deal with a lunar calendar, none of the texts are understood, and even the calendar cannot actually be read. It is not known if "rongorongo" directly represents the Rapa Nui language â that is, if it is a true writing system â and oral accounts report that experts in one category of tablet were unable to read other tablets, suggesting either that "rongorongo" is not a unified system, or that it is proto-writing that requires the reader to already know the text. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming that "rongorongo" is writing: the small number of remaining texts, comprising only 15,000 legible glyphs; the lack of context in which to interpret the texts, such as illustrations or parallels to texts which can be read; and the fact that the modern Rapa Nui language is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tabletsâespecially if they record a specialized register such as incantationsâwhile the few remaining examples of the old language are heavily restricted in genre and may not correspond well to the tablets either.
