Minh and ÄÃ´n asked Conein to secure an American aircraft to take the brothers out of the country. Two days earlier, US Ambassador to Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., had alerted Washington that such a request was likely and recommended Saigon as the departure point. This request put the Kennedy administration in a difficult position, as the provision of an airplane would publicly tie it to the coup. When Conein telephoned David Smith, the acting chief of the Saigon CIA station, there was a ten-minute delay. The US government would not allow the aircraft to land in any country, unless that state was willing to grant asylum to Diá»m. The United States did not want Diá»m and Nhu to form a government in exile and wanted them far away from Vietnam. Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman had written in August that "under no circumstances should the Nhus be permitted to remain in Southeast Asia in close proximity to Vietnam because of the plots they will mount to try to regain power. If the generals decide to exile Diá»m, he should also be sent outside Southeast Asia." He further went on to anticipate what he termed a "GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung in the palace".
