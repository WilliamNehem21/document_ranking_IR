Amid the third inning of the September 23 diversion, as per articles composed by ESPN and the "Los Angeles Times", after JosÃÂ© Uribe and Atlee Hammaker jumped on base with back to back singles, Brett Butler grounded into a power out at a respectable halfway point to leave Uribe on third and Butler on first. At the point when Ernie Riles hit a groundball, Butler meddled with Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin causing an awful toss and separating the twofold play. A run was posted on the scoreboard after Uribe crossed home plate. Be that as it may, Bob Engel ruled the twofold play had been separated by impedance, making the play a twofold play. This enabled the streak to proceed past 42 innings. Contemporaneous sources, for example, "The Washington Post" and "Los Angeles Times" noticed that when Butler swiped at Griffin's leg, Griffin tossed over the head of Tracy Woodson. Different contemporaneous sources, for example, "Sports Illustrated" and "USA Today" said that Paul Runge decided that Butler had meddled with second baseman Steve Sax' transfer toss to Griffin. A few sources noticed that late in Drysdale's streak, Drysdale profited likewise when Harry Wendelstedt invalidated Dick Dietz' bases stacked hit by pitch for neglecting to endeavor to stay away from the pitch.
