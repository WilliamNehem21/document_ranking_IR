Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in "Hit Parader" praised the album for "probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s", but that they "still like "Pet Sounds" better". "NME" wrote of the album: "By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing." "Hi Fidelity" said: "...Â they are making the psychedelic routeÂ ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of MalibuÂ ... their work can only receive partial approval." "Rolling Stone" referred to it as a "disaster" and an "abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney." On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's "genius" label, which he called a "promotional shuck", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called "one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles". He wrote that "for some reason, ["Smiley Smile"] just doesn't make itÂ ... [the songs] just don't move you. Other than displaying Brian Wilson's virtuosity for production, they are pointless."
