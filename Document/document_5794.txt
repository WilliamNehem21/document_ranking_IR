Yorkshire had one of their most exceedingly bad seasons to date in 1910, completing eighth in the County Championship and pulling in objection from pundits. Hirst drove the Yorkshire batting and bowling midpoints and was the third most elevated wicket-taker in the nation. He scored 1,840 keeps running at 32.85 and took 164 wickets at 14.79. A standout amongst his best exhibitions came at Lord's, the place he scored an unbeaten century to direct Yorkshire to a success against Middlesex. Against Lancashire he took nine for 23, the best bowling figures of his profession, clean-bowling eight of his unfortunate casualties as Lancashire were rejected for 61. Yorkshire kept on battling in 1911, however Hirst was fruitful against a considerable lot of the main regions, for the most part as a bowler. Be that as it may, he accomplished some huge scores; against Sussex, he hit the third twofold century of his profession and against Lancashire he scored 156 just as taking six wickets for 83. Altogether, he scored 1,789 keeps running at 33.12 and took 137 wickets at 20.40. In 1912 Yorkshire recovered the County Championship; Hirst's structure that season was not on a par with in earlier years, yet he batted a long time before poor climate and knee damage intruded on his cricket. He hit one century and his exhibitions with the ball were unspectacular. In all he scored 1,133 keeps running at a normal of 25.75 and took 118 wickets at 17.37. Albeit both Australia and South Africa visited England, Hirst did not play any Tests and, out of the blue since 1904, was not chosen for the Players side in any of their matches.
