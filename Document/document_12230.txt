Therefore, she "needed to cover pages and pages of the story without expressing anything, a significant part of the time. I couldn't consider strategy, I simply needed to continue taking a gander at the [novel] and afterward by one way or another emanate the sentiments". "Influence" was shot in sequential request, which enabled Root to see "what a distinction [her character's] feeling of despondency can make", as before the finish of the film Anne is "more joyful and looks better". Root believed the job to be a lot calmer than her encounters working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which incorporated her depiction of Lady Macbeth.

He additionally valued that, however Wentworth was a "skillful pioneer of men in his calling", he was "socially awkward" in Anne's quality. Susan Fleetwood, the performing artist who played Lady Russell, had additionally worked with Michell on "The Buddha of Suburbia". She kicked the bucket not long after in the wake of taping; "Influence" was her last film job.
