In exploring the case, the court thought about a few factors in its very own investigation, analyzing trademark and copyright issues independently. As in the region court preliminary, Nagashima demonstrated the court an amusement cartridge that kept running on the Genesis that did not show the trademark logo. In any case, the court was not moved by this, concluding Nagashima's cartridges indicated what one could do with information of the TMSS, which Accolade did not have. As indicated by the court, since learning of how to abstain from showing the trademark on the Genesis III was not data that was open to the business, Sega's endeavor to demonstrate that the presentation of their trademark was not required for diversions to be played on the comfort was deficient. Composing for the assessment of the court, Judge Stephen Reinhardt expressed, "Sega intentionally gambled two huge outcomes: the false naming of certain contenders' items and the debilitating of different contenders from assembling Genesis-good amusements. Under the Lanham Act, the previous direct, in any event, is plainly unlawful." The court at that point proceeded to refer to "Hostile to Monopoly v. General Mills Fun Group", which states in reference to the Lanham Act, "The trademark is abused in the event that it serves to restrict rivalry in the assembling and offers of an item. That is the exceptional area of the constrained imposing business models gave as per the patent laws." The judges for the situation had chosen that Sega had abused this arrangement of the demonstration by using its trademark to confine rivalry for programming for its comfort.
