Unearthings of the tomb of Nikau-Isesi under the course of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded proof in help of a shorter rule. Nikau-Isesi was an official who begun his profession amid the rule of Djedkare Isesi, survived that of Unas and kicked the bucket as supervisor of Upper-Egypt under Unas' successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have kicked the bucket on the time of the eleventh cows tally amid Teti's rule, an occasion comprising of checking the domesticated animals all through the nation to assess the measure of expenses to be imposed. It is customarily trusted that such tallies happened at regular intervals amid the Old Kingdom and consistently amid the later Middle Kingdom (c.2055Ã¢ÂÂ c.1650 BC). Accordingly Nikau-Isesi would have lived for a long time after Teti took the position of royalty and together with the 30 years of rule credited to Unas, would have kicked the bucket recent years old. In any case, measurable examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of close to 45 years of age. This recommends the steers check happened more than once like clockwork amid Unas and Teti's time, perhaps unpredictably. Assuming this is the case, Unas' 30-year figure on the Turin standard, comprehended to mean 15 cows tallies, could convert into as meager as 15 years, which together with only 11 years amid Teti's rule would represent Nikau-Isesi's passing at around 40 to 45 years old.
