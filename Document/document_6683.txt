Planet Moon planned the structure of the single-player mode to be a continuous learning process for the players; the diversion would acquaint new direction sets with the players as they advance, and urge them to continue utilizing the new directions for that mission. From the beginning of the task, the group expected the controls to be straightforward, and mapped generally utilized directions to a couple keys. Center gatherings comprising in excess of 25 analyzers experienced this structure to confirm its simplicity. Planet Moon went for a complex man-made brainpower (AI); PC controlled characters would avoid shots and hide. The adversary AI would plot its activities as per long haul objectives. The improvement group counseled Mark Frohnmayer, lead software engineer of the multiplayer diversion "Clans 2", for guidance on executing the multiplayer divide. To adjust the characters in battle, Planet Moon concentrated on qualities that could influence the battling abilities, rather than tweaking the harm yield. The group confronted a tight timetable, and relinquished a few highlights at first in the diversion. Early plans enabled players to change the scene; they could pig out water channels and detach portions of the land by playing as Reapers. The Kabuto character at first could heat mud into "mud shepherd" units and use them to guard its group of sustenance.
