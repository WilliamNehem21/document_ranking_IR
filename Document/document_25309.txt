While passing between Saipan and the volcanic island of Anatahan, Nabi brought tropical storm force winds to several islands in the Northern Mariana Islands. Saipan International Airport reported sustained winds of 95Â km/h (59Â mph), with gusts to 120Â km/h (75Â mph). Also on the island, Nabi produced 173Â mm (6.82Â in) of rainfall. The storm destroyed two houses and left 26Â others uninhabitable, while 77Â homes sustained minor damage, largely from flooding or roof damage. Nabi damaged 70â80% of the crops on Saipan and also knocked down many trees, leaving behind 544Â tonnes (600Â tons) of debris. The entire island was left without power, some without water, after the storm. On Tinian to the south, Nabi damaged or destroyed nine homes, with heavy crop damage. On Rota, there was minor flooding and scattered power outages. Farther south, the outer reaches of the storm produced sustained winds of 69Â km/h (43Â mph) at Apra Harbor on Guam, while gusts peaked at 101Â km/h (63Â mph) at Mangilao. Gusts reached 72Â km/h (45Â mph) at the international airport on Guam, the highest during 2005. The storm dropped 115Â mm (4.53Â in) of rainfall in 24Â hours on the island. Flooding covered roads for several hours and entered classrooms at Untalan Middle School, forcing hundreds of students to evacuate. Damage in the region was estimated US$2.5Â million. After Nabi exited the region, it produced high surf for several days on Guam and Saipan.
