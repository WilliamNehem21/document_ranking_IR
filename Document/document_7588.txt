There were a few outskirt clashes among Colombia and Peru in the early piece of the twentieth century, and in 1922, their legislatures marked the SalomÃÂ³n-Lozano Treaty trying to determine them. As a feature of this arrangement, the bordertown of Leticia and its encompassing zone was surrendered from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River. On 1 September 1932, business pioneers from Peruvian elastic and sugar enterprises who had lost land thus sorted out an equipped takeover of Leticia. At first, the Peruvian government did not perceive the military takeover, however President of Peru Luis SÃÂ¡nchez Cerro chose to oppose a Colombian re-occupation. The Peruvian Army involved Leticia, prompting a furnished clash between the two countries. Following quite a while of political dealings, the administrations acknowledged intercession by the League of Nations, and their agents exhibited their cases before the Council. A temporary harmony understanding, marked by the two gatherings in May 1933, accommodated the League to accept control of the debated domain while respective arrangements continued. In May 1934, a last harmony understanding was marked, bringing about the arrival of Leticia to Colombia, a formal expression of remorse from Peru for the 1932 intrusion, disarmament of the zone around Leticia, free route on the Amazon and Putumayo Rivers, and a vow of non-animosity.
