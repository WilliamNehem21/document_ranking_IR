The two twin turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and fourteen twin Type 96 gun mounts were added on sponsons. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 50Â°, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110â120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the 15-round magazines. Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25Â mm guns and two new Type 94 anti-aircraft directors replaced the outdated Type 91s. After the modernization, "Akagi" carried one Type 89 director for the guns; it is uncertain how many were carried before then. The ship's crew increased to 2,000 after the reconstruction.
The ship's anti-aircraft guns were grouped amidships and placed relatively low on the hull. Thus, the guns could not be brought to bear directly forward or aft. Also, the island blocked the forward arcs of the port battery. As a result, the ship was vulnerable to attack by dive bombers. The ship's 12Â cm 10th Year Type guns were scheduled to be replaced by more modern Type 89 mounts in 1942. The anti-aircraft sponsons were to be raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire as was done during "Kaga"s modernization. However, the ship was lost in combat before the upgrade could take place.
