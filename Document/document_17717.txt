The game's aesthetics were strongly praised. One reviewer appreciated the variety of styles in the music; it has been compared to Yanni, Enya, John Tesh, and sci-fi scores. Alan Dang contrarily found the music at times "neutral" and generic; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse. Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue. The game's cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed; "Computer and Video Games" noted they were "superbly used for laughs or to create a real sense of dramatic tension", while "Next Generation" wrote that "Anachronox" would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema. "The Guardian", while also giving praise, found them somewhat predictable. Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels. Earlier ones were said to contain many "little details that bring the game to life" and significant immersion. The later levels were less well received, with one reviewer suspecting that Ion Storm ran out of time to polish the game, as some end-game locations were "hideously ugly, with huge slab-like polygons, dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures". "The Guardian" felt the lighting was too dark in general, while Kevin Cheung of "The Sydney Morning Herald" found the graphics blocky.
