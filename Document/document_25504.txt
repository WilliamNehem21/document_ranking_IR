Paterson and Fehlmann, along with usual collaborators Hughes, Nick Burton, and Phillips, wrote and produced "Cydonia" for a planned 1999 release. Featured on the album were appearances from Robert Fripp, John Roome (Witchman), and Fil Le Gonidec, one of the Orb's live performers. Singers Nina Walsh and Aki Omori appeared on two tracks each, providing vocals and co-writing lyrics with Paterson. Paterson felt that this new direction of songwriting for the Orb was more similar to the experimental work of "Orbus Terrarum" than to the techno-pop of "Orblivion". Island Records was in a period of restructuring due to its recent purchase by Universal Music Group, and "Cydonia" was not released until 2001. Upon release, critics noted that "Cydonia" merged pop, trance, and ambient-dub music, which they felt to be a conglomeration of bland vocals and uninventive ambience that lacked the appeal of the Orb's earlier work. "NME" harshly described it as "a stillborn relic, flawed throughout by chronically stunted ambitions" and describing its only appropriate audience to be "old ravers" seeking nostalgia. The Orb were generally regarded by the British press as past their prime and an "ambient dinosaur" out of place in the current dance music environment. After the release of "Cydonia", Hughes left the group for undisclosed reasons, becoming "another acrimonious departure from the Orb" according to "The Guardian".
