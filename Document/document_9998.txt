French voyager Jacques Cartier was the principal European to give an account of traveler pigeons, amid his voyage in 1534.

The early pilgrims suspected that expansive flights of pigeons would be trailed by sick fortune or disorder. At the point when the pigeons wintered outside of their ordinary range, some trusted that they would have "a debilitated summer and fall." In the eighteenth and nineteenth hundreds of years, different pieces of the pigeon were thought to have therapeutic properties. The blood should be useful for eye issue, the powdered stomach lining was utilized to treat looseness of the bowels, and the excrement was utilized to treat an assortment of diseases, including migraines, stomach torments, and dormancy. In spite of the fact that they didn't keep going as long as the quills of a goose, the plumes of the traveler pigeon were much of the time utilized for bedding. Pigeon plume beds were popular to the point that for a period in Saint-JÃÂ©rÃÂ´me, Quebec, each endowment incorporated a bed and pads made of pigeon quills. In 1822, one family in Chautauqua County, New York, killed 4,000 pigeons in multi day exclusively for this reason.
