"Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine" was launched in 1977 and from 1983, under the editorships of Shawna McCarthy and later Gardner Dozois, it began to publish more mature material, becoming a more direct competitor to "F&SF"'s market niche. Authors such as Lucius Shepard, James Blaylock, and John Crowley, whose work was a natural fit for "F&SF", were selling to "Asimov"'s as well. The launch of "Omni" in 1978 also had an impact. For almost every year in the 1970s stories published in "F&SF" won more award nominations, and were selected for more "Year's Best" anthologies, than the other magazines; in the 1980s that was no longer true, as "Asimov's" took over the leading role, and "Omni" sometimes pushed "F&SF" into third place. Ferman was still able to acquire some highly regarded material, such as "Lost Boys" by Orson Scott Card, and "Kirinyaga" by Mike Resnick. When "Omni" rejected George R.R. Martin's "Monkey Treatment" and Gardner Dozois's "Down Among the Dead Men", which were dark fantasy, Ferman acquired both. Along with these regular columns, Ferman occasionally published articles, such as "Science Fiction and the University", a feature in the May 1972 issue that included contributions from Darko Suvin, Thomas Clareson, and Philip Klass.
