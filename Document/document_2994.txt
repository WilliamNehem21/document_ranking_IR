The best reaction was "The Money-Makers" (1885), distributed secretly by Henry Francis Keenan, a previous partner of Hay's at the "New-York Tribune". Keenan's work left little uncertainty that he had fixed on Hay as writer of "The Bread-Winners", as it contains characters unmistakably summoning Hay, his family, and partners. Aaron Grimestone parallels Amasa Stone, Hay's dad in-law. At the point when the Academy Opera House breakdown, taking several lives, Grimestone is regarded in charge of its defective developmentÃ¢ÂÂas Stone was for the passings in the Ashtabula railroad debacle. Grimestone in the end ends it all by shooting himself in his washroom, as stoned in 1883. His little girl Eleanor parallels Clara Stone Hay, and Keenan's depictions of Eleanor make it obvious she is, as Clara, pudgy. The character Archibald Hilliard is designed according to Hay, and the depiction of his appearance is that of Hay even to the mustache. Hilliard was a secretary to a high official in Washington, and later an ambassador and proofreader, entering news coverage in a similar year as Hay. Hilliard turns into a splendid author at the "Chart book", a transforming New York paper like the "Tribune", under the editorship of Horatio Blackdaw, that is, "Tribune" proofreader Whitelaw Reid. In spite of the fact that she isn't physically alluring to him, Hilliard charms Eleanor, persuading himself he isn't just a fortune searcher.
