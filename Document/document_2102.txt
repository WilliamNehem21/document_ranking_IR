Her purposes behind doing as such have never been acceptably clarified, and she would offer numerous, conflicting records of her thinking in later life. As indicated by one record, her dad sent her to ponder with the acclaimed soothsayer and spiritualist Aleister Crowley, who had established the religion of Thelema in 1904; Montalban's biographer Julia Philips noticed that while she met Crowley in London, this story stays farfetched. Another of Montalban's records held that she moved to the money to work for the "Day by day Express" paper; this case has never been confirmed, and one of the paper's journalists at the time, Justine Glass, has guaranteed that she always forgotten Montalban working there. Montalban regularly changed her accounts, and educated later follower Michael Howard that upon entry in London, the "Day by day Express" sent her to talk with Crowley. As indicated by this story, when she previously visited him at his lodgings in Jermyn Street, he was experiencing an asthma assault, and having had involvement with this disease from a relative she had the capacity to support him, gaining his appreciation. They along these lines went to the costly CafÃÂ© Royal in Regent Street, where after their lunch, he uncovered that he was unfit to pay, forgetting Montalban to sort installment.
