Infrequent mollusk fossils are found, just as an assortment of other amphibian creatures like fish and turtles. Crocodilians incorporated a few types of "Shamosuchus", a family with teeth adjusted for smashing shells. Warm blooded animal fossils are exceedingly uncommon in the Nemegt Formation, however numerous flying creatures have been found, including the enantiornithine "Gurilynia" and the hesperornithiform "Judinornis", just as "Teviornis", an early agent of the as yet existing Anseriformes (waterfowl). Researchers have depicted numerous dinosaurs from the Nemegt Formation, including the ankylosaurid "Saichania", and pachycephalosaur "Prenocephale". By a wide margin the biggest predator known from the arrangement, grown-up "Tarbosaurus" probably went after extensive hadrosaurs, for example, "Saurolophus" and "Barsboldia", or sauropods, for example, "Nemegtosaurus", and "Opisthocoelicaudia". Grown-ups would have gotten little challenge from little theropods, for example, the little tyrannosaurid "Alioramus", troodontids ("Borogovia", "Tochisaurus", "Zanabazar"), oviraptorosaurs ("Elmisaurus", "Nemegtomaia", "Rinchenia") or "Bagaraatan", once in a while considered a basal tyrannosauroid. Different theropods, similar to the tremendous "Therizinosaurus", may have been herbivorous, and ornithomimosaurs, for example, "Anserimimus", "Gallimimus", and immense "Deinocheirus" may have been omnivores that just took little prey and were in this way no challenge for "Tarbosaurus". Be that as it may, as in other huge tyrannosaurids just as present day Komodo monsters, adolescents and subadult "Tarbosaurus" would have filled specialties between the monstrous grown-ups and these littler theropods.
