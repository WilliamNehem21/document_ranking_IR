Franck's content shows components of early Pietism: the outflow of outrageous emotions, for instance "O seligste Zeiten!" (O most honored occasions) in the opening tune, and a "mysterious manner", for instance in the two part harmony of the Soul and the Spirit joined together. In the center area of the principal development, Franck summarizes the Gospel content, which says in section 23 that God needs to stay with man, to "" (God Himself will set up our spirits for His sanctuary, all the more actually: "God needs to plan [our] spirits to turn into his sanctuaries"). The words for the recitative are the citation of section 23 from the Gospel of John, "" (Whoever adores Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our residence with him). Development 3 tends to the Trinity and development 4 the Spirit that was available at the Creation. Development 5 is a two part harmony of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental statement from Martin Luther's Pentecost song "", which depends on the Latin psalm "Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium". Development 6 is a chorale, stanza four of Philipp Nicolai's song "". Nicolai's "Geistlich Brautlied" (Spiritual wedding tune) proceeds with the topic of solidarity among Soul and Spirit.
