When the band entered Hook End Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, their attitude had turned sour towards Tolhurst's escalating alcohol abuse, although Smith insisted that his displeasure was caused by a meltdown in the face of recording The Cure's career-defining album and reaching 30. Displeased with the swollen egos he believed his bandmates possessed, Smith entered what he considered to be "one of my non-talking modes" deciding "I would be monk-like and not talk to anyone. It was a bit pretentious really, looking back, but I actually wanted an environment that was slightly unpleasant". He sought to abandon the mood present on "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me" and the pop singles they had released, and rather recreate the atmosphere of the band's fourth album "Pornography" (1982). Despite the serious subject matter of the album, keyboardist Roger O'Donnell commented in 2009 that the atmosphere in the studio was still upbeat during the sessions: âI remember very clearly laughing and joking and fooling around in the control room while Robert was singing âDisintegrationâ, and then all of us trying to be serious when he came in to listen back.[...] It was never a serious atmosphere in the studio, and when you think about the album and how dark it is, Iâm sure people think we were sitting around slitting our wrists with candles and chains hanging from the walls."
