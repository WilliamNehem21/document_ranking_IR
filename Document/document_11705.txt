The all out number of French losses can't be determined unequivocally, so total was the breakdown of the Franco-Bavarian armed force that day. David G. Chandler's "Marlborough as Military Commander" and "A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe" are reliable concerning French loss figures i.e., 12,000 dead and injured in addition to somewhere in the range of 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in "Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles," likewise notes 12,000 dead and injured and states 'up to 10,000' taken prisoner. In "The Collins Encyclopedia of Military History", Dupuy puts Villeroi's dead and injured at 8,000, with a further 7,000 caught. Neil Litten, utilizing French files, proposes 7,000 murdered and injured and 6,000 caught, with a further 2,000 forsaking. John Millner's diaries Ã¢ÂÂ "Concise Journal" (1733) Ã¢ÂÂ is increasingly explicit, recording 12,087 of Villeroi's military were slaughtered or injured, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In "Marlborough", notwithstanding, Correlli Barnett puts the all out loss figure as high as 30,000 Ã¢ÂÂ 15,000 dead and injured with an extra 15,000 abducted. Trevelyan gauges Villeroi's setbacks at 13,000, however includes, 'his misfortunes by departure may have multiplied that number'. La Colonie precludes a setback figure in his "Accounts of an old Campaigner"; yet Saint-Simon in his "Diaries" states 4,000 murdered, including 'numerous others were injured and numerous critical people were taken prisoner'. Voltaire, be that as it may, in "Histoire du siÃÂ¨cle du Louis XIV" records, 'the French lost there twenty thousand men'.
