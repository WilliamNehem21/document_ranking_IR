On 14 November, "84Â F", "92Â F", "94Â M", "99Â M" and "100Â M" encountered four Italian destroyers off the mouth of the Piave, but the torpedo boats were again able to elude their pursuers by sailing behind a minefield. Two days later, the coastal defence ships and "Budapest" sailed to engage a Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo near the mouth of the Piave, with an escort that included "84Â F", "92Â F", "94Â F", "98Â M"Â â "100Â M" and some minesweepers. Both "Wien" and "Budapest" were hit, but none of the torpedo boats suffered any damage. After an Italian force of seven destroyers and three MAS boats appeared, the bombarding force withdrew. On 28 November, 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the first mission, "79Â T", "86Â F" and "90Â F" supported the bombardment of Senigallia by three destroyers, before they were joined by "78Â T", "82Â F", "87Â F", "89Â F" and "95Â F" and another three destroyers for the bombardment of Porto Corsini, Marotta and Cesenatico. On 19 December, a large Austro-Hungarian force engaged the Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo. The force consisted of the pre-dreadnought battleship , the light cruiser , "Budapest", six destroyers, ten torpedo boats including "84Â F", "92Â F", "94Â F" and "98Â M"Â â "100Â M", and ten minesweepers. None of the ships of the bombarding force suffered damage during the mission.
