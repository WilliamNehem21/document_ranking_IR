After a rest available for later positions, the twelfth Brigade was then in the cutting edge of the assault on the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September, with the 48th Battalion driving the attack in the principal stage, trailed by the 45th which caught the second target. Regardless of assessments in actuality, Leane understood that the third "abuse" period of the assault would not be accomplished by watches, and would require the responsibility of a whole contingent, and he distributed the 46th to the assignment. As the Australians were resolved to push forward to the third target in spite of a more drawn out deferral on the second goal by the British on the correct flank of the twelfth Brigade, Leane gave the leader of the 46th Battalion quite certain guidelines with respect to his ambush, incorporating to assault in incredible profundity and ensure his correct flank. About 15:00, the assault of the 46th was held up by German opposition, so once he got this report, Leane went ahead and encouraged its boss to recharge the assault when big guns backing could be orchestrated. The boss contended against this methodology, saying that his men were depleted and required rest and nourishment. Leane acknowledged this, and it was chosen that the assault would be restored at 23:00. Leane, worried about his uncovered right flank brought about by the disappointment of the British to go ahead, requested two organizations of the 48th Battalion to get ready to assault over the divisional limit and catch a slope in the forward zone of the British first Division, yet needed to drop the request when the British divisional officer protested. Rather, he had the two organizations advance to a position securing that flank yet inside his detachment limit.
