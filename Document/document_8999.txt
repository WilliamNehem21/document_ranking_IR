The extension is one of just two enduring sustained scaffolds in the United Kingdom, the other being in Warkworth, Northumberland. There, the gatehouse remains ashore toward one side of the extension, instead of on the scaffold itself, and is portrayed by the prehistorian John Steane as "less great" than the "heavenly" Monnow Gate. An ongoing (2016) increase by the history specialist Richard Hayman depicts the Monnow Bridge as "apparently the best enduring medieval extension in Britain". Such extension towers were basic crosswise over territory Europe and, to a lesser degree, in Great Britain from medieval occasions. English models incorporated the Mardol Gate in Shrewsbury and Froome Bridge in Bristol. Mainland precedents incorporate the Frias Bridge, close Burgos in Spain, and the Pont ValentrÃÂ©, in Cahors, France. In any case, urban extension, the diminishing of cautious necessities, and the generous increments in rush hour gridlock and exchange from the eighteenth century ahead prompted the devastation of a significant number of what was at one time a typical scaffold type. The uncommonness of Monnow Bridge and Gate is reflected in its status as a potential World Heritage Site, a Scheduled Monument, and a Grade I recorded structure; its posting depicting it as "a remarkable medieval sustained extension, presently special in Britain".
