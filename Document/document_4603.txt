To meet the expenses of his way of life, Davidson required more cash than his Stiffkey living could give. He tried to improve his budgetary position when, in around 1920, he met Arthur John Gordon, as far as anyone knows a well off American organization advertiser however as a general rule an undischarged bankrupt and certainty swindler. Gordon not just influenced Davidson to put his reserve funds in a scope of questionable plans, yet in addition got him to request assets from different financial specialists. Davidson acquired intensely to expand his venture and by 1925 was in genuine monetary challenges. In February that year he neglected to pay his neighborhood rates and was compromised with detainment. He evaded this by obtaining from moneylenders at over the top loan fees, however in October was compelled to record a request of chapter 11 with obligations totalling ÃÂ£2,924. In the long run a repayment was come to, whereby around half of his Stiffkey stipend was connected to the decrease of his obligations. Some way or another, notwithstanding, Davidson figured out how to proceed with his London life. He believed constantly in Gordon's basic genuineness, and was sure that one day his ventures would satisfy. Quite a bit of his time in London was spent, not in quest for young ladies, yet searching for Gordon.
