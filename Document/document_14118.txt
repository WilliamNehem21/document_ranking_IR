Gordimer says Rosa's job in the public arena is engraved on her since early on by her lobbyist guardians, and she experiences childhood in the shadow of her dad's political heritage. Researcher Carol P. Bog Lockett composes that everybody considers Rosa to be Lionel Burger's little girl with obligations and duties to her dad, and not Rosa the person. In satisfying these desires, she precludes herself a personality from claiming her own. JanMohamed says it is just when Conrad urges her to look past her self-forfeits that Rosa begins analyzing the contentions throughout her life, in particular her duty to help other people versus her craving for a private life. While trying to determine these contentions, Rosa considers swinging to blacks, yet she is careful about this in light of the fact that, as indicated by the book's mysterious storyteller, white South Africans will in general use blacks as a way "of seeing exotic reclamation, as sentimental people do, or of seeing feelings of trepidation, as racialists do". JanMohamed takes note of that Rosa's dad was a sentimental who set up real companionships with blacks to beat his "erotic reclamation", however she is uncertain of where she stands. Visel says that Rosa's solitary method to free herself from these duties to her family and the upset is to "imperfection" and go to France. John Cooke, in his paper "Going out", takes note of that "By putting her deserting in such distinct terms, Gordimer owns her most grounded expression of the need, whatever the outcome, of a youngster to guarantee her very own actual existence".
