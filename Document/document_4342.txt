The drafting of Wheatley had been fervently challenged. Some Giant draft war-room work force had needed to choose Korey Stringer and others had an enthusiasm for Rashaan Salaam when the Giants' determination came. After Wheatley was chosen with the seventeenth pick, running backs Napoleon Kaufman, James Stewart and Rashaan Salaam were picked with the eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first determinations, individually. Reeves made its an obvious fact that he would have chosen Salaam over Wheatley in the draft. First experience with the Giants was an agreement quarrel that shielded him from getting to preparing camp on schedule. At that point, in new kid on the block season preparing camp, he had the disaster of pulling a hamstring while at the same time running dashes on the primary day. Hypothesis had been that the damage had happened in a stagger in a June track meet. Reeves held the brief damage against the running back he never needed. Wheatley later nodded off in a gathering which drew a fine from Reeves. Despite the fact that he just really nodded off in one gathering, he additionally had mental fixation issues by and by. He was not known for living sporadically so his nodding off and loss of focus was a sufficient issue that the Giants had Wheatley assessed. Over this, Wheatley was fined a few times for lateness to group gatherings.
