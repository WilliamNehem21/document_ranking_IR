Blazes could be viewed as far away as Corvallis. One volunteer fireman, Floyd McMullen, an understudy at Willamette University, kicked the bucket in the flame, which drew firemen from as far away as Portland. Salem sent seven fire engines to the scene; three more originated from Portland. Just the external dividers were left remaining after the flame was doused. Misfortunes were evaluated at $1.5 million ($ÃÂ  starting at 2019), and the state did not convey protection. The misfortunes, which included notable curios, for example, the representations of the considerable number of governors, could have been more regrettable had the state not utilized flame resistant vaults in the storm cellar to store assets, for example, more than $1 million ($ÃÂ  starting at 2019) in stocks and bonds. Amid the burst, firemen poured water on these vaults to help keep them cool and keep the substance from deteriorating. A long time prior, the state had turned over numerous verifiable archives to the Oregon Historical Society in Portland for conservation, and those records were safeguarded. In spite of the fact that the Supreme Court had moved to the Oregon Supreme Court Building in 1914, the two structures were associated by underground passages utilized for power and warming. At the season of the flame, the Oregon State Library was in the storm cellar and first floor of the Supreme Court Building. Numerous books in the storm cellar endured water harm when water used to battle the flame overwhelmed underground passages and saturated the Supreme Court Building. Workplaces recently housed in the state house were moved to other government structures and to rented space in downtown Salem until another structure was manufactured.
