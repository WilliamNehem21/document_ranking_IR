The musical drama starts in the key of F, and changes to G at the beginning of the woods scene in Act 1. Act 2 begins in E minor and finishes in G. The last demonstration starts and finishes in B minor. As per Hicks the predominant character musically, aside from in Act 3 in which she scarcely sings, is Armida. Her entrance cavatina "Furie terribili" gives, says Hicks, "a quick impression of red hot enthusiasm", a vitality and force exhibited in her Act 2 "Ah crudel", and in her later retaliation aria which is the event of Handel's harpsichord cadenzas. Armida's Act 3 two part harmony with Argante was the last two part harmony with bass part that Handel composed for a long time. Of the other set pieces, Dean and Knapp feature Rinaldo's "Cara sposa" for instance of Handel's developing certainty with aria frames. "Or then again la tromba" is applauded for the splendor of its coordination: 4 trumpets, drums, strings and oboesÃ¢ÂÂthe main aria Handel composed for this mix. The song for Almirena's "Lascia ch'io pianga" started its life as an Asian move in "Almira" before showing up as an aria in the oratorio "Il trionfo". From this straightforward tune and plain backup Handel accomplishes a "strongly moving impact" in this, the best-known about every one of the arias.
