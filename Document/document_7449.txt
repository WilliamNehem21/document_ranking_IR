In the late twelfth and mid thirteenth hundreds of years the outskirt and political connection among England and Scotland was questioned, with the lords of Scotland guaranteeing portions of what is currently northern England. John's dad, Henry II, had constrained William the Lion to swear fealty to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174. This had been repealed by Richard I in return for money related pay in 1189, yet the relationship stayed uneasy. John started his rule by reasserting his sway over the questioned northern areas. He rejected William's solicitation for the earldom of Northumbria, yet did not mediate in Scotland itself and concentrated on his mainland issues. The two rulers kept up a benevolent relationship, meeting in 1206 and 1207, until it was supposed in 1209 that William was meaning to align himself with Philip II of France. John attacked Scotland and constrained William to sign the Treaty of Norham, which gave John control of William's girls and required an installment of ÃÂ£10,000. This adequately disabled William's capacity north of the fringe, and by 1212 John needed to intercede militarily to help the Scottish ruler against his inner opponents. John tried no endeavors to revitalize the Treaty of Falaise, however, and both William and Alexander thusly stayed autonomous lords, upheld by, yet not owing fealty to, John.
