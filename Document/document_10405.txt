Among February and April 1890 Van Gogh endured an extreme backslide. Discouraged and unfit to force himself to compose, he was as yet ready to paint and draw a bit of amid this time, and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a couple of little canvases "from memoryÃÂ ... thinks back of the North". Among these was "Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset". Hulsker trusts that this little gathering of artworks framed the core of numerous illustrations and study sheets portraying scenes and assumes that Van Gogh dealt with amid this time. He remarks that this brief period was the main time that Van Gogh's ailment significantly affected his work. Van Gogh asked his mom and his sibling to send him illustrations and unpleasant work he had done in the mid 1880s so he could deal with new depictions from his old portrayals. Having a place with this period is "Distressing Old Man ("At Eternity's Gate")", a shading study Hulsker portrays as "another obvious recognition of times long past". His late compositions demonstrate a craftsman at the tallness of his capacities, as per the workmanship pundit Robert Hughes, "yearning for concision and elegance".
