Some of the Romualdo Formation postcrania were used as the basis for the creation of a replica "Angaturama" skeleton, later mounted at the Federal University-owned Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (National Museum of Rio de Janeiro). The skeleton depicted the animal carrying an anhanguerid pterosaur in its jaws. It was the centerpiece of the "Dinossauros no SertÃ£o" (Dinosaurs of SertÃ£o) exhibit, which opened to the public in March 2009, becoming the first large carnivorous Brazilian dinosaur to be put on display. Some of the original postcranial elements (including the fossil pelvis and sacral vertebrae) were presented alongside the mount. In press releases of the exhibit's opening, Kellner informally implied MN 4819-V as belonging to "Angaturama". This is also reflected in the specimen's inclusion in the skeletal mount. In 2011, a third Brazilian spinosaur, "Oxalaia quilombensi", was named and described from the AlcÃ¢ntara Formation of the Itapecuru Group, part of the SÃ£o LuÃ­s Basin. This larger species, known only from an isolated snout tip and upper jaw fragment, lived during the Cenomanian stage, around six to nine million years after "Irritat"or and "Angaturama". "Oxalaia quilombensis" is differentiated from "Angaturama limai" by its broader, more rounded snout and lack of a sagittal crest on the premaxillae. In September 2018, a fire broke out at the palace housing the Museu Nacional, largely destroying the fossil collections and possibly the exhibited "Angaturama" skeleton and fossil elements. The holotype of "Oxalaia quilombensis", which was stored in the same building, may also have been destroyed.
