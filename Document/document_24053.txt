In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7Â perÂ cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately Â£800Â million (then approx. $1.5Â billion). Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange. In July 2006, the club announced a Â£660Â million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30Â perÂ cent reduction in annual interest payments to Â£62Â million a year. In January 2010, with debts of Â£716.5Â million ($1.17Â billion), Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth Â£504Â million, enabling them to pay off most of the Â£509Â million owed to international banks. The annual interest payable on the bonds â which were to mature on 1 February 2017 â is approximately Â£45Â million per annum. Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre. Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the "Red Knights", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.
