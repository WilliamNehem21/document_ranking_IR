At long, the Pacific quick is the biggest of the "Apus" swifts. It has a 43Ã¢ÂÂ 54-cm (17Ã¢ÂÂ 21-in) wingspan. Females are marginally heavier than guys, averaging against . It is comparable fit as a fiddle to the regular quick, albeit marginally longer-winged and with an all the more distending head. The fork of the tail is more profound, and the back end is more extensive. The upperparts are dark, aside from a white back end band and a fairly greyer head. The underparts are dark, albeit white edges to the quills gives the gut a flaky appearance when seen well from underneath. The tail and the upper wings are dark, and the underwings are darker. The eyes are dark colored and the little bill and extremely short legs are dark. The genders are indistinguishably plumaged, and adolescents contrast from the grown-ups just in that the quills show pale edges, especially on the wings. The southern subspecies, "A. p. kurodae", has a smaller white posterior (15ÃÂ mm/0.6ÃÂ in against the assign structure's 20ÃÂ mm/0.8ÃÂ in), a dark throat and darker underparts. Adolescents of transitory "Apus" swifts have a fractional shed before movement, yet hold the bigger wing plumes. The shed is finished in the wintering grounds, where grown-ups have a total shed.
