Wollstonecraft's "oeuvre" shows "a keen and vital concern with education, especially the education of girls and women". One year before she published "Original Stories", she wrote a conduct book (a popular 18th-century genre, akin to the modern self-help book) entitled "Thoughts on the Education of Daughters" (1787), which describes how to raise the ideal middle-class woman. In 1789, she assembled "The Female Speaker", a text meant to edify the minds of young women by exposing them to literature; she modelled it after William Enfield's anthology "The Speaker", which was designed specifically for men. Just one year later, she translated Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's "Elements of Morality", a popular German pedagogical text. Wollstonecraft continued writing on educational issues in her most famous work, "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792), which is largely a defence of female education. She also devotes an entire chapter to outlining a national education planâshe envisioned a half-public, half-private, co-educational system. She also directly challenged Rousseau's "" (1762), which claimed that women should not be taught to reason since they were formed for men's pleasure and that their abilities lay in observation rather than reason. When Wollstonecraft died in 1797, she was working on two more educational works: "Management of Infants", a parenting manual; and "Lessons", a reading primer inspired by Anna Laetitia Barbauld's "Lessons for Children" (1778â79).
