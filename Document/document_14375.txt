Howe's profession as a military officer was combative and devoured essentially by strife with political and military pioneers in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1778, he battled a duel with Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina which was prodded to some degree by Howe's contention with South Carolina's state government. Political and individual encounters, joined with Howe's notoriety for being a womanizer among the individuals who disfavored him, inevitably prompted the Continental Congress stripping him of his order over the Southern Department. He was then sent to New York, where he served under General George Washington in the Hudson Highlands, despite the fact that Howe did not have an effective or noteworthy vocation in that theater. He sat as a senior officer on the court-military board that condemned to death John AndrÃÂ©, a British officer blamed for helping Benedict Arnold in the last's plot to change faithfulness and convey West Point to the British. Howe himself was blamed for endeavoring to desert to the British, yet the allegations were thrown away at the time as having been situated in a British endeavor to create additional dissension in the Continental Army. Howe likewise assumed a job in putting down a few late-war rebellions by individuals from the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Lines in New Jersey and Philadelphia and returned home to North Carolina in 1783. He again ended up dynamic in state governmental issues, yet kicked the bucket in December 1786 while in transit to a session of the North Carolina House of Commons.
