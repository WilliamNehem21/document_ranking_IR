Mary Shelley's "Meanders" both takes after and endeavors to isolate itself from other travel stories of the time. Elizabeth Nitchie, in her portrayal of the content, composes, for instance, that there is "little curiosity either in what [Shelley] saw or in her record" of the Alps, the Rhine, or Italy, and Moskal noticed that Shelley's "book partakes in the movement book tradition of historical center going". Despite the fact that Shelley drew on Murray's popular handbooks and different manuals, she explicitly endeavored to separate her work from these. While Murray's manuals, for instance, were commonly objective, Shelley contends in the introduction to "Meanders" that the uniqueness of her work is in its depiction of the Italian individuals from "a political perspective". Shelley had sold her distributer on the possibility of a movement story by portraying the pending book as "light" and "entertaining", in the style of Samuel Rogers, whose movement account of Italy, joined by delineations by J. M. W. Turner, had been a hit in the late 1820s. Rogers' content had stayed away from legislative issues and concentrated on pleasant and brilliant view. Despite the fact that Shelley committed "Drifts" to Rogers, her introduction recognized the impact of Lady Morgan, whose movement work, "Italy" (1821), had been vocal in its analysis of Austria's standard over Italy and had been put on the ecclesiastical rundown of restricted books. To make her legislative issues progressively agreeable to her gathering of people, be that as it may, Shelley frequently utilizes examinations of writing and workmanship to reiforce her focuses.
