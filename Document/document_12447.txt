The British government had chosen that the RUF couldn't be trusted, and would need to be gone up against and compelled to enter the UN's Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) process. They surveyed that there were three choices accessible to accomplish thisÃ¢ÂÂto send British powers against the RUF, for UNAMSIL to grow its tasks and go up against the RUF, or for the Sierra Leonean government to utilize steadfast powers (the SLA, previous SLA staff, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and a few other volunteer army gatherings) to take on the RUF. Richards evaluated that a British organization against the RUF would require somewhere around a detachment estimated compel (more than 5,000 troops). By the by, British powers' inclusion in Sierra Leone was politically disagreeable in Westminster and the MoD couldn't gather such a power while keeping up its duties somewhere else, so the utilization of British powers to straightforwardly go up against the RUF was discounted. Additionally precluded was an UNAMSIL-drove encounter. Despite the fact that UNAMSIL's order would have enabled it to go into battle with the RUF, the national contingents were hesitant to leave their bases and its attention stayed on peacekeeping instead of the harmony authorization that the British and others accepted was essential.
