Willington noted that the game's visuals experienced aliasing, and "Wipeout 2048" was "undercutting the point" of "Wipeout HD" (a PlayStation 3 title). An "Edge" reviewer also called its visuals less exciting than the "Wipeout" series' typical science-fiction setting, noting that Studio Liverpool "rewinds the timeline" to a less futuristic, more relatable setting. Martin Gaston of VideoGamer.com said that "Wipeout 2048" featured a different (not inferior) aesthetic design from the other games due to its "closer to home", near-future setting. According to GameSpot's Mark Walton, the game's smooth, beautiful visuals gave the player a real feeling of speed and provided breathtaking vistas but was somewhat lacking in innovation. Paul Furfari of UGO enjoyed "Wipeout 2048" visual style, calling it the only showcase for the PlayStation Vita's raw power. He singled out the "Tron"-like visual presentation of the Zone mode and the game's generally solid frame rate. Dale North of Destructoid said that the series consistently showcased the system on which they were released and "Wipeout 2048" was a good launch title for the PlayStation Vita. North called it a beautiful game; "as fast and flashy as its predecessors", it "really impresses" on the PlayStation Vita's high-resolution screen and the ships and futuristic backdrops seem to "pop right off the screen". Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat wrote that the game adheres to the familiar, high visual standard set by previous "Wipeout" instalments.
