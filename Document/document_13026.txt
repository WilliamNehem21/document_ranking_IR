Krause and partners recognized two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as front upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal lines of cusps. One line (push A; potentially the lingual one) incorporates four cusps, the other (push B) incorporates something like two, yet is harmed. In column A, there are three edges (at the front, center, and back) stretching out from the tip of the base of every cusp. The second and third cusps are biggest and most generally isolated from one another. In column B, one cusp bears three edges, of which one reaches out towards the other cusp in the line and the two others towards line An) and the other cusp is harmed. 250 is progressively fragmentary, yet bears somewhere around five cusps and may speak to a similar tooth position as 249, however it would originate from the contrary side of the mouth. The microstructure of the finish of this tooth has been examined. With a width of about 55ÃÂ ÃÂ¼m close to the tip of a cusp, the veneer is slim. The veneer crystals are straight, little, and adjusted and there is minimal material between the crystals. Little, adjusted crystals are additionally observed in "Gondwanatherium", "Sudamerica", and different gondwanatheres, yet in few multituberculates. Indeed, even in those multituberculates that do have little crystals, the crystal sheath is shut, yet the sheath is inadequate in "Gondwanatherium" and potentially "Ferugliotherium".
