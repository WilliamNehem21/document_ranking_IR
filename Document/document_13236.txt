Numerous basic audits of the work originated from researchers who protested Bakker's detachment with logical reality. The scientist Thomas Holtz noticed that Bakker joined fauna in manners not legitimately bolstered by the fossil record; for instance, a few of the dinosaurs highlighted in the books lived a huge number of years after "Utahraptor" ceased to exist. Michael Taylor, keeper of vertebrate fossil science at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that ""Raptor Red" is an exact depiction just inside the setting of vulnerabilities over the remaking of fossil creatures as living structures ... Bakker's postscript never truly concedes these vulnerabilities." David B. Norman scrutinized the book as "close to a youngsters' experience storyÃ¢ÂÂand a fairly ineffectively kept in touch with one at that ... The converging of science and dream is even under the least favorable conditions in books like "Raptor Red" since none however the specialists can unravel actuality from fiction; this sort of jabber transforms a clueless peruser into a misled one." Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, distributed a reply, saying, "The most critical point is that Bakker's depiction of the dinosaurs in "Raptor Red" is clearÃ¢ÂÂstriking in a way couple of exhibition hall shows or genuine records can be. What's more, on the off chance that it turns out over the long haul that a portion of the theory is unjustifiable, what difference does it make? Weave Bakker has given us a one of a kind window onto the time of dinosaurs."
