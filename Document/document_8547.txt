Milton Leitenberg noted in the 2005 work "Surveying the Biological Weapons and Bioterrorism Threat", "there is evidently no other 'psychological oppressor' bunch that is known to have effectively refined any pathogen." Federal and state specialists mentioned that subtleties of the episode not be distributed in the "Diary of the American Medical Association" (JAMA) for a long time, for they dreaded a depiction of the occasions could start copycat wrongdoings, and "JAMA" agreed. No recurrent assaults or tricks in this way happened, and a point by point record of the episode and examination was distributed in "JAMA" in 1997. A 1999 experimental examination in the diary "Rising Infectious Diseases" distributed by the CDC depicted six persuasive components related with bioterrorism, including: magnetic authority, no outside electorate, prophetically catastrophic belief system, maverick or fragment gathering, feeling of distrustfulness and pomposity, and cautious hostility. As indicated by the article, the "Rajneesh Cult" fulfilled every single persuasive factor aside from a "prophetically calamitous belief system". An investigation in the book "Cliques, Religion and Violence" question the connection to alluring authority, bringing up that in this and different cases, it was hierarchical lieutenants who assumed a significant job in the inception of savagery. Contending for a relevant instead of conclusive perspective on moxy, the creators express that the attribution of results to the identity of a solitary individual, even an appealling pioneer, normally disguises an unmistakably progressively complex field of social connections.
