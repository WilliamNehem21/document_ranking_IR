Christgau trusted the 1970s guide was the most "definitive" in the "Purchaser Guide" book arrangement in light of the fact that the decade's littler music advertise was simpler to process. He portrayed the primary volume as "a sort of group characterizing work, putting forth the defense for Van Morrison and, state, the McGarrigle sisters, and against Black Sabbath and, state, Donny Hathaway." In contrast with "The Rolling Stone Record Guide", Christgau said "I think mine is better, yet that does not merit contending. What's certain is that mine was composed by one individual, and was thusly a demonstration of reasonableness instead of social fiat, with no sanctifying goal but some consecrating impact (which was before long invalidated by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [in 1983], a status snatch undeniably more powerful than any book)." In the two decades that pursued, he felt the standard had developed "far murkier, vaster, and progressively different", and his own taste had turned out to be increasingly eccentric and disparate from general basic agreement. As indicated by "The Boston Globe"s Ivan Kreilkamp, the "daring, group characterizing work" remained the faultfinder's most effective work. In Eric Weisbard's sentiment, Christgau "wasn't such a great amount of consecrating as utilizing the unending listening gathering to discover new wrinkles in his, and famous music's, unsummarizable tasteful".
