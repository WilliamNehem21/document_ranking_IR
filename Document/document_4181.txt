In "Stegosaurus stenops" there are 27 bones in the vertebral segment front to the sacrum, a shifting number of vertebrae in the sacrum, with four in many subadults, and around 46 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The presacrals are separated into cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals, the all out number being one more noteworthy than in "Hesperosaurus", two more prominent than "Huayangosaurus", in spite of the fact that "Miragaia" jelly 17 cervicals and an obscure number of dorsals. The principal cervical vertebra is the hub bone, which is associated and regularly combined to the chart book bone. More remote posteriorly, the proportionately bigger the cervicals become, despite the fact that they don't change significantly in something besides estimate. Past the initial few dorsals, the centrum of the bones become progressively lengthen front-to-back, and the transverse procedures become increasingly raised dorsal. The sacrum of "S. stenops" incorporates four sacral vertebrae, however one of the dorsals is additionally fused into the structure. In certain examples of "S. stenops", a caudal is additionally joined, as a caudosacral. In "Hesperosaurus" there are two dorsosacrals, and just four combined sacrals, yet in "Kentrosaurus" there might be upwards of seven vertebrae in the sacrum, with both dorsosacrals and caudosacrals. "S. stenops" jelly 46 caudal vertebrae, and up to 49, and along the arrangement both the centrums and the neural spines become littler, until the neural spines vanish at caudal 35. Around the center of the tail, the neural spines become bifurcated, which means they are isolated close to the top.
