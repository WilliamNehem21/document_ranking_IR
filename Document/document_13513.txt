"StarCraft"s first extension, Insurrection, was discharged for Windows on July 31, 1998. The extension was created by Aztech New Media and approved by Blizzard Entertainment. Its story concentrated on a different Confederate state insinuated in the manual to "StarCraft", following a gathering of Terran pioneers and a Protoss armada in their battle against the Zerg and a rising neighborhood uprising. "Uprising" was not gotten well, being reprimanded by commentators for coming up short on the nature of the first amusement. "Revolt" was pursued inside a couple of months by a second extension, Retribution. Created by Stardock, distributed by WizardWorks and approved by Blizzard Entertainment, "Requital" pursues every one of the three races endeavoring to catch control of an incredible gem on a Terran Dominion province. The development was not gotten with basic help, rather being viewed as normal however at any rate testing. After the arrival of "Reprisal", Blizzard Entertainment declared another official extension pack that would proceed on the narrative of "StarCraft". "" was subsequently made, grew mutually by Blizzard Entertainment and Saffire Corporation. "Brood War" proceeds with the tale of "StarCraft" from days after its decision, and was discharged for the two Windows and Mac to basic acclaim on November 30, 1998 in the US and in March 1999 in Europe.
