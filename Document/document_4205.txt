The line of volcanoes has been the subject of fantasies and legends by First Nations. To the Squamish Nation, Mount Cayley is classified "tak'takmu'yin tl'a in7in'axa7en". In their language it signifies "Landing Place of the Thunderbird". The Thunderbird is an incredible animal in North American indigenous people groups' history and culture. At the point when the fledgling folds its wings, thunder is made, and lightning starts from its eyes. The stones that make up Mount Cayley were said to have been scorched dark by the Thunderbird's lightning. This mountain, similar to others in the region, is viewed as sacrosanct in light of the fact that it has an essential impact of their history. The Black Tusk, a zenith of dark volcanic shake on the north shore of Garibaldi Lake toward the southeast, supports a similar name. Social formal use, chasing, catching and plant gathering happen around the Mount Garibaldi territory, yet the most vital assets was a lithic material called obsidian. Obsidian is a dark volcanic glass used to make blades, etches, adzes and other sharp instruments in pre-contact times. Lustrous rhyodacite was additionally gathered from various minor outcrops on the flanks of Mount Fee, Mount Callaghan and Mount Cayley. This material shows up in goat chasing locales and at the Elaho rockshelter, all in all dated from about 8,000ÃÂ to 100ÃÂ years old.
