On 6 June 1950 Jacques was thrown in the primary scene of the week after week radio show "Instructing Archie" as Agatha Dinglebody. The "Archie" of the title was the ventriloquist's sham Archie Andrews, worked by Peter Brough. The principal arrangement kept running for 29 weeks until 19 December. In the show Jacques showed up close by Max Bygraves, Julie Andrews, Beryl Reid andÃ¢ÂÂin the second arrangementÃ¢ÂÂTony Hancock. It was on this program she originally worked with Eric Sykes, who was giving contents to the arrangement. Sykes had been awed with Jacques since he visited the Players' in 1948. He later composed that she "moved about the phase with a style and beauty as though she possessed it. Toward the finish of her demonstration, to incredible praise, she jumped noticeable all around, completing in the parts, arrival as delicately as a snowflake in July". After the show Sykes was acquainted with Jacques behind the stage and imagined that the gathering was "the start of another flight" in his expert life. Toward the finish of the arrangement Jacques came back to the Players' to show up in the Christmas emulate, "Ali Baba and the Thirty-nine Thieves", which she and Joan Sterndale-Bennett had adjusted after they had replicated it out long-hand at the British Museum. The analyst in "The Times" suspected that Jacques was "as engaging as a year ago", in her execution as Ali Baba's better half, Cogia.
