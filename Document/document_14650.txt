On 26 January 1918, Leane rejoined his brigade, having recovered from his injuries. His CMG and bar to the DSO had been declared while he was away, as had his fifth notice in despatches. For nearly the entire time of his nonattendance, the 48th Battalion had been retaining substitutions, resting and preparing in back territories, just coming back to its turn through to the bleeding edges, hold channels and rest regions in mid-January. Indeed, even its short periods in the cutting edge had been calm, for the most part occupied with improving channels and different barriers. In mid-February the force moved to billets close Meteren where it stayed until 25 March. On that day the 724-in number 48th Battalion was grabbed by truck and sent south to help meet the German Spring Offensive, which had just been propelled four days sooner, meeting with reverberating achievement. Subsequent to debussing north of Berles-au-Bois, the legion walked into that town and took up positions. The next evening they were requested to walk during that time another further south to Senlis-le-Sec, landing there on the morning of 27 March. After a concise stop they proceeded through HÃÂ©nencourt and east to Millencourt, due west of Albert.
