The first centerline was painted on a state highway in 1917 along the MarquetteâNegaunee Road which was designated TrunklineÂ 15, now County RoadÂ 492 in Marquette County. Winter maintenance started during World War I to keep of strategic highways clear; some $13,200 (equivalent to $ in ) was appropriated with partial funding from the War Loan Board.
In 1919, the legislature passed the Aldrich Act; combined with the approval of the Bond Issue Act during an election that April, the MSHD was authorized to assume responsibility over the roadways that composed the State Trunkline Highway System. The state highway commissioner was required to sign the state trunkline highways, and Michigan become the second state after Wisconsin to do so. Alan Williams, Ionia County engineer, helped to design the diamond marker used to sign the highways; he is also known for placing a picnic table alongside USÂ 16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac, considered the first in the country. Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now USÂ 2 near Iron River in 1919â20. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues in Detroit on October 9, 1917. The tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before it was replaced in October 1920 with the world's first four-way traffic light.
