There are a few terns of a comparative size and outward presentation to the basic tern. A customarily troublesome animal varieties to isolate is the Arctic tern, and until the key attributes were cleared up, far off or flying feathered creatures of the two species were regularly together recorded as "commic terns". Albeit comparative in size, the two terns vary in structure and flight. The normal tern has a bigger head, thicker neck, longer legs, and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative, and has an all the more dominant, non-stop flight. The Arctic tern has greyer underparts than the normal, which make its white cheeks progressively self-evident, though the posterior of the basic tern can be grayish in non-reproducing plumage, contrasted with the white of its relative. The regular tern builds up a dim wedge on the wings as the reproducing season advances, yet the wings of Arctic remain white all through the northern summer. All the flight quills of the Arctic tern are translucent against a brilliant sky, just the four deepest wing plumes of the basic tern share this property. The trailing edge of the external flight plumes is a slight dark line in the Arctic tern, however thicker and less characterized in the normal. The bill of a grown-up basic tern is orange-red with a dark tip, aside from in dark charged "S.ÃÂ h.ÃÂ longipennis", and its legs are brilliant red, while the two highlights are a darker red shading in the Arctic tern, which likewise does not have the dark bill tip.
