Likewise in 1829, Jones set out on a voyage through the northern United States with Reverend William Case and a few Indian believers to fund-raise for the Methodist missions in Upper Canada. The visit raised ÃÂ£600, 30% of the Methodist Church's yearly consumptions crosswise over British North America. After his arrival to Upper Canada, the year's yearly Methodist gathering named Jones "A Missionary to the Indian Tribes" on Case's asking. The 1830 meeting gave him a similar arrangement. He was likewise appointed as a minister at that point. Upper Canada's Methodists were in urgent need of cash by 1831; that spring the congregation had been unfit to pay every one of the pay rates owed. To fund-raise for the congregation, Jones ventured out with George Ryerson to the United Kingdom that spring where he gave in excess of sixty messages and one hundred talks which raised more than ÃÂ£1000. These lessons were likewise held with Jones in Indian clothing, which joined with his Indian name made interest and filled the lobbies, with four or five thousand participants at his message for the London Missionary Society's commemoration. Jones met with various conspicuous Englishmen, including James Cowles Prichard, who treated him when he became sick in June 1831, just as Methodist pioneers, for example, Adam Clarke, Hannah More and Richard Watson. This visit made noteworthy open intrigue, and Jones met with King William IV on April 5, 1832, in the blink of an eye before his arrival to Upper Canada.
