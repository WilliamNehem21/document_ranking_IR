The British squadron, of which "Levant" was part, was tasked with disrupting French trade through the Caribbean and hunting privateers. However the frigate saw little action in her first six months in the region; French trade had virtually ceased since the outbreak of war with Britain, while a smallpox outbreak killed some among "Levant"s crew. It was not until early 1760 that "Levant" defeated her first opponent, a 14-gun French privateer which was sunk with the loss of 120 of her crew. Thereafter combat was more frequent. Two small privateers were captured in early 1760 â the 8-gun "Poissan Volante" and the 12-gun "St Pierre" â and these vessels and their crews were delivered into British custody on the Leeward Islands. In June "Pickering", a British merchantman previously captured by the French, was retaken and sailed to Antigua as "Levant"s prize. A further victory followed on 29 June with the capture of French privateer "Le Scipio", after which "Levant" was put into harbour in Antigua for resupply. One contemporary source at this time records her as carrying only 20 of her 28 guns. She returned to sea before the end of the year, capturing the privateer "L'Union" on 18 December.
