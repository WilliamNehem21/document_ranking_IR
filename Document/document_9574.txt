England led the pack in dealings to revive the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo, the world's most extravagant wellspring of uranium mineral, which had been overwhelmed and shut, as 30 percent of the stock in Union MiniÃÂ¨re du Haut Katanga, the organization that claimed the mine, was constrained by British interests. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador John Winant worked out an arrangement in May 1944 with Edgar Sengier, the chief of Union MiniÃÂ¨re, and the Belgian government for the mine to be revived and of mineral to be acquired at $1.45 a pound. The Combined Development Trust likewise arranged arrangements with Swedish organizations to secure mineral from that point. Oliphant moved toward the Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir Stanley Bruce, in August 1943 about uranium supplies from Australia, and Anderson made an immediate solicitation to the leader of Australia, John Curtin, amid the last's visit to Britain in May 1944 to start mineral investigation in Australia in spots where uranium stores were accepted to exist. Just as uranium, the Combined Development Trust verified supplies of thorium from Brazil, Netherlands East Indies, Sweden and Portugal. At the time uranium was accepted to be an uncommon mineral, and the more plentiful thorium was viewed as a conceivable option, as it could be lighted to deliver uranium-233, another isotope of uranium reasonable for making nuclear bombs.
