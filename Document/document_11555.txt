In 1943 Vaughan Williams led the debut of his Fifth Symphony at the Proms. Its peaceful tone appeared differently in relation to the stormy Fourth, and drove a few pundits to think it a symphonic valediction. William Glock composed that it was "like crafted by a recognized writer who has nothing exceptionally new to state, yet says it in flawlessly streaming language". The music Vaughan Williams composed for the BBC to praise the finish of the war, "Thanksgiving for Victory", was set apart by what the pundit Edward Lockspeiser called the arranger's trademark evasion of "any proposal of expository vainglory". Any doubt that the septuagenarian author had sunk into kindhearted quietness was scattered by his Sixth Symphony (1948), portrayed by the faultfinder Gwyn Parry-Jones as "a standout amongst the most exasperating melodic articulations of the twentieth century", opening with a "base shout, diving the audience quickly into a universe of animosity and approaching bedlam." Coming as it neared the beginning of the Cold War, numerous pundits thought its "pianissimo" last development a delineation of an atomic burned no man's land. The author was contemptuous of automatic speculations: "It never appears to jump out at individuals that a man may very well need to compose a bit of music."
