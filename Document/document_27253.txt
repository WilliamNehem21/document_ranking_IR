The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) approved the United States Numbered Highway System on November 11, 1926, and the MSHD designated USÂ 31 in Michigan according to AASHO's plan to run northward from the Indiana state line and along the Lake Michigan shoreline to Mackinaw City. A section in the Benton HarborâSt. Joseph area overlapped USÂ 12 and the modern concurrency with USÂ 10 was also in place. By the end of the next year, the highway was extended across the Straits of Mackinac on the state car ferries to connect to USÂ 2 in the Upper Peninsula north of St. Ignace. In 1930, Muskegon was bypassed; the new highway east of downtown was numbered USÂ 31A.
By the end of 1936, the last section of USÂ 31 in the state was paved near Charlevoix, making the entire highway in Michigan a hard-surfaced road. Early the next year, the route of USÂ 2 was realigned to run into St. Ignace; after the change, USÂ 2 and USÂ 31 ran concurrently. Later that year, a set of curves were straightened out south of Ludington and the routes of USÂ 31 and a USÂ 31A between Saugatuck and Holland were switched, and USÂ 31 was realigned to bypass downtown Ludington.
