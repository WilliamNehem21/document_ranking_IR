ONUC powers in Katanga were under the direction of Major General Chand and his operational agent, Brigadier Reginald Noronha. ONUC compel quality had been raised to 18,200, 70 percent of whom were conveyed in and around Katanga. Peacekeeping contingents from Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Ireland, Sweden, and Tunisia were reserved by the UN to do Operation Grandslam. So as to at the same time convey these troops for the task, the UN required an expansive carrier capacity. ONUC had amassed an air transport armada of 65 planes, the biggest being Douglas DC-4s, however it was as yet deficient for Operation Grandslam. Thant's military attachÃÂ©, Indar Jit Rikhye, had mentioned help from the United States Department of Defense. A few days after the fact, the United States submitted its flying corps to give strategic help. In November United States President John F. Kennedy offered to supply the UN with American contender planes to apply a "staggering show of solidarity from the air". Thant, however craving compelling UN ground and air activity, was anxious to keep ONUC fair-minded and needed to shun approaching a lot of help from any significant world forces. On 16 December he pronounced that he would consider the American offer if the circumstance stayed gridlocked by the spring of 1963.
