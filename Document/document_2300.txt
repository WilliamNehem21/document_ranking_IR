Arrangement of the holotype started in the fall of 1900 not long after it was gathered by Riggs for the Field Museum. First the appendage components were prepared. In the winter of 1904, the severely endured vertebrae of the back and hip were set up by James B. Abbott and C.T. Kline. As the planning of each bone was done, it was put in plain view in a glass case in Hall 35 of the Fine Arts Palace of the Worlds Columbian Exposition, the Field Museum's first area. Every one of the bones were, singularly, still in plain view by 1908 in Hall 35 when the Field Museum's recently mounted "Apatosaurus" was divulged, the very example Riggs had found in Quarry 12, today listed as FMNH P25112 and recognized as a "Brontosaurus" model. No mount of "Brachiosaurus" was endeavored on the grounds that just 20% of the skeleton had been recuperated. In 1993, the holotype bones were shaped and cast, and the missing bones were etched dependent on "Giraffatitan" material in Berlin. This plastic skeleton was mounted and, in 1994, put in plain view at the north end of Stanley Field Hall, the principle show corridor of the Field Museum's present structure. The genuine bones of the holotype were put on display in two huge glass cases at either end of the mounted cast. The mount remained until 1999, when it was moved to the B Concourse of United Airlines' Terminal One in O'Hare International Airport to account for the exhibition hall's recently procured "Tyrannosaurus" skeleton, "Sue". In the meantime, the Field Museum mounted a second plastic cast of the skeleton (intended for outside use) which is in plain view outside the exhibition hall on the NW patio.
