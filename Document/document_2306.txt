The tradition gathered on June 1 in Baltimore, Maryland, and the stop happened of course. On the principal vote of the 288 agents, hung on June 3, Cass guaranteed 116, Buchanan 93, and the rest were dissipated, without a solitary vote in favor of Pierce. The following 34 polls go with no victor even close, and still no votes in favor of Pierce. The Buchanan group at that point had their representatives vote in favor of minor hopefuls, including Pierce, to exhibit Buchanan's certainty, and join the tradition behind him. This epic strategy reverse discharges after a few tallies as Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine changed to Pierce; the rest of the Buchanan powers started to break for Marcy, and Pierce was soon in third spot. After the 48th vote, North Carolina Congressman James C. Dobbin conveyed an unforeseen and energetic underwriting of Pierce, starting a flood of help for the dim steed hopeful. On the 49th ticket, Pierce got everything except six of the votes, and in this way picked up the Democratic selection for president. Representatives chose Alabama Senator William R. Ruler, a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's running mate, and embraced a gathering stage that rejected further "fomentation" over the bondage issue and upheld the Compromise of 1850.
