No.Â 30 Communications Flight included Robertson's personal Dakota, operating under his direction. The unit's complement of two Dakotas and two Austers was soon augmented by two more Dakotas from Australia. On 1Â November 1950, No.Â 30 Communications Flight was renamed No.Â 30 Communications Unit. The same month, it received another four Dakotas from No.Â 38 Squadron, of No.Â 90 (Composite) Wing in Malaya, giving it a strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers. The unit supported all Australian forces in Korea. One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs. Unlike No.Â 77 Squadron, it was not tasked by Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control, which was exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan. No.Â 30 Communications Unit was re-formed as No.Â 30 Transport Unit on 5Â November 1951, and as No.Â 36 (Transport) Squadron on 10Â March 1953. During the war it transported around 100,000 passengers and over 6,000 tons of cargo. No.Â 91 Wing's records listed 12,762 medical evacuations from Korea to Japan, and over 2,000 from Japan to Australia or Britain. The transportation unit lost an Auster and a Wirraway to crashes, resulting in four deaths.
