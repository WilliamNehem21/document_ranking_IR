"Reign in Blood" was released in 1986 and was Slayer's first album to enter the "Billboard" 200âat 94â and their first to be awarded gold certification. Music critics praised the album; "Kerrang!" described it as the "heaviest album of all time", while Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that the album was a "stone-cold classic". The positive reception led to the band's European agent John Jackson, to suggest that the band play "Reign in Blood" in its entirety on the JÃ¤germeister tour of 2003 and 2004, under the tour banner "Still Reigning". Original drummer Dave Lombardo, who recorded drums on the album, re-joined the band in 2001, after departing in 1991. This influenced the band's decision to play the album in its entirety, as they had the original members and all members regard the album as a high-point in their career. The band was going to enter the recording studio to record their next album ("Christ Illusion"). However, the band's producer Rick Rubin insisted the band not enter the recording studio due to problems between himself and the band's record label, American Recordings. The band's manager suggested they record a performance of one of the JÃ¤germeister shows and release it on a DVD â the band agreed.
