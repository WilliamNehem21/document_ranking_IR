Duke Charles Eugene moved into the Neuer Hauptbau in 1757 and entrusted La GuÃÂªpiÃÂ¨re with the loft's embellishment. After two years, La GuÃÂªpiÃÂ¨re finished the whole suite with the exception of the bedchamber, as the Duke involved his significant other's previous suite in 1760 for his real living arrangement. The remainder of the suite was utilized for social capacities until it was discharged of decorations in the following decade. A staircase and waiting room lead to the passage of the present loft, a display improved by Ludovico Bossi. The underlying rooms are the first and second waiting rooms, clad in green damask with representations by Antoine Pesne and framing by Michel Fressancourt, overdoors by MatthÃÂ¤us GÃÂ¼nther, boiserie deck, and furniture by Jacques-Philippe Carel and Jean-Baptiste HÃÂ©douin that Charles Eugene procured around 1750. The Assembly Room, reestablished in 2003, conspicuously includes overdoors by Adolf Friedrich Harper and trophies of melodic instruments over the windows. Charles Eugene's third-floor habitation starts with the Corner Room, again painted by Harper, which encourages into a cupboard room and after that at long last the bedchamber, finished in 1770. Bossi made the roof's stucco in 1759Ã¢ÂÂ 60, yet the room and its two wardrobes took one more decade to finish. Extra rooms on the third floor housed relatives of the leaders of WÃÂ¼rttemberg and these have been involved by the Ceramics Museum since 2004.
