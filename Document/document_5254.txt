The other meteor showers transmitting from Auriga are far less noticeable and fanciful than the Alpha Aurigids. The Zeta Aurigids are a frail shower with a northern and southern branch enduring from December 11 to January 21. The shower tops on January 1 and has moderate meteors, with a greatest rate of 1Ã¢ÂÂ 5 meteors for every hour. It was found by William Denning in 1886 and was found to be the wellspring of uncommon fireballs by Alexander Stewart Herschel. There is another swoon stream of meteors called the "Aurigids", random to the September shower. This shower keeps going from January 31 to February 23, topping from February 5 through February 10; its moderate meteors top at a rate of around 2 every hour. The Delta Aurigids are a swoon shower transmitting from Auriga. It was found by a gathering of specialists at New Mexico State University and has a low pinnacle rate. The Delta Aurigids last from September 22 through October 23, topping between October 6 and October 15. They might be identified with the September Epsilon Perseids, however they are increasingly like the Coma Berenicids in that the Delta Aurigids last more and have a lack of splendid meteors. They also have a conjectured association with an obscure brief period retrograde comet. The Iota Aurigids are a guessed shower happening in mid-November; its parent body might be the space rock 2000 NL10, yet this association is profoundly questioned. The speculated Iota Aurigids may rather be a black out stream of Taurids.
