Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987â88, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3â3 draw) saved Ferguson's career. The following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1â0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1â0 at Wembley. In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title â alongside the FA Cup â to complete the first "Double" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995â96, before retaining the league title once more in 1996â97 with a game to spare.
In the 1998â99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League â "The Treble" â in the same season. Losing 1â0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar SolskjÃ¦r scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time. The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating Palmeiras 1â0 in Tokyo. Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football.
