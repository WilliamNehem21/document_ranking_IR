Timothy Henry HoÃÂ»olulu Pitman was conceived MarchÃÂ 18, 1845, in Hilo, HawaiÃÂ»i, the primary child and second offspring of Benjamin Pitman and KinoÃÂ»oleoliliha. Initially a local of Salem, Massachusetts, Pitman's dad was an early pioneer, representative and sugar and espresso manor proprietor on the island of HawaiÃÂ»i, who benefitted significantly from the kingdom's blasting whaling industry in the mid 1800s. On his dad's side, he was an incredible grandson of Joshua Pitman (1755Ã¢ÂÂ 1822), an English-American craftsman on the ship "Franklin" under Captain Allen Hallett amid the American Revolutionary War. On his mom's side, Pitman was a relative of KameÃÂ»eiamoku, one of the imperial twins (with Kamanawa) who instructed Kamehameha I in his success concerning the Hawaiian Islands, and furthermore of the early American or English ocean skipper Harold Cox, who loaned his name to George "Cox" Kahekili KeÃÂ»eaumoku II, the Governor of Maui. Henry HoÃÂ»olulu Pitman imparted his Hawaiian name to his maternal granddad HoÃÂ»olulu who, alongside his sibling Hoapili, covered the bones of King KamehamehaÃÂ I in a mystery concealing spot after his demise. In the Hawaiian language, the name "HoÃÂ»olulu" signifies "to lie in the protected waters". His kin were Mary Pitman Ailau (1838Ã¢ÂÂ 1905), Benjamin Franklin Keolaokalani Pitman (1852Ã¢ÂÂ 1918) and stepsister Maria KinoÃÂ»ole Pitman Morey (1858Ã¢ÂÂ 1892).
