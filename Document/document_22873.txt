On the basis of Austen's reputation as a serious author, the producers were able to rely on high-brow publications to help market their film. Near the time of its US release, large spreads in "The New York Review of Books", "Vanity Fair", "Film Comment", and other media outlets featured columns on Lee's production. In late December, "Time" magazine declared it and "Persuasion" to be the best films of 1995. Andrew Higson referred to all this media exposure as a "marketing coup" because it meant the film "was reaching one of its target audiences." Meanwhile, most promotional images featured the film as a "sort of chick flick in period garb." New Market Press published Thompson's screenplay and film diary; in its first printing, the hard cover edition sold 28,500 copies in the US. British publisher Bloomsbury released a paperback edition of the novel containing film pictures, same title design, and the cast's names on the cover, whilst Signet Publishing in the US printed 250,000 copies instead of the typical 10,000 a year; actress Julie Christie read the novel in an audiobook released by Penguin Audiobooks. "Sense and Sensibility" increased dramatically in terms of its book sales, ultimately hitting tenth place on "The New York Times" Best Seller list for paperbacks in February 1996.
