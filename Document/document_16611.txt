The novel revolves around the fictionalized figure of BolÃ­var and includes many minor characters who are part of the General's travelling party, whom he meets on his journey or who come to him in his memories and dreams of his past. Sometimes they are identified by particular quirks or tied to small but significant events. They include, for instance, General JosÃ© MarÃ­a CarreÃ±o, a member of the entourage, whose right arm was amputated after a combat wound, and who once revealed a military secret by talking in his sleep. At other times, they are prostheses for the General's now failing powers: Fernando, for example, the General's nephew, is "the most willing and patient of the General's many clerks", and the General wakes him "at any hour to have him read aloud from a dull book or take notes on urgent extemporizations". One of the least developed of the minor characters is the General's wife, MarÃ­a Teresa RodrÃ­guez del Toro y Alayza, who had died, readers are told, in mysterious circumstances shortly after their marriage. The General has "buried her at the bottom of a water-tight oblivion as a brutal means of living without her"; she only fleetingly enters his memories in the book's last chapter. According to Menton, she is "upstaged" by Manuela SÃ¡enz, whose later history GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez recounts as if she instead were the General's widow. MarÃ­a Teresa's death, however, marked the General's "birth into history", and he has never tried to replace her.
