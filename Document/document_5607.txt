The LIRR was qualified by law for take the case to the New York Court of Appeals (the state's most astounding court) as there had been a dispute in the Appellate Division, and it did. The railroad contended again that Palsgraf had neglected to set up that she had come to hurt through the railroad's carelessness: that there was no carelessness, and regardless of whether there was, that disregard had not hurt Palsgraf, since such damage was not "a characteristic and likely result of helping a man to board a train". Its short asserted that the trainmen couldn't have prevented the man from loading up, and once he had flung himself onto the train, had minimal decision yet to support him, "looked with such a crisis they can't be accused of carelessness since they chose to help the man instead of stand inertly by and abandon him to his destiny." Wood, as far as concerns him, contended that carelessness had been found by the jury, and by both greater part and contradicting judges in the Appellate Division. He composed that there were numerous certainties from which the jury could have discovered carelessness, including the way that the train had not closed its entryways as it left (however whether this was to enable mavericks to board or in light of the fact that it was a late spring day is unsure). The case was contended under the watchful eye of the Court of Appeals in Albany on February 24, 1928.
