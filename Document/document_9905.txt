Stott pulled back help in 1970 over the Chowilla Dam, a disagreement regarding the area of a dam on the Murray River, and South Australia went to the surveys. The dam discussion was very little of a decision issue, and endeavors by the Democratic Labor Party to depict Dunstan as a socialist over his resistance to progressing Australian help for South Vietnam had little impact. The LCL crusaded intensely on Hall, while Dunstan guaranteed clearing social change, imaginative change and greater network administrations. He said "We'll set another standard of social progression that the entire of Australia will envy. We trust South Australia can set the pace. It can occur here. We can do it." Dunstan won the 1970 race effectively, taking 27 seats contrasted and the LCL's 20. In spite of the fact that the offer of the votes had been like 1968, the weakening of the Playmander had changed the offer of the seats. As Labor had accomplished a lion's share of the well known vote in favor of an extensive stretch, and on the grounds that malapportionment had been generally finished, the political specialists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch said "a Dunstan decade appears to be guaranteed".
