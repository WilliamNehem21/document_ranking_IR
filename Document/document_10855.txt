After Australia won the initial two Tests, Parkin, writing in England, again scrutinized Gilligan's administration in the press and incited a minor contention by proposing that Jack Hobbs ought to accept the captaincy. The third Test was a lot nearer, despite the fact that England were seriously hampered by wounds to three bowlers, including Gilligan himself. These wounds may have influenced the result of the arrangement. Australia won by the little edge of 11 runs, however Gilligan took his group near triumph with a limited innings of 31. Britain won the fourth Test, their first triumph over Australia since the war, yet lost the last amusement. Pundits made a decision about that the group played well and did not endure disrespect, in spite of the outcome. Gibson takes note of that the visit "was fruitful in everything except for triumph, and this was detected by the English open, who collected in expansive numbers to respect the side home". In the Test arrangement, Gilligan took 10 wickets at a normal of 51.90 and scored 64 keeps running at 9.14. Gibson makes a decision about that the greater part of his wickets were great batsmen, and numerous bowlers had poor figures in an arrangement that created a substantial number of runs, so this record isn't as poor as it shows up. In all top of the line diversions on visit, Gilligan took 28 wickets at 38.39 and scored 357 keeps running at 17.85. He didn't play in any more Tests.
