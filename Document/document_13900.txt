Amid a show at New York's Madison Square Garden, Prince played out a concoction of his 1984 melodies "Pop Life" and "I Would Die 4 U", fusing an example of "Single Ladies". Amid her visit in Melbourne, Australia, on August 13, 2010, Katy Perry performed "Single Ladies" and endeavored to imitate the movement. English writer of traditional music Mark-Anthony Turnage made a setting out of the tune which he titled "Pounded Out". Depicting it as his "most R&B work to date", Turnage disclosed to Tim Rutherford-Johnson of "The Guardian" that he was persuaded to put the "Single Ladies" reference in his work by his young child, an enthusiast of the tune. The piece debuted at the BBC Proms on August 27, 2010. Sara Bareilles secured the tune as a component of "Billboard"s "Mashup Mondays" and performed it as a feature of her set rundown on the 2010 Lilith Fair Tour. As expressed by a commentator composing for the magazine, Bareilles put "a piano-pop" curve on "Single Ladies" and turned it "into a moderate, energetic track, total with crawling bassline and vocal harmonies". American musical gang A Rocket to the Moon secured "Single Ladies" and put it on their EP, "The Rainy Day Sessions", which was discharged in October 2010.
