Matos was comprehensively incredulous of the amusement's multiplayer mode, however he singled out certain components, for example, the maps, too planned. He disdained the association with single-player mode, calling it "an abnormal story tie-in", and was worried that despite the fact that the ongoing interaction makes an interpretation of well into the multiplayer component, "the whole experience might be too disordered to even consider enrapturing a substantial audienceÃÂ ...ÃÂ it doesn't feel sufficiently profound to direction significantly more than an angrily devoted fan following". Simmons was progressively positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is "a really crisp additionÃÂ ...ÃÂ that effectively extends a considerable lot of the signs of the much-cherished single-player [game]". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his most loved mode, however did not feel that the battle offered enough profundity to make multiplayer "a really captivating knowledge", portraying it rather as "an oddity that gives a couple of long periods of happiness instead of being a fundamental expansion". The survey from "Edge" magazine depicted multiplayer mode as "turbulent at first", with overpowering alternatives, yet said that it winds up simpler as players become familiar with the dimensions. The "Edge" survey distinguished the fixed camera framework as an advantage since "you can generally observe precisely what's happening and battle your adversaries rather than the perspective", and furthermore lauded the shading coding framework, which "adequately tells you when you have an opening and when to run".
