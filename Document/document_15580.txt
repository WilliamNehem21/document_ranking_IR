In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters there. The annual summer cruise was to Norway, and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in Danzig on 29 August. "Deutschland" again won the "SchieÃpreis" that year. In November, "Deutschland", accompanied by the aviso and the dispatch boat , hosted Wilhelm II during the celebration of the opening of the Naval Academy MÃ¼rwik in Flensburg. "Deutschland" had too deep a draft to enter Gelting Bay outside the Flensburg Firth, so Wilhelm II transferred to "Sleipner". A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In early March 1911, "Deutschland" again carried Wilhelm II to Helgoland; this trip was followed by fleet exercises in the Skagerrak and Kattegat that month. "Deutschland" and the rest of the fleet received British and American naval squadrons at Kiel in June and July. The year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat, and "Deutschland" won the "SchieÃpreis" a third time. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli. Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Chancellor of Germany, also attended the review, aboard "Deutschland". On 1 October, "Deutschland" was relieved of her tactical assignment to the II Squadron, as the "Reichstag" (Imperial Diet) authorized the fleet to keep a 17th battleship in commissionâthe I and II Squadrons comprising eight battleships each, so the fleet could now keep two full squadrons in addition to the flagship.
