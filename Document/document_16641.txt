"New York Dolls" has frequently been named one of the greatest albums of all-time; according to Acclaimed Music, it is the 167th most prominently ranked record on critics' all-time lists. In 1978, it was ranked as the 199th greatest record ever in Paul Gambaccini's book "Rock Critics' Choice: The Top 200 Albums", which polled a number of leading music journalists and record collectors. Christgau, one of the critics polled, named it the 15th best album of the 1970s in "The Village Voice" the following year. "New York Dolls" was included in Neil Strauss's 1996 list of the 100 most influential alternative records, and the "Spin Alternative Record Guide" (1995) named it the 70th best alternative album. In 2002, it was included on a list published by "Q" of the 100 best punk records, while "Mojo" named it both the 13th greatest punk album and the 49th greatest album of all time. In 2003, "Rolling Stone" placed the record at number 213 on its 500 greatest albums list and "Personality Crisis" at number 271 on its 500 greatest songs list. In 2007, "Mojo" polled a panel of prominent recording artists and songwriters for the magazine's "100 Records That Changed the World" publication, in which "New York Dolls" was voted the 39th most influential and inspirational record ever. English singer Morrissey named it his favorite album in a list for "The Quietus" in 2010. According to Paul Myers, the record "struck such a chord with Morrissey that he was not only moved to form his own influential group, The SmithsÂ ... but would eventually convince the surviving Dolls to reunite [in 2004]". In 2013, "New York Dolls" was placed at number 355 on "NME"s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
