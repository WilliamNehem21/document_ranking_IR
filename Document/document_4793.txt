Walker mentioned Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to counsel those with involvement in the Everglades on the attainability of depleting them, saying that he had been advised a few waterways to the Gulf of Mexico would be adequate. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to react, and many favored the thought, advancing the land as a future agrarian resource for the South. A couple deviated, for example, Captain John Sprague, who composed he "never assumed the nation would energize a request, other than as a concealing spot for Indians, and had it struck me that so extraordinary an endeavor, one so absolutely impracticable, as depleting the Ever Glades was to be talked about, I ought not have devastated the scratch of pen upon a subject so productive, and which can't be seen yet by the individuals who have swam the water midsection profound and inspected cautiously the western coast via land and by water."
