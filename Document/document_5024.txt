The primary story, told more than three acts, pursues commonly that of Busenello's lyrics for Monteverdi's 1642 musical drama "L'incoronazione di Poppea". It describes Nero's different plans to supplant his present ruler Octavia with his paramour Poppea, against the urgings of his mom Agrippina and the savant Seneca. A sub-plot presents Tiridates, crown sovereign of Armenia, another verifiable figure who, in the musical show, is pledged to the anecdotal Cassandra yet is furtively seeking after Poppea in contention with the ruler. Octavia and Cassandra give each other common help in their preliminaries, while Agrippina aligns with Octavia and barely escapes passing from a bit of falling stone work. Thusly, she attempts ineffectively to induce Seneca to slaughter Nero. As a stratagem to verify Tiridates' adoration, Cassandra masks herself and educates him of her demise, which news briefly disturbs him. Anicetus further convolutes matters by becoming hopelessly enamored with Octavia. As these occasions build up, the hireling Graptus gives a deriding, amusing analysis. Nero's play, "The Judgment of Paris", and a portrayal of the copying of Rome involve quite a bit of Act III. After these numerous diversions the musical show finishes up with the expulsion of Octavia, the imprisonment of Agrippina, the arrival of his faculties to Tiridates when he discovers that Cassandra is alive, and a blissful and triumphant twofold crowning celebration: Nero and Poppea, and Tiridates and Cassandra.
