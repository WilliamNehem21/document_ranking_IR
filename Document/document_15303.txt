Ãthelbald was the second son of King Ãthelwulf and probably of his first wife Osburh, who was the mother of Alfred the Great. As Ãthelstan was old enough to be appointed king ten years before Alfred was born in 849, and Ãthelbald took part in battle in 851, some historians argue that it is more likely that the elder children were born to an unrecorded earlier wife. Ãthelstan died before his father, but Ãthelbald and his three younger brothers were successively kings of Wessex: Ãthelbald reigned from 855 to 860, Ãthelberht reigned from 860 to 865, Ãthelred I reigned from 865 to 871 and Alfred the Great reigned from 871 to 899. Ãthelbald is first recorded when he witnessed a charter of his father (S 290) in 840 as "filius regis" (the king's son). He attested with the same designation in the 840s, to S 300 in 850 as "dux filius regis" and in the early 850s as "dux" (ealdorman). In 850 his elder brother Ãthelstan defeated a Danish fleet off Sandwich in the first recorded naval battle in English history, but he is not recorded thereafter, and probably died soon afterwards. In 851 Ãthelwulf and Ãthelbald defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea and, according to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", "we have never heard of a greater slaughter of them, in any region, on any one day, before or since". At Easter in 854 Ãthelbald and his younger brother Ãthelberht attested charters as "dux", and in 855 their father went on pilgrimage to Rome and appointed Ãthelbald as king of Wessex while Ãthelberht became king of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex.
