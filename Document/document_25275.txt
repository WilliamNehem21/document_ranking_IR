In the late 1920s, he rejoined the Nazi Party and became a member of the paramilitary "Sturmabteilung" (SA) in 1931. He clashed with other leaders of the SA, and joined the "Allgemeine-SS" in 1936. Initially responsible for physical education in an SS region, he was soon transferred to the staff of "ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS" Heinrich Himmler as head of the sports office. In 1938, he was appointed as head of the recruiting office of the SS Main Office (SS-HA), taking over as chief of the SS-HA the following year. To a significant extent, Berger was the "father" of the "Waffen-SS", as he not only implemented recruiting structures and policies that assisted the "Waffen-SS" to circumvent Wehrmacht controls over conscription, but also extended "Waffen-SS" recruiting first to "Germanic" volunteers from Scandinavia and western Europe, then "Volksdeutsche" (ethnic Germans) outside the Reich, and finally to peoples who in no way reflected Himmler's ideas of "racial purity". He consistently advocated greater ideological training for the "Waffen-SS", but did not view SS ideology as a replacement for religion. He also sponsored and protected his friend Oskar Dirlewanger, whom he placed in command of a unit of convicted criminals; the SS-"Sonderkommando Dirlewanger" subsequently committed many war crimes. Berger often clashed with senior officers of the Wehrmacht and even with senior "Waffen-SS" officers over his recruiting methods, but he took advantage of opportunities as they presented themselves in order to grow the "Waffen-SS" to a total of 38 divisions by war's end.
