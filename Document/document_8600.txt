Catherine Hoad finds the issue of national and racial personality integral to Viking metal. For example, she composes that when Trafford and Pluskowski guarantee that Manowar couldn't guarantee religious or racial personality with the Vikings when the band had a lead vocalist with the "'not exactly entirely Scandinavian name of Joey di Maio', [Trafford and Pluskowski] are moving toward a more unpredictable and racially-charged issue than their offhandedness would recommend." While Viking symbolism might be promptly appropriated, as indicated by Hoad the meaning of a "genuine" Viking is very inflexible, an unbending nature which non-Nordic, and particularly non-White, performers must fight with. For instance, she refers to the Brazilian band Viking Throne, which claims authenticity through European family and verifiable references to investigations of South America by Nordic nations, and statements their front-man, Count Nidhogg: "A few people see splendidly that it doesn't make a difference where you live, what's extremely essential is your legacy and lineage. Notwithstanding living in a South American nation as Brazil we as a whole have European blood." Hoad contends that Viking Throne represents the social significance of asserting Viking heritage, a culture that works on to a great extent geographic lines. As opposed to Viking Throne, she refers to the band Slechtvalk, which is notable for its image of Christian Viking metal, however is infrequently condemned as inauthentic by the scene. Hoad estimates that the European ethnicity of the band is sufficient to adjust for its generally unreasonable music.
