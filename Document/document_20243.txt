In the period drama "Rajanna" (2011), the central character Mallamma (played by Baby Annie) listens to "Mayabazar" songs. Although this was criticised as anachronistic, director K. V. Vijayendra Prasad said that "Rajanna" was set in 1958, a year after "Mayabazar" release. In Ram Gopal Varma "Katha Screenplay Darsakatvam Appalaraju" (2011), its protagonist Appalaraju (played by Sunil), an aspiring director, is shown enjoying a sequence from the song "Lahiri Lahiri" in the song "Mayabazaaru". In her article "The making of Tollywood", commemorating the 81st anniversary of the Indian Telugu film industry, Sunita Raghu of "The New Indian Express" called "Mayabazar" the "tour de force" of Telugu cinema. In November 2012, "The Times of India" listed "Mayabazar" along with other unrelated films such as "Missamma" (1955), "Gundamma Katha" (1962), "Nartanasala" (1963), and "Bommarillu" (2006) in the list "Telugu classics to watch along with family this Deepavali". For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included "Mayabazar" in its list of "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time", and a May 2013 CNN-News18 poll ranked it the greatest Indian film of all time. In commemoration of the centennial of Indian cinema, "The Hindu" listed "Mayabazar" along with "Pathala Bhairavi" (1951), "Missamma", "Gundamma Katha", "Maduve Madi Nodu" (1965), "Ram Aur Shyam" (1967), "Julie" (1975), and "Shriman Shrimati" (1982) as the iconic films produced by Nagi Reddy.
