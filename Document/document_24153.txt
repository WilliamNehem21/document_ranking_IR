No. 77 Squadron returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageÂ III supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7Â July. The Mirages were charged with interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30Â mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No.Â 77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat. No.Â 481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, as well as most heavy maintenance. No.Â 77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3Â April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage hit the water during formation flying at night on 24Â June 1976.
The squadron began training with laser-guided bombs in October 1980. As of March 1984, its aircraft complement was nineteen Mirages. Two pilots died following a mid-air collision at low level on 9Â April that year.
On 1Â January 1985, in preparation for the introduction of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet to Australian service, No.Â 77 Squadron took over all Mirages and Macchi MB-326s of No.Â 2 Operational Conversion Unit, assuming responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. The transfer swelled the squadron's strength to fifty-six aircraftâforty Mirages and sixteen Macchisâand over 500 officers and men, making it the largest operational unit in the RAAF. Along with a heavily expanded training program, and its existing Australian Army close support role, No.Â 77 Squadron's fleet support commitment was increased to take up the slack resulting from the diminution of the Royal Australian Navy's fixed-wing capability. Its last fatal accident with the Mirage occurred on 2Â May 1986; the aircraft crashed into water during air-to-air gunnery practice.
