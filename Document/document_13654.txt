By the mid 21st century, couple of pachycephalosaur genera were known from postcranial remains, and numerous taxa were just known from vaults, which made order inside the gathering troublesome. Pachycephalosaurs are in this way for the most part characterized by cranial highlights, for example, the level to domed frontoparietal, the wide and straightened bar along the postorbital and squamosal bones, and the squamosal bones being profound plates on the occiput. In 1986, Sereno had isolated the pachycephalosaurs into various gatherings dependent on the degree of the doming of their skulls (assembled in now invalid taxa, for example, "Tholocephalidae" and "Domocephalinae"), and in 2000 he considered the "incompletely" domed "Stegoceras" a progress between the as far as anyone knows "crude" level headed and progressed "completely" domed genera, (for example, "Pachycephalosaurus"). The arch headed/level headed division of the pachycephalosaurs was relinquished in the next years, as level heads were considered paedomorphic (adolescent like) or determined qualities in many modifications, however not an explicitly dimorphic attribute. In 2006, Sullivan contended against the possibility that the degree of doming was helpful in deciding ordered affinities between pachycephalosaurs. In 2003, Sullivan discovered "Stegoceras" itself to be increasingly basal (or "crude") than the "completely domed" individuals from the subfamily Pachycephalosaurinae, expounding on ends come to by Sereno in 1986.
