Robert Bianco of the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" commended the show and said the choice to concentrate on less subplots may help. Bianco stated, "We should trust the progressions work, since "Crime" is too great to even consider losing, and its vision of development is too upsetting to even consider shunting aside." "The Washington Post" TV commentator Tom Shales called "Murder" "painfully, even horrendously, splendid. The best cop show I have ever observed." David Zurawik of "The Baltimore Sun" considered it the best police dramatization at any point made for TV other than "Slope Street Blues". "Baltimore Sun" journalist David Bianculli applauded the show's scholars for being happy to put their characters in morally flawed positions, including: "Kindly watch this arrangement; it's so great, I wouldn't fret arguing." Tom Jicha of "South Florida Sun-Sentinel" called it "an hour about as fine as there is on the cylinder" with incredible composition and camera-work. Jicha stated, "It would be a silly demonstration of viciousness against brilliant TV for the individuals who case to acknowledge fine dramatization to murder this show by turning the dial." Hal Boedeker, TV commentator with "The Miami Herald", firmly applauded the arrangement, especially "Bop Gun", which he called "the most noteworthy request for system TV". Boedeker called the composition, bearing and acting "top notch" and proclaimed "Murder" the better decision over "NYPD Blue" since it didn't depend on contrivances like the nakedness highlighted in the last show.
