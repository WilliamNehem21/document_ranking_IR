Burwell and Fleming state the book's subtext is tied in with maturing, as symbolized by the essayist's fascination in the more youthful prolific lady, and Hemingway utilized richness symbolism to symbolize "the maturing author's tension about his capacity to compose". The pictures of the old elephant symbolize the maturing and useless essayist, and Burwell supports Patrick Hemingway's choice to hold those bits of the original copy. Hemingway researcher Hilary Justice composes the work demonstrates an accentuation on "the author not composing", which for Hemingway would have been a destiny more awful than maturing. In this way, she says, "Valid at First Light" conjures a conundrum with "a maturing essayist for whom composing is ending up progressively troublesome at the time of expounding on the not-composing writer". Composing, for Hemingway, had dependably been troublesome. He overhauled his work perpetually and adhered to the act of expressing "one genuine sentence" and halting each composition session when despite everything he had more to compose. Tom Jenks, manager of a prior after death distributed book "The Garden of Eden", says Hemingway demonstrates the most exceedingly awful of his writing in "Valid at First Light": introducing himself as a "self indulging, liberal, overconfident" persona in a book that is close to a mass of fragmentary material. Jenks thinks Hemingway is essentially capriciously composing and the plot does not have the strain prominent in his most punctual works, for example, The Sun Also Rises". Be that as it may, he supposes Hemingway had great material to work with and some skeletal topical structures show guarantee.
