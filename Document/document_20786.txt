Based on ship observations in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, a low-pressure area developed north of Key West in early August. It developed into a tropical depression at 12:00Â UTC on AugustÂ 8, and strengthened into a tropical storm at 06:00Â UTC on AugustÂ 9 while moving northwestward off the west coast of Florida. Gradual intensification continued, and at 06:00Â UTC on AugustÂ 11 the storm strengthened to hurricane status. At 22:00Â UTC on AugustÂ 11, the hurricane reached its peak intensity and concurrently made landfall near the border between Alabama and Florida as a small tropical cyclone. During this time, the storm's maximum sustained winds were estimated at 80Â mph (130Â km/h), making it the equivalent of a CategoryÂ 1 hurricane on the modern day SaffirâSimpson hurricane wind scale. A lull in the storm accompanied the nearby passage of its eye before conditions once again deteriorated. Although the lowest barometric pressure measured on land was 1007Â mbar (hPa; 29.74Â inHg) in Pensacola, Florida, the storm's pressure was estimated to be much lower at 982Â mbar (hPa: 29.00Â inHg). After making landfall, the hurricane weakened and slowly drifted westward, weakening to a tropical depression over Louisiana on AugustÂ 13, before dissipating over Arkansas by 12:00Â UTC the next day.
