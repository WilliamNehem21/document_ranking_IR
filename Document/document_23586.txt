"Grim Fandango" development was led by project leader Tim Schafer, co-designer of "Day of the Tentacle" and creator of "Full Throttle" and the more recent "Psychonauts" and "BrÃ¼tal Legend". Schafer had conceived a Day of the Dead-themed adventure before production of "Full Throttle" began, and he submitted both concepts to LucasArts for approval at the same time. "Full Throttle" was accepted instead because of its greater mainstream appeal; it became a hit and opened the way for Schafer to create "Grim Fandango". "" noted that the pitching process for "Grim Fandango" was "a breeze" because of Schafer's earlier success, despite the new project's unusual theme. Development began soon after the completion of "Full Throttle" in June . "Grim Fandango" was an attempt by LucasArts to rejuvenate the graphic adventure genre, in decline by 1998. According to Schafer, the game was developed on a $3 million budget. It was the first LucasArts adventure since "" not to use the SCUMM engine, instead using the Sith engine, pioneered by "", as the basis of the new GrimE engine. The GrimE engine was built using the scripting language Lua. This design decision was due to LucasArts programmer Bret Mogilefsky's interest in the language, and is considered one of the first uses of Lua in gaming applications. The game's success led to the language's use in many other games and applications, including "Escape from Monkey Island" and "Baldur's Gate".
