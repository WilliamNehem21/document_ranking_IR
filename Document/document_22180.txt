For the first time since 1977's "Animals", designer Storm Thorgerson was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio album cover. His finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach, inspired by a phrase from "Yet Another Movie" and Gilmour's vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house, as well as "vestiges of relationships that have evaporated, leaving only echoes". The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds, placed on Saunton Sands in Devon (where some of the scenes for "Pink Floyd â The Wall" were filmed). The beds were arranged by Thorgerson's colleague Colin Elgie. A hang glider can be seen in the sky, a clear reference to "Learning to Fly". The photographer, Robert Dowling, won a gold award at the Association of Photographers Awards for the image, which took about two weeks to create. To drive home the message that Waters had left the band, the inner gatefold featured a group photograph â of just Gilmour and Mason â shot by David Bailey. Its inclusion marked the first time since 1971's "Meddle" that a group photo had been used in the artwork of a Pink Floyd album. Richard Wright was represented only by name, on the credit list, although he also appears in photographs included in later reissues. 
"A Momentary Lapse of Reason" was released in the UK and US on 7Â September 1987. It went straight to number three in both countries, held from the top spot by Michael Jackson's "Bad" and Whitesnake's self-titled album.
