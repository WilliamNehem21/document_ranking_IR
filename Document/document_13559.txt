The dedication remains inside St Andrew's Church in Mells. The Horner family had a long relationship with the congregation, which imparts a divider to the villa. The family has its very own house of prayer (once in the past the Lady Chapel) in the congregation which contains the tombs of a few relatives. Toward the finish of the nineteenth century, the Horners financed broad reclamation work to the structure. The commemoration is a bronze equestrian statue, etched by Munnings, including Edward Horner as a youthful mounted force officer, exposed headed and situated on horseback with his sword and protective cap connected to the seat. The statue initially confronted a recolored glass window including a Madonna and Child, making the picture of Horner riding towards the light. It remains on a Portland stone plinth planned by Lutyens, reminiscent of his Cenotaph and depicted by Lutyens' biographer Jane Ridley as "misleadingly basic". The transitory remembrance cross, which initially denoted Horner's grave in France, recorded , is set into the back of the plinth while the Horner family's ensign is formed into the front. The south (left) side bears the engraving , while the north (right) side peruses , from Percy Bysshe Shelley's "AdonaÃÂ¯s" (1821), an epitaph for John Keats.
