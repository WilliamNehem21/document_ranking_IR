The coat comprised of an external layer of long, coarse "protect hair", which was on the upper piece of the body, up to long on the flanks and underside, and in width, and a denser inward layer of shorter, somewhat wavy under-fleece, up to long and in distance across. The hairs on the upper leg were up to long, and those of the feet were long, achieving the toes. The hairs on the head were moderately short, yet longer on the underside and the sides of the storage compartment. The tail was stretched out by coarse hairs up to long, which were thicker than the watchman hairs. The wooly mammoth likely shed regularly, and the heaviest hide was shed amid spring. Since mammoth remains were bound to be protected, perhaps just the winter coat has been safeguarded in solidified examples. Present day elephants have considerably less hair, however adolescents have a more broad covering of hair than grown-ups. Correlation between the over-hairs of wooly mammoths and surviving elephants demonstrate that they didn't vary much in general morphology. Wooly mammoths had various sebaceous organs in their skin, which discharged oils into their hair; this would have improved the fleece's protection, repulsed water, and given the hide a lustrous sheen.
