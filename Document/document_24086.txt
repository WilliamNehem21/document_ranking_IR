The original "Meat Boy" is an Adobe Flash game created by Edmund McMillen and programmed by Jonathan McEntee. The game was developed over a three-week period, and was released on Newgrounds on October 5, 2008. By April 2009, it had garnered over 840,000 views at Newgrounds, and 8 million overall. A map pack for the Flash version was released on December 8, 2008. McMillen began development of "Super Meat Boy" after Nintendo and Microsoft requested that he make a game for their download services, WiiWare and Xbox Live Arcade, as they were impressed by the success of his Flash games "Aether" and "Meat Boy". At the time, he was working with Tommy Refenes on a Flash game titled "Grey Matter". Although McMillen initially pitched the companies a sequel to "Gish" or "Aether", the pair decided to form Team Meat and work on an expanded version of "Meat Boy" instead. Team Meat also includes soundtrack composer Danny Baranowsky and sound effects designer Jordan Fehr. According to the developers, "Super Meat Boy" is "a big throwback to a lot of super hardcore NES classics like "Ghosts'n Goblins", "Mega Man", and the Japanese version of """, with the plot written as "a mash-up of every videogame story from the early 90s". The game was explicitly designed by the team to be reminiscent of "Super Mario Bros.", and McMillen considered it a tribute to Shigeru Miyamoto, the developer of "Super Mario Bros."
