Beneath about , Scott could see nothing of the surface in light of the amounts of lunar residue being dislodged by "Bird of prey's" exhaust. "Hawk" had a bigger motor ringer than past LMs, to a limited extent to suit a heavier burden, and the significance of closing down the motor at introductory contact instead of hazard "blowback", the fumes reflecting off the lunar surface and returning into the motor (potentially causing a blast) had been urged the space travelers by mission organizers. In this way, when Irwin called "Contact", demonstrating that one of the tests on the arrival leg augmentations had contacted the surface, Scott quickly stopped the motor, giving the lander a chance to fall the rest of the separation to the surface. Effectively moving descending at about every second, "Bird of prey" dropped from a stature of . Scott's speed brought about what was likely the hardest lunar arriving of any of the kept an eye on missions, at about every second, causing a surprised Irwin to shout "Bam!" Scott had landed "Hawk" on the edge of a little cavity he couldn't see, and the lander settled back at an edge of 6.9 degrees and to one side of 8.6 degrees. Irwin depicted it in his life account as the hardest landing he had ever been in, and he expected that the specialty would continue spilling, driving a quick prematurely end.
