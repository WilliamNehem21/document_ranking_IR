Lester's dreams are underscored by moderate and dull movement shots; Mendes utilizes twofold and-triple reductions in a few successions, and the score modifies to make the group of onlookers mindful that it is entering a dream. One model is the exercise center sceneÃ¢ÂÂLester's first experience with Angela. While the team promoters play out their half-time routine to "On Broadway", Lester turns out to be progressively focused on Angela. Time eases back to speak to his "voyeuristic trance" and Lester starts to fantasize that Angela's execution is for only him. "On Broadway"Ã¢ÂÂ which gives a customary underscore to the onscreen activityÃ¢ÂÂis supplanted by dissonant, percussive music that needs tune or movement. This nondiegetic score is imperative to making the account stasis in the succession; it passes on a minute for Lester that is extended to an uncertain length. The impact is one that Stan Link compares to "vertical time", portrayed by the arranger and music scholar Jonathan Kramer as music that bestows "a solitary present extended into a gigantic span, a possibly boundless 'now' that in any case feels like a moment". The music is utilized like a viewable sign, so that Lester and the score are gazing at Angela. The arrangement closes with the unexpected reintroduction of "On Broadway" and teleological time.
