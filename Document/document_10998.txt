In October 1888 Lang was chosen to an All Souls Fellowship, and started to separate his time among London and Oxford. A portion of his Oxford companions were preparing for appointment and Lang was regularly drawn into their talks. In the long run the inquiry entered Lang's brain: "Is there any good reason why you shouldn't be appointed?" The idea persevered, and one Sunday evening in mid 1889, after a visit to the philosophical school at Cuddesdon, Lang went to night administration at the Cuddesdon area church. By his own record, amid the lesson he was held by "an awesome internal voice" which let him know "You are needed. You are called. You should comply." He quickly disjoined his association with the Bar, revoked his political aspirations and connected for a spot at Cuddesdon College. With the assistance of an All Souls contact, the fundamental advance of his affirmation into the Church of England was directed by the Bishop of Lincoln. Lang's choice to turn into an Anglican and look for appointment frustrated his Presbyterian father, who in any case kept in touch with his child: "What you think, devoutly and gravely, you should do Ã¢ÂÂ you should do Ã¢ÂÂ we will acknowledge."
