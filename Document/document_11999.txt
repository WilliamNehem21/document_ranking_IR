The structure of the front face depends on the general revival of the dead after the Last Judgment. At the top sits God the Father, over two blessed messengers. A little gap at the dimension of their knees demonstrates where a pigeon speaking to the Holy Spirit was initially appended; with Christ underneath, every one of the three people of the Trinity were in this way spoken to. A round-topped compartment ensured by a stone precious stone "window" holds the relic itself and the gathering around Christ. Christ in Judgment is demonstrated situated showing the injuries of his execution, with his feet laying on the globe of the world, and making a gift motion. Similarly as with all the enameled assumes that are as yet surviving, the hair is in gold, the principle robe is in white, and the tissue is in white with hued eyes and lips, a pinch of pink on the cheeks. Behind Christ the heavenly circles are spoken to like a rainbow, or more him fly two blessed messengers holding Instruments of the Passion, including the crown of thistles over his head; behind him a cross in shallow alleviation rises up out of the bended gold foundation. The thistle relic ascends underneath and before him, mounted on an "enormously extensive sapphire".
