Goldsmith was influenced by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of "Star Wars". "When you stop and think about it, space is a very romantic thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, weâre up in the universe. Itâs about discovery and new life [...] itâs really the basic premise of "Star Trek"", he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to rework his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked "Enterprise" by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is the only "Star Trek" film to have a true overture, using "Ilia's Theme" (later re-recorded, as a lyrical version, by Shaun Cassidy as "A Star Beyond Time" with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the "Director's Edition" DVD release. "Star Trek" and "The Black Hole" were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's "Dancer in the Dark").
