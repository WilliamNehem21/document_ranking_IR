Apollonius' problem can also be formulated as the problem of locating one or more points such that the "differences" of its distances to three given points equal three known values. Consider a solution circle of radius "r" and three given circles of radii "r", "r" and "r". If the solution circle is externally tangent to all three given circles, the distances between the center of the solution circle and the centers of the given circles equal , and , respectively. Therefore, differences in these distances are constants, such as ; they depend only on the known radii of the given circles and not on the radius "r" of the solution circle, which cancels out. This second formulation of Apollonius' problem can be generalized to internally tangent solution circles (for which the center-center distance equals the difference of radii), by changing the corresponding differences of distances to sums of distances, so that the solution-circle radius "r" again cancels out. The re-formulation in terms of center-center distances is useful in the solutions below of Adriaan van Roomen and Isaac Newton, and also in hyperbolic positioning or trilateration, which is the task of locating a position from differences in distances to three known points. For example, navigation systems such as LORAN identify a receiver's position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three fixed positions, which correspond to the differences in distances to those transmitters.
