An audit of undergrad flying preparing, appointed by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Ray Funnell, and went for lessening disappointment rates and improving cost-viability, saw the retirement of the CT-4s in December 1992, trailed by the conclusion of No.ÃÂ 1 FTS. The last RAAF flying course finished on 12ÃÂ June 1992, and the last Army pilots' course in December. The school was disbanded on 31ÃÂ January 1993, finishing just about 80 years of military flying preparing at Point Cook, Australia's most established military air base. The event was set apart by a strutting of the Queen's Color and a flypast by six CT-4s before the new CAS, Air Marshal Barry Gration. This was trailed by an administration at the RAAF Chapel of the Holy Trinity overflown by four Winjeels and a Tiger Moth, and later an all-positions feasting in night. Simultaneous with the eliminate of preparing at No.ÃÂ 1 FTS, British Aerospace was contracted to direct flight reviewing at its base in Tamworth, New South Wales. Consequent all-through flight preparing on the Pilatus PC-9 occurred at No.ÃÂ 2 FTS, Pearce. In 1998, British Aerospace was allowed an agreement to supply tri-administration essential flying guidance at the recently framed Australian Defense Force Basic Flying Training School (ADFBFTS) in Tamworth, the primary course initiating in January 1999 on CT-4B Airtrainers, and No.ÃÂ 2 FTS again ended up in charge of cutting edge flying preparing as it were. ADFBFTS in this manner progressed toward becoming, as indicated by the school's head of preparing, "the No.ÃÂ 1 Flying Training School you have when you don't have a No.ÃÂ 1 Flying Training School".
