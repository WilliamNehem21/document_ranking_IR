The tramp mushroom was initially depicted as "Agaricus caperatus" in 1796 by South African mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon, who noted it developed in beech woods. The particular sobriquet "caperatus" is Latin for "wrinkled". Bohemian naturalist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz showed it in his "Naturgetreue Abbildungen und Beschreibungen der essbaren, schÃÂ¤dlichen und verdÃÂ¤chtigen SchwÃÂ¤mme", distributed somewhere in the range of 1831 and 1846. It was exchanged to the family "Cortinarius" by the Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. Later it was exchanged to "Pholiota" in 1874 by French mycologist Claude Casimir Gillet, a position pursued by Italian naturalist Pier Andrea Saccardo. Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten built up the sort "Rozites" in 1879 to oblige the speciesÃ¢ÂÂas "Rozites caperatus"Ã¢ÂÂ based on the mushroom having a twofold cloak; that is, a fractional shroudÃ¢ÂÂthe leftovers of which become a ring on the stipeÃ¢ÂÂjust as an all inclusive cover. It was known as a "Rozites" animal categories for a long time. In the mean time French mycologist Lucien QuÃÂ©let ordered "Pholiota" as a subgenus of "Dryophila" in 1886, bringing about "Dryophila caperata" being added to the species' synonymy. Worthington George Smith put it in his new sort "Togaria" (presently considered an equivalent word of "Agrocybe").
