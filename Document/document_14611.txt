In first experience with 1921's "Men, Women and Boats", one of the principal Crane treasurys, Vincent Starrett noticed the distinction in tone between "The Monster" and the 14 different stories that Crane set in the anecdotal Whilomville. He stated, "The authenticity is difficult; one reddens for humanity. Be that as it may, while this story truly has a place in the volume called "Whilomville Stories", it is appropriately let well enough alone for that arrangement. The Whilomville stories are unadulterated parody, and "The Monster" is a ghastly catastrophe." Critic William M. Morgan noticed the tales' comparative interest with "unadulterated creature spirits" and "implications of childhood", however separated "The Monster" center around "a bigger, increasingly develop, and modernizing network." Paul Sorrentino additionally indicated the style contrasts, taking note of the story's attention on the grown-up characters instead of the kids, just as the general length of the story; at in excess of 21,000 words, it predominates the other Whilomville stories. Be that as it may, there is contradiction among commentators with respect to whether "The Monster" ought to be viewed as a short story or a novella. Crane considered it a "novelette", and the Library of America release alludes to it as a novella.
