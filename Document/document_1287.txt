Blackburn and his child Cary went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in September 1854 to verify an apprenticeship for Cary under noted doctor Samuel D. Net. While they were there, a yellow fever episode hit Fort Washington close Long Island, New York. The civic chairman of New York City solicited Blackburn to help treat unfortunate casualties from the episode; Blackburn acknowledged the welcome and rejected pay for his administrations. When he returned home in November 1856, he discovered his better half Ella, who experienced dropsy and an anxious condition, sickly with a fever. Regardless of Blackburn's endeavors to spare her, Ella Blackburn's condition declined and she kicked the bucket before the month's end. Blackburn was hit with sadness, and companions urged him to visit Europe, as he had regularly talked about doing, to facilitate his distress. He did as such in mid 1857, visiting clinics in England, Scotland, France, and Germany. While in Paris, Blackburn met individual Kentuckian Julia M. Churchill, who was going with her sister and niece. Blackburn and Churchill cut their voyages off, returned home, and were hitched in November 1857. After their wedding trip, the couple relocated to New Orleans in January 1858, and Blackburn continued his therapeutic practice. A concise lyric composed by Blackburn shows that the couple had a little girl named Abby, yet the tyke clearly kicked the bucket as a newborn child, and her introduction to the world and demise dates are obscure.
