Cragh's recuperation started the day after his hanging, yet it was some timeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ one observer said 15 daysÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ before he had the capacity to stand unaided. That he didn't recoup all the more rapidly provided reason to feel ambiguous about the legitimacy of the marvel, as supernatural occurrences should be quick, yet "fractional wonders" could be clarified by the "tepid confidence of the individuals who had made the pledge". Once adequately recuperated, Cragh was gathered to show up at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The minister, William of Codineston, was additionally present. Cragh clarified, "with extraordinary dread and fear" as indicated by the minister, that as he was being taken to the hangman's tree he petitioned Thomas de Cantilupe to spare him. His dread came about because of his worry that he may be executed once more, and he had valid justification to be concerned. Despite the fact that the individuals who endure were normally exonerated, it was not obscure for them to be hanged once more. Between the season of his hanging and his appearance at the mansion Cragh may have persuaded himself that he had been spared by Cantilupe, or he may just have concluded that it would be reasonable for him to oblige the story for his very own wellbeing. Cragh proceeded to guarantee that as he was swinging from the hangman's tree a priest dressed all in white showed up, and spared him either by supporting his feet or by supplanting his tongue in his mouth.
