In 2001 Chrisye discharged the studio collection "Konser Tur 2001" ("Concert Tour 2001"), which included two new tunes and a few old ones. The music video for one of the new melodies, "Setia" ("Loyal"), was questionable inferable from its depiction of a lady in tight attire. Before long a while later, Chrisye chose to cover some of what he considered the most essential Indonesian melodies since the nation's freedom in 1945, going from tunes from the 1940s as marzuki Ismail's "Kr. Pasar Gambir and Stambul Anak Jampang" ("Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the Cowlicked Child"), to the late 1990s, for example, Ahmad Dhani's "Kangen" ("Longing"). It additionally included a tune composed only for the collection by Pongky of Jikustik and two part harmonies with Sophia Latjuba. The collection, "Dekade" ("Decade"), was discharged in 2002; by October 2003 it had sold 350,000 duplicates. On 15 December 2002 Chrisye took an interest in the Bali for the WorldÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Voices of Stars show at Kartika Beach Plaza to raise assets for the casualties of the bombings on 12 October; different acts included Melly Goeslaw, Gigi, Slank, and Superman is Dead. On 12 July 2004 Chrisye held a third show, Dekade, at Plenary Hall. The show, with a set that contained various works of art incorporated into "Dekade", highlighted two part harmonies with Sophia Latjuba and a few of the first entertainers, for example, Fariz RM with "Sakura" and A. Rafiq with "Pengalaman Pertama" ("First Experience"); Gutawa's ensemble again gave the music.
