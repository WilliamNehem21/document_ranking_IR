After repairs and a successful eastbound crossing, "Princess Matoika" had an encounter with an iceberg off Newfoundland while carrying some 2,000Â Italian immigrants on her first return trip from Italy. On the night of 24Â February, the fully laden ship struck what was reported in "The New York Times" as either "an iceberg or a submerged wreck" off Cape Race. The ship's steering gear was damaged in the collision, leaving the ship adrift for over seven hours before repairs were effected. The "Matoika"s captain indicated that no passengers were hurt in the collision. According to the story of one third-class passenger, she, suspecting there was something seriously amiss, made inquiry after the commotion. A crew member told her that the "Matoika" had only stopped to greet a ship passing in the night. When she went on deck, insistent on seeing the other ship herself, she saw the iceberg and observed the first-class passengers queued up to board the already-lowered lifeboats. She took her daughter with her to join one of the queues, and, though initially rebuffed, was allowed to remain. The lifeboats were never deployed, however, and the "Matoika" arrived in Boston, where she had been diverted due to a typhus scare, on 28Â February without further incident.
