In a letter devoting the new musical show to Queen Anne, Hill composed of his decision of story: "I couldn't chuse a better Subject than the praised story of Rinaldo and Armida". He had, be that as it may, worked out "a Poet's Privilege", to render Tasso's work reasonable for the stage. This "benefit" moved the musical show's story far from Tasso's unique. Slope developed another champion, Almirena, to furnish the principle love enthusiasm with the legend Rinaldo, and the connection among Rinaldo and Armida barely figures in the musical drama. In like manner, the issue among Argante and Armida is Hill's creation, similar to the changes to Christianity, the last potentially a sop to English susceptibilities.

Cost likewise indicates the feasible effects on the structure of "Rinaldo" from two British semi-musical dramasÃ¢ÂÂGeorge Granville's "The British Enchanters", and Purcell's "Top dog Arthur". The changes of characters to others' shapes, Price fights, is likely gotten from John Dryden's play "Amphitryon".
