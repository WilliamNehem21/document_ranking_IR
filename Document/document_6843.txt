Bolikango first traveled to another country when he went to Kethulle de Ryhove's burial service in Belgium in 1956. Amid his arrival trip he halted in Paris to meet African individuals from the French Parliament. That year he met a bunch of his previous understudies and other Congolese pioneers in his home. Together they drafted the main Congolese political proclamation, "Manifeste de Conscience Africaine". In 1958 he left his showing post and went to Brussels to speak to Catholic instruction at the Expo 58 occasion, holding obligation regarding advertising at the Missions Pavilion. This drove him to think about press, radio, TV, film, and mass instruction procedures at the Office of Information and Public Relations for the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi. In August 1959 he was designated Assistant Commissioner of Information in the workplace, making him one of just two Congolese to ever hold a second grade government employee position in the Belgian pioneer organization. In that limit he started a relative investigation of data benefits crosswise over Sub-Saharan Africa, accumulated subtleties on Congolese government officials, gave various discourses, and helped plan Bantu language courses at the University of Ghent. He normally composed for the LÃÂ©opoldville month to month "La Voix du Congolais" and the Catholic paper "La Croix du Congo". In 1960 Bolikango began his own paper, "La Nation Congalaise". In his commitments he regularly upheld for equivalent pay among dark and whites for a similar work.
