Pitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film "A River Runs Through It", directed by Robert Redford. His portrayal of the character was described by "People"s Janet Mock as a career-making performance, proving that Pitt could be more than a "cowboy-hatted hunk." He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his "weakest performancesÂ ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for." Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying "when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better." In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film "Kalifornia". He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's character in a performance described by Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" as "outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace." Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit "True Romance" as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film. He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.
