Other than the philosophy upheld by their religious heads, the general population of Plymouth Colony had a solid confidence in the powerful. Richard Greenham was a Puritan scholar whose works were known to the Plymouth inhabitants, and he guided widely against swinging to enchantment or wizardry to take care of issues. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in almost every catastrophe that happened to them; the dull enchanted expressions were genuine and present for them. They put stock within the sight of noxious spirits who conveyed mishap to individuals. For instance, in 1660, a court investigation into the suffocating passing of Jeremiah Burroughs discovered that a had kayak was to be faulted. Massachusetts Bay Colony encountered a flare-up of black magic unnerves in the seventeenth century, however there is little proof that Plymouth was immersed in anything comparable. Black magic was recorded as a capital wrongdoing in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, yet there were no real feelings of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records just show two formal allegations of black magic. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to preliminary. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, brought about preliminary and vindication.
