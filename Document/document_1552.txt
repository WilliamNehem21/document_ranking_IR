The most punctual rearing of the predecessors of the Cleveland Bay was done in huge part by English holy places and religious communities, to address an issue for pack ponies to convey exchange products among convents and cloisters in upper east England. These medieval steeds picked up the epithet of "Chapman Horses" in view of their utilization by voyaging vendors known as "chapmen". What is presently the Cleveland Bay was created from Barb and Andalusian ponies crossed with Chapman Horse female horses. The Barb blood came for the most part from ponies imported by well off young fellows on their Grand Tour of Europe, paid off the docks in Marseilles and transported back to England. The Andalusian blood originated from steeds reproduced at the regal stud in Cordoba and given to English eminence by the King of Spain. The stallions were frequently accessible for rearing to neighborhood ponies, and the primary mixture of Andalusian blood was added to the local Chapman Horses. The Spanish steeds likewise advanced toward the peripheral homes of English honorability, and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell's men after the English Civil War. Once in the hands of Cromwell's men, a significant number of the stallions were made accessible for local people to cross with the current Chapman Horses, including a second imbuement of Andalusian bloodlines. In the late seventeenth century a second mixture of Barb blood was included when Cleveland reproducers bought steeds legitimately from warriors at Tangier or from the Moors themselves.
