In the Fall 1996 issue of "Raritan Quarterly Review", Stephen D. Cox, freely admitting to never having read the book, nonetheless called Terhune a "hack writer" who lacked "storytelling skill" and denounced "Lad: A Dog" as non-literature with "sentences [that] are insufferably stilted and hammy" and "have a tendency to wander off on long romps with his personal obsessions." Terming it a "socially interesting" work, he concedes that the novel has maintained "intense and long-lasting" interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and "desire to have a collie dog." He quotes Irving Litvag, author of Terhune's biography "The Master of Sunnybank", stating that Lad "became the dog we always wanted to have and never did. Maybe even more than thatâmaybe he became the friend we always waited to find, or even the brother, or the father." In "You're Only Young Twice: Children's Literature and Film", Timothy Morris felt the novel had "dated badly" due to changes in American society, and while he stated that he enjoyed the work, in comparing it to Anna Sewell's "Black Beauty" he faults "Lad: A Dog" for lacking an "autobiographical frame" and for leaving readers guessing as to what is happening.
