The Italian history specialist Carlo Ginzburg has been refered to as being eager to give "some slight help" to Murray's hypothesis. Ginzburg expressed that in spite of the fact that her proposal had been "defined in a completely uncritical manner" and contained "genuine imperfections", it contained "a portion of truth". He expressed his conclusion that she was directly in asserting that European black magic had "establishes in an antiquated fruitfulness religion", something that he contended was vindicated by his work looking into the "benandanti", an agrarian visionary convention recorded in the Friuli locale of Northeastern Italy amid the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of years. A few students of history and folklorists have called attention to that Ginzburg's contentions are altogether different to Murray's: while Murray contended for the presence of a pre-Christian witches' faction whose individuals physically met amid the witches' Sabbaths, Ginzburg contended that a portion of the European visionary conventions that were conflated with black magic in the Early Modern time frame had their inceptions in pre-Christian fruitfulness religions. Also, different history specialists have communicated analysis of Ginzburg's translation of the "benandanti"; Cohn expressed that there was "not much" in the source material to legitimize the possibility that the "benandanti" were the "survival of a deep rooted fruitfulness faction". Resounding these perspectives, Hutton remarked that Ginzburg's case that the "benandanti" visionary customs were a survival from pre-Christian practices was a thought laying on "blemished material and reasonable establishments". He included that Ginzburg's "supposition" that "what was being imagined about in the sixteenth century had in actuality been carried on in religious functions" dating to "agnostic occasions", was totally "a deduction of his own" and not one upheld by the narrative proof.
