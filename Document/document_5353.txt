In the late evening of 7 November 1976, three agitators from a gathering of seven were spotted by an Army perception post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, simply south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland area. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians prepared themselves to fly out by helicopter and connect with the guerrillas. There were eight four-man "stops" associated with a Fireforce, and on this event Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb kept running over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the pioneer of Stop 3, and yelled over the clamor of the air ship. "They will get me this time," he hollered, harshly; "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" Kaye and his MAG heavy weapons specialist, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this remark and advised Lamb to get going. "Go nail gooks!" Kaye called after Lamb as he and the remainder of Stop 2 took off on board their Alouette III gunship. Sheep's men were a 18-year-old national administration MAG heavy weapons specialist of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian normal who conveyed a FN FAL fight rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, matured 28 and furthermore outfitted with a FN. Sheep conveyed the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL prepared in his grasp.
