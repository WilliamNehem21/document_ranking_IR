Andros first got a notice of the approaching change to his control while driving an endeavor to strengthen Pemaquid (Bristol, Maine), aiming to secure the territory against French and Indian assaults. Toward the beginning of January 1688/9, he got a letter from King James depicting the Dutch military development. On January 10, he issued an announcement cautioning against Protestant tumult and forbidding an uprising against the domain. The military power that he drove in Maine was made out of British regulars and volunteer army from Massachusetts and Maine. The civilian army organizations were directed by regulars who forced unforgiving order that distanced the minute men from their officers. Andros was cautioned to the gatherings in Boston and furthermore gotten informal reports of the upheaval, and he came back to Boston in mid-March. Talk coursed that he had accepted the civilian army to Maine as a component of an alleged "popish plot;" the Maine volunteer army mutinied, and those from Massachusetts started to advance home. A decree reporting the insurgency achieved Boston toward the beginning of April; Andros had the emissary captured, yet his news was dispersed, encouraging the general population. Andros kept in touch with his leader at Pemaquid on April 16 that "there is a general humming among the general population, extraordinary with desire for their old contract", even as he arranged to have the returning cowards captured and transported back to Maine. The danger of captures by their own frontier state army expanded pressures between the general population of Boston and the territory government.
