The music, Lang says, streams "beguilingly" from the extensive suggestion; the calmer, enthusiastic sections are shown reminiscently, while in the more fantastic minutes Handel's imaginative utilization of metal is energizing and rousing. The unexpected impact of trumpets which declares the Act 3 March gives, state Dean and Knapp, "an impact of magnificence and elation that time has not diminished". The harpsichord performances which enrich "Vo' far guerra" in Act 2 were initially extemporized on the console by Handel amid exhibitions, and were amazingly prevalent. They were recollected and recorded by William Babell, and distributed later as isolated pieces. Lang trusts that regardless of the borrowings, and the rushed way in which the work was assembled, "Rinaldo" is one of Handel's extraordinary musical shows. As per Dean and Knapp, no Italian musical show heard in London to that point had been bolstered by such "lofty" symphonic powers. Pundit Anthony Hicks depicts the music, in general, as both "differed and phenomenal". Dignitary and Knapp's decision is progressively dubious. The music for the war and display scenes, they state, is "splendidly fruitful", however in portraying the scenes worried about enchantment, Handel comes up short; they recommend it was not until more than 15 years after the fact, with "Admeto" and "Orlando", that he had the capacity to speak to the powerful convincingly in music.
