On October 19, the Martin Company was about further east, making its last intersection of the North Platte River close present-day Casper, Wyoming. Not long after finishing the intersection, the snow squall struck. Numerous individuals from the organization experienced hypothermia or frostbite in the wake of swimming through the freezing stream. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unfit to proceed ahead through the snow. In the interim, the first exploring gathering proceeded with eastbound until it achieved a little empty fortress at Devil's Gate, where they had been told to sit tight for the remainder of the salvage party on the off chance that they had not discovered the Martin Company. At the point when the primary salvage party rejoined them, another exploring party comprising of Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Daniel Webster Jones was sent forward. The Martin organization stayed in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts at last touched base on October 28. When the scouts arrived, 56 individuals from the organization had kicked the bucket. The scouts encouraged the wanderers to start moving once more. Amid this interim, the gathering was fortunately met by Ephraim Hanks, bringing meat from an as of late butchered bison, likely sparing numerous lives as the nutritive estimation of the protein and fat in the meat was a lot higher than that of the depleted flour supplies, and so on. He likewise performed numerous favors and aided in certain removals, and so on to stop the movement of the frostbite and gangrene that would have generally slaughtered more individuals from the organization. After three days the fundamental salvage party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon organizations and helped them on to Devil's Gate.
