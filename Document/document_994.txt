In 1973, Roberts distributed "Tito, MihailoviÃÂ, and the Allies, 1941Ã¢ÂÂ 1945" which included data about the GermanÃ¢ÂÂ Partisan exchanges of March 1943. The distributing of the book irritated the Yugoslav government, which held up an objection with the US Department of State. The push of the Yugoslav protest was that the book compared the Partisans with the Chetniks. Roberts denied this, expressing his book did not compare the two or acknowledge the Partisan folklore of the Partisans as a "freedom development" or the Chetniks as "traitorous colleagues". The book likewise distinguished ÃÂilas as the primary mediator. In 1977, ÃÂilas affirmed his contribution in his book "Wartime", yet expressed that he would not have revealed the subtleties of the arrangements on the off chance that it had not as of now been known through Roberts' book. In 1978, Tito conceded that the arrangements happened, yet described their motivation as "exclusively to acquire German acknowledgment of hostile status for the Partisans". In 1985, after Tito's passing, LekoviÃÂ had the capacity to distribute the aftereffects of his examination that had begun in 1967, in "Martovski pregovori 1943" (The March Negotiations 1943). In 1989, PopoviÃÂ gave his variant of occasions in Aleksandar NenadoviÃÂ's "Razgovori s KoÃÂom" (Conversations with KoÃÂa), trailed by Velebit in Mira ÃÂ uvar's "Vladimir Velebit: svjedok historije" (Vladimir Velebit: Witness to History) in 2001, and in his own "Tajne I zamke Drugog svjetskog rata" (Secrets and Traps of the Second World War) the next year.
