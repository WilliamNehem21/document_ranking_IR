Sandringham House has not been respected by pundits. Its central blame is the absence of agreement between Humbert's unique structure and Edis' augmentations, "a differentiation between the northern and southern parts of the house (that) has been quite condemned from that point forward". The engineering antiquarian John Martin Robinson wrote in 1982, "Sandringham, the most recent in date of the places of the British government, is the least recognized structurally". In his life story of Queen Mary, James Pope-Hennessy contrasted the house horribly with "a golf-lodging at St Andrews or a station-inn at Strathpeffer". Simon Jenkins considered Sandringham "ugly", with a "bleak, institutional appearance". Pevsner portrayed the structural style as "excited"; Girouard conveyed what needs be confounded with regards to the inclination appeared by the imperial family for A. J. Humbert, a support the essayist Adrian Tinniswood portrayed as "the Victorian Royal Family's skill for picking below average engineers". An article on the house in the June 1902 version of "Nation Life" opined, "of minor wonder there isn't much, yet of considerable solace a decent arrangement". The author Clive Aslet proposes that the wearing open doors offered by the home were the principle fascination for its regal proprietors, instead of "the house itself, which even subsequent to reconstructing was never boggling".
