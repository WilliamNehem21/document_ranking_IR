By this time, the "Waffen-SS" numbered just under 125,000, of whom more than 40,000 originated from post-Anschluss Austria and other areas outside the pre-1933 borders of Germany. In April 1940, the Germans had invaded and occupied Denmark and Norway, opening up a source of "Nordic" or "Germanic" recruits, which Berger was quick to exploit. After the invasion of France and the Low Countries, the resulting regiment, "SS-Nordland", was joined by a Dutch-Belgian-Flemish regiment, "SS-Westland". At the same time as they were recruiting for these "Germanic" regiments, Berger's delegates were also focusing on gaining ethnic German volunteers from outside the Reich, men not subject to the Wehrmacht-controlled draft. In May, more than 1,000 Romanian "Volksdeutsche" had been recruited, with the help of Andreas Schmidt, Berger's son-in-law and the political leader of the Romanian "Volksdeutsche". Three weeks after the invasion of Belgium, Berger was appointed as the president of the German-sponsored pro-Nazi Belgian political party, "DeVlag". Berger also worked to bring the Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche" under the influence of the SS, which he was able to achieve six months prior to the invasion of that country by the Axis in April 1941. Berger's recruiting work with the Flemish and Croatian communities was facilitated by his chairmanship of both the "Deutsche-FlÃ¤mischen Studiengruppe" (German-Flemish Studies Group) and the "Deutsche-Kroatischen Gesellschaft" (German-Croatian Society).
