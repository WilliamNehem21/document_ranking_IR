Hancock's underlying postings subsequent to qualifying as a pilot were to Nos.ÃÂ 1 and 3 Squadrons. It was, in any case, basic practice for Duntroon graduates to be given staff positions in the Air Force on account of their preparation in organization, and Hancock was no special case. He burned through the greater part of the 1930s in a progression of posts at RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. From 1931 to 1935, he filled in as Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence. He wedded Joan Butler on 26ÃÂ May 1932; the couple had two children and a little girl. By 1935, Hancock had been elevated to flight lieutenant and delegated Staff Officer to the Chief of the Air Staff. In 1937 he was presented on Britain to go to the RAF Staff College, Andover. Like other Commonwealth flying corps, the RAAF kept up close innovative and instructive ties with the Royal Air Force, and Hancock was one of 30 Australian officers to go through Andover before the episode of World WarÃÂ II. Coming back to Australia in 1938, he was elevated to squadron pioneer and moved toward becoming Director of Works and Buildings, regularly known as "Works and Bricks", at RAAF Headquarters.
