One of his first difficulties was to make a bureau palatable to all groups; this he did by barring the pioneers everything being equal. He himself took the arrangement of Public Works and Provincial Treasurer. Charles R. Mitchell, who like Sifton had been a judge amid the outrage and had as needs be had no impact in it, progressed toward becoming Minister of Education and Attorney-General. Archibald J. McLean was named Provincial Secretary. His help for the radicals (however not as one of their pioneers) was counterbalanced by the continuation of Rutherford's Agriculture Minister Duncan Marshall, who had assumed no specific job amid the embarrassment yet had stayed faithful to Rutherford. To the frustration of the restriction Conservatives, Bulyea prorogued the enactment before this new government's quality could be tried by a demonstration of positive support. In any case, its acknowledgment by the Liberal assembly can be estimated by the way that just a single part, Ezra Riley, surrendered in dissent. Riley questioned the prohibition from bureau of insurrection pioneer W. H. Cushing; after his renunciation he kept running as an autonomous Liberal in the following by-decision, however was crushed by Sifton supporter Archibald J. McArthur. As time mended old injuries, Sifton extended his bureau to incorporate a few of the old foes: in February 1912 Cross was re-instated as Attorney-General and agitator pioneer John R. Boyle was made Minister of Education (Mitchell, who had recently held both of these posts, was exchanged to the Public Works portfolio). The other new increases to bureauÃ¢ÂÂMalcolm McKenzie as Provincial Treasurer and Charles Stewart in the new position of Minister of Municipal AffairsÃ¢ÂÂhad casted a ballot with the Rutherford government amid the outrage.
