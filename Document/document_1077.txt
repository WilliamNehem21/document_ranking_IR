Diversion designers including Shigeru Miyamoto (maker of the establishments "Jackass Kong", "Super Mario," and "The Legend of Zelda"), Hideo Kojima ("Metal Gear"), and John Romero and John Carmack (both "Fate)" have refered to "Space Invaders" as first experience with computer games. Miyamoto considers "Space Invaders" to be the amusement that reformed the computer game industry. "Deus Ex" maker Warren Spector stated: ""Space Invaders" and diversions like it speak to the underlying foundations of all that we see today in gaming. It speaks to the introduction of another work of art, one that truly changed the world. "Space Invaders" is critical as a recorded curio, no not exactly the quiet movies of the mid twentieth century or early printed books." Several productions attributed the extension of the computer game industry from a curiosity into a worldwide industry to the achievement of the diversion. "Edge" magazine ascribed the move of diversions from bars and beguilement arcades to more standard areas, for example, eateries and retail chains, to "Space Invaders". Its prominence was to such an extent that it was the primary amusement where an arcade machine's proprietor could compensate for the expense of the machine in less than one month, or in certain spots inside multi week.
