After the Russian triumph against Sweden in 1743, the Swedes set up a commission to distinguish shortcomings in the eastern safeguards. In 1747, the commission presumed that the strongholds in southeastern Finland should have been improved and extended, and that Sweden expected to assemble a solid beach front naval force. Augustin EhrensvÃÂ¤rd (1710Ã¢ÂÂ 72), a big guns officer, was the main thrust behind these changes. The board of trustees based huge numbers of its decisions and choices on his thoughts. In 1756, Sweden set up the archipelago armada with the official name "armÃÂ©ns flotta" ("armada of the military") under the direction of the military division, Krigskollegium, with EhrensvÃÂ¤rd as incomparable officer. For two decades, the battle for power between the Hats and the Caps, the predominant political groups at the time, and competitions among armed force and naval force achieved changes to the archipelago armada. The parliamentary triumph of the Hats in the Riksdag in 1769Ã¢ÂÂ 70 and the overthrow d'ÃÂ¨tat by King Gustav III in 1772 verified the archipelago armada's status as a free part of the military. Beginning in 1770, the archipelago armada converged with the Finnish Squadron ("Finska eskadern") based at Sveaborg. In 1777, it joined the Swedish Squadron ("Svenska eskadern"), the cookroom armada based at Stockholm. The Swedish military put extensive assets in the new armed force branch and made it an expert, autonomous association. The archipelago armada pulled in individuals from the social and social world class who appreciated the assurance and support of King Gustav III, who had built up himself as an outright ruler in the 1772 upset.
