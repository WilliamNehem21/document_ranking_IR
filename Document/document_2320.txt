After VE Day, the Churchills originally came back to Chartwell on 18 May 1945, to be welcomed by what the horticulturalist and patio nursery student of history Stefan Buczacki depicts as, "the greatest group Westerham had ever observed". In any case, military triumph was quickly trailed by political thrashing as Churchill lost the June 1945 general race. He very quickly traveled to another country, while Clementine returned to Chartwell to start the long procedure of opening up the house for his arrival Ã¢ÂÂ "it will be beautiful when the lake cover is no more". Soon thereafter, Churchill again offered idea to selling Chartwell, worried by the cost of running the bequest. A gathering of companions, sorted out by Lord Camrose, raised the entirety of ÃÂ£55,000 which was passed to the National Trust enabling it to purchase the house from Churchill for the aggregate of ÃÂ£43,800. The abundance gave an enrichment. The deal was finished on 29 November. For installment of a lease of ÃÂ£350 per annum, in addition to rates, the Churchills focused on a 50-year rent, enabling them to inhabit Chartwell until their demises, so, all in all the property would return to the National Trust. Churchill recorded his appreciation in a letter to Camrose in December 1945, "I feel how insufficient my thanks have been, my dear Bill, who (...) never faltered in your fellowship amid throughout the entire these and turbulent years".
