On 9 July 1916, the scout cruiser , "54 T", "73 F" and another torpedo pontoon assaulted the Otranto Barrage, the Allied maritime barricade of the Strait of Otranto, which brought about the sinking of two vagabonds, and harm to two more. After ten days, "65 F" and "66 F" sank the Italian submarine "Balilla" off Lissa. On 8 October, "68 F" experienced the Italian off San Giovanni di Medua, yet after a concise pursue had the capacity to achieve the front of a shore battery. On 16 November 1917, "61 T" and "65 F" were a piece of a minesweeping power supporting the siege of an Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo close to the mouth of the Piave. All pontoons were expected to have their rearward torpedo tube supplanted by a solitary ÃÂ koda L/30 hostile to airplane firearm in late 1918, however it isn't evident whether this really happened. "52 T" steered into the rocks close Split in December 1918. Following World War I, the "Kaiman"- class water crafts were apportioned to Great Britain, Italy and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). Extraordinary Britain and Italy rejected their vessels, yet the Yugoslavs held "54 T", "60 T", "61 T" and "69 F" as "T12", "T9", "T10" and "T11" individually. Every one of the four were disposed of and separated somewhere in the range of 1928 and 1930.
