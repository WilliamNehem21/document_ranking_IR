Murdoch was favored to the Department of Defense in January 1956 as Deputy Secretary (Military). By February 1958, he had been made a substantive air bad habit marshal and delegated Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. In October 1959, Murdoch was presented on London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff, and delegated a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1960 New Year Honors. He came back to Australia in June 1962, when he moved toward becoming AOC Operational Command. His residency in the position matched with the sending of the first RAAF flying machine to South Vietnam, seven DHC-4 Caribous, starting in August 1964. Murdoch was advanced air marshal and designated Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) on 1ÃÂ June 1965, succeeding Air Marshal Sir Valston Hancock. He was the remainder of a group of four of armed force prepared CASs; from 1954 to 1969 comprehensive, each RAAF bossÃ¢ÂÂJohn McCauley, Scherger, Hancock, and MurdochÃ¢ÂÂhad been a cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, before presenting with the Air Force. With this family, Murdoch was portrayed via Air Chief Marshal Scherger as "the remainder of the experts". The new CAS was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1966 Queen's Birthday Honors.
