The game received widespread acclaim from critics upon release. It was referred to by "GameFan" as "quite possibly the greatest game ever made", a quote selected for the back cover of the game's jewel case. GameSpot commented that "never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in "Final Fantasy VII"," expressing particular favor toward the game's graphics, audio, and story. IGN's Jay Boor insisted the game's graphics were "light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation", and regarded its battle system as its strongest point. "Computer and Video Games"s Alex C praised the dramatic story and well-developed characters. "Edge" noted that "Final Fantasy VII" had come close to being an interactive movie in playable form, praising its combination of a complex story that went against Western graphic adventures trends and "excellently orchestrated chip music". RPGamer praised the game's soundtrack, both in variety and sheer volume, stating that "Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well" and saying that it was potentially his best work. "Final Fantasy VII" has received some negative criticism. "Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine" ("OPM") and GameSpot questioned the game's linear progression. "OPM" considered the game's translation "a bit muddy" and felt the summon animations were "repetitive." RPGamer cited its translation as "packed with typos and other errors which further obscure what is already a very confusing plot." "GamePro" also considered the Japanese-to-English translation a significant weakness in the game, and IGN regarded the ability to use only three characters at a time as "the game's only shortcoming."
