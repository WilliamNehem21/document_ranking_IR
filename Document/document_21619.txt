On 4 March, Diá»m held a review of the VNAF in central Saigon. Large crowds flocked to the banks of the Saigon River to watch formations of VNAF aircraft on aerial parade, although everyday civilians were not allowed within a block of the presidential box, where Diá»m was accompanied by Nolting and General Paul D. Harkins, head of the US military mission to Vietnam. The display included 29 of the aircraft used to attack Independence Palace. Diá»m spoke about the events of 27 February and noted that he was "not unaware" of the supportive reaction of the various segments of society to "the foolish act perpetrated by some treacherous elements" that had "tried to rouse bloody troubles which would have profited only enemies of the fatherland". He said that the bombing was "merely an isolated action off a few insane traitors to the fatherland and to the people, while the entire air force, like the rest of the armed forces, demonstrated unfaltering loyalty and an unwavering spirit of national unity by rapidly and effectively countering the aggression of two criminals". He described that attack as "the odious act of renegades" and called upon the VNAF "to remain always vigilant, to turn away from all temptations, to scorn all perfidious schemes and to place the higher interest of the fatherland above personal interest". In response, the VNAF chief Vinh, asked Diá»m for "forgiveness and clemency" and presented a plaque inscribed with a resolution from the VNAF condemning attack.
