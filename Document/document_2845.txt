Tom Hall declared that "Ananchronox" would include a "fierce story with a crazy ride of feeling", and guaranteed it would convey identity and silliness to the pretending sort. Corridor planned to make a sincerely holding, true to life experience from the earliest starting point: "I need this amusement to respond to the inquiry, 'Can a PC make you cry?' I need to make the characters so warm and agreeable and adorable and recognizable... I need to begin them off for the sake of entertainment circumstances, yet as the amusement goes on, I need the climate to get darker and darker. Companions sell out the lead character, different companions bite the dust, and you will feel some of what they feel since you have been with these individuals for 50 hours, and as it were, lived some portion of their lives with them." Hall commented that the characters were aspects of his adolescence. He later looked at the name "Anachronox" (which means poison from an earlier time) and the inside battles of each character, brought about by tempestuous occasions in their pasts and "clairvoyant toxic substance." Hall meant to include astounding heading and camera-work in "Anachronox", reminiscent of epic true to life subjects in pretending computer games like the "Last Fantasy" establishment. Corridor enrolled maker Jake Hughes to coordinate cut scenes; Hughes had recently chipped away at a few short free movies. Designers utilized continuous diversion cutscenes rather than real to life cinematics to maintain a strategic distance from "[taking] players out of the amusement." Hall commented, "Every one of these recreations change to cutscenes that look five hundred times superior to the diversion. The mystery isn't to let the cutscenes kick the diversion's butt."
