In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-directed romantic drama "Hamari Adhuri Kahani". Penned by Mahesh Bhatt, the film tells the story of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of "Mid Day" commented that Vidya "has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do". Vidya next took on the part of a police officer in "Te3n" (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film "Montage", co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She identified with her character's "silent aggression" and drawn to the idea of playing a character who commands respect. NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya "is reliably solid each time she's on screen, raising her brow, curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for "Ekk Albela", a Marathi language biopic of Bhagwan Dada.
