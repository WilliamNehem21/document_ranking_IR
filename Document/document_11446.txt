From 1942 onwards, HergÃÂ© started redrawing and shading his prior "Tintin" experiences for Casterman, yet decided not to do as such for "Tintin in the Land of the Soviets", considering its story excessively unrefined. Humiliated by it, he marked it a "transgression of [his] youth". Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier trusted that another factor in his choice may have been the story's destructively against Marxist subject, which would have been disagreeable in the midst of developing West European feelings toward Marxism following the Second World War. In an article talking about HergÃÂ©'s work which was distributed in the magazine "Jeune Afrique" ("Young Africa") in 1962, it was noticed that in spite of the way that aficionados of his work visited the BibliothÃÂ¨que Nationale to peruse the duplicate of "Place where there is the Soviets" that was held there, it "will never (and with great motivation) be republished". In 1961, HergÃÂ© composed a letter to Casterman recommending that the first form of the story be republished in a volume containing a distributer's notice about its substance. Louis-Robert Casterman answered with a letter in which he expressed that while the subject had been talked about inside the organization, "There are more reluctant or emphatically negative feelings than there are energetic ones. Whatever the case, you can rest guaranteed that the issue is in effect effectively considered".
