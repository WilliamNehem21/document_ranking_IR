Unwin and Martill proposed in 2007 that thalassodromids may have rummaged comparably to storks, as had been recommended for azhdarchids. Witton said in 2013 that albeit skim-nourishing had been proposed for some, pterosaur gatherings, the thought was condemned as of late; pterosaurs needed for all intents and purposes all adjustments for skim-encouraging, making it far-fetched that they sustained along these lines. "Thalassodromeus" (in contrast to skimmers) did not have an especially wide or strong skull or particularly vast jaw-muscle connection destinations, and its mandible was nearly short and tubby. Witton concurred with Unwin and Martill that thalassodromids, with their equivalent appendage extents and lengthened jaws, were fit to wandering presently and sustaining artfully; their shorter, progressively adaptable necks demonstrated an alternate way of bolstering than azhdarchids, which had longer, stiffer necks. He recommended that thalassodromids may have had progressively summed up encouraging propensities, and azhdarchids may have been increasingly limited; "Thalassodromeus" may have been exceptional at taking care of generally huge, battling prey than its relative, "Tupuxuara", which had a lighter-manufactured skull. Witton focused on that more investigations of utilitarian morphology would need to be done to light up the subject and guessed that "Thalassodromeus" may have been a raptorial predator, utilizing its jaws to quell prey with solid chomps; its inward sense of taste could enable it to swallow vast prey.
