At 1:30Â pm on 9Â February, Milson led 31 or 32 Beaufighters into the air from Dallachy. The strike force was joined by either ten or twelve P-51 Mustang fighters from No. 65 Squadron RAF and two Warwick air-sea rescue aircraft from No. 279 Squadron RAF carrying life rafts to help any aircrew forced to ditch. All four of the Dallachy Wing's squadrons contributed aircraft to the force. The No. 404 and No. 455 Squadron Beaufighters were armed with "60lb" rockets while the aircraft from No. 144 Squadron and the single No. 489 Squadron Beaufighter dispatched were armed only with their four 20 mm cannon and six machine guns.
After the attackers crossed the Norwegian coastline at 3:40Â pm, two Beaufighters from No.Â 144 and No.Â 489 Squadrons detached themselves from the main force and pressed ahead as outriders. The two 'outriders' crossed FÃ¸rde Fjord near where the German ships had been sighted that morning. At 3:50Â pm they sent Milson a radio message stating that they could not see the ships. The 'outriders' then turned to the east and overflew the town of FÃ¸rde before searching the next fjord to the north; during their flight near FÃ¸rde Fjord they did not spot the German warships in their new position. Meanwhile, the Ninth and Twelfth Squadrons of JG5 were scrambled from Herdla at 3:50Â pm and ordered to attack the Dallachy Wing and its escorts.
