Lieutenant Daniel S "Pat" Judson, conceived in Bulawayo in 1898, turned into the main Rhodesia-conceived aviator in history when he joined the RFC in April 1916. He was seriously injured while shelling foe positions in March 1918, yet recouped and stayed in the unit until April 1919. The main flying pro conceived in Rhodesia was Major George Lloyd, nicknamed "Zulu", who joined No. 60 Squadron in April 1917, and won four elevated triumphs before exchanging to No. 40 Squadron in July 1917, where he won four more. He got the Military Cross in March 1918 for "obvious valor and commitment to obligation", and furthermore won the Air Force Cross soon thereafter. Second Lieutenant David "Tommy" Greswolde-Lewis, a brought up Bulawayan, was the 80th and last pilot crushed by Manfred von Richthofen, the German pro generally known as the Red Baron. Richthofen brought down Lewis simply north-east of Villers-Bretonneux on 20 April 1918; the Rhodesian's air ship burst into flames in mid-air, and when it slammed he was tossed from the destruction. The Baron's projectiles had hit Lewis' compass, goggles, coat and pant leg, however he was for all intents and purposes safe, having endured just minor consumes. He spent the remainder of the war a German detainee.
