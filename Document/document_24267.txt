In 1909, Robert Broom visited the collection of the British Museum of Natural History. He concluded that Owen had mixed the partial distorted skull, teeth, and a mandible of a pareiasaur and a partial upper jaw of a dinosaur, BMNH 47338, which were actually from two different species. Broom kept the name "Anthodon" for the pareiasaur, but identified the other fossil as a member of the genus "Palaeoscincus", naming the new species "Paleoscincus africanus" in 1912. He found that the anatomy of the teeth were quite different, even though they resembled each other, as well as those of "Stegosaurus". In 1929, Franz Nopcsa, unaware of Broom's previous publication, provided a second novel name as D.M.S. Watson believed that the jaw should be differentiated from "Anthodon". Nopcsa named the species "Paranthodon Owenii", with the generic name derived from the Latin "para", meaning "similar", "near", or "beside", and "Anthodon", and specific name honoring Owen. Per modern conventions, the specific name was later emended to "owenii". Both names were brought into the current nomenclature by Walter P. Coombs in his 1971 dissertation as the new combination "Paranthodon africanus", as the name "Paranthodon" was the first new generic name for the fossils and "africanus" was the first new specific name. This makes "Paranthodon africanus" the proper name for the taxon previously known as "Palaeoscincus africanus" and "Paranthodon owenii".
