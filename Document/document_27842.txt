Manga, anime, video-game and related media publications have praised and criticized the character. Sheena McNeil of the online magazine "Sequential Tart" liked Allen's design and called his anti-Akuma weapon "quite impressive". According to McNeil, the combination of his cursed left eye and his white hair make him "much more striking". Anime News Network's Casey Brienza also praised his design, saying he looks like a "visual kei rock star" and calling him "a nice change of pace" from other "shÅnen" protagonists. His redesign for "Hallow" received similar reactions from Amrita Aulakh of "Pop Wrapped", who stated he was one of the best "Shonen Jump" protagonists alongside Gintoki Sakata from "Gin Tama". 
Kevin Leathers of the UK Anime Network noted that Allen differs from the genre's typical main characters. Leathers saw little character development, writing; "[he] is focused on his job, but will always make time for his friends, which while different, isn't interesting over a long period of time". Tom Tonhat of "Escapist" magazine called Allen a "good lead character". Active Anime's Sandra Scholes found him mysterious, citing his arrival at the Black Order and the anti-Akuma weapon. Critics have noted Allen's interactions with other characters during the series. IGN's Richard Osborn enjoyed the comic relief provided by his clashes with Kanda against the series' dark plot. John Rose of "Fandom Post" considered the team of Allen Walker and Yu Kanda is the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. In a later review, Rose said he enjoyed the plot in which Allen is unable to distinguish Innocents from Akumas.
