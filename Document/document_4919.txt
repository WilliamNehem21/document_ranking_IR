Yoram Tsafrir has endeavored to put the Acra underneath the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount fenced in area. Tsafrir focuses to a straight vertical crease in the fenced in area's eastern stone work divider as proof of various times of development. North of the crease is an early area of the divider worked of huge ashlar squares. These squares have faces with drafted edges around an unmistakable supervisor and are laid in homogeneous header and stretcher courses, one over the other. This style of development is Hellenistic and particular from the Herodian development evident south of the crease. In spite of the fact that the careful dating of this development in questionable, Tsafrir trusts it is a remainder of the Acra's establishments which were later fused into Herod the Great's augmentation of the Temple stage. As additional verification, Tzafrir likewise indicates critical similitude between development strategies apparent north of the crease, including the utilization of trapezoid-formed stones, with the techniques utilized in the Seleucid city of Perga in Asia Minor. 1 Macabees 1:30 traits development of the Acra to Apollonius, AntiochusÃÂ III's "boss gatherer" (, "Sar Hamissim"), which seems, by all accounts, to be an antiquated mistranslation or his unique title as boss (, "Sar") of the Mysians, a people of Asia Minor.
