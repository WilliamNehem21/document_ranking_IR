In 2009, Kapoor worked with nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar on "Don't Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight", a book which focused on the principles of healthy eating habits. Published by Random House Publications, the book was well received by critics, and sold 10,000 copies within its first twenty days. A follow-up titled, "Women and The Weight Loss Tamasha", was released two years later. It addressed the weight loss concerns and eating habits of women in various parts of their life, and featured Kapoor in a voice-over for the audiobook. In February 2013, Kapoor released her autobiographical memoir: "The Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva". Co-written alongside Rochelle Pinto, it became the first book to be launched under the Shobhaa De imprint of Penguin Booksâa set of series that included celebrity memoirs, guides and biographies. In a review published by "Mint", Shefalee Vasudev criticised the writing style as "too-breezy" but further stated that it is "a well-produced book, reproducing chirpy little post-it notes and diet charts, punctuated with Bebo's stunning pictures from her private albums to fashion magazine covers." Later that year, she collaborated with Diwekar for the third time on "The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right", a documentary film about nutrition.
