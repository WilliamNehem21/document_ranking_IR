In September 1861, Pierce made a trip to Michigan, visiting his previous Interior Secretary, McClelland, previous congressperson Cass, and others. A Detroit book retailer, J. A. Roys, sent a letter to Lincoln's Secretary of State, William H. Seward, blaming the previous president for meeting with unfaithful individuals, and saying he had heard there was a plot to topple the administration and build up Pierce as president. Soon thereafter, the star organization "Detroit Tribune" printed a thing calling Pierce "a sneaking swindler spy", and hinting that he was an individual from the master Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle. No such trick existed, however a Pierce supporter, Guy S. Hopkins, sent to the "Tribune" a letter implying to be from an individual from the Knights of the Golden Circle, showing that "President P." was a piece of a plot against the Union. Hopkins proposed for the "Tribune" to make the charges open, so, all in all Hopkins would concede origin, along these lines making the "Tribune" editors appear to be excessively divided and simple. Rather, the "Tribune" editors sent the Hopkins letter to government authorities. Seward at that point requested the capture of conceivable "tricksters" in Michigan, which included Hopkins. Hopkins admitted initiation of the letter and conceded the trick, yet in spite of this, Seward wrote to Pierce requesting to know whether the charges were valid. Puncture denied them, and Seward hurriedly backtracked. Afterward, Republican papers printed the Hopkins letter notwithstanding his affirmation that it was a scam, and Pierce concluded that he expected to demonstrate his innocence openly. At the point when Seward would not make their correspondence open, Pierce broadcasted his shock by having a Senate partner, California's Milton Latham, read the letters among Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record, to the organization's shame.
