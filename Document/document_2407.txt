After the arrival of "Roadway 61 Revisited" in August 1965, Dylan begin procuring a visiting band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and console player Al Kooper had upheld Dylan on his new collection and at Dylan's dubious electric presentation at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield decided not to visit with Dylan, wanting to stay with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Subsequent to support him at shows in late August and early September, Kooper educated Dylan he didn't wish to keep visiting with him. Dylan's supervisor, Albert Grossman, was setting up a tiring show plan that would keep Dylan out and about for the following nine months, visiting the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan reached a gathering who were executing as Levon and the Hawks, comprising of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian artists: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had met up as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two individuals had unequivocally prescribed the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the official secretary of Grossman, and blues artist John Hammond, Jr., child of record maker John Hammond, who had marked Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had sponsored the more youthful Hammond on his 1965 collection "So Many Roads".
