The see of Philadelphia had been empty since the demise of Bishop Michael Francis Egan in 1814, in spite of a few endeavors to fill it. Diocese supervisor John Carroll of Baltimore, whose territory included Philadelphia, had considered no less than fifteen clerics for the position; some had been precluded for some reason, and others (counting the missional overseer, Louis de Barth) had turned the activity down. Some portion of the deferral was strategicÃ¢ÂÂCarroll was uncertain of the careful methodology for choosing a competitor in the as of late raised regionÃ¢ÂÂyet part was because of the apparent nuisance of the post, which regulated just a couple of little chapels in a piece of the country with couple of Catholics. There was additionally a noteworthy debate (known as trusteeism) over the privileges of temples' lay trustees that was probably going to confuse the activity of running the see. In Europe, the Church possessed property and legitimately controlled its areas through the ministry. In the United States, in any case, early Catholic houses of worship were normally established by laymen who acquired the property, and raised the congregation structures. Those laypeople as needs be requested some command over the organization of the ward, even after the entry of ministry from Europe who held the conventional perspective on area association. In a bigger sense, the debate spoke to a distinction in understandings of power among Americans and Europeans.
