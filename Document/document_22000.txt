Hill 260 was located in the Americal Division's sector, about outside the main perimeter line, on the southern approaches to the Torokina perimeter. An hourglass-shaped feature consisting of two rounded hills to the north and south â dubbed "North Knob" and "South Knob" â the position was essentially a saddle, albeit one separated by a very narrow handle. The U.S. forces had established an outpost on the feature which was occupied by a reinforced platoon from G Company, 2ndÂ Battalion, 182ndÂ Regiment and a party of artillery observers; the total strength of this isolated force on 10Â March was about 80 men. An observation platform had been erected up a tree (called "OP tree"), and the heavily forested hill was protected by a network of bunkers which had been constructed out of sandbags and logs. During the night of 9/10Â March small parties from the Muda Unit, having assembled at Peko before moving along the EastâWest Trail, infiltrated the gap between Hill 260 and the main American perimeter and the main body of the Japanese force moved into its jumping off position east of the hill. During the night American artillery also bombarded the approaches to the southern end of the hill.
