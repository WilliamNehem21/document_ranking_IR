Philip pledged to the settlement, yet he postponed the takeoff of the Athenian agents, who still couldn't seem to get the promises from Macedon's partners in Thessaly and somewhere else. At last, harmony was sworn at Pherae, where Philip went with the Athenian assignment, after he had finished his military arrangements to move south. Demosthenes blamed the different agents for corruption and of encouraging Philip's arrangements with their position. Soon after the finish of the Peace of Philocrates, Philip passed Thermopylae, and stifled Phocis; Athens made no move to help the Phocians. Bolstered by Thebes and Thessaly, Macedon assumed responsibility for Phocis' votes in the Amphictyonic League, a Greek religious association shaped to help the more prominent sanctuaries of Apollo and Demeter. Regardless of some hesitance with respect to the Athenian heads, Athens at last acknowledged Philip's entrance into the Council of the League. Demosthenes was among the individuals who embraced an even minded methodology, and suggested this position in his address "On the Peace". For Edmund M. Burke, this discourse tourist spots a snapshot of development in Demosthenes' profession: after Philip's effective crusade in 346ÃÂ BC, the Athenian statesman understood that, if he somehow happened to lead his city against the Macedonians, he had "to alter his voice, to turn out to be less divided in tone".
