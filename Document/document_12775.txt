Following the breakdown of the 1454Ã¢ÂÂ 55 protectorate, the Yorkist rulers withdrew to their domains, and Mowbray separated himself from factional legislative issues. An uneasy harmony existed between the court and the Yorkists until April 1455, when the King brought a Great Council to meet at Leicester the next month. The Duke of York expected that the motivation behind this chamber was to decimate him; a few writers of the day propose that Somerset was harming the King's psyche against York. The duke and his Neville partners continued to raise a military from their northern homes. The King and a little power left London on 20 May; the Yorkists drew nearer from the north with a speed determined to astonish. In a pre-emptive strike, York and his partners caught the King at the primary Battle of St Albans. Mowbray figured out how to keep away from association in the battling, despite the fact that, as Earl Marshal, his messengers were utilized amid dealings between the two camps. It is dubious when Mowbray joined the fight, or in the event that he even achieved the King so as to partake. The battling kept going just a brief span, and however there were not many fatalities among the soldiery, the Earl of Northumberland, the Duke of Somerset and Lord Clifford were executed. They were not by any means the only three of the King's most steadfast supporters, yet Percy and Somerset at any rate were unpleasant foes of the Nevilles and York.
