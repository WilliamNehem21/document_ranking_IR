Milk suddenly quit functioning as a protection statistician and turned into a specialist at the Wall Street firm Bache and Company. He was much of the time elevated in spite of his propensity to affront the more seasoned individuals from the firm by disregarding their recommendation and parading his prosperity. In spite of the fact that he was talented at his specific type of employment, colleagues detected that Milk's heart was not in his work. He began a sentimental association with Jack Galen McKinley and enlisted him to take a shot at moderate Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential crusade. Their relationship was vexed. At the point when McKinley initially started his association with Milk in late 1964, McKinley was 16 years of age. He was inclined to gloom and now and again took steps to end it all if Milk did not indicate him enough consideration. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the medical clinic where Milk's ex-darling, Joe Campbell, was himself recovering from a suicide endeavor, after his sweetheart Billy Sipple left him. Milk had stayed benevolent with Campbell, who had entered the vanguard workmanship scene in Greenwich Village, however Milk did not comprehend why Campbell's gloom was adequate reason to think about suicide as an alternative.
