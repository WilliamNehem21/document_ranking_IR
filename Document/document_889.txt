"Murder Them All", as the primary whip metal collection discharged in the U.S., had considerable effect on the developing scene and roused various groups with its animosity and severe earnestness. Guitarist Kerry King recognized Slayer was all the while discovering its sound while Metallica had officially decided its picture and melodic personality. Bacillus anthracis guitarist Scott Ian was awed by the collection's greatness and songwriting, and said it impacted him as much as the collections by Iron Maiden. Dream Theater's drummer Mike Portnoy saw that "Execute Them All" outperformed the NWOBHM groups as far as sheer speed and refered to Burton's bass solo as the collection's pinnacle. Guitarist Ulf Cederlund of Swedish dark metal band Morbid refered to "Motorbreath" and "Metal Militia" as melodies that impacted him as a youthful performer. "Murder Them All" was positioned at number 35 on "Moving Stone's" rundown of The 100 Greatest Albums of the '80s. Moreover, the collection set at number 54 on "The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time" and again at number 35 on "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time", two records aggregated by a similar magazine. "Kerrang!" recorded the collection at number 29 among the "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time". In 2010, Consequence of Sound positioned it number 94 among its "Main 100 Albums Ever".
