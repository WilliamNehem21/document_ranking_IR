The "Persona" series has been referred to as the most popular spin-off from the "Megami Tensei" franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. Io9's James Whitbrook commented that while "here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane "normal" life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". "Nintendo Power", in an article concerning the "Megami Tensei" series, cited the "Persona" series' "modern-day horror stories" and "teams of Japanese high-school kids" as the perfect example of the franchise. "Persona" was mentioned in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying "Examining "Persona" reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. "Persona 3" was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed "Persona 3" and "4" in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list. "Persona 3" was listed by Gamasutra as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. "Persona 4" was also listed by "Famitsu" as one of the greatest games of all time in a 2010 list.
