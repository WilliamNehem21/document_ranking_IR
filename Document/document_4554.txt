The ship partook in the uneventful winter journey into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The primary quarter of 1907 pursued the past example and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-assigned the High Seas Fleet. From the finish of May to early June the armada went on its late spring voyage in the North Sea, coming back to the Baltic by means of the Kattegat. This was trailed by the standard journey to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. Amid the pre-winter moves, which endured from 26 August to 6 September, the armada led landing practices in northern Schleswig with the IX Corps. The winter preparing journey went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the armada went on a noteworthy journey into the Atlantic rather than its typical voyage in the North Sea, which incorporated a stop in Horta in the Azores. The armada came back to Kiel on 13 August to plan for the fall moves, which kept going from 27 August to 7 September. Division practices in the Baltic promptly pursued from 7 to 13 September. After the finish of the moves, "Wittelsbach" was soothed as the squadron leader by the new war vessel and turned into the leader of the delegate officer.
