The Library turned out to be increasingly vital amid the eighteenth century; preceding that it had been a little, little-utilized accumulation of books. In 1725 it was proposed by the Pension that "a publick Library be sett up and kept open for ye utilization of ye society", and that more books be bought. The main request of new books was on 27 June 1729 and comprised of "a gathering of Lord Bacon's works". In 1750 the Under-Steward of the Inn made another index of the books, and in 1789 the Library was moved to another room between the Hall and the Chapel. In 1840 another two rooms were raised in which to store books, and in 1883 another Library was built with space to store roughly 11,000 books. This was quickly observed to be deficient, and in 1929 another Library, known as the Holker Library after the supporter, Sir John Holker, was opened. The library, albeit great looking, was not especially helpful; Francis Cowper composed that: Though amazing to take a gander at, the new structure was something not exactly a triumph as a library. The demeanor of roominess was delivered to the detriment of rack room, and however in the octagon [at the north end] the improving impact of endless supply of books taking off upwards towards the cornice was extensive, the loftiest were absolutely unavailable spare to the individuals who could scale the longest and dizziest stepping stools. Further, the arrangements were of such outperforming mag-nificence that no ink-pots were permitted in the space because of a paranoid fear of mishaps.
