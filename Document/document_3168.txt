The Philadelphia Mint authored 200,112 half dollars in October 1920, with the overabundance over the round number held for assessment and testing at the 1921 gathering of the yearly Assay Commission. They were delivered to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to people in general, with the benefits to go to the tercentenary commission. The coins could be requested through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek trusted the clearance of 1920-dated coins to have been exceptionally effective, and there was no idea around then of restoring any to the Mint for reclamation and liquefying. The main request had not depleted the approved mintage, so the tercentenary commission requested 100,000 all the more amid the spring of 1921 when deals impeded. These were instituted in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the time of issue included the front to one side of Bradford. This was done to consent to the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the time of striking to show up on coins. The retreat of 1921 started before long; deals dropped, and countless the two dates stayed unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.
