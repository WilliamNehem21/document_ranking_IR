Inside the West Indies, this species is most normal in the Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands and little islands east of Puerto Rico. Reproducing in the Western Palearctic happens on the Cape Verde Islands and the ÃÂles des Madeleines off Senegal. In 2000, the absolute number of sets there was likely under 150. In the Pacific Ocean, it breeds from the Gulf of California and Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico in the north, to the Galapagos Islands, Isla Plata, Ecuador and San Lorenzo Island, Peru. Scientists Larry Spear and David Ainley assessed the base populace of the Pacific at around 15,750 feathered creatures in 1995 following 15 years of field perceptions. Red-charged tropicbirds scatter generally when not reproducing, the adolescents more so than the grown-ups, with winged creatures in the Pacific achieving the 45th parallel north off Washington State and 32nd parallel south off Chile, with 19 records starting at 2007 from HawaiiÃ¢ÂÂsome from Mexico. It here and there meanders further, including five records from Great Britain, and two from Australia: OctoberÃ¢ÂÂ December 2010 on Lord Howe Island and September 2014 on Ashmore Reef. In July 2005, one was found in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, while another has been seen at Matinicus Rock, Maine routinely since 2000.
