"Temeraire" then rammed into "Redoutable", dismounting many of the French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together. "Temeraire" now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire as she did so from the 112-gun Spanish ship lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship , which came up on "Temeraire"s un-engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to hold fire until "Fougueux" came within point blank range. "Temeraire"s first broadside against "Fougueux" at a range of caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into "Temeraire", whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. "Temeraire" was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled in a letter to his wife "Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her." "Redoutable", sandwiched between "Victory" and "Temeraire", suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of "Redoutable" killed and wounded a number of "Temeraire"s crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. "Temeraire" narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from "Redoutable" exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only "Temeraire", but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.
