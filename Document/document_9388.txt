History specialist H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921 that "Pinafore" "caricaturizes the kind of nautical show of which Douglas Jerrold's "Dark Eyed Susan" is a regular case, and the 'God's Englishman' kind of nationalism which comprises in yelling a clichÃÂ©, striking a mentality, and doing nearly nothing or nothing to support one's nation". G. K. Chesterton concurred that the parody is pointed at the narrow-mindedness of "being pleased with yourself for being a resident" of one's nation, which requires no upright exertion of will to oppose the "compulsions to have a place with different countries" however is only a reason for pride. In 2005, Australian musical drama chief Stuart Maunder noticed the juxtaposition of parody and patriotism in the musical show, saying, "they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you realize damn well they're sending it up, however the music is so militaryÃÂ ... that you can't resist the urge to be cleared up in that entire patriotism that is the British Empire." what's more, he contended that the tune integrates this topic with the principle parody of class qualifications in the musical show: ""H.M.S. Pinafore" is fundamentally a parody onÃÂ ... the British love of the class system.ÃÂ ... [O]f course [Ralph] can wed [the Captain's] little girl, since he's British, and along these lines he's extraordinary'". Jacobs takes note of that Gilbert is parodying the convention of nautical drama in which the mariner's "nationalism ensures his prudence".
