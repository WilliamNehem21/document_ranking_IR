On 15 September 1940 amid the Battle of Britain, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron RCAF, No.ÃÂ 229 Squadron, No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron, No.ÃÂ 504 Squadron, and part of No.ÃÂ 264 Squadron were based at the station, all under the control of No. 11 Group RAF, headquartered at RAF Uxbridge. All flew Hawker Hurricanes aside from No.ÃÂ 264 Squadron's unforeseen, which worked the Boulton Paul Defiant. Amid the Battle of Britain, the Polish Squadron shot down the best number of foe air ship, with its Czech pilot Sergeant Josef FrantiÃÂ¡ek scoring the most "murders". The Luftwaffe shelled the runway in August 1940 just as other division landing strips in the zone, including Biggin Hill, Hornchurch and North Weald, as a major aspect of a concentrated exertion against the landing strips and segment stations of No.ÃÂ 11 Group RAF. A sum of 4,000 bombs were recorded as falling inside two miles (3ÃÂ km) of the runway over a fifteen-month time span, albeit just two were recorded as hitting the landing strip itself. Under the authority of the station administrator, Group Captain Stanley Vincent, the landing strip was disguised to look like common lodging. Vincent had been worried that disguising the runway as open land would look excessively suspicious from the air; Northolt was encompassed by lodging thus an extensive open zone would draw consideration. A phony stream was painted over the principle runway while the shelters were designed to look like houses and gardens. The outcome was effective to the point that pilots traveling to Northolt from different runways frequently attempted to discover it.
