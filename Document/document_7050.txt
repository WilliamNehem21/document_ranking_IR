"Northern gannet" has been assigned as the official regular name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). It is otherwise called the North Atlantic gannet. "Gannet" is gotten from Old English "ganot", signifying "solid or manly", which is at last from a similar Old Germanic root as "gander". "Soland goose" and comparative old names for the northern gannet, for example, "solan" or "solan goose" get from a theoretical Scottish Gaelic "sulan", itself obtained from the Old Norse "sula". The exacting significance is "separated stick", alluding to the presence of the obvious crossed dark wing tips on a roosted northern gannet. Old provincial names, for example, Norfolk's "herring gant" or Yorkshire's "mackerel gant" allude to run of the mill fish prey. Lincolnshire's "withered", albeit got from a similar Germanic root, as a rule applies to the extraordinary peaked grebe, yet the English essayist Richard Hakluyt utilized the term in 1600 to allude to the gannet, "an incredible White foule". Youthful feathered creatures have been classified "spotted booby" or "parliament goose", the previous term alluding to their plumage. The encouraging propensities for the gannet have prompted its name being utilized as slang for a ravenous individual, a use originally recorded in 1929.
