Australian arrangement for the utilization of the Second Australian Imperial Force (2AIF) was to have all powers amassed in an Australian Corps, under Australian order. By June, Australian troops were scattered all through the Middle East, Cyprus and North Africa. The subject had been of worry to the Australian Government since 18 April. The issue reached a crucial stage on 18ÃÂ July, when Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey (officer of the 2AIF, and appointee leader Middle East Command) composed a letter to General Claude Auchinleck, the new authority of all powers in North Africa and the Middle East, expressing "the concurred approach for the work of Australian troops between the British and Australian Governments is that theÃÂ ... troops ought to work as a solitary power." Blamey likewise featured that the troops in Tobruk were demonstrating a decrease in wellbeing because of the attack and that the steady loss rate they were enduring would result in "impressive" setbacks, on the off chance that they were not supplanted by crisp troops. This caused a conciliatory line between Winston Churchill and the Australian Government that proceeded after the war, and turned what Graham Freudenberg called a "sensible solicitation in July" into "a dangerous one in October".
