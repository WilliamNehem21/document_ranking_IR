As per Josephus, Demetrius III and Philip I pursued a savage war against Antiochus X; the language of Josephus demonstrates that Antiochus X was in a protective position as opposed to arranging huge crusades against his cousins. In 220 SE (93/92 BC), no coins were delivered for Demetrius III in Damascus; this could imply that he lost authority over the city. It is conceivable that either the Judaeans or the Nabataeans exploited Demetrius III's takeoff to support his sibling and involved the city; the King recovered Damascus in 221 SE (92/91 BC). Antiochus X's date of death is obscure; customary grant, with no proof, gives the year 92 BC, at that point has Demetrius assuming responsibility for Antioch and decision it for a long time until his destruction in 87 BC. Those customary dates are difficult to legitimize; utilizing a strategy dependent on evaluating the yearly bite the dust use normal rate (the Esty equation), Hoover proposed the year 224 SE (89/88 BC) for the finish of Antiochus X's rule. It is evaluated that just a single to three kicks the bucket were utilized by Demetrius III for his Antiochene coins, a number too little to even consider justifying a five-year-long reign in Antioch; no artistic sources determine the year 92 BC as the date of Demetrius III's control of Antioch, and none of his Antiochene coins bear a date.
