Soft cover books in the United States extended noticeably after World WarÃÂ II through the showcasing techniques of Pocket Books, who started to convey productions through papers, newspaper kiosks, markets, and transport and train stations. The retail chances of soft cover books became about ten times with this technique. In 1950, rival organization Gold Medal Books distributed "Ladies' Barracks", a fictionalized record of writer Tereska Torres' experience serving in the Free French Forces. The book delineates a lesbian relationship the writer saw, finishing with one of the ladies ending it all. It sold 4.5ÃÂ million duplicates, and Gold Medal Books' editors were "excited". Its prosperity earned it a notice in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Gold Medal Books was a part of Fawcett Publications that concentrated on soft cover books which at the time were imprinted on shabby paper, not intended to keep going for over a year, sold for 25ÃÂ cents in medication stores and different settings everywhere throughout the United States and Canada. The books made for shabby, simple perusing that could be disposed of toward the finish of an excursion at next to no cost to the client. In light of the low nature of generation, they earned the name mash fiction.
