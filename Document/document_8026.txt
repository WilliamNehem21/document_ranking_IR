The extension is long and wide. The gatehouse stands high over the extension deck. It has three curves remaining on wharfs. The two docks that remain on the bed of the Monnow structure cutwaters. The undersides of the curves are ribbed for fortification. The extension is developed of seven kinds of stone, dominatingly Old Red Sandstone, all quarried inside of Monmouth. The two ways through the door are nineteenth century inclusions. Preceding their development, the primary entryway was the sole methods for passage and departure. This opening was guarded by a portcullis. The gatehouse is circular, and its western and eastern rises show extensive contrasts. The western front has three machicolations over the door with homicide gaps inset. The antiquarians Oliver Creighton and Richard Higham note their "fine structural enumerating". The dating of the machicolations is questionable, yet correlation with comparative, dated, models, for example, those at Cooling Castle in Kent, proposes a development period in the fourteenth century. They can't be unique to the door, as their situating would have hindered the portcullis. The eastern front is less enriched and shows proof of progressively significant reproduction. It has a midway set round-headed window. The person on foot curves through the extension likewise vary in plan, the northern being pointed and the southern having a level "Caernarvon" head.
