Since the 1920s, numerous anecdotal works have been propelled by Anderson's case to be Anastasia. In 1928, the quiet film "Garments Make the Woman" was put together all around freely with respect to her story. In 1953, Marcelle Maurette composed a play dependent on Rathlef's and Gilliard's books called "Anastasia", which visited Europe and America with Viveca Lindfors in the title job. The play was successful to the point that in 1956 an English adjustment by Guy Bolton was made into a film, "Anastasia". The plot spins around a gathering of swindlers who endeavor to fund-raise among Russian ÃÂ©migrÃÂ©s by imagining that Grand Duchess Anastasia is as yet alive. A reasonable amnesiac, "Anna", is prepped by the swindlers to imitate Anastasia. Anna's sources are obscure and as the play advances indications are dropped that she could be the genuine Anastasia, who has lost her memory. The watcher is left to choose whether Anna truly is Anastasia. Another film was discharged in the meantime, "Is Anna Anderson Anastasia?" featuring Lilli Palmer, which makes much a similar progress, yet the focal character is "maybe significantly progressively lost, distraught and terrible, however she, as well, has minutes when she is a lady of quality and nobility".
