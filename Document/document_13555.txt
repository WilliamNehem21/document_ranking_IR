President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed on April 12, 1945, in the wake of driving the United States through a significant part of the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt had experienced polio since 1921 and had helped found and unequivocally upheld the March of Dimes to battle that devastating illness, so the ten-penny piece was an undeniable method for respecting a president well known for his war authority. On May 3, Louisiana Representative James Hobson Morrison presented a bill for a Roosevelt dime. On May 17, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. declared that the Mercury dime (otherwise called the Winged Liberty dime) would be supplanted by another coin portraying Roosevelt, to go into course about the year's end. Around 90 percent of the letters gotten by Stuart Mosher, editorial manager of "The Numismatist" (the diary of the American Numismatic Association), were steady of the change, yet he himself was not, contending that the Mercury configuration was wonderful and that the restricted space on the dime would not do equity to Roosevelt; he upheld a memorial silver dollar. Others questioned that in spite of his benefits, Roosevelt had not earned a spot close by Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, the main presidents respected on the flowing coinage to that point. As the Mercury structure, first instituted in 1916, had been struck for somewhere around 25 years, it could be changed under the law by the Bureau of the Mint. No congressional activity was required, however the boards of trustees of each house with ward over the coinage were educated.
