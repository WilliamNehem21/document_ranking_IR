Jed Gottlieb of the "Boston Herald" contends that, despite the fact that "Is This It" gave generous melodic impact, its greatest achievement was in patching up the music business and making A&R delegates scout and advance elective groups. Gunn joins the achievement of elective music in British graphs all through the 2000s to the collection, yet takes note of that "the copyists" would never coordinate the tender loving care and genuine feeling of the Strokes. Mulholland includes that even the pop stars of that decade who rediscovered disco, electro, and synthpop owe an obligation to the record, since its business achievement "made each overlooked craftsmanship pop trial of the late 70s and mid 80s immediately hip and ready for reexamination". Hamish MacBain of "NME" composes that "the western world has proceeded onward, and is presently swinging to the tune of "Is This It"", while "Pitchfork"s Joe Colly proposes that "you just catch this sort of a lightning in a jug once". Gunn infers that, while the status of the collection as the 2000s' most persuasive guitar record might be "a twofold edged sword" due to low quality copyists, its status as the decade's best pop collection ought not be in uncertainty.
