As the American Revolution escalated in 1775, Scott raised an organization of volunteers in Cumberland County. It was the main organization shaped south of the James River to take an interest in the Revolution. The organization stood prepared to help Patrick Henry in a foreseen conflict with Lord Dunmore at Williamsburg, Virginia, in May 1775, however Dunmore surrendered the city in June, and they joined units from the encompassing regions in Williamsburg soon thereafter. In July, the Virginia Convention made two regiments of Virginia troops, one under Patrick Henry and the other under William Woodford. As those pioneers left for Williamsburg, the Conventions recognized Scott as impermanent president of the volunteers previously collected there. On August17, 1775, he was chosen lieutenant colonel of Woodford's regiment, the second Virginia. His more youthful sibling, Joseph, filled in as a lieutenant in the regiment. In December, Woodford dispatched Scott and 150 men to Great Bridge, Virginia, to shield an intersection point on the Elizabeth River. Days after the fact, this power assumed a huge job in the December9, 1775, Battle of Great Bridge by killing British Captain Charles Fordyce, consequently ending the British development on the intersection. Following the fight, pilgrim powers had the capacity to possess the city of Norfolk, Virginia, and Lord Dunmore in the end withdrew from Virginia.
