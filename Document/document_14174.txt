The essayist Jonathan's first experience with the 2006 version of "Jewels Are Forever" portrays Bond as a "surprisinglyÃÂ ... complex" character who, conversely with the true to life portrayal, is "nothing other than human.ÃÂ ... Fleming's Bond commits errors and pays for them. He feels agony and lament." The writer Raymond BensonÃ¢ÂÂwho later composed a progression of Bond booksÃ¢ÂÂcomposes that the character creates in "Precious stones Are Forever", expanding on Fleming's characterisation in his past three books. This development emerges through Bond's blossoming association with the book's principle female character, Tiffany Case. He becomes hopelessly enamored; the first occasion when he has done as such since Vesper Lynd in "Gambling club Royale". As indicated by Benson, Tiffany is depicted as intense, yet desolate and unreliable, and "is Fleming's first completely created female character." The social students of history Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett compose that a large number of the primary female characters in Fleming's books are remarkable, and TiffanyÃ¢ÂÂalongside Pussy Galore from "Goldfinger" and Honeychile Rider from "Dr. No"Ã¢ÂÂ has been "damagedÃÂ ... explicitly" having recently been assaulted. The impact of the injury has prompted Tiffany working for the scalawag, which enables Bond to finish his main goal, and adjust her to an increasingly legit way of life.
