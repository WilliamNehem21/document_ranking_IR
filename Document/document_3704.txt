He began his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a success at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth decision at 5Ã¢ÂÂ 1 and had an ideal number four post position.

At the highest point of the homestretch, he was just a half length before the field, however then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Ponies he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later put second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow confronted again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an extra ten towards capability for the Derby.
