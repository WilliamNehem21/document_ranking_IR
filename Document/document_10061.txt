The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant was sold in January 1911 to Studebaker, a noteworthy creator of different steed drawn street vehicles since the 1850s. That equivalent year, when the railroad goad line serving the manufacturing plant was raised above road level, the stacking dock behind the structure was supplanted with a raised stage, level with the second floor. Likewise in 1911, Studebaker procured the E-M-F Company, which claimed an alternate vehicle fabricating complex on Piquette Avenue. Studebaker started to put its name on the vehicles in the past delivered by the E-M-F Company in 1912. In 1920, Studebaker fabricated a four-story, strengthened solid structure, known as the "Studebaker Detroit Service Building", quickly west of the Piquette Avenue Plant. The Detroit Service Building was associated with the Piquette Avenue Plant's southwest corner on the second and third floors, which made a ground-level, drive-through passage to the court between the two structures. In 1926, the lift stairwell mix on the Piquette Avenue Plant's southwest side was moved somewhat northwards to make simpler access between the two structures on their second and third floors. Likewise in 1926, the apparatus for both of the Piquette Avenue Plant's lifts was supplanted. Studebaker utilized the Piquette Avenue Plant for vehicle creation until 1933.
