At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, Alfred Lyttelton formally proposed this alteration; the movement was upheld by 259 votes to 188, however neglected to verify the 66% lion's share required to change the laws. A. G. Steel was the essential rival of the change, as he trusted it would make the assignment of the umpires excessively troublesome, however he later lamented his position. Lyttelton's sibling, Robert, bolstered the modification and battled for an incredible remainder to have the lbw law changed. As proof that cushion play was expanding and should have been diminished, he refered to the developing number of wickets which were falling lbw: the extent ascended from 2% of expulsions in 1870 to 6% in 1890, and 12% in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was attempted in the Minor Counties Championship, yet esteemed a disappointment. An expansion in the measure of the stumps was one of a few other rejected proposition right now to lessen the predominance of batsmen over bowlers.
