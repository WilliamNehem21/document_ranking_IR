Comet was depicted by five ponies, each with an alternate ability. The primary pony was Copper, picked by veteran wrangler Gordon Spencer since it was quiet and delicate. Campbell nicknamed the pony "Leadbelly" because of its capacity to try to avoid panicking amid activity or discourse scenes. Another steed, Boss, was utilized for long-run shots, pursue scenes, and expound stunts, for example, jumps through windows. Expert was brought in when the team needed to shoot scenes in which the pony raised. Close to the finish of the period, a pony named Comet was prepared, its name picked so the steed would become acclimated to hearing it on set. The "genuine show horse" was Strip, which was adroit at doing traps, for example, lip developments, head gestures, and foot stepping. As indicated by Spencer, each one of those tricks "just as tying the bunches and opening the entryway and going into rooms and the majority of that" were finished by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would remain off-camera and utilize a stick to flag Strip. Campbell had an exceptional pocket sewn into his ensemble and filled it with grain to remunerate Strip after each take. No other pony had a greater number of scenes than Strip and Copper. With white colorings on his nose and legs, Strip's appearance was picked for Brisco's steed; Copper and different ponies were contacted up with "jokester white" greasepaint to coordinate Strip's markings.
