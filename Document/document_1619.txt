At the point when the new government court opened in Virginia in 1790, British loan bosses instantly documented over a hundred cases trying to authorize claims from the Revolutionary War. Henry was a piece of the protection group in "Jones v. Walker" under the watchful eye of the government court in 1791; his co-counsel included John Marshall, who arranged the composed pleadings while Henry did a significant part of the court promotion. Henry contended the case for three days; Marshall, thinking back, called him "an extraordinary oratorÃÂ ... what's more, considerably more, an educated legal advisor, a most precise scholar, and a significant reasoner". The case finished uncertainly after one of the judges passed on, yet the legitimate groups reassembled for the instance of "Product v. Hylton". Contended under the watchful eye of another three-judge board that included Chief Justice of the United States John Jay and Associate Justice James Iredell, Henry's contention incited Justice Iredell to shout, "Charitable God! He is a speaker in fact." Henry and Marshall were at first fruitful, however the offended parties offered, and after Marshall contended his solitary case under the watchful eye of the Supreme Court, that court in 1796 ruled for the British lenders.
