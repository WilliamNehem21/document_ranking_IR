In 2013, the revelation of two new "Deinocheirus" examples was declared before the yearly Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) gathering by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, and associates. Housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, these two headless people were given the example numbers MPC-D 100/127 and MPC-D 100/128. MPC-D 100/128, a subadult example, was found by researchers in the "Altan Ula IV" territory (organizes: ) of the Nemegt Formation amid the Korea-Mongolia International Dinosaur Expedition in 2006, however had just been harmed by fossil poachers. The second example, MPC-D 100/127, was found by researchers in the "Bugiin Tsav" area (organizes: ) in 2009. It is somewhat bigger than the holotype, and it could be plainly distinguished as "Deinocheirus" by its left forelimb, and along these lines recognized the before gathered example as "Deinocheirus". The example had additionally been exhumed by poachers, who had expelled the skull, hands and feet, however abandoned a solitary toe bone. It had presumably been plundered after 2002, in light of cash left in the quarry. Skulls, hook bones and teeth are regularly specifically focused by poachers on the cost of the remainder of the skeletons (which are frequently vandalized), because of their saleability. Currie expressed in a meeting that it was an arrangement of their group to research quarries after they had been plundered and recuperate anything of importance, and that finding any new "Deinocheirus" fossils was cause for festivity, even without the poached parts. A virtual model of "Deinocheirus" uncovered at the SVP introduction brought praise from the horde of going to scientistss, and Scottish scientist Stephen L. Brusatte expressed he had never been as astonished by a SVP talk, however new fossils are routinely introduced at the meeting.
