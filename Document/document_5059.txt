Papers and diaries joined the discussion, some in solid terms. One fervent distribution, "The Record", differentiated the two hopefuls: MÃÂ¼ller's compositions were "well-known to all people inspired by writing, while they have wrecked trust in his religious suppositions"; Williams was portrayed as "a man of true devotion, and one who is likely, by the gift of God on his works, to advance a definitive item which the author of the Professorship had in view." Other papers featured the nationalities of the competitors; as Beckerlegge has put it, "voting in favor of the Boden Chair was progressively assuming the presence of being a trial of enthusiasm." "The Homeward Mail" (a London-put together paper that concentrated with respect to news from, and identifying with, India) asked its perusers whether they needed "an outsider and an outsider" to win, or "one of your own body". An essayist in "The Morning Post" said that voters should "keep the incredible prizes of the English colleges for English understudies". The "Morning Herald" said that it was "an issue of national enthusiasm", since it would influence the instruction of government workers and teachers and accordingly "the advancement of Christianity in India and the upkeep of British expert in that domain". It foreseen that Britain would be disparaged on the off chance that it needed to name a German to its driving scholastic Sanskrit position.
