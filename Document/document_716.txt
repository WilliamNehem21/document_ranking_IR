The two structures toward the west and east of the "corps de logis" are associated with it by arcaded displays, finished in 1713 and 1715 individually, that nearby off the northern edge of the "cour d'honneur". The western exhibition praises harmony with stucco statuary, emblems, and reliefs of the Judgment of Paris, Aeneas escaping Troy, Hercules and Omphale, and Apollo and Daphne. Its end, the Jagdpavillon (Hunting structure), contains the "Marmorsaletta" (Little marble lobby) brightened with scagliola by Riccardo Retti and frescoes by Luca Antonio Colomba. Appended to the corridor are three bureau rooms, the first and third are adorned with Turkish and Chinese symbolism separately. The eastern exhibition commends war with stucco trophy prisoners and weapons, reliefs of Eberhard Louis' monogram, and delineations of the cardinal ethics and the established components. Spreading over the whole exhibition is Colomba's roof fresco of the Gigantomachy, the war between the Olympian divine beings and the monsters. Toward the finish of the exhibition is the Spielpavillon, finished in 1716, whose middle is an adjusted, cruciform corridor with four corner rooms that contain impersonation Delftware pictures of Jacques Callot's "Odd Dwarves". The arch fresco by Colomba and delineates the four seasons and their comparing zodiac signs.
