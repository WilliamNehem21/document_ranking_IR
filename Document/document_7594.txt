Disciplines are likewise depicted finally, including the task of monotonous composition assignments and the excruciating use of the tie: Of all the physical torments to which we were uncovered, positively the most intense was that caused by this leathern instrument, around two fingers wide, connected to our poor little hands with all the quality and all the anger of the director. To persevere through this established type of adjustment, the unfortunate casualty stooped amidst the room. He needed to leave his structure and go to stoop down close to the ace's work area under the inquisitive and for the most part cruel eyes of his colleagues... Some young men shouted out and shed severe tears previously or after the utilization of the tie; others acknowledged the punishment with unemotional calmÃÂ ... be that as it may, few could control a statement of anguish in expectation. Further indications of Balzac's authenticity show up when Lambert depicts his capacity to vicariously encounter occasions through idea alone.
