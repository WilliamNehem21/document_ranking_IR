"B.Â telmatiaea" grows as an upright bush up to 2Â m (7Â ft) high. It has hairy stems and branchlets, and straight, narrow leaves from 1Â½ to 3Â centimetres (Â½â1Â inches) long and about a millimetre (Â in) wide. The leaves have a green upper surface and white hairy undersurface. The new growth is pale brown, later turning green.
Flowers occur in "flower spikes", inflorescences made up of hundreds of flower pairs densely packed around a woody axis. Arising from short lateral branchlets off stems older than four years of age, the inflorescence of "B.Â telmatiaea" is roughly oval to cylindrical, with a height of 3â5Â cm (1â2Â in) and diameter of 4â7Â cm (1â2Â in). It contains between 500 and 900 golden brown to pale brown flowers, each of which consists of a tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals, and one long wiry style. The styles are hooked rather than straight, and are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at anthesis. The species generally flowers from April to August, although flowers have been observed as late as November. They take five to six weeks to develop from bud, then reach anthesis over a period of two weeks. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground.
