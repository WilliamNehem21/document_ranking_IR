On 16 August 1915, "Posen" and "Nassau" led a second attempt to breach the defenses of the gulf, with "Posen" as Admiral Schmidt's flagship. The two dreadnoughts were accompanied by 4Â light cruisers and 31Â torpedo boats. On the first day of the assault the Germans broke through the Russian forces, but two German light craftâthe minesweeper and the destroyer âwere sunk. "Posen" and "Nassau" engaged a pair of Russian gunboats, and . "Sivuch" was sunk that day and "Korietz" was severely damaged; the ship managed to limp away but had to be scuttled the following day. On the 17th, "Posen" and "Nassau" engaged "Slava" at long range; they scored three hits on the Russian ship and forced her to return to port. By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. Reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day. Admiral Hipper later remarked, "To keep valuable ships for a considerable time in a limited area in which enemy submarines were increasingly active, with the corresponding risk of damage and loss, was to indulge in a gamble out of all proportion to the advantage to be derived from the occupation of the Gulf "before" the capture of Riga from the land side." In fact, the battlecruiser "Moltke" had been torpedoed that morning. On 21 August, Schmidt had his flag hauled down from "Posen" and disbanded the special unit.
