Cosmas Indicopleustes, a sixth century Eastern Roman priest and previous vendor who composed the "Christian Topography" (depicting the Indian Ocean exchange driving right to China), visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included observer records of it in his book. He duplicated a Greek engraving enumerating the rule of a mid third century polytheistic leader of Aksum who sent a maritime armada over the Red Sea to overcome the Sabaeans in what is presently Yemen, alongside different pieces of western Arabia. Old Sabaean writings from Yemen affirm this was the Aksumite ruler Gadara, who made partnerships with Sabaean lords, prompting possible Axumite authority over western Yemen that would last until the Himyarite ruler Shammar Yahri'sh (r. c. 265 Ã¢ÂÂ c. 287) removed the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia. It is just from Sabaean and Himyarite engravings that we know the names of a few Aksumite rulers and rulers after Gadara, including the rulers 'DBH and DTWNS. Engravings of ruler Ezana notice stone-cut positions of authority close to the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum (the stages of which still exist), and Cosmas portrayed a white-marble honored position and stele in Adulis that were both canvassed in Greek engravings.
