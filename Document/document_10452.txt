The bad habit presidential selection was viewed as unimportant; no president had neglected to finish his chosen term. Very little consideration was given to the decision, and the particulars of how Tyler came to pick up it are misty. Chitwood brought up that Tyler was a sensible applicant: as a Southern slaveowner, he adjusted the ticket and furthermore alleviated the feelings of dread of Southerners who felt Harrison may have abolitionist leanings. Tyler had been a bad habit presidential hopeful in 1836, and having him on the ticket may win Virginia, the most crowded state in the South. One of the tradition directors, New York distributer Thurlow Weed, asserted that "Tyler was at long last taken on the grounds that we could get no one else to acknowledge"Ã¢ÂÂ however he didn't state this until after the resulting break between President Tyler and the Whig Party. Other Tyler adversaries asserted that he had sobbed himself into the White House, in the wake of crying at Clay's annihilation; this was improbable, as the Kentuckian had supported Tyler's adversary Rives in the Senate race. Tyler's name was submitted in the balloting, and however Virginia avoided, he got the vital greater part. Tyler, as president, was blamed for having picked up the selection by covering his perspectives, and reacted that he had not been gotten some information about them. His biographer, Robert Seager II, held that Tyler was chosen due to a shortage of elective hopefuls. Seager closed, "He was put on the ticket to attract the South to Harrison. No more, no less."
