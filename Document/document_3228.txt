In "The Psychology of Joss Whedon", two scholastic analysts recognize the wellspring of Buffy's quality as her mom, matched with Giles' mentorship. Joyce did not know up and down that Buffy was a Slayer and experienced issues tolerating what her little girl was called to do. She was in any case constantly mindful and accessible when Buffy's certainty was shaken, and both Joyce's and Giles' dedication to her "gave her the confidence to employ her capacity to its maximum capacity". Joyce filled in as a parent figure to the majority of Buffy's companions, whose home lives were frequently flimsy or cold, in this way making her demise progressively impactful to every one of them. Willow makes reference to her folks a few times all through the arrangement, yet her dad is never observed. Her mom is depicted just once in "Gingerbread", at first as a scholastic so distracted with her profession that she is unfit to speak with Willow, and after thatÃ¢ÂÂwith JoyceÃ¢ÂÂunder the spell of an evil presence and in the throes of sentimental hysteria, endeavoring to consume her own girl at the stake for being engaged with black magic. Xander's folks are portrayed by him and the individuals who have been to his home as alcoholic and verbally injurious. Indeed, even Anya, seriously needing in social graces, has lost somebody she appreciates and trusts. Giles additionally laments for the departure of a companion andÃ¢ÂÂin one scene when the grown-ups fall under a spell making them retreat into a pre-adult expressÃ¢ÂÂa darling. Lorna Jowett in "Sex and the Slayer" composes that Joyce speaks to dependability and typicality. For the Scoobies, her demise pulverizes the dream that typical life is without inconvenience; it is similarly as trying as experiencing heavenly powers.
