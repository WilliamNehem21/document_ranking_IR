During World War II, production peaked again, first exceeding 1,000,000 metric tons in 1941. Aluminium was heavily used in aircraft production and thus a strategic material of extreme importance; so much so that when Alcoa (successor of Hall's Pittsburgh Reduction Company and the aluminium production monopolist in the United States at the time) did not expand its production, the United States Secretary of the Interior proclaimed in 1941, "If America loses the war, it can thank the Aluminum Corporation of America". In 1939, Germany was world's leading producer of aluminium; the Germans thus saw aluminium as their edge in the war. Aluminium coins continued to be used but while they symbolized decline on introduction, by 1939, they had come to represent power. (In 1941, they began to be withdrawn from circulation.) After the United Kingdom was attacked in 1940, it started an ambitious program of aluminium recycling; the newly appointed Minister of Aircraft Production appealed to the public to donate any household aluminium for airplane building. The Soviet Union received 328,100 metric tons of aluminium from its co-combatants from 1941 to 1945; this aluminium would be used in aircraft and tank engines. Without these shipments, the output of the Soviet aircraft industry would have fallen by over a half. Production fell after the war but then rose again.
