Albeit volunteer eagerness was basic to the Association's arrangements in the Harvest Campaign, it didn't depend on it at the larger amounts; the state seats were redressed, both by compensation and commission. J.W. Gibbes, assistant of the South Carolina House of Representatives, was procured as that state's official chief; he attempted to sell 100,000 coins and got just shy of $3,500 in pay and commissions, all paid in 1926. Neighborhood volunteers sorted out Chamber of Commerce lunch meetings to sell coins all through the South; sections of the UDC obtained pieces to present to enduring Civil War veterans. The standard for Florida was 175,000 coins, with every town and city allocated its offer. Frequently, Kiwanis or Rotary gatherings endorsed nearby portions. Mrs. N. Burton Bass of Atlanta was accounted for to be the main merchant, once discarding 233 coins in an evening. A progression of move balls respected the UDC individuals who sold vast quantities of pieces. In any case, Hyder and Colbert recommended that there was "a general absence of more women, for example, Mrs. Bass"; numerous regions experienced difficulty discovering neighborhood seats. Outside the South, deals were advanced by three expert marketing specialists employed by the Association. To keep open intrigue high, the Association discharged Lukeman's originations for Stone Mountain, which were on a littler scale than Borglum's. Lukeman imagined a downsized idea, of the three Confederate pioneers on horseback. In spite of the crusade, deals were slower than anticipated. In late 1925, the Association offered Northern banks a commission of seven pennies a coin; it is questionable if any took up the offer. The proceeding with restriction of the GAR to the coins hosed deals in the North, and there was significant analysis of the coin issue in papers.
