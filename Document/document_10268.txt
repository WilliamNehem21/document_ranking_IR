In 1909, Robert Broom visited the accumulation of the British Museum of Natural History. He reasoned that Owen had blended the fractional contorted skull, teeth, and a mandible of a pareiasaur and an incomplete upper jaw of a dinosaur, BMNH 47338, which were really from two distinct species. Floor brush kept the name "Anthodon" for the pareiasaur, however distinguished the other fossil as an individual from the class "Palaeoscincus", naming the new species "Paleoscincus africanus" in 1912. He found that the life structures of the teeth were very extraordinary, despite the fact that they took after one another, just as those of "Stegosaurus". In 1929, Franz Nopcsa, ignorant of Broom's past distribution, gave a second novel name as D.M.S. Watson trusted that the jaw ought to be separated from "Anthodon". Nopcsa named the species "Paranthodon Owenii", with the nonexclusive name got from the Latin "para", signifying "comparative", "close", or "next to", and "Anthodon", and explicit name respecting Owen. Per current traditions, the particular name was later improved to "owenii". The two names were brought into the present classification by Walter P. Coombs in his 1971 paper as the new blend "Paranthodon africanus", as the name "Paranthodon" was the principal new conventional name for the fossils and "africanus" was the main new explicit name. This makes "Paranthodon africanus" the correct name for the taxon recently known as "Palaeoscincus africanus" and "Paranthodon owenii".
