At the point when the Cold War started in the mid-1940s, the NAACP separated itself from Communists, in case its subsidizing or notoriety endure. The NAACP tried harder in 1947 after "Life" magazine distributed a piece by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. guaranteeing that the NAACP was intensely impacted by Communists. Disregarding the NAACP's wants, Du Bois kept on hobnobbing with socialist sympathizers, for example, Paul Robeson, Howard Fast and Shirley Graham (his future second spouse). Du Bois stated "I am not a communistÃÂ ... Then again, IÃÂ ... believeÃÂ ... that Karl MarxÃÂ ... put his finger soundly upon our difficultiesÃÂ ...". In 1946, Du Bois composed articles giving his appraisal of the Soviet Union; he didn't grasp socialism and he condemned its autocracy. In any case, he felt that free enterprise was in charge of neediness and bigotry, and felt that communism was an elective that may enhance those issues. The Soviets unequivocally dismissed racial qualifications and class refinements, driving Du Bois to reason that the USSR was the "most confident nation on earth." Du Bois' relationship with noticeable socialists made him a risk for the NAACP, particularly since the FBI was beginning to forcefully explore socialist sympathizers; soÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ by common agreementÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ he left the NAACP for the second time in late 1948. In the wake of leaving the NAACP, Du Bois began composing consistently for the liberal week by week paper the "National Guardian", a relationship that would suffer until 1961.
