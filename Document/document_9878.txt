The presentation of the five-penny copper-nickel piece significantly diminished the notoriety and utilization of the three-penny piece. The three-penny piece had appeared in 1865 with a mintage of more than eleven million and almost five million out of 1866; from that point strikings declined, tumbling to under a million by 1871, a figure the coin would from that point surpass just twice. The open had favored little bronze coins to paper cash, at that point the three-penny nickel piece instead of the bronze; they currently favored the five-penny nickel to the three. One purpose behind this was the base metal five-penny piece would be reclaimed by the administration whenever exhibited in $100 parcels as per an arrangement in the approving enactment. There was no such arrangement for the three-penny nickel piece; nor was there any for the other base metal coins. Following Pollock's abdication in 1866 over his protests to President Johnson's Reconstruction strategies, the new Mint Director was Henry Linderman, who in his first yearly report in 1867, depicted the reclamation statement in the nickel's approving enactment as "a most insightful and simply arrangement", asking its augmentation to the penny, two-penny piece, and three-penny piece. Postmasters were constrained to take three-penny nickel pieces in return for stamps, yet experienced issues in keeping them in the Treasury in installment of their commitments, as the legislature would take close to sixty pennies worth of them in a solitary exchange. Private people and firms also declined them past the lawful delicate farthest point; those with an excess of base metal coins frequently sold them at a markdown.
