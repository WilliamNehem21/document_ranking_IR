Davies endeavors to both make symbolism and to give a social critique in his contents; for instance, he utilizes camera headings in his contents more much of the time than fresher screenwriters to guarantee that any individual who peruses the content, particularly the chief, can "feel... the pace, the speed, the air, the mind-set, the stiflers, [and] the fear". His stage bearings additionally make an environment by their arranging and evasion of the principal individual. Despite the fact that the premise of a few of his contents get from past ideas, he asserts that most ideas for narrating have been as of now utilized, and rather endeavors to tell a generally new and engaging plot; for instance, the "Specialist Who" scene "Turn Left" shares its idea most prominently with the 1998 film "Sliding Doors". Like how "Sliding Doors" inspects two courses of events dependent on whether Helen Quilley (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets a London Underground train, Davies utilizes the decision of the Doctor's friend to turn left or ideal at a street crossing point to portray either a world with the Doctor, as observed all through the remainder of the fourth arrangement, or a substitute world without the Doctor, analyzed completely inside the scene. The world without the Doctor makes an oppressed world which he uses to give a critique on Nazi-esque one party rule. Davies for the most part endeavors to make his contents "very nitty gritty, however extremely brief", and shuns the long character and set portrayals; rather, he restrains himself to just three descriptors to depict a character and two lines to depict a set to enable the exchange to depict the story.
