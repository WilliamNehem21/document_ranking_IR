While working on "Covert Operations", Klepacki composed "Hell March" from the idea of "a rock tune to marching boots," finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff. Upon listening, director Brett Sperry insisted this song be used as the signature theme of "Command & Conquer: Red Alert." Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samplesâincluding marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored "Red Alert" with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the "Red Alert" team to expand upon the style of "Command & Conquer". In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like "Workmen" and "Crush", then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as "Vector" and "Roll Out". Klepacki scored "Fogger" and "Mud", one of his personal favorites, before finishing with "Militant Force" and "Radio 2". He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by Kane and an Allied commander in the cut scenes of "Red Alert". He previously appeared as a Nod soldier and the voice of the commando in "Command & Conquer" and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.
