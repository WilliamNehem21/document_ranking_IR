Lindow Man's official name is LindowÂ II, as there are other finds from the area: LindowÂ I (Lindow Woman) refers to a human skull, LindowÂ III to a "fragmented headless body", and LindowÂ IV to the upper thigh of an adult male, possibly that of Lindow Man. After the discovery of Lindow Man, there were no further archaeological excavations at Lindow Moss until 1987. A large piece of skin was found by workmen on the elevator on 6 February 1987. On this occasion, the police left the investigation to the archaeologists. Over 70Â pieces were found, constituting LindowÂ III. Although the bone was not as well preserved as that of Lindow Man, the other tissues survived in better condition. The final discovery was that of LindowÂ IV on 14 June 1988. Part of a left leg and buttocks were found on the elevator, from a site just west of where Lindow Man was found. Nearly three months later, on 12 September, a right thigh was discovered in the peat on the bucket of a digger. The proximity of the discovery sites, coupled with the fact that the remains were shown to come from an adult male, means that LindowÂ IV is probably part of Lindow Man.
