The most punctual of the Gothic Revival places of worship depended freely on the Early English style, with single or matched lancet windows between braces in the sides of the congregation, and ventured triple lancets at the east end. Others were in a "stilted Perpendicular" style, with "dainty west towers, flimsy braces, fat zeniths, and insides with three displays and mortar vaults".

In addition to other things, they contended that in addition to the fact that Gothic should be the main right and appropriate style for houses of worship, however that their highlights ought to be exact portrayals of that style; they ought to be "right" Gothic highlights, as opposed to being inexactly gotten from the style.
