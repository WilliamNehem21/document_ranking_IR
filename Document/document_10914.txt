In 1995, Smith enlisted a spare in each appearance from April 28 to June 25. On June 11, he spared his sixteenth back to back diversion to break the significant class record set by Doug Jones in 1988. He ran his streak to 19 diversions before at last blowing a save money on June 28. (John Wetteland broke the record the following year by sparing 24 straight). In the wake of keeping his ERA at 0.00 through the initial two months of the period, he was chosen to his seventh and last All-Star Game, consequently ending up just the fourth player to be an All-Star for four distinct groups (after Walker Cooper, George Kell and Goose Gossage). Smith did not admission well for the following month, pushing his ERA as far as possible up to 5.40. In any case, the Angels held a twofold digit lead in the division and appeared to be set for the postseason. Rather, California endured one of the most noticeably awful crumples in real association history, blowing the whole twofold digit lead in under about a month and a half. While the remainder of the group was reeling, Smith returned to his initial season structure and pitched fabulously throughout the previous two months, just blowing one spare endeavor in that range. He completed the season with 37 spares and a 3.47 ERA, which was in excess of a point higher than the class normal.
