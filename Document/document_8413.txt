After touching base in Charleston, Howe went about as an auxiliary to Major General Charles Lee, who had been designated Commander of the Southern Department of the Continental Army. Howe legitimately told the South Carolina volunteer army amid the First Siege of Charleston in June 1776 and was alloted order over the resistances of the city appropriate. Lee was reviewed toward the North to help General George Washington, and in his nonattendance, James Moore was designated Commander of the Southern Department. Howe was left in direction of Charleston and Savannah, Georgia in Lee's nonappearance, and in September 1776, he wound up entangled in a discussion including the common get together of South Carolina enabling its officers to enroll fighters from North Carolina's mainland line units. Howe begged the Provincial Congress of North Carolina to enable South Carolina to enroll inside the previous state's outskirts on account of the more prominent number of white guys in that state. In the long run, North Carolina agreed to that demand yet simply in the wake of requesting Howe to recover the North Carolinians who had just been tricked away by the South Carolinians. The South Carolina Council disapproved and requested that Howe pay the enrollment rewards for the men in the event that he wished to have them back. With James Moore's demise on April 15, 1777, Howe accepted direction of the Southern Department.
