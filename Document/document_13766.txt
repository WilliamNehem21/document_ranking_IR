Amid the last 50% of 2002, Sasha worked together with enormous beat craftsman Junkie XL on the single "Breezer". Addict XL, alongside Charlie May, likewise helped Sasha on his second collection of unique material, "Airdrawndagger". "Airdrawndagger" took quite a while to create because of Sasha's craving for the collection to be "as close to flawlessness as could reasonably be expected." That March, Sasha endured a punctured eardrum in a car crash, further postponing the collection's generation. In spite of the fact that the mishap incidentally impeded his hearing, he drew motivation for the collection from his difficulty. "Airdrawndagger" was at long last discharged, in August 2002, to much flourish. In any case, the collection was "got with a great deal of head scratching", as indicated by Sasha, which he credited to its surprising blend of kinds. The collection did not include the heavier "club sound" of Sasha's past blend collections, looking to some extent like surrounding music. "Airdrawndagger" by and large gotten ideal audits, however commentators noticed that it was not as predictable and very much created as his DJ blends. Sasha himself portrayed it as "a narrow minded, somewhat liberal record", however he keeps up that he is "content with it right up 'til today". A few pundits, in any case, called it "drowsy"; "E!Online" depicted it as being "more allied with Yanni than Moby". To empower audience members' advantage, Sasha held a novice remix challenge for the collection's single, "Wavy Gravy". Because of the challenge's prosperity, Sasha discharged every one of the tracks from "Airdrawndagger" on his site, with the goal that fans could download and make their own variants.
