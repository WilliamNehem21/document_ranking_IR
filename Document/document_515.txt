Hu's most prominent work is the "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy" ("Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu", ), a collection of around 320 prints by around thirty unique specialists (counting Hu himself), distributed in 1633. It comprises of eight segments, covering calligraphy, bamboo, blooms, rocks, winged animals and creatures, plums, orchids and organic product. A portion of these areas had been discharged beforehand as single volumes. Just as a gathering of fine arts, it was additionally proposed as an imaginative groundwork, with guidelines on right brush position and strategy and a few pictures intended for novices to duplicate. In spite of the fact that these guidelines just show up in the areas on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the main case of an absolute and diagnostic way to deal with Chinese painting. In this book, Hu utilized his various square printing strategies to acquire degrees of shading in the pictures, as opposed to evident diagrams or covers. The manual is bound in the "butterfly official" ("hudie zhuang", ) style, whereby entire folio representations are collapsed with the goal that each involves a twofold page spread. This coupling style enables the peruser to lay the book level so as to take a gander at a specific picture. Cambridge University Library discharged a total computerized sweep of the manual, including all works and delineations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, "The coupling is so delicate, and the manual so sensitive, that until it was digitized, we have never had the capacity to give anybody a chance to glance through it or study it Ã¢ÂÂ in spite of its undoubted significance to researchers."
