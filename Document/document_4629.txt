"Salon.com" author Jonah Weiner said of the principal season, "Every scene ended up pretty much a similar way, with the mortification of Poehler's unrealistic, delightfully doofy civil servant". A few faultfinders said the show's characters and generally tone were too gutless in the early scenes. While commentators adulated different cast individuals in individual scenes, some said the supporting characters as a rule should have been all the more completely created and furnished with better material. A few composed that a portion of the subplots were excessively unsurprising and gambled getting to be stale, for example, Leslie's long-standing pound on Mark and the topic of whether Andy and Ann would continue dating. Others said Leslie was excessively unintelligent and ditzy. Schur said that was not the aim of the journalists, and the criticism incited changes to the character in the second season. A long time after the principal season finished, Schur said he trusted a significant part of the early analysis originated from the way that groups of onlookers were not yet acquainted with the characters, and he trusted watchers who returned to the scenes delighted in them more since they had been able to realize the characters better as the arrangement advanced.
