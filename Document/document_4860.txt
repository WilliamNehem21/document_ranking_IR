After the passing of Manuel I and the consequent death of the Komnenian administration in 1185, the naval force declined quickly. The support of galleys and the upkeep of capable teams were over the top expensive, and disregard prompted a fast decay of the armada. As of now by 1182 the Byzantines needed to pay Venetian soldiers of fortune to group a portion of their galleys, yet during the 1180s, as the main part of the Komnenian maritime foundation endured, endeavors of 70Ã¢ÂÂ 100 boats are as yet recorded in contemporary sources. Along these lines Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (1183Ã¢ÂÂ 1185) could in any case assemble 100 warships in 1185 to oppose and later annihilation a Norman armada in the Sea of Marmara. Be that as it may, the ensuing harmony arrangement incorporated a proviso which required the Normans to outfit an armada for the Empire. This, together with a comparable understanding made by Isaac II Angelos (1185Ã¢ÂÂ 1195 and 1203Ã¢ÂÂ 1204) with Venice the following year, in which the Republic would give 40Ã¢ÂÂ 100 galleys at a half year's notice in return for ideal exchanging concessions, is a telling sign that the Byzantine government knew about the insufficiency of its own maritime foundation.
