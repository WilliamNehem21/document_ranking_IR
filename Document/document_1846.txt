Prior to her appearance on TV, Smith had performed aggressively in the Kettering, Northamptonshire Eisteddfod, the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod, the Pontins Junior Starquest rivalry and Festival 4 Stars. She tried out for the second arrangement of the ITV unscripted TV drama "England's Got Talent", giving what Jon O'Brien, of Allmusic, called a "develop" execution of "Ave Maria", and was put through to the live shows. Simon Cowell portrayed her tryout as "the best tryout I've heard in years". Prior to performing live, she and Andrew Johnston were top picks to win. She won her semi-last by the open vote, playing out a front of Sarah McLachlan's "Heavenly attendant". This put her in the last, and left her as the most loved to win. Amid her initially live show, Cowell depicted her as "truly one of every a million". She at that point performed in the live last, where she was portrayed by Cowell as one of the five demonstrations (alongside George Sampson, Johnston, Signature and Kate and Gin) who got an opportunity of winning. She again performed "Ave Maria", yet completed outside the main three. Sampson in the long run won the show because of the telephone in, with Signature second, and Johnston third. Because of her last execution of "Ave Maria", Smith was welcome to be a visitor vocalist at a songwriting grants service in London. She at that point proceeded to perform in the Britain's Got Talent Live Tour with different candidates, where she previously played out a two part harmony of "Strolling in the Air" with Johnston.
