Lesbians delineated in writing were moderately uncommon during the 1950s. It was the distributer's arrangement in any novel including lesbianism that the characters could never get any fulfillment from the relationship. One or both normally wound up ending it all, going crazy, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker talks about this in the 2004 foreword of "Spring Fire": she was told by supervisor Dick Carroll that on the grounds that the books were dispersed by the U.S. Mail station rather than privately owned businesses conveying legitimately to stores, postal controllers would send the books back to the distributer if homosexuality was delineated decidedly. The Postal Service loosened up their control after a few First Amendment vulgarity preliminaries, including Roth v. US and another with respect to Allen Ginsberg's "Wail" in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a small portion of opportunity in her plots. In spite of the fact that the completion of "Odd Girl Out" did not veer excessively a long way from the inadmissible goals recipe of "Spring Fire", "Ladies' Barracks", and Radclyffe Hall's "The Well of Loneliness", it analyzed Laura's inside battle in the acknowledgment that regardless of her gentility, she was profoundly enamored with another lady, and toward the end she grasped it, which was uncommon in lesbian fiction.
