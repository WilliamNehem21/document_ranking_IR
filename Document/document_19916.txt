In November 1940, with the support of the leader of the "Volksgruppe in RumÃ¤nien" (ethnic Germans in Romania), Andreas Schmidt, Phleps wrote to the key "Waffen-SS" recruiting officer "SS-BrigadefÃ¼hrer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS" (Brigadier) Gottlob Berger offering his services to the Third Reich. He subsequently asked for permission to leave Romania in order to join the "Wehrmacht", and this was approved by the recently installed Romanian "ConducÄtor" (dictator), General Ion Antonescu. Phleps volunteered for the "Waffen-SS" instead, enlisting under his mother's maiden name of Stolz. According to the historian Hans Bergel, Phleps joined the "Waffen-SS" because "Volksdeutsche" were not permitted to join the "Wehrmacht". He was appointed an "SS-StandartenfÃ¼hrer" (colonel) by "ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS" Heinrich Himmler and joined the SS Motorised Division "Wiking", where he commanded Dutch, Flemish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish volunteers. When Hilmar WÃ¤ckerle, the commander of SS-Regiment "Westland", was killed in action near Lvov in late June 1941, Phleps took over command of that regiment. He distinguished himself in fighting at Kremenchuk and Dnipropetrovsk in the Ukraine, commanded his own "Kampfgruppe", became a confidant of "Generalmajor" (Brigadier General) Hans-Valentin Hube, commander of the 16th Panzer Division, and was subsequently promoted to "SS-OberfÃ¼hrer" (senior colonel). In July 1941 he was awarded the 1939 clasp to his Iron Cross (1914) 2nd Class and then the Iron Cross (1939) 1st Class.
