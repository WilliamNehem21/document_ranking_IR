Rosendale's first ski jumping competition was held on JanuaryÂ 24, 1937. The ski track was designed by Harold Schelderup, a ski hill designer from Norway. Bad weather caused the cancellation of competitive events, but a skiing exhibition still occurred. That April, the Telemark club held a special dinner in Brooklyn to honor members who performed well in the January competition. The club planned to hold a summer competition by covering the mountain with "straw and pine needles". Harold Schelderup, who was recognized at the dinner for his skills, performed in the summer tournament. Joppenbergh's ski track was coated with borax, and the tournament was held on JulyÂ 18, 1937 at 2:30 in the afternoon, with enough parking provided for 500 cars. In front of a crowd of 3,300 people, "jumpers took off from an in-run covered with borax and landed on a hill covered with mats and carpets topped with straw and borax".

Although Satre's record was expected to be beaten by more than , the winner of the JanuaryÂ 23, 1938 competition was Norwegian skier Nils Eie, who jumped only . Harold Schelderup also participated in the competition, which was held the week after he won a separate tournament in White Plains. Another Joppenbergh tournament was planned for MarchÂ 7, 1938. Competitions were held in 1940 and 1941. The length of the slope was increased to in 1941, but the United States' entrance into World War II caused skiers to enter the military, and competitions were not held after the war.
