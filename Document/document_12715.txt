In any case, the content is vague, making it flawed that Henry ever develops. As commentator Donald Gibson expressed in "The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero", "the novel undermines itself. It says there is no response to the inquiries it raises; yet it says the inverse... It says that Henry Fleming at last considers things to be they are; it says he is a swindled trick. It says that Henry does not consider things to be they are; however nobody else does either." Although Crane commentator and biographer Stallman composed of Henry's "otherworldly change" before the finish of the story, he likewise discovered this subject hard to support in light of the novel's mysterious completion. Despite the fact that Henry "advances upwards toward masculinity and good triumph", as he starts to develop by disappearing from his past "sentimental ideas," "the instruction of the saint finishes as it started: in self misleading." Critic William B. Dillingham additionally noticed the novel's bravery oddity, particularly as far as the thoughtful Henry's slip by into unreasoning self-desert in the second 50% of the book. Dillingham expressed that "so as to be fearless, a man in time of physical struggle must desert the most noteworthy of his human offices, reason and creative ability, and act instinctually, even carnally."
