Stays later distinguished through DNA testing as the Romanovs and their workers were found in the forested areas outside Yekaterinburg in 1991. Two bodies, Alexei and one of his sisters, for the most part thought to be either Maria or Anastasia, were missing. On 23 August 2007, a Russian excavator reported the disclosure of two copied, incomplete skeletons at a campfire site close Yekaterinburg that seemed to coordinate the site depicted in Yurovsky's journals. The archeologists said the bones are from a kid who was generally between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the season of his demise and of a young lady who was generally between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years of age. Anastasia was seventeen years, one month old at the season of the death, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her sibling Alexei was two weeks short of his fourteenth birthday celebration. Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years of age at the season of the death. Alongside the remaining parts of the two bodies, archeologists discovered "shards of a compartment of sulfuric corrosive, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and slugs of different gauge." The bones were discovered utilizing metal identifiers and metal poles as tests.
