The extensive number of marks required (start with the 1913 race, 9,399 marks were required) implied that just an issue fit for stirring a great part of the territory could prompt a choice. Forbiddance was such an issue. The Conservatives were supporters of such a choice (amid the first Alberta Legislative Assembly, Conservative Cornelius Hiebert had upheld restriction or, coming up short that, an administration imposing business model on liquor deals), however Sifton and his Liberals were less eager. They knew the aid to government coffers that alcohol deals spoke to, and were not anxious to estrange either the UFA's ethical reformers or the region's hoteliers and saloonkeepers. When the submission enactment was set up, be that as it may, its promoters squandered no time: in 1914 the assembly acknowledged a request bearing 23,656 names, and properly called a choice regarding the matter. The Alberta denial submission passed resoundingly, and the lawmaking body passed the Prohibition Act in the spring of 1916. At first the new Act seemed effective: in 1917 there were 5,151 feelings for all violations crosswise over Alberta, when contrasted with a yearly normal of 12,706 over the previous four years. When the area's requirement of the demonstration was uncovered as being either intentionally remiss or simply purposeless, contingent upon the onlooker, Sifton had left office.
