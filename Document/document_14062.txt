For a long time, Harrison was confined in his songwriting commitments to the Beatles' collections, yet he discharged "Everything Must Pass", a triple collection with two circles of his tunes and the third of chronicles of Harrison sticking with companions. The collection was viewed by numerous individuals as his best work, and it beat the diagrams on the two sides of the Atlantic. The LP delivered the main hit single "My Sweet Lord" and the best ten single "What Is Life". The collection was co-delivered by Phil Spector utilizing his "Mass of Sound" approach, and the performers included Starr, Clapton, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, the entire of Delaney and Bonnie's Friends band and the Apple aggregate Badfinger. On discharge, "Everything Must Pass" was gotten with basic recognition; Ben Gerson of "Moving Stone" portrayed it as being "of great Spectorian extents, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of peaks and immense skylines". Creator and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the verses of the collection's title track "an acknowledgment of the temporariness of human existenceÃÂ ... a basic and powerful end" to Harrison's previous band. In 1971, Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright encroachment over "My Sweet Lord", inferable from its comparability to the 1963 Chiffons hit "He's So Fine". At the point when the case was heard in the United States area court in 1976, he denied purposely counterfeiting the melody, yet lost the case, as the judge decided that he had done as such subliminally.
