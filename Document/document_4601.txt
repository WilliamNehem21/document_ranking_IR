The palace shaped the scenery for a few scenes in William Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part 1" and "Section 2". Another Henry Percy acquired the family bequests in 1585 and accepted the title of 9thÃÂ Earl of Northumberland. After the fizzled Gunpowder Plot of 1605, the baron was detained for his association with Thomas Percy, one of the plotters. In a matter of seconds before he was condemned (he was fined ÃÂ£30,000 and held in the Tower of London), the duke rented Warkworth Castle to Sir Ralph Gray, who claimed Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. Dim ignored the lord's structure and enabled it to fall further into deterioration. The lead from the structures in the bailey was sold in 1607 to ease the lord's money related issues. At the point when JamesÃÂ I visited in 1617 in transit to Scotland, his escort was irritated by the sorry condition of the chÃÂ¢teau. With the unification of England and Scotland under a solitary ruler, the barons of Northumberland had no requirement for two extraordinary manors close to the Anglo-Scottish outskirt; they kept up Alnwick to the detriment of Warkworth. In the main quarter of the 17thÃÂ century, the keep was utilized to hold house courts and for the spreading out of oats.
