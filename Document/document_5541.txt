In the wake of finishing his doctorate, Sledd acquired an arrangement as a teacher of Greek at Methodist-subsidiary Southern University (presently known as BirminghamÃ¢ÂÂ Southern College) in Greensboro, Alabama. A while later, on July 6, 1904, he was consistently chosen to be the leader of the University of Florida at Lake City by its leading group of trustees. At the season of his arrangement, the University of Florida at Lake City was encountering its very own discussion: its organization and personnel were miserably cracked by identity clashes and its disagreeable president's fizzled endeavors at improving the little school's guidance and scholarly standing. The college's leading group of trustees had evacuated the inadequate president, and expelled seven individuals from its little workforce. The college, for example, it was, had been known as "Florida Agricultural College" until 1903. At the point when Sledd landed in Lake City, it was a school with another name, a personnel broken by argumentative identities, an obscure number of returning understudies and an unsure future. Sledd required all past employees to re-apply on the off chance that they wanted to keep their occupations, procured substitution educators, the vast majority of whom had earned doctoral degrees in their particular fields (as opposed to the past personnel), and start concocting thorough scholastic principles for the school's new understudies. Despite the fact that the college was an assigned land-allow school under the central government's Morrill Act, it got deficient yearly budgetary help from the state government, and its accounts stayed dubious.
