"Brigg Fair" (1907) announced the composer's full stylistic maturity, the first of the pieces for small orchestra that confirm Delius's status as a musical poet, with the influences of Wagner and Grieg almost entirely absent. The work was followed in the next few years by "In a Summer Garden" (1908), "Life's Dance" (1911), "Summer Night on the River" (1911) and "On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring" (1912). The critic R.W.S. Mendl described this sequence as "exquisite nature studies", with a unity and shape lacking in the earlier formal tone poems. These works became part of the standard English concert repertory, and helped to establish the character of Delius's music in the English concert-goer's mind, although according to Ernest Newman, the concentration on these works to the neglect of his wider output may have done Delius as much harm as good. The typical mature Delian orchestral sound is apparent in these works, through the division of the strings into ten or more sections, punctuated by woodwind comments and decorations. In the "North Country Sketches" of 1913â14, Delius divides the strings into 12 parts, and harps, horns, clarinets and bassoons evoke a lifeless winter scene. In Payne's view, the "Sketches" are the high water mark of Delius's compositional skill, although Fenby awards the accolade to the later "Eventyr (Once Upon a Time)" (1917).
