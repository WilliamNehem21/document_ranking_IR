As indicated by Sony, Ready at Dawn used "cutting edge visual advances" that permitted "higher quality situations and characters." "Apparition of Sparta" offers "over 25% more interactivity" than "Chains of Olympus", while including more adversaries screen and progressively supervisor experiences. Advancement of "Phantom of Sparta" took 23 months to finish. Because of Weerasuriya's calendar at Ready at Dawn, he couldn't come back to coordinate; Dana Jan, the lead level architect for "Chains of Olympus", progressed toward becoming executive for "Apparition of Sparta". At Comic-Con 2010, Jan noticed that when advancement started in 2008, the objective was to make the amusement greater than "Chains of Olympus", which had clearly pushed the PSP to its practical breaking points. Jan expressed that "Phantom of Sparta" took the PSP to its "outright limit", with another element being more on-screen adversaries. The amusement idea was initially utilized as a secret for players who got the platinum trophy from "Divine force of War III". The trophy uncovered a site called spartansstandtall.com, which turned into the official site for "Apparition of Sparta" on May 4. Jan expressed the reason they had the diversion happen between "Divine force of War" and "Lord of War II" was on the grounds that "It appeared to bode well to fill in that void."
