Bridport gave guidelines as he pulled back for "Alexandre", "Impressive" and "Tigre" to be taken under tow by HMS "Sovereign", HMS "Barfleur" and HMS "Ruler George" separately. The British armada was in great condition: five boats had seen no activity at all and of those that had battled, just "Ruler Charlotte" had endured any huge harm, essentially to her gear. The British armada had lost 31 men slaughtered and 113 injured; "Ruler Charlotte" and "Giant" had the heaviest losses of 36 and 35 separately. Bridport put prize groups on the caught vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the armada back eastwards once it had achieved a sheltered separation from the coast, so as to offer help for Warren's campaign to Quiberon. Warren handled the French Royalist powers at Carnac on 27 June, however the attack finished in a fiasco a month later, the enduring Royalists driven back to the coast and gathered by Warren. Bridport had stayed off Quiberon to guarantee that Villaret did not come back to annoy the expeditionary power, coming back to Britain on 20 September however leaving the majority of the bar armada off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey. The 68-year-old Bridport was persuasively resigned in October after a disconnected contention with First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Spencer, however was restored in 1796 and kept on serving in order of the Channel Fleet until 1800.
