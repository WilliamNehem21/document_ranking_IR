Directing his concentration toward books, his first book, "Adrenaline", was distributed under the pen name Dillinger. An account of two gay criminal darlings on the run, it foretold the parody and medication filled viciousness so unmistakable in his later books. Here Baker started building up the topics that ruled his following works: political agitation; irate and fairly distrustful gay men; the dim underside of Los Angeles, compared with its radiant outward picture; the pietism of composed religion; mysterious sex and its suggestions in the period of AIDS; and homophobia and the mistreatment of gays in a Republican ruled America. Its plot gadget of dark horse characters constrained into trip because of conditions outside their ability to control was one Baker investigated in the majority of his resulting work. The unobtrusive accomplishment of this novel urged him to dedicate himself to what have turned into his best known works, "Fuel-Injected Dreams" (a novel rotating around a character approximately dependent on record maker Phil Spector) and the 1986 discharge "Kid Wonder". After the novel was distributed, he quit screenwriting so as to exclusively focus on books. He spent the greater part of every day composing and looking into, and carried on characters and scenes of his books on tape to consummate the discourse.
