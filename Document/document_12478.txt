ÃÂthelhelm is just recorded in Alfred's will of the mid-880s, and most likely kicked the bucket sooner or later in the following decade, yet ÃÂthelwold is recorded above Edward in the main contract where he shows up, presumably demonstrating a higher status. ÃÂthelwold may likewise have had favorable position since his mom Wulfthryth saw a sanction as ruler, while Edward's mom Ealhswith never had a higher status than lord's better half. Be that as it may, Alfred was in a situation to give his very own child extensive points of interest. In his will, he just left a bunch of bequests to his sibling's children, and the majority of his property to Edward, including all his booklands (land vested in a contract which could be estranged by the holder, rather than folkland, which needed to go to beneficiaries of the body) in Kent. Alfred likewise propelled men who could be relied upon to help his arrangements for his progression, for example, his brother by marriage, a Mercian ealdorman called ÃÂthelwulf, and his child in-law ÃÂthelred. Edward saw a few of his dad's sanctions, and regularly went with him on regal peregrinations. In a Kentish contract of 898 Edward saw as "rex Saxonum", recommending that Alfred may have pursued the procedure received by his granddad Egbert of fortifying his child's case to prevail toward the West Saxon position of authority by making him sub-ruler of Kent.
