During the 1920s, Norman Hastings based on Berry's theory proposing Bury as the Ripper, and 100 years after the Ripper murders William Beadle and Dundee administrator Euan Macpherson distributed books and articles advancing Bury as a Ripper suspect. They featured that the authoritative five Whitechapel murders finished in November 1888, which generally corresponded with Bury's takeoff from Whitechapel. There was spray painting at Bury's Dundee level that suggested that Jack the Ripper lived there, and Macpherson assumed this was composed by Bury as a type of admission. William took Ellen's rings, and the Ripper is accepted to have taken rings from unfortunate casualty Annie Chapman. Cover was tirelessly brutal to his better half, undermined her with a blade, and cut open her stomach area after death in a way not at all like the Whitechapel killer. In a discussion with her neighbors, Marjory Smith, who ran the shop over the Burys' Prince's Street level in Dundee, solicited them "What kind of work was this you Whitechapel society have been tied in with, letting Jack the Ripper slaughter such a large number of individuals?" Bury did not answer her, however Ellen answered "Jack the Ripper is tranquil at this point." She apparently told another neighbor, "Jack the Ripper is taking a rest." Beadle and Macpherson contended that Ellen's remarks may demonstrate that she knew about the Ripper's whereabouts.
