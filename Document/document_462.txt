In March 1909, Boyce set out on a two-month trek to Europe, which incorporated a visit to his little girls, who were in Rome. On coming back to America, Boyce sorted out a photographic endeavor to Africa with the inventive elevated picture taker George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with safari coordinators and suppliers and provisioned his campaign in London and Naples. His child Benjamin and Lawrence's child Raymond were a piece of the campaign. Sketch artist John T. McCutcheon joined the endeavor while they were cruising from Naples to Africa. The gathering landed at Mombasa, Kenya, and was in Nairobi by September. In the wake of procuring neighborhood watchmen and guides, the whole undertaking totaled around 400 individuals, around three-fourths of whom were hirelings. It required 15 train vehicles to move the general population and hardware to the zone the undertaking would investigate close Kijabi and Lake Victoria. The endeavor was a disappointment in light of the fact that a zooming focal point was neither brought nor along these lines acquired, the sight-seeing balloons were not reasonable for the conditions on the fields of East Africa, and the cameras were so expansive and loud to move into position that the creatures were frightened off. The individuals from the endeavor needed to turn to purchasing photos of major game creatures from shops in urban areas, for example, Nairobi. The undertaking managed to effectively chase a few types of major game creatures.
