Alabama half dollars were first set at a bargain on October 26, 1921, the day of President Harding's visit to Birmingham, Alabama, where he as a Mason laid the foundation for the city's new Masonic sanctuary, and as president tended to an isolated group, encouraging improvement of race relations. Coins were sold from exceptionally fabricated corners developed simply off the city's walkways. It is dubious whether these coins bore the 2X2 or not. Official records demonstrate that every one of the coins struck in October were of the 2X2 assortment, and this was for some time acknowledged by numismatic history specialists. In any case, one currency gatherer purchased two of the half dollars that day, and more than fifty later, the majority of the plain assortment, and affirmed that none of the 2X2 could have been sold in Birmingham on the principal day. As Owen composed that the initial 5,000 got bore the imprint, Swiatek presumed that 1,000 of the October mintage was of the plain assortment, every one of that was available to be purchased in Birmingham. In December, 64,038 more were printed, with 38 put aside for test. These were recorded to be of the plain assortment. Both 2X2 and plain coins were struck from a similar bite the dust; the imprint was ground off to permit coinage of plain pieces.
