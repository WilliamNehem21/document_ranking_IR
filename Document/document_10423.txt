As the centennial of Wong's introduction to the world drew closer, a reevaluation of her life and profession came to fruition; three noteworthy takes a shot at the performer showed up and thorough reviews of her movies were held at both the Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of the Moving Image in New York City. Anthony Chan's 2003 life story, "Interminably Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong (1905Ã¢ÂÂ 1961)", was the primary real work on Wong and was composed, Chan says, "from a remarkably Asian-American point of view and reasonableness". In 2004, Philip Leibfried and Chei Mi Lane's comprehensive examination of Wong's vocation, "Anna May Wong: A Complete Guide to Her Film, Stage, Radio and Television Work" was distributed, just as a second full-length memoir, "Anna May Wong: From Laundryman's Daughter to Hollywood Legend" by Graham Russell Hodges. In spite of the fact that Anna May Wong's life, vocation, and heritage reflect numerous mind boggling issues which remain a long time after her demise, Anthony Chan calls attention to that her place in Asian-American true to life history, as its first female star, is lasting. A delineated life story for kids, "Sparkling Star: The Anna May Wong Story", was distributed in 2009.
