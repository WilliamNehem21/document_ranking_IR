Debussy's works began to feature increasingly in concert programmes at home and overseas. In 1910 Gustav Mahler conducted the "Nocturnes" and "PrÃ©lude Ã  l'aprÃ¨s-midi d'un faune" in New York in successive months. In the same year, visiting Budapest, Debussy commented that his works were better known there than in Paris. In 1912 Sergei Diaghilev commissioned a new ballet score, "Jeux". That, and the three "Images", premiered the following year, were the composer's last orchestral works. "Jeux" was unfortunate in its timing: two weeks after the premiere, in March 1913, Diaghilev presented the first performance of Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring", a sensational event that monopolised discussion in musical circles, and effectively sidelined "Jeux" along with FaurÃ©'s "PÃ©nÃ©lope", which had opened a week before.
In 1915 Debussy underwent one of the earliest colostomy operations. It achieved only a temporary respite, and occasioned him considerable frustration ("There are mornings when the effort of dressing seems like one of the twelve labours of Hercules"). He also had a fierce enemy at this period in the form of Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns, who in a letter to FaurÃ© condemned Debussy's "En blanc et noir": "It's incredible, and the door of the Institut [de France] must at all costs be barred against a man capable of such atrocities." Saint-SaÃ«ns had been a member of the Institut since 1881: Debussy never became one. His health continued to decline; he gave his final concert (the premiere of his Violin Sonata) on 14 September 1917 and became bedridden in early 1918.
