Researchers, for example, Charles Oman note that one component of the kids' record, the passage into an alternate reality by method for a cavern, appears to have been very prominent. Gerald of Wales recounts to a comparative story of a kid who, in the wake of getting away from his lord, "experienced two pigmies who drove him through an underground section into a lovely land with fields and streams, however not lit by the full light of the sun". In any case, the theme is ineffectively bore witness to; E. W. Baughman records it as the main case of his F103.1 class of English and North American people story themes: "Occupants of lower world visit humans, and keep on living with them". Martin Walsh considers the references to St Martin to be noteworthy, and sees the narrative of the green kids as proof that the dining experience of Martinmas has its inceptions in an English native past, of which the kids' story frames "the most minimal stratum". A supporter of "Notes and Queries" in 1900 proposed a Celtic association: "ÃÂ 'Green' spirits are 'righteous' in Celtic writing and traditionÃÂ ... It might be in excess of a fortuitous event that the green young lady weds a 'man of [Kings] Lynn.' Here the first [Celtic word] would be "lein", abhorrent, "i.e." the unadulterated pixie weds a corrupt offspring of earth."
