Historical linguists have found that phrases consisting of nouns and numbers went through several structural changes in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese before classifiers appeared in them. The earliest forms may have been "NumberÂ âÂ Noun", like English (i.e. "five horses"), and the less common "NounÂ âÂ Number" ("horses five"), both of which are attested in the oracle bone scripts of Pre-Archaic Chinese (circa 1400Â BCE to 1000Â BCE). The first constructions resembling classifier constructions were "NounÂ âÂ NumberÂ âÂ Noun" constructions, which were also extant in Pre-Archaic Chinese but less common than "NumberÂ âÂ Noun". In these constructions, sometimes the first and second nouns were identical ("N1Â âÂ NumberÂ âÂ N1", as in "horses five horses") and other times the second noun was different, but semantically related ("N1Â âÂ NumberÂ âÂ N2"). According to some historical linguists, the "N2" in these constructions can be considered an early form of count-classifier and has even been called an "echo classifier"; this speculation is not universally agreed on, though. Although true count-classifiers had not appeared yet, mass-classifiers were common in this time, with constructions such as "wineÂ âÂ sixÂ âÂ " (the word Â "yÇu" represented a wine container) meaning "six "yÇu" of wine". Examples such as this suggest that mass-classifiers predate count-classifiers by several centuries, although they did not appear in the same word order as they do today.
