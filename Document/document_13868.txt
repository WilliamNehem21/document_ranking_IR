He spoke to the state in the United States House of Representatives and filled in as its 31st senator. Darker was chosen to the House of Representatives for three non-continuous terms, every one of which was defaced by debate. He was first chosen in 1859, regardless of his own challenges that he was not yet a quarter century old; the for serving in the council. The voters of his region chose him in any case, however he was not permitted to sit down until the Congress' second session, after he was of lawful age to serve. In the wake of moving to Henderson, Kentucky, Brown was chosen from that area in 1866. On this event, he was precluded his seat on the grounds that from securing asserted traitorousness to the Union amid the Civil War.

After an ineffective gubernatorial offer in 1871, Brown was again chosen to the House in 1872 and served three successive terms. Amid his last term, he was authoritatively rebuked for conveying a discourse abrading Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Head servant. The rebuke was later erased from the congressional record.
