Cleanser musical show observer Jenn Bishop said she thought that it was hard to clarify Todd's prominence, and that in the event that she is confounded about her sentiments in regards to him, it is justifiable that others would be also. "If I somehow managed to give a surface dimension evaluation of Todd, I'd state he's a loathsome character with practically zero saving graces," she said. "His activities, which range from the unethical to criminal, can be out and out offensive. I wouldn't have any desire to know Todd, not to mention associate with him, in actuality. Nor would I need any lady to have any kind of association with him." Instead of considering Todd to be a wannabe, she considered him to be a greater amount of "an enemy of screw-up" and expressed that what added to his intrigue was that his assault storyline was bona fide. "While Todd isn't the first (or the last) cleanser character to have carried out this wrongdoing, the realness of this specific storyline didn't leave a ton of space for modifies," Bishop remarked. "For instance, Luke's assault of Laura on "General Hospital" was reworked and for quite a long time was alluded to as a 'temptation.' There was no 'hazy area'. This current [Todd's assault of Marty] couldn't be expelled as basically the conduct of a sentimental maverick." To Bishop, the final product of this viewpoint, and that the essayists had Todd by and large pay for his violations, "was the advancement of a dynamic, eccentric, multi-faceted character with numerous qualities that contention with each other" and "[a]ll this makes for one destroyed person, interesting to the watchers and one I can't resist the urge to like".
