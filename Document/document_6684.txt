Another early impact was William Morris. In Vaughan Williams' words, "It was presently that Holst found the sentiment of solidarity with his kindred men which made him a short time later an extraordinary educator. A feeling of comradeship instead of political conviction drove him, while still an understudy, to join the Kelmscott House Socialist Club in Hammersmith." At Kelmscott House, Morris' home, Holst went to addresses by his host and Bernard Shaw. His very own communism was moderate in character, however he delighted in the club for its great organization and his esteem of Morris as a man. His beliefs were affected by Morris' yet had an alternate accentuation. Morris had expressed, "I don't need craftsmanship for a couple of anything else than instruction for a couple, or opportunity for a couple. I need all people to be instructed by their ability, not as indicated by the measure of cash which their folks happen to have". Holst stated, "'Aristocracy in craftsmanship'Ã¢ÂÂ workmanship isn't for everything except just for the picked fewÃ¢ÂÂyet the best way to locate those few is to convey workmanship to everybodyÃ¢ÂÂat that point the specialists have a kind of masonic flag by which they perceive each other in the group." He was welcome to lead the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, training them madrigals by Thomas Morley, ensembles by Purcell, and works by Mozart, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876Ã¢ÂÂ 1969), a wonderful soprano two years his lesser. He began to look all starry eyed at her; she was at first neutral by him, yet she came round and they were locked in, however with no prompt prospect of marriage given Holst's small salary.
