Work initiated on 5 October. Gear and work force were carried crosswise over to Tatana Island so it could continue from the two closures. Some of fill totalling was required to set up a roadway long and wide over the high tide mark. Work was finished on 30 October and the main ship berthed there on 3 November. Port limit was expanded from every day. Be that as it may, the venture did not continue without contention. A substantial deluge on 21 October affirmed the pilots' most noticeably awful feelings of dread, and Lieutenant General George C. Kenney, the administrator of Allied Air Forces (AAF), sent a letter to MacArthur on 26 October advising him that while work to redesign the landing strip runways before the wet season was almost finished, airplane couldn't work from them without runways, hardstands, offices and access streets, which were all a long way from prepared. He cautioned that he may need to pull back something like two squadrons back to Australia. Real General Richard Sutherland, MacArthur's head of staff at GHQ, and Brigadier General Hugh J. Casey, his main architect, consoled Kenney everything conceivable would be done to keep the landing strips operational in the wet season. Extra architect units were requested to Port Moresby, and work on the port and the Nine Mile Quarry was given over to the Australians.
