Other oviraptorosaur genera known from the Nemegt Formation incorporate the basal "Avimimus", the oviraptorids "Rinchenia", "Nomingia", and "Ajancingenia", and the caenagnathid "Elmisaurus". Furthermore, "Conchoraptor" is known from the Baruungoyot Formation. Regardless of the high number of oviraptorid taxa in these developments (the Nemegt has the most astounding known decent variety of them anyplace), none of them were firmly related. The Nemegt Formation is exceptional in having both oviraptorid and caenagnathid oviraptorosaurs, and in 1993 the Canadian scientist Phillip J. Currie and partners recommended this decent variety was because of the two gatherings leaning toward various conditions in the territory. In 2016 the Japanese scientist Takanobu Tsuihiji and associates proposed that oviraptorids may have favored drier situations, while caenagnathids favored fluvial conditions, in view of the sort of arrangements they have been found in. Funston and partners proposed that oviraptorids were found in both xeric and mesic situations (however were increasingly inexhaustible in the previous), while the other oviraptorosaur bunches kept away from the xeric conditions, and that the concurrence of the families can be clarified by specialty apportioning in eating regimen. The earth of the Nemegt Formation may have gone about as a desert garden and along these lines pulled in oviraptorids.
