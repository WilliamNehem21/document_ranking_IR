In the same year, Rix Nicholas created one of her most extraordinary works, which would also be her largest canvas. Standing almost high, and wide, "Les fleurs dÃ©daignÃ©es" ('The despised flowers') is an "unnerving" and "arresting" portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the hem of her enormous formal dress. Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was "a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry and an eighteenth-century dress, created by a twentieth-century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, and was painted with the specific intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed "The Sydney Morning Herald" critic's attention:
While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, "Le Bigouden", was hung. She also appeared at the SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works, a very large number for a single artist. The SociÃ©tÃ© not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.
