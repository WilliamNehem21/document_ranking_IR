In the interim, the Godwin family turned out to be significantly progressively awkward as Godwin sank further into obligation and as relations among Mary and her stepmother turned out to be progressively antagonistic. Mary Godwin comforted herself with Shelley and the two began an energetic relationship. At the point when Shelley announced to Godwin that the two were enamored, Godwin detonated in indignation. Notwithstanding, he required the cash that Shelley, as a blue-blood, could and was happy to give. Disappointed with the whole circumstance, Mary Godwin, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont kept running off to Europe together on 28 June 1814. Godwin briskly brought Imlay home from Wales to enable him to deal with the circumstance. Her stepmother composed that Imlay's "feeling was profound when she known about the dismal destiny of the two young ladies; she can't get over it". Amidst this fiasco, one of Godwin's protÃÂ©gÃÂ©s killed himself, and youthful William Godwin fled from home and was absent for two days. At the point when updates on the young ladies' venture wound up open, Godwin was pilloried in the press. Life in the Godwin family unit turned out to be progressively stressed.
