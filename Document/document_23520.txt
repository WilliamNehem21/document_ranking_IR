The diagram above shows the rhodiumâcarbon ( inside pentagons on the left) and carbonâcarbon ( outside pentagons on the left) bond distances for both ligands, along with the bond angles ( inside pentagons on the right) within each cyclopentadienyl ring. The atom labels used are the same as those shown in the crystal structure above. Within the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, the carbonâcarbon bond lengths vary between 1.35Â Ã and 1.40Â Ã and the internal bond angles vary between 107Â° and 109Â°. For comparison, the internal angle at each vertex of a regular pentagon is 108Â°. The rhodiumâcarbon bond lengths vary between 2.16Â Ã and 2.18Â Ã. These results are consistent with Î·-coordination of the ligand to the metal centre. In the case of the substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, there is somewhat greater variation: carbonâcarbon bond lengths vary between 1.39Â Ã and 1.48Â Ã, the internal bond angles vary between 106Â° and 111Â°, and the rhodiumâcarbon bond lengths vary between 2.14Â Ã and 2.20Â Ã. The greater variation in the substituted ligand is attributed to the distortions necessary to relieve the steric strain imposed by neighbouring "tert"-butyl substituents; despite these variations, the data demonstrate that the substituted cyclopentadienyl is also Î·-coordinated.
