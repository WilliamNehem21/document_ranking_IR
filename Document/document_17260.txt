Although Haig paid tribute to Allenby for the plan's "great initial success", Allenby's subordinates "objected to the way he handled theÂ ... attritional stage". Allenby was sent to command the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. He regarded the transfer as a "badge of failure", but he "more than redeemed his reputation by defeating" the Ottomans in battles that were fought in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1917â18. Haig stayed in his post until the end of the war. When the failures of the 6th Army command became apparent, Ludendorff removed Falkenhausen (who never held a field command again, spending the rest of war as Governor-General of Belgium) and several staff officers. In early 1918, "The Times" carried an article, "Falkenhausen's Reign of Terror", describing 170 military executions of Belgian civilians since he had been appointed governor. Ludendorff and LoÃberg discovered that although the Allies were capable of breaking through the first position, they could probably not capitalise on their success if they were confronted by a mobile, clever defence. Ludendorff immediately ordered more training in manoeuvre warfare for the "Eingreif" divisions. LoÃberg was soon promoted to general and directed the defensive battle of the 4th Army against the Flanders Offensive of the summer and late autumn; he had become "legendary as the fireman of the Western Front; always sent by OHL to the area of crisis".
