A portion of the Romualdo Formation postcrania were utilized as the reason for the production of an imitation "Angaturama" skeleton, later mounted at the Federal University-claimed Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (National Museum of Rio de Janeiro). The skeleton delineated the creature conveying an anhanguerid pterosaur in its jaws. It was the highlight of the "Dinossauros no SertÃÂ£o" (Dinosaurs of SertÃÂ£o) show, which opened to general society in March 2009, turning into the primary extensive savage Brazilian dinosaur to be put in plain view. A portion of the first postcranial components (counting the fossil pelvis and sacral vertebrae) were exhibited close by the mount. In public statements of the show's opening, Kellner casually suggested MN 4819-V as having a place with "Angaturama". This is likewise reflected in the example's incorporation in the skeletal mount. In 2011, a third Brazilian spinosaur, "Oxalaia quilombensi", was named and depicted from the AlcÃÂ¢ntara Formation of the Itapecuru Group, some portion of the SÃÂ£o LuÃÂ­s Basin. This bigger species, known just from a confined nose tip and upper jaw piece, lived amid the Cenomanian organize, around six to nine million years after "Irritat"or and "Angaturama". "Oxalaia quilombensis" is separated from "Angaturama limai" by its more extensive, increasingly adjusted nose and absence of a sagittal peak on the premaxillae. In September 2018, a flame broke out at the castle lodging the Museu Nacional, to a great extent crushing the fossil accumulations and conceivably the showed "Angaturama" skeleton and fossil components. The holotype of "Oxalaia quilombensis", which was put away in a similar structure, may likewise have been decimated.
