The 767 was the principal Boeing wide-body to be planned with a two-group computerized glass cockpit. Cathode beam tube (CRT) shading shows and new hardware supplanted the job of the flight engineer by empowering the pilot and co-pilot to screen flying machine frameworks legitimately. In spite of the guarantee of diminished group costs, United Airlines at first requested a regular three-man cockpit, refering to worries about the dangers related with presenting another flying machine. The transporter kept up this situation until July 1981, when a US presidential team verified that a group of two was alright to work wide-body planes. A three-group cockpit stayed as an alternative and was fitted to the primary creation models. Ansett Australia requested 767s with three-group cockpits because of association requests; it was the main aircraft to work 767s so arranged. The 767's two-team cockpit was additionally connected to the 757, enabling pilots to work both flying machine after a short change course, and adding motivator for aircrafts to buy the two kinds. Albeit ostensibly comparable in control configuration, flying the 767 feels unique in relation to the 757. The 757's controls are substantial, like the 727 and 747; the control burden can be turned to 90 degrees toward every path. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control burden has around 2/3 the pivot travel.
