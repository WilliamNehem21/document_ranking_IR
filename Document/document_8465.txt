The fight in court about whether "The Demi-Virgin" was foul gave new driving force to progressing discussions about control. Preservationists called for new enemy of vulgarity enactment, while their adversaries cautioned of the threats of state restriction. Sumner had recently elevated an arrangement to make resident drove "play juries" that would survey and edit preparations. At the point when city authorities were unfit to close down "The Demi-Virgin", the play jury thought was resuscitated as a trade off between city authorities, who needed an approach to get control over what they saw as uncontrolled muck, and makers, who expected that new restriction laws may be instituted. Among makers, the lawful triumphs accomplished by Woods likewise recommended new chances. In 1923, Broadway maker Earl Carroll started his "Vanities" revue, including many ladies in outfits thought about brave at the time. Later that equivalent year, J. J. Shubert opened a revue called "Specialists and Models", which incorporated a demonstration with topless female models. The expressness of the revues drew blue pencils' concentrate far from the insinuation of room shams. Woods later said that in contrast with these revues, he had "never created a rotten show". The play juries demonstrated reluctant to make the solid enemy of foulness move that Sumner and his partners needed; by 1927 the framework had been surrendered for reestablished endeavors at government guideline.
