Each time the barges were siphoned full, the links fixed and the boats were siphoned out, the ship was conveyed a meter nearer to the surface. In a progression of 18 lifts in August and September 1959, the ship was moved from profundity of 32 meters (105ÃÂ ft) to 16 meters (52ÃÂ ft) in the more protected region of Kastellholmsviken, where jumpers could work all the more securely to plan for the last lift. Through the span of 18 months, a little group of business jumpers cleared flotsam and jetsam and mud from the upper decks to help the ship, and made the structure as watertight as could be expected under the circumstances. The weapon ports were shut by methods for impermanent covers, a transitory substitution of the fallen sterncastle was built, and a considerable lot of the openings from the iron jolts that had rusted away were stopped. The last lift started on 8 April 1961, and on the morning of 24 April, "Vasa" was prepared to come back to the world without precedent for a long time. Press from everywhere throughout the world, TV cameras, 400 welcomed visitors on freight ships and water crafts, and a large number of onlookers on shore looked as the primary timbers broke the surface. The ship was then exhausted of water and mud and towed to the Gustav V dry dock on Beckholmen, where the ship was glided without anyone else bottom onto a solid boat, on which the structure still stands.
