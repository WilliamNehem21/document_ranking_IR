"" (truly: stable, you melodies) is a merry concerto, set apart by Bach. Words and music are perhaps founded on a before lost mainstream (salutary cantata). A printing of Franck's works contains a cantata for New Year's Day, (Sound once more, saluting tunes) that may have filled in as a model. The development is in "da capo" structure: the main area is rehashed after a differentiating center segment. It is scored for three "choirs": one of trumpets, another of strings and bassoon, and a four-section theme. The number three, symbolizing the Trinity, shows up again in the 3/8 time mark and in the utilization of three trumpets. The initial segment opens with trumpet flourishes, exchanging with streaming coloraturas in the strings. The voices enter as a third homophonic choir. They rehash the primary proportion of the exhibit theme on "Erschallet" (resonate!), as the trumpets reverberation the theme. The voices rehash the theme from the second proportion of the ballyhoo on "ihr Lieder", and the trumpets reverberation it once more. The tune rehashes estimates 3 and 4 on "erklinget, ihr Saiten", directing the strings to play. As a summit, the primary syllable of "" (most honored occasions) is hung on a seventh harmony (first in measure 53), amid which the instruments play their themes.
