Tech Tower's ceaseless use since its fulfillment in 1888 has required infrequent upkeep and repair. It experienced broad redesigns in 1965 with an emphasis on rebuilding the structure's inside design. Amid this time, the library and house of prayer were supplanted with current office space and goods. Conversely, endeavors coordinated towards the outside of the structure have intended to protect its notable appearance. A reclamation venture called the "Tech Tower Renovation" started in 1987, led by former student Eugene M. "Quality" Clary's endowment of new copper shingles with which to supplant Tech Tower's maturing rooftop tiles. Clary previously proposed gold-hued shingles, yet John Patrick Crecine, Georgia Tech's leader at the time, demanded copper shingles to coordinate the structure's unique development materials. One of these shingles and a little marker inside the Tech Tower entrance hall honor Clary and his gift. Extra rebuilding of Tech Tower's outside and the Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District, supported by the Class of 1950 and Class of 1975, started in 2000. As a major aspect of Phase I of the Georgia Tech Master Plan of 1997, the territory was made "progressively passerby inviting" with the evacuation of access streets and the expansion of finishing upgrades, seats, and different offices. Further redesigns to Tech Tower were finished amid 2015-2016, which cost $7.5 million, and tended to flame, security, and openness issues. These remodels were intended to improve inhabitant security and comfort and furthermore improve building vitality proficiency.
