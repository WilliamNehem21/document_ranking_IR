The introduced snake "Boa constrictor" preys on "O.Â couesi" on Cozumel. Parasites recorded on "O.Â couesi" in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea "Polygenis odiosus" was found on an "Oryzomys couesi" from Cozumel. Out of ten "O.Â couesi" in San Luis PotosÃ­, five each were infected by the nematode worms "Hassalstrongylus musculi" and "H.Â bocqueti", with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two cestodes of the genus "Raillietina". The mites "Eubrachylaelaps circularis" and "Gigantolaelaps boneti" have been found on "Oryzomys couesi" in Oaxaca, the sucking louse "Hoplopleura oryzomydis" in Nicaragua, the mites "Laelaps oryzomydis", "Echinonyssus microchelae", "Ornithonyssus bacoti", "Prolistrophorus frontalis", and "Prolistrophorus bakeri" in Colima, and the apicomplexan "Eimeria couesii" in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantavirusesâCatacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexicoâwhich are related to the Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to "O.Â couesi" hantaviruses, however. Chiapas "O.Â couesi" easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.
