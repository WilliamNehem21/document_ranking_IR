The Spanish portrayed the weapons of war of the PetÃÂ©n Maya as bows and bolts, discharge honed posts, stone headed lances and two-gave swords known as "hadzab" that were created from solid wood with the sharp edge formed from inset obsidian; these were like the Aztec "macuahuitl". They had a dainty, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or stone edges set into directs in the wood. The pole was up to long and was made from the hard, dim wood of a blooming tree ("Apoplanesia paniculata") called "chulul" by the Maya. The bows utilized by the Maya were portrayed as nearly as high as a man and were produced using the equivalent "chulul" wood as the "hadzab", with the bowstring molded from henequen fiber; the bow was known as a "chuhul". Bolts were produced using reeds with rock, bone or fishtooth sharpened stones and flights created from plumes. Close by to-hand battle the Maya utilized knifes with obsidian or stone edges set into a "chulul"- wood handle, they were about long. Maya lances were alluded to as "nabte"; in some cases the tip was fire-solidified, here and there they were set with a stone cutting edge. Lances were chiefly used to push and cut yet they could likewise be tossed as a lance. The Maya utilized a few unique sizes of lance with the littler lances most likely utilized as a rocket; the more drawn out lances were a comparative size as those utilized by the Spanish.
