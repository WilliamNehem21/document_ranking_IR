His first year of Q-transport administration was baffling for Stuart and the group. Albeit, preceding his connection to the ship, "Farnborough" had prevailing with regards to sinking a foe submarine (the "U-68" in March 1916), there had been no triumphs since. In February 1917, Campbell chose that so as to appropriately welcome an assault, the "Farnborough" would need to really be torpedoed before battle and afterward draw in the submarine as she shut to complete the activity with shellfire. On 17 February this hypothesis was demonstrated right off Southern Ireland when the solitary "Farnborough" was struck by a torpedo terminated at outrageous range. Campbell deliberately neglected to sidestep the rocket and the ship took the blow in the hold, making some minor wounds the team yet genuine harm to the ship. The group were all around practiced and the "alarm party" took to their vessels with an extraordinary show of alert and turmoil while the firearm teams kept an eye on positions on their shrouded weapons. At the point when four rafts had been discharged and the ship had settled in the water and was unmistakably sinking, the submarine "U-83" pulled up only ten yards (9m) from the disaster area. A hail of shot was then released by the "Farnborough's" remaining group from their six-pounder weapon and a few automatic rifles into the stationary submarine. The absolute initially shot beheaded the German commander Bruno Hoppe and the U-pontoon was quickly diminished to a battered wreck. Eight German mariners got away from the submarine before it sank however no one but two could be pulled from the water, one of whom along these lines kicked the bucket from his injuries.
