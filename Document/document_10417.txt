"Ã¢ÂÂ¦ And Justice for All" was recorded from January to May 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Metallica created the collection with Flemming Rasmussen. He had been at first inaccessible for the arranged begin on January 1, 1988, and the band got Mike Clink, who had grabbed their eye for delivering the presentation collection of Guns N' Roses, "Hunger for Destruction" (1987). Plans decayed, and after three weeks Rasmussen wound up accessible after Ulrich called him. Rasmussen tuned in to Clink's unpleasant blends for the collection on his February 14 trip to Los Angeles, and upon his entry, Clink was terminated. Hetfield clarified that recording with Clink did not work out so well, and Rasmussen came over as a very late substitution. Be that as it may, Clink is credited with building the drums on two of the collection's tracks: "The Shortest Straw" and "Collector of Sorrow". While trusting that Rasmussen will arrive, the band recorded two spread melodiesÃ¢ÂÂ"Breadfan" and "The Prince"Ã¢ÂÂ to "fineÃ¢ÂÂtune the sound while they got into the studio vibe". Both were discharged as B-sides of the "Reaper of Sorrow" CD single, as isolated B-sides for "Eye of the Beholder" and "One" individually, and were incorporated on the spread collection "Carport Inc." (1998).
