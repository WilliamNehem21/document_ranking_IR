The PetÃ©n lowlands are formed by a densely forested low-lying limestone plain featuring karstic topography. The area is crossed by low eastâwest oriented ridges of Cenozoic limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as "bajos". A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of PetÃ©n; during the rainy season some of these lakes become interconnected. This drainage area measures approximately eastâwest by northâsouth. The largest lake is Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡, near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures . A broad savannah extends south of the central lakes; it has an average altitude of above mean sea level with karstic ridges reaching an average altitude of . The savannah features a compact red clay soil that is too poor to support heavy cultivation, which resulted in a relatively low level of pre-Columbian occupation. It is surrounded by hills with unusually steep southern slopes and gentler northern approaches; the hills are covered with dense tropical forest. To the north of the lakes region "bajos" become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of PetÃ©n the Mirador Basin forms another interior drainage region. To the south PetÃ©n reaches an altitude of approximately as it rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets Paleozoic metamorphic rocks.
