In 1995, Gretzky sold the card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two organizations expected to utilize the card as the great prize in a limited time challenge. The card was sent the whole way across the United States, as a major aspect of Wal-Mart's arrangement to revive the baseball card advertise. On February 24 of the next year, the 122nd commemoration of Wagner's birthday, the fantastic prize illustration for the card was hung on CNN's "Larry King Weekend". At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's visitors on the show, hauled out the name of one Patricia Gibbs, a postal specialist living in Hollywood, Florida. In the wake of putting in hours fruitlessly attempting to contact Gibbs, King's staff at long last broke through to her telephone, and educated Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs half a month later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs couldn't manage the cost of the expenses on the card, so she chose to entrust the card to a closeout later on. She committed the card to Christie's, a New York-based sales management firm better known for selling acclaimed works of art.
