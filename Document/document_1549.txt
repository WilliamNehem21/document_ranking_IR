Numerous sources guarantee that the 42-reel form was just at any point expected to be a harsh cut, and that Von Stroheim chop it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924, with the goal of screening it with recesses more than two evenings. The chief experienced issues chopping the film down, telling his companion Don Ryan, "I could take out successions and accordingly land the position over in multi day. That would be a drop in the bucket. Yet, I can't do it. It would leave holes that must be connected through titles. When you do a wonder such as this you have represented captions rather than a movie." Von Stroheim later guaranteed that as of now the Goldwyn Company needed him to shoot a scene of McTeague awakening in his dental practitioner seat, appearing whole film to have been an awful dream. While von Stroheim was altering the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who was the leader of the Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel variant of "Insatiability" by January 21, 1924. She requested significantly more slices to be made on January 29, yet then left for Rome toward the beginning of February to supervise the creation of "Ben-Hur" and was uninvolved in the film's altering for a while.
