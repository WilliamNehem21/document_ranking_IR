The Americans had figured out how to stifle her flames by 14:00 and "Yorktown" was making by 14:30 when the second gathering of Japanese airplane propelled from the "HiryÃÂ«" was drawing nearer, low dimension torpedo planes this time. They had been recognized by the ship's radar at 13:55, however the CAP was kept down until they drew nearer. Six Wildcats were on CAP obligation and four were vectored toward the assaulting air ship while the other two were held to cover the departure of the 10 Wildcats energizing on deck. The Japanese were seized 14:38 by two Wildcats which shot down one torpedo aircraft before they were both shot somewhere near the escorting Zeros. Two Zeros were shot down later for the loss of one Wildcat. Two more B5Ns were shot down before they could drop their torpedoes and three a short time later, yet none of these airplane hit the bearer. The last four torpedo aircraft scored two hits (one B5N had its torpedo-discharge gear flop) on "Yorktown" that harmed three boilers and thumped out all electrical power so she couldn't siphon fuel oil to starboard to check her six degree rundown to port. After seventeen minutes, after the rundown expanded to 23 degrees, the group was requested to surrender dispatch. Of the four Zeros and five B5Ns that came back to "HiryÃÂ«", just a single Zero and three jump aircraft were still flight-commendable.
