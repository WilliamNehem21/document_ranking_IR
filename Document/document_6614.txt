The name "Apatosaurus ajax" was begat in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh, Professor of Paleontology at Yale University, in view of an about total skeleton (holotype, YPM1860) found in the eastern lower regions of the Rocky Mountains in Gunnison County, Colorado. The composite term "Apatosaurus" originates from the Greek words "apatÃÂ" ()/"apatÃÂlos" () signifying "double dealing"/"tricky", and "sauros" () signifying "reptile"; along these lines, "misleading reptile". Swamp gave it this name dependent on the chevron bones, which are not at all like those of different dinosaurs; rather, the chevron bones of "Apatosaurus" indicated likenesses with those of mosasaurs. Amid unearthing and transportation, the bones of the holotype skeleton were blended with those of another "Apatosaurus" individual initially portrayed as "Atlantosaurus immanis"; as a result, a few components can't be credited to either example with certainty. Bog recognized the new class "Apatosaurus" from "Atlantosaurus" based on the quantity of sacral vertebrae, with "Apatosaurus" having three and "Atlantosaurus" four. After two years, Marsh declared the revelation of a bigger and increasingly total example at Como Bluff, Wyoming. He gave this example another name dependent on the traditions of his age and the moderately inadequate fossil record accessible around then. It was later perceived that the highlights he had used to recognize genera and species were in truth increasingly far reaching among sauropods. He named the new species "Brontosaurus excelsus". All examples as of now considered "Apatosaurus" were from the Morrison Formation, the area of the unearthings of Marsh and his opponent Edward Drinker Cope.
