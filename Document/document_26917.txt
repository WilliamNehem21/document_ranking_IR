"Eraserhead" sound design has been considered one of its defining elements. Although the film features several hallmark visualsâthe deformed infant and the sprawling industrial settingâthese are matched by their accompanying sounds, as the "incessant mewling" and "evocative aural landscape" are paired with these respectively. The film features several constant industrial sounds, providing low-level background noise in every scene. This fosters a "threatening" and "unnerving" atmosphere, which has been imitated in works such as David Fincher's 1995 thriller "Seven" and the Coen brothers' 1991 drama "Barton Fink". The constant low-level noise has been perceived by James Wierzbicki in his book "Music, Sound and Filmmakers: Sonic Style in Cinema" as perhaps a product of Henry Spencer's imagination, and the soundtrack has been described as "ruthlessly negligent of the difference between dream and reality". The film also begins a trend within Lynch's work of relating diegetic music to dreams, as when the Lady in the Radiator sings "In Heaven" during Spencer's extended dream sequence. This is also present in "Episode 2" of "Twin Peaks", in which diegetic music carries over from a character's dream to his waking thoughts; and in 1986's "Blue Velvet", in which a similar focus is given to Roy Orbison's "In Dreams".
