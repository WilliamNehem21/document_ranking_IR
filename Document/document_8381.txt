As per Asser, toward an amazing finish, ÃÂthelwulf coordinated that his kingdom ought to be partitioned between his two oldest children, and this was completed when he kicked the bucket on 13 January 858. ÃÂthelbald then proceeded (or continued) as ruler of Wessex, while ÃÂthelberht continued (or kept) the majesty of Kent and the south-east. ÃÂthelwulf left an endowment to ÃÂthelbald, ÃÂthelred and Alfred, with the arrangement that whoever experienced the longest was to acquire the entire; this is seen by certain history specialists as leaving the authority of Wessex to the survivor, however different students of history question this and it might have been expected to accommodate the more youthful children. Judith's allure as a Carolingian princess was great to the point that instead of lose the distinction of the association ÃÂthelbald then hitched her. The "Old English Saxon Chronicle" disregards the marriage, maybe on the grounds that referencing such an esteemed association of Alfred's more established sibling would have cheapened its attention on the accomplishments of Alfred himself. ÃÂthelbald's marriage to his bereaved stepmother was in this way denounced by Asser as "against God's forbiddance and Christian nobility, and furthermore in opposition to the act everything being equal", despite the fact that it doesn't seem to have excited resistance at the time. The Frankish "Chronicles of St Bertin" revealed the marriage without remark, and expressed that when she came back to her dad after ÃÂthelbald's passing, Judith was dealt "with all the respect because of a ruler". To her dad's rage, soon a short time later she ran off with Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and their child Baldwin II wedded Alfred's little girl ÃÂlfthryth.
