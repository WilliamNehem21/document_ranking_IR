Amid July 1908, a couple of months before the Model T's presentation, a gathering of Piquette Avenue Plant representatives tried different things with the idea of utilizing a moving mechanical production system to make vehicles, where the skeleton would be moved to the specialists for parts to be introduced. This exertion was driven by Charles E. Sorensen, the colleague to Peter E. Martin, who was the processing plant's director. Sorensen trusted that a moving mechanical production system would make vehicle get together quicker, less difficult, and simpler. The tests comprised of binds a rope to a Model N undercarriage and pulling it over the production line's third floor on slips until its axles and wheels were included. The suspension would then be moved over the floor in scores, where explicit parts would be connected. Somewhere around one Model N was finished at the Piquette Avenue Plant utilizing this procedure. In spite of the fact that Henry Ford energized these trials, he didn't execute a formal moving mechanical production system at the Piquette Avenue Plant, as the majority of his consideration was centered around kicking Model T creation off on schedule. In spite of not having a moving mechanical production system, the Piquette Avenue Plant, supported by the utilization of tradable parts and other generation upgrades, delivered 101 finished autos in a solitary day on June 4, 1908, a car industry record at the time.
