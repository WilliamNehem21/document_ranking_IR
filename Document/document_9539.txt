Following the war, previous individuals from the division framed a board of trustees to investigate potential outcomes for a commemoration. The advisory group was led by one of the main individuals from the RND, Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, the child of H. H. Asquith, the British PM for the primary portion of the war. Now, the Admiralty was thinking about designs for a substantial remembrance to the Royal Navy in London's Trafalgar Square, yet settled on three landmarks over the south shoreline of England (the Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Chatham maritime commemorations). The RND board of trustees was quick to have its remembrance in London, and continued autonomously. The advisory group still wanted to have its remembrance in Trafalgar Square, yet the Office of Works thought about that their financial plan of ÃÂ£3,000 would not create a work reasonable for such an unmistakable area. Sir Reginald BlomfieldÃ¢ÂÂan administration counselor on war remembrances and an unmistakable fashioner of commemorations in his own rightÃ¢ÂÂrecommended a site on the Victoria Embankment close by the River Thames, which ended up home to various war dedications, however the board of trustees dismissed the thought. The workplace's changeless secretary, Sir Lionel Earle, recommended that Asquith counsel Charles Sargeant Jagger with respect to the structure of the remembrance, however nothing seems to have come about because of the discourse.
