Sanh came back to southern Vietnam, and started dressing as a Buddhist priest. He went through the six regions of the Mekong Delta area. His partners Hiep and Tri found an older man from Cholon in Saigon, and exhibited the senior resident to the masses as a "living Buddha". After some nearby older folks protested their exercises, they moved to the focal point of Cholon. The elderly person took up living arrangement with Sanh, and workers and tradespeople before long started rushing to their temporary sanctuary, situated in a house in Cholon's Thuan Kieu Street. As their sanctuary was situated in a noticeable business region, the gathering started to gather more assets. The benefactors made contributions of gold and silver, with some individual gifts being worth as much as 1,500 piastres. At the point when the "living Buddha" startlingly passed on in February 1912, he was entombed in the family hallowed place of an eminent supporter. Sanh's strategists announced that before the elderly person had kicked the bucket, he named Sanh as the legitimate Emperor of Vietnam. Meanwhile, the elderly person's remaining parts turned into the object of adoration, giving further spread to political plotting and raising support when guests came to offer their regards. After the fruition of the memorial service customs, Sanh and his adherents organized an offhand crowning ritual function at Battambang in October 1912. Sanh took on the name Phan XÃÂ­ch Long and was otherwise called HÃ¡Â»Âng Long, the two of which signify "red winged serpent".
