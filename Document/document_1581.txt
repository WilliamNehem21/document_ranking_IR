For the French, the survival of the Corps Mortier appeared to be absolutely a supernatural occurrence. The rest of Gazan's division crossed the stream the following morning and in the long run recovered in Vienna, which the French procured by duplicity later in the month. All the more critically for them, the French power had performed well over troublesome landscape and under awful battle conditions. At first there had been some frenzy and parts of somewhere around one French brigade had endeavored to escape on the flotilla create. They had lost control of the vessels in the present and crushed into the mainstays of the severed tie at Krems, toppling their water crafts. Hurled into the frigid waterway, most had suffocated. Regardless of this underlying frenzy, Gazan's section held its union, and reacted well to different troublesome requests. Dupont had shown his strategic discernment: when he heard gun discharge, he guided his troops toward it to help the French division. Regarding French staffing, Mortier's inability to protect his flank, particularly even with Napoleon's immediate exhortation, unfavorably affected his association with his officer. Be that as it may, in the quick weeks ahead, the colorful Murat accomplished more to pester Napoleon than Mortier had. In surveying the fight and its consequence, history specialists have laid the fault and credit for its result not just on Mortier and Gazan: "Napoleon, mindful of Mortier's risk and his own culpability for it, vented his disappointment on Murat, whom he unreasonably blamed for forsaking Mortier for the vacant magnificence of riding through Vienna."
