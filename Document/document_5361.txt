Flight 367 withdrew from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30ÃÂ p.m. on 26 January. The airplane, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, arrived at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30ÃÂ p.m., where it was taken over by VuloviÃÂ and her associates. "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," VuloviÃÂ said. "I saw every one of the travelers and group deplane. One man appeared to be horrendously irritated. It was not just me that seen him either. Other team individuals considered him, to be did the station chief in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the things. I think he had checked in a pack in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-loaded onto the flight." Flight 367 withdrew from Copenhagen Airport at 3:15ÃÂ p.m. At 4:01ÃÂ p.m., a blast tore through the DC-9's things compartment. The blast made the air ship break separated mid-air over the Czechoslovak town of SrbskÃÂ¡ÃÂ Kamenice. Out of the 28 travelers and group, VuloviÃÂ was the main overcomer of the accident. She was found by a resident named Bruno Honke, who heard her shouting in the midst of the destruction. Her turquoise uniform was canvassed in blood and her stiletto heels had been removed by the power of the effect. Honke had been a surgeon amid World War II and had the capacity to keep her alive until rescuers touched base at the scene.
