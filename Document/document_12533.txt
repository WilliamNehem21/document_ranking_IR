The British Government sold "Nairana" to William Denny and Brothers after her administration in Russia to be remade to her unique plans, and the ship was given over to Huddart Parker in January 1921. "Nairana" touched base in Melbourne in March, following a two-month voyage from Plymouth, and initiated her first Bass Strait intersection on 18 April 1921. She was enrolled in Melbourne under the British banner and was designated the United Kingdom official number 143765, and the code letters THPM. Exchanged to Tasmanian Steamers in January 1922, she worked the Bass Strait keep running from Launceston, Devonport, and Burnie to Melbourne for the following 26 years.

She was pulled back from administration for redesign at Sydney's Cockatoo Island Dockyard in October 1922, and again in SeptemberÃ¢ÂÂ October 1923.

She was removed from administration for a noteworthy update at Cockatoo Island from May to October 1927. The evening of 24 January 1928, she was struck by a maverick wave in substantial oceans, and nearly upset; one lady, officially sick when she boarded in Launceston, passed on.
