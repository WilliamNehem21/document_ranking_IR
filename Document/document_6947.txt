In Grbalj, south-west of Kotor, the quantity of the logs is equivalent to the quantity of individuals in the family unit. A terebinth is chopped down for the badnjak related with the lady of the house, called the "badnjaÃÂica" (), meaning she-badnjak. A similar term is additionally utilized in different zones where just a couple of oak logs is cut, in which case "badnjaÃÂica" alludes to the littler of the two. In Resava, the "badnjaÃÂica" is set up from an Italian oak, and the badnjak from a Turkey oak. In ZagaraÃÂ, focal Montenegro, both of the logs might be cut from a similar tree in the event that it is tall enough, the "badnjaÃÂica" at that point originating from the upper, more slender piece of the storage compartment. The pair is in certain areas joined by a third log called the "badnjaÃÂiÃÂ"Ã¢ÂÂ badnjak the kid. Albeit youthful and dainty trees are normally utilized for the badnjak, in northern Dalmatia's district of Bukovica two generally thick logs with breadths of 30 to 50ÃÂ centimeters (12 to 20ÃÂ inches) are readied, in addition to one more slender log (called trinity). In different zones dry oak branches are gathered from the beginning, utilized rather than a log.
