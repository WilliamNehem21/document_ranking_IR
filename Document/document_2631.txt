On the morning of 16 June Cornwallis came back to the locale, chasing for Vence, and rather found Villaret de Joyeuse with a staggering power. This time Cornwallis was compelled to withdraw, heading into untamed water with the French armada in interest. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor cruising of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the main French boats were close enough to start shooting at his rearguard. For the duration of the day the French vanguard kept up a removed yet nonstop flame on the rearmost British ship HMS "Mars", until in the long run the ship started to fall behind. With an end goal to ensure "Mars", Cornwallis intervened his 100-firearm leader HMS "Illustrious Sovereign" between the British squadron and the French power, its gigantic broadsides driving the French back. In the meantime, Cornwallis had requested the frigate HMS "Phaeton" to go in front of his squadron making false flags reporting the up and coming landing of a British armada. These signs, in blend with the unintentional appearance of unidentified sails toward the north, caused Villaret to turn out to be concerned to the point that at 18:40 he canceled interest and came back to the French coast, enabling Cornwallis to come back to Britain moving forward without any more episode. The commitment was accordingly known as Cornwallis' Retreat.
