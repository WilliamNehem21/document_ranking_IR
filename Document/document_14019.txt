From the age of six and for an incredible remainder Saint-SaÃÂ«ns formed "mÃÂ©lodies", composing more than 140. He viewed his tunes as completely and regularly French, denying any impact from Schubert or other German writers of "Lieder". Dissimilar to his protÃÂ©gÃÂ© FaurÃÂ©, or his adversary Massenet, he was not attracted to the tune cycle, composing just two amid his long profession Ã¢ÂÂ "MÃÂ©lodies persanes" ("Persian Songs", 1870) and "Le Cendre rouge" ("The Red Ash Tree", 1914, committed to FaurÃÂ©). The artist whose works he set regularly was Victor Hugo; others included Alphonse de Lamartine, Pierre Corneille, Amable Tastu, and, in eight melodies, Saint-SaÃÂ«ns himself: among his numerous non-melodic abilities he was a novice writer. He was exceedingly touchy to word setting, and told the youthful writer Lili Boulanger that to compose tunes adequately melodic ability was insufficient: "you should contemplate the French language inside and out; it is fundamental." Most of the "mÃÂ©lodies" are composed for piano backup, yet a couple, including "Le switch du soleil sur le Nil" ("Sunrise over the Nile", 1898) and "Hymne ÃÂ  la paix" ("Hymn to Peace", 1919), are for voice and symphony. His settings, and picked stanzas, are commonly customary in structure, diverging from the free section and less organized types of a later age of French writers, including Debussy.
