Much of the commentary on the compilation focused on Rare's choice of selections and concluded that players new and old would find enough new treasures to outweigh the duds. Reviewer favorites included "Blast Corps", "", the "Viva PiÃ±ata" games, and the Nintendo 64 classics (especially "Banjo-Kazooie", "Conker", and "Perfect Dark"). Among the least favorites were "Perfect Dark Zero", "Grabbed by the Ghoulies", and the early Spectrum games, which reviewers felt had aged the worst. "Ars Technica", however, defended the Spectrum titles for showing an experimental and unrefined side of Rare. Many critics regretted the implacable licensing problems that led to the exclusion of what they considered the company's best gamesâ"Donkey Kong Country", "GoldenEye 007", and "Diddy Kong Racing"â while others felt that the package was fine without them. Also omitted were Rare's "Kinect Sports" series, Nintendo franchise releases, Super Nintendo-era games, and ""Mario Kart" clones". These timeline gaps precluded, for instance, the player from understanding "Conker" as an edgy response to the "cutesy" characters of preceding Nintendo games. Despite these absences, "Ars Technica" critic was impressed by Microsoft's ability to license from publishers including Tradewest, Nintendo, Milton Bradley, and Electronic Arts. "Eurogamer" reviewer was surprised by Rare's consistent style across the selections, and compared the company's legacy to that of Cosgrove Hall Films. The "Kotaku" reviewer saw "Rare Replay" as "image rehabilitation" that would hopefully mark Rare's return to making "deep and daring games" in line with their historical reputation.
