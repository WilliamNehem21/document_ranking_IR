In 1991, the assumed internment site of the royal family and their workers was exhumed in the forested areas outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found almost 10 years sooner, yet was kept concealed by its pioneers from the Communists who were all the while administering Russia at the time. The grave just held nine of the normal eleven arrangements of remains. DNA and skeletal examination coordinated these remaining parts to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of the four thousand duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and probably Maria). The different stays, with disconnected DNA, compare to the family's specialist (Yevgeny Botkin), their valet (Alexei Trupp), their cook (Ivan Kharitonov), and Alexandra's house cleaner (Anna Demidova). Legal master William R. Maples chose that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia's bodies were absent from the family's grave. Russian researchers challenged this end, in any case, asserting it was the collection of Maria that was absent. The Russians distinguished the body as that of Anastasia by utilizing a PC program to look at photographs of the most youthful fabulous duchess with the skulls of the exploited people from the mass grave. They evaluated the stature and width of the skulls where bits of bone were absent. American researchers discovered this technique vague.
