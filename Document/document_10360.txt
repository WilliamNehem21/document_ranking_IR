The scholars at first expected that Sam would spare Dean from Hell, potentially even before "No Rest for the Wicked", by surrendering to his devilish powers and turning into "this completely operational dull power" who might then need to follow Lilith. The fight would have been "substantially more climactic", with the Winchesters "doing battle to spare Dean's life". By the center of the period, in any case, the scholars understood the expenses related with delineating such a commitment and scaled it down. To exacerbate the situation, the 2007Ã¢ÂÂ 2008 Writers Guild of America strike kept them from fleshing out Sam's developing capacities all through the season, and his whole story circular segment was pushed again into the fourth season. With Sam's storyline never again dovetailing with Dean's, the authors "[never had] any uncertainty in [their] minds" to send Dean to Hell. Kripke despised that the second-season finale "simply finished", and he felt that this scene gave a cliffhanger finishing that had individuals "gnawing their nails". In spite of the fact that the watchers' desires that Dean would be spared was "reason enough", his detainment in Hell likewise filled in as a "defining moment" for both the character and the arrangement. Kripke remarked, "You need gigantic moves to happen that can cause radical moves in the characters, that set them off toward another path. So the end result for Dean in Hell and how Dean gets out become essential worries of season four."
