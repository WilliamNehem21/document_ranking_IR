In Blaenau Ffestiniog, the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been changed over into a guest fascination. Guests can go on the Miners' Tramway or plummet into the Deep Mine, by means of a funicular railroad which utilizes an old grade, to investigate this previous slate mine and figure out how slate was separated and prepared and about the lives of the diggers. The Deep Mine, opened in 1979, is gotten to by Britain's steepest traveler railroad, with a slope of 1:1.8 or 30ÃÂ°. In the chambers, framed by slate extraction, sound and light is utilized to recount to the narrative of the mine and mining. The Braichgoch slate mines at Corris have been changed over into a vacation spot named "Ruler Arthur's Labyrinth" where guests are taken underground by watercraft along an underground waterway. They at that point stroll through the sinkholes to see varying media introductions of the Arthurian legends and stories from the Mabinogion and the stories of Taliesin. The Llwyngwern slate quarry close Machynlleth is currently the site of the Center for Alternative Technology. Some of the railroads which conveyed the slates to the ports have been reestablished as vacation destinations, for instance the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.
