Edwards' next false plan included producing letters to cotton dealers in New Orleans and utilizing the marks got from their answers to manufacture letters to specialists in New York City, saying that the phony John CaldwellÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Edwards' aliasÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ had a lot of cotton on store with the New Orleans representatives. Edwards utilized those letters to verify false credits from dealers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokersÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Brown Bros. and Co. what's more, Jacob LittleÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ gave Edwards bank drafts for $25,000 each. Edwards at that point got the money for the drafts professing to be Caldwell, however without endeavoring to mask his appearance. Unfortunately for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was educated by the New Orleans handles that there was no cotton on record for Caldwell, and this provoked the investors to offer a reward for data on the counterfeiter. The police started to scan for the falsifier of the letters yet were fruitless until Edwards endeavored to occupy their consideration regarding a colleague, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an unknown letter to the New York police, expressing that the counterfeiter they were chasing was cruising to England, as Powell was going to do. Edwards accepted that when the police acted, Powell's ship would as of now have cruised. The ship was postponed and the police had the capacity to get Powell, who disclosed to them that Edwards was their falsifier.
