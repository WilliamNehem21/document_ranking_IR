Procellariids have been an occasionally copious wellspring of nourishment for individuals wherever individuals have had the capacity to achieve their provinces. Early records of human misuse of shearwaters (alongside gooney birds and cormorants) originate from the remaining parts of seeker gatherer middens in southern Chile, where dingy shearwaters were taken 5000 years prior. All the more as of late procellariids have been chased for nourishment by Europeans, especially the northern fulmar in Europe, and different species by Inuit, and mariners around the globe. The chasing weight on the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, was intense to the point that the species about ended up terminated and went missing for a long time. The name of one animal varieties, the fortune petrel, is gotten from its (apparently) marvelous landing on Norfolk Island, where it gave a godsend to starving European pioneers; inside ten years the provision petrel was wiped out on Norfolk. A few types of procellariid have become terminated in the Pacific since the landing of man, and their remaining parts have been found in middens dated to that time. Increasingly maintainable shearwater gathering enterprises created in Tasmania and New Zealand, where the act of collecting what are known as muttonbirds proceeds with today.
