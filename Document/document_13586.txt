Matilda brought forth her third child William on 22 July 1136 at Argentan, and she at that point worked out of the outskirt locale for the following three years, building up her family unit knights on bequests around the territory. Matilda may have solicited Ulger, the Bishop of Angers, to collect help for her case with the Pope in Rome, yet in the event that she did, Ulger was fruitless. Geoffrey attacked Normandy in mid 1136 and, after an impermanent ceasefire, attacked again later that year, striking and consuming homes as opposed to attempting to hold the region. Stephen came back to the Duchy in 1137, where he met with Louis VI and Theobald to consent to a casual union against Geoffrey and Matilda, to counter the developing Angevin control in the area. Stephen framed a military to retake Matilda's Argentan strongholds, yet grindings between his Flemish hired fighter powers and the nearby Norman nobles brought about a fight between the two parts of his military. The Norman powers at that point betrayed the King, compelling Stephen to surrender his crusade. Stephen consented to another ceasefire with Geoffrey, promising to pay him 2,000 imprints per year in return for harmony along the Norman fringes.
