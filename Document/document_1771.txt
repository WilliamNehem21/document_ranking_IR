Before any casting a ballot started, the agents needed to cast a ballot on the imperative matter of the unit rule. Before the beginning of the tradition, James Garfield noted, "I view it [the unit rule] as could really compare to even the decision of a hopeful." If the standard was bolstered by a lion's share of the agents, at that point state party managers, similar to the individuals from the "triumvirate", would most likely cement Grant's designation offer. On the off chance that Conkling and the other Stalwart supervisors had their direction, the about sixty nonconformists from the states spoken to by the "triumvirate" would be hushed. Lamentably for Half-Breeds, J. Donald Cameron was executive of the Republican National Committee. Cameron wanted to practice his capacity to embrace new principles for the tradition, and furthermore stifle any protesters of the unit rule. His arrangement was spilled, and inside days, practically every one of the agents in Chicago thought about it. Supporters of the Sherman and Blaine battles realized that they needed to keep Cameron from practicing his capacity. Blaine's powers concurred that they could just keep Cameron from forcing the unit rule by expelling him as the seat of the Republican National Committee.
