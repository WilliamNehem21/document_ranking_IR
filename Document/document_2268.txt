The music video opens with a perspective on Rihanna lying in vast waters, as different scenes of precious stones being come in a way suggestive of making a joint are intercutÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a scene reminiscent of the single's craftsmanship. As the video advances Rihanna is appeared on a thruway. In a high contrast scene, Rihanna licks the joint and starts smoking it. The picture blurs to dark as the melody starts. Rihanna performs in a similar high contrast setting while in a dark bodice. Pictures of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are appeared, with items breaking, shades falling and roses consuming backward impact. Rihanna is appeared on the expressway, fleeing from what has all the earmarks of being the headlights of a pursuing vehicle. She at that point stops as she admires the night sky at an aurora see. All through the video, Rihanna's hand is appeared with that of a vigorously inked man, whose face isn't appeared in the video. As the second section begins, Rihanna is appeared in a desert where ponies run openly. Scenes of a road fight are later appeared, consuming autos and broken glass around the earth. As the video proceeds, the artist and her sweetheart's hands are appeared slipping separated, with just their fingertips contacting towards the finish of the video. The video closes with Rihanna by and by skimming alone in the vast waters.
