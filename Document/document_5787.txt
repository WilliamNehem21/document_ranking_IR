Swarms of armed force ants are a critical asset utilized by certain types of antbird, and the one from which the family's normal name is inferred. Numerous types of tropical subterranean insect structure extensive striking swarms, yet the swarms are frequently nighttime or assault underground. While flying creatures visit these swarms when they happen, the species most regularly gone to by feathered creatures is the Neotropical species "Eciton burchellii", which is both diurnal and surface-attacking. It was once imagined that going to winged animals were really eating the ants, yet various investigations in different pieces of "Eciton burchellii's" run has demonstrated that the ants go about as mixers, flushing creepy crawlies, different arthropods and little vertebrates into the holding up groups of "subterranean insect devotees". The improvement in rummaging productivity can be emotional; an investigation of spotted antbirds found that they made endeavors at prey each 111.8 seconds from ants, yet at swarms they made endeavors each 32.3 seconds. While numerous types of antbirds (and different families) may entrepreneurially bolster at armed force subterranean insect swarms, 18 types of antbird are commit insect devotees, getting the majority of their eating routine from swarms. With just three exemptions, these species never routinely scrounge far from insect swarms. A further four animal groups normally go to swarms however are as regularly observed far from them. Commit subterranean insect supporters visit the settling bivouacs of armed force ants in the first part of the day to check for assaulting exercises; different species don't. These species will in general touch base at swarms first, and their calls are utilized by different species to find swarming ants.
