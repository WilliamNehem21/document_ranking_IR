The creators included pretending components in the diversion. Like "Ultima Underworld", another Looking Glass Studios venture, the earth in "Framework Shock 2" is diligent and continually changes without the player's quality. Paper-and-pencil pretending diversions were compelling; the character customization framework depended on "Traveller"s philosophy and was actualized in the anecdotal military branches which, by permitting numerous character ways, the player could get an increasingly open-finished interactivity experience. Loathsomeness was a key concentration and four noteworthy focuses were recognized to effectively join it. Seclusion was considered essential, which brought about the player having minimal physical contact with other aware creatures. Besides, a powerlessness was made by concentrating on a delicate character. Last were the consideration of ill humored audio effects and "the insightful arrangement of lighting and shadows". The amusement's lead originator, Ken Levine, regulated the arrival of "Framework Shock" lowlife SHODAN. Some portion of Levine's plan was to partner the player with her, as he trusted that amusement characters were excessively trusting, expressing "heroes are great, trouble makers are awful. What you see and see is genuine". Levine tried to challenge this thought by having SHODAN sell out the player: "Now and then characters are double-crossed, yet the "player" never is. I needed to abuse that trust and make the player feel that "they", and not [only] the character, were driven on and deluded". This structure decision was disputable with the advancement group.
