In 1996, the scientist Paul Sereno and partners portrayed another skull of the related family "Carcharodontosaurus" from Morocco, a theropod depicted in 1927 yet recently known just from fragmentary remains (the first fossils were demolished in World War II). They evaluated the skull to have been long, like "Giganotosaurus", yet maybe surpassing that of the "Tyrannosaurus" "Sue", with a 1.53ÃÂ m (5ÃÂ ft) long skull. They likewise indicated out that carcharodontosaurs show up have had the relatively biggest skulls, yet that "Tyrannosaurus" seems to have had longer rear appendages. In a 1995 meeting for a "Science News" article entitled "New Beast Usurps "T. Rex" as King Carnivore", Sereno noticed that these newfound theropods from South America and Africa contended with "Tyrannosaurus" as the biggest predators, and would help in the comprehension of Late Cretaceous dinosaur faunas, which had generally been "North America-driven". In a similar issue of "Science" in which "Carcharodontosaurus" was depicted, the scientist Philip J. Currie forewarned that it was yet to be resolved which of the two creatures were bigger, and that the extent of a creature is less intriguing to scientistss than, for instance, adjustments, connections, and dispersion. He likewise thought that it was momentous that the two creatures were found inside a time of one another, and were firmly related, regardless of being found on various mainlands.
