"HÃÂshÃÂ" was arranged as a seaplane bearer like the British with a forward taking off deck, 32 air ship, four low-point firearms, and four enemy of air ship (AA) weapons. The arrangement was changed after reports were gotten from Japanese onlookers with the Royal Navy in Europe about the attractive quality to have the capacity to arrive air ship on the ship. The new prerequisites were demonstrated on after she got her back flight deck in 1918. The ship was to be prepared to do and fitted with a forward flight deck, superstructure and pipes amidships, and an expansive shelter rearward. Presently dependent on perceptions of landing preliminaries on "Angry" and , the world's first flush-decked plane carrying warship, "HÃÂshÃÂ's" flight deck configuration was overhauled in April 1919. The superstructure was evacuated and the pipes were moved to the other side to make an unhindered, full-length flight deck, and the ship was renamed as a plane carrying warship. The ship's structure depended on that of a vast cruiser and she was given a little island. Her three pipes were mounted on the starboard side and swiveled to lie even amid flight activities. "HÃÂshÃÂ"s planned speed was decreased to , dependent on British encounters amid World War I.
