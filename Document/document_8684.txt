Significant General Chand was especially on edge about Bunche's visit. Acutely mindful of this, Bunche did his best to ease the general's stresses, requesting to remain at his home in ÃÂlisabethville rather than an inn. Chand was frightened when Bunche gave him a letter from Thant, yet Bunche ventured into his pocket and hauled out a proposed reaction. The general was astonished by the precision of the draft in its contemplations of the military circumstance of UN troops amid the development, however the next day he gave Bunche a full clarification of what had happened. In his official report on the occasions in Katanga, Bunche finished up, "I have found certain that it is our hardware that is to blame, definitely more than the people." He came back to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official expression of remorse from ONUC administrators. Thant later remarked on the issue, stating, "I felt that it was I, not they, who ought to have apologized for my erroneous conclusion and misgivings dependent on panic reports from London and Brussels." According to UN official Eric S. Packham, it was informally proposed that the Indian government, in direct correspondence with Chand and eager with the UN's advancement in Katanga, singularly requested Noronha's troops to seize Jadotville. Others supposed that Gardiner had discreetly endorsed of the activity, or that Chand had intentionally deferred the end request by guiding all radio hardware to be deactivated.
