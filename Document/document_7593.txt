In March 1970, Great Northern was converged with three other real railways into the Burlington Northern Railroad, which kept on working traveler administration for one year. In November, the central government built up Railpax (later Amtrak) to solidify unrewarding cross-country traveler benefits recently worked by contending railways. The six traveler trains serving Edmonds were disposed of or rerouted somewhere else under the Railpax plan; the last "Domain Builder" train left from Edmonds on the evening of April 30, 1971. The station stayed open as a Burlington Northern cargo stop and kept up by the railroad with expectations of reestablished traveler administration. Traveler trains to Edmonds station restored a year later on July 17, 1972, with the reestablished "Pacific International" among Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. Cross-country administration to Edmonds returned on June 13, 1973, by means of an augmentation of the "North Coast Hiawatha" over Stevens Pass, and was enhanced by the rerouted "Realm Builder" in 1981. Amtrak dropped the "North Coast Hiawatha" in 1979 and "Pacific International" in 1981 because of poor support and ticket deals, leaving Edmonds with just two every day train takeoffs. Edmonds was slated to lose its ticketing office and baggage carousel in 1983 as a component of national slices to stations with low ridership, however was saved by Amtrak in light of an expansion in ticket income.
