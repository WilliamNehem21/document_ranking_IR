Apollo 15 sprinkled down about north of Honolulu at 4:46ÃÂ pm EDT () on August 7, 1971; the team was recovered by helicopters from the "Okinawa". Scott had solicited that a supply from the twin space stamps of the structure he had dropped on the Moon (issued August 2) be accessible on the "Okinawa", and on July 14, Forrest J. Rhodes, who ran the postal office at KSC, kept in touch with the Chief Petty Officer accountable for the "Okinawa"s post office. The ship answered on the twentieth, saying the stamps could be acquired in time. The stamps were verified from the mail station at Pearl Harbor; 4,000 were traveled to the "Okinawa" adrift by helicopter, apparently in the authority of a maritime officer joining the vessel. The space travelers had no cash with them; their buys were paid for by high-positioning officers on board the "Okinawa", who were later repaid. The group had the help of "Okinawa" team individuals in attaching the stamps to the 400 spreads for crossing out by the ship's mail station. The Irwin covers were not stamped, either at liftoff or splashdown. Worden wrote in his book that he never observed the spreads Scott had brought until the space travelers were on the trip to Houston. In any case, as Scott referenced he was having them stamped with the splashdown date, Worden orchestrated to have that accomplished for the ones he had taken into space. On the flight, the 400 spreads were signed by the three space travelers; the Herrick covers were likewise marked while in transit. Irwin recalled the marking took a few hours.
