On January 6, after the Americans had gone through a few days of pausing and yelling fundamental Huaorani phrases into the wilderness, the first Huaorani guests arrived. A young fellow and two ladies developed on the contrary stream bank around 11:15ÃÂ a.m., and before long joined the preachers at their place to stay. The more youthful of the two ladies had come against the desires of her family, and the man, named Nankiwi, who was impractically inspired by her, pursued. The more seasoned lady (around thirty years of age) went about as a self-designated chaperone. The men gave them a few presents, including a model plane, and the guests before long loose and started speaking openly, clearly not understanding that the men's language aptitudes were powerless. Nankiwi, whom the evangelists nicknamed "George", indicated enthusiasm for their airplane, so Saint took off with him on board. They initially finished a circuit around the camp, however Nankiwi seemed energetic for a second excursion, so they flew toward Terminal City. After achieving a well-known clearing, Nankiwi perceived his neighbors, and inclining out of the plane, fiercely waved and yelled to them. Later that evening, the more youthful lady wound up anxious, and however the teachers offered their guests dozing quarters, Nankiwi and the young lady left the shoreline with little clarification. The more seasoned lady evidently had more enthusiasm for talking with the teachers, and stayed there the vast majority of the night.
