The Gregorian ministers centered their endeavors in regions where Roman settlement had been concentrated. It is conceivable that Gregory, when he sent the evangelists, was endeavoring to reestablish a type of Roman civilisation to England, displaying the congregation's association after that of the congregation in Francia around then. Another part of the mission was the means by which little of it depended on asceticism. One cloister was set up at Canterbury, which later progressed toward becoming St Augustine's Abbey, yet despite the fact that Augustine and a portion of his ministers had been priests, they don't seem to have lived as priests at Canterbury. Rather, they lived more as common ministry serving a house of God church, and it seems likely that the sees built up at Rochester and London were sorted out along comparable lines. The Gaulish and Italian places of worship were sorted out around urban communities and the regions constrained by those urban areas. Peaceful administrations were brought together, and places of worship were worked in the bigger towns of the urban areas' regional standard. The seat of the ward was built up in the city and all temples had a place with the bishopric, staffed by the diocesan's church.
