The most established geographical development in the valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous time frame. It is a critical element towards the north-eastern piece of the zone and is spoken to by the Pensford Syncline coal bowl, which framed piece of the Somerset coalfield. It is an unpredictable arrangement containing coal creases and is comprised of dirt and shales. The scene is commonly undulating and incorporates outcrops of sandstone. The greater part of the territory around Stanton Drew have nonpartisan to corrosive red loamy soils with gradually penetrable subsoils. Soils toward the eastern piece of the region are gradually penetrable clayey and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous earth and shales common of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are much of the time waterlogged where the geography directs. They tend towards being corrosive and are dark colored to dim darker in shading. In the south and south east of the zone there are coal estimates which are adequately close to the surface for coal mining to have occurred around Clutton and High Littleton. In the eastern territory of the valley as the River Chew moves through Publow, Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial stores of mud soils.
