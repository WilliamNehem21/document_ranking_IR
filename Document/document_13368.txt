As per African-American writing researcher Pierre A. Walker, the test for a significant part of the historical backdrop of African-American writing was that its writers have needed to affirm its status as writing before they could achieve their political objectives, which was the reason Angelou's manager Robert Loomis had the capacity to set out her into expressing "Confined Bird" by provoking her to compose a personal history that could be considered "high craftsmanship". Angelou recognized that she pursued the slave account convention of "talking in the principal individual particular discussing the main individual plural, continually saying I signifying 'we'". Researcher John McWhorter calls Angelou's books "tracts" that protect African-American culture and battle negative generalizations. As per McWhorter, Angelou organized her books, which to him appear to be composed more for kids than for grown-ups, to help her barrier of dark culture. McWhorter considers Angelou to be she delineates herself in her self-portrayals "as a sort of remain in figure for the dark American in Troubled Times". McWhorter sees Angelou's fills in as dated, yet perceives that "she has prepared for contemporary dark authors who can appreciate the advantage of being just people, no longer delegates of the race, just themselves". Researcher Lynn Z. Sprout looks at Angelou's attempts to the compositions of Frederick Douglass, expressing that both satisfied a similar reason: to depict dark culture and to translate it for their more extensive, white groups of onlookers.
