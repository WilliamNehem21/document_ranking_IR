A large portion of the bones gathered were encased in siltstone knobs encompassed by fine sand and sediment, with the rest lying in dirt. The bones were and dispersed over a 5 x 2ÃÂ m (17 x 8ÃÂ ft) territory, however most were not a long way from their normal positions. The situation of certain bones was irritated by a bulldozer, and some were broken by mechanical gear before they were gathered. Setting up the example was troublesome, because of the hardness of the siltstone grid and the nearness of siderite; corrosive arrangement was endeavored, yet the greater part of the lattice was expelled precisely. It took six years of practically steady readiness to get every one of the bones out of the stone, and by the end, dental devices and air hammers must be utilized under a magnifying lens. The example speaks to around 65 percent of the skeleton, and comprises of incomplete skull bones, including premaxillae (first bones of the upper jaw); the left maxilla (second bone of the upper jaw); nasal bones; the left lacrimal bone; the left prefrontal bone; the left postorbital bone; the braincase including the occiput; dentary bones (the front bones of the lower jaw); different bones from the back of the lower jaw; teeth; cervical (neck), dorsal (back), and caudal (tail) vertebrae; ribs; a sternum; both scapulae (shoulder bones); both coracoids; the two humeri (upper arm bones); left span and ulna (lower arm bones); finger bones and unguals (hook bones); hip bones; upper end of the left femur (thigh bone) and lower end of the right; right fibula (of the lower leg); and foot bones including an ungual. The first example number was BMNH R9951, however it was later re-classified as NHMUK VP R9951.
