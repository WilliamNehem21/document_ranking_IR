The last scene recorded was the film's first, Picard's Borg bad dream. One camera shot starts inside the iris of Picard's eyeball and dismantles back to uncover the commander on board a gigantic Borg send. The shot keeps on pulling back and uncover the outside of a Borg transport. The scene was roused by a New York City generation of "Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street" in which the stage encompassed the gathering of people, giving a feeling of authenticity. The shot was recorded as three separate components converged with advanced impacts. The group utilized a 50-mm focal point to make it simpler for the impacts group to break up the closeup shots with different components. Beginning from Stewart's eye, the camera pulled back , requiring the key light to increment in power up to 1000ÃÂ footcandles so that there was sufficient profundity to keep the eye sharp. The outside of the stage demonstrated too uneven to even think about accomplishing the smooth dolly pullback required by the impacts group, who required a relentless shot to mix a PC created adaptation of Picard's eye with the pullback. The dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with bits of twofold thick birch pressed wood, picked for its smooth completion. The whole set for the scene was wide and high; holes left by the dolly uncover were filled in later carefully. Primary photography completed on July 2, 1996, two days over timetable yet at the same time under spending plan. Shooting took a sum of sixty days.
