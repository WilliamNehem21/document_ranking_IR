"StarCraft" happens in a sci-fi universe made by Chris Metzen and James Phinney for Blizzard Entertainment. As per the story exhibited in the amusement's manual, the overpopulation of Earth in the mid 24th century has caused the global administering body, known as United Powers League (which was later prevailing by United Earth Directorate), to banish certain individuals from mankind, for example, crooks, the cybernetically upgraded and hereditary freaks to colonize the most distant ranges of the cosmic system. An endeavor to colonize an adjacent nearby planetary group turns out badly, bringing about humankind's entry in the Koprulu Sector. In the removed Koprulu Sector of the universe, the outcasts structure a few governments, however rapidly fall into struggle with one another. One government, the Confederacy of Man, in the long run rises as the most grounded group, yet its harsh nature and merciless techniques for stifling dissenters work up significant radical resistance as a psychological militant gathering called the Sons of Korhal. Only before the start of the amusement, in December 2499, an outsider race having cutting edge innovation and psionic control, the Protoss, reaches mankind by wrecking a Confederate state world with no earlier cautioning. Not long after this, the Terrans find that a second outsider race, the insectoid Zerg, has been stealthily pervading the outside of a few of the Terran provinces, and that the Protoss are crushing the planets to keep the Zerg from spreading. With the Confederacy compromised by two outsider races and inside resistance, it starts to disintegrate.
