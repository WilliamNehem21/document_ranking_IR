Free discourse legal counselor Mike Godwin breaks down activities by the Scientology association to ensure and keep mystery the Xenu content, inside a talk in his book "Digital Rights" about the use of competitive innovation law on the Internet. Godwin clarifies, "competitive innovation law secures the data itself, not just its specific articulation. Competitive innovation law, in contrast to copyright, can secure thoughts and actualities legitimately." He advances the inquiry, "Yet did the material truly qualify as 'exchange insider facts'? Among the material the congregation has been endeavoring to smother is what may be known as a 'beginning legend of Scientology': an anecdote about a galactic autocrat named Xenu who chose 75 million years prior to murder a bundle of individuals by anchoring them to volcanoes and dropping atomic bombs on them." Godwin asks, "Does a 'congregation' regularly have 'contenders' in the competitive advantage sense? On the off chance that the Catholics got hold of the full certainties about Xenu, does this mean they'll get more piece of the overall industry?" He remarks on the capacity of the Scientology association to use such laws so as to contain its mystery writings, "It appears to be likely, given what we think about the case now, that even a mix of copyright and prized formula law wouldn't achieve what the congregation might want to achieve: the all out concealment of any spread of chapel reports or tenets." The writer finishes up, "Yet the way that the congregation was probably not going to increase any total legitimate triumphs in its cases didn't imply that they wouldn't dispute. It's unquestionable that the negligible danger of prosecution, or the expenses of real case, may achieve what the legitimate speculations alone don't: the compelling hushing of numerous pundits of the congregation."
