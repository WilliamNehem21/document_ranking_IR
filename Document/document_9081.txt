The Macedonians, similar to different Greeks, customarily rehearsed monogamy, however PhilipII rehearsed polygamy and wedded seven spouses with maybe special case that did not include the dependability of his blue-blooded subjects or new partners. His first relational unions were to Phila of Elimeia of the Upper Macedonian gentry just as the Illyrian princess Audata to guarantee a marriage coalition. To build up a collusion with Larissa in Thessaly, he wedded the Thessalian aristocrat Philinna in 358BC, who bore him a child who might later control as Philip III Arrhidaeus (). In 357BC, he wedded Olympias to verify a union with Arybbas, the King of Epirus and the Molossians. This marriage would bear a child who might later govern as AlexanderIII (also called Alexander the Great) and guarantee plunge from the unbelievable Achilles by method for his dynastic legacy from Epirus. It is misty whether the Achaemenid Persian rulers impacted PhilipII's routine with regards to polygamy, despite the fact that his forerunner AmyntasIII had three children with a conceivable second spouse Gygaea: Archelaus, Arrhidaeus, and Menelaus. PhilipII had Archelaus executed in 359BC, while PhilipII's other two stepbrothers fled to Olynthos, filling in as a "casus belli" for the Olynthian War (349Ã¢ÂÂ 348BC) against the Chalcidian League.
