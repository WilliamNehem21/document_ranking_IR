The Bayswater, Paddington, and Holborn Bridge Railway Company was set up to associate the Great Western Railway's (GWR's) Paddington station to Pearson's course at King's Cross. A bill was distributed in November 1852 and in January 1853 the chiefs held their first gathering and selected John Fowler as its specialist. After fruitful campaigning, the organization verified parliamentary endorsement under the name of the "North Metropolitan Railway" in mid-1853. The bill put together by the City Terminus Company was dismissed by Parliament, which implied that the North Metropolitan Railway would not have the capacity to achieve the City: to conquer this impediment, the organization assumed control over the City Terminus Company and presented another bill in November 1853. This dropped the City end and broadened the course south from Farringdon to the General Post Office in St. Martin's Le Grand. The course at the western end was likewise changed with the goal that it associated all the more legitimately to the GWR station. Consent was tried to associate with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) at Euston and to the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at King's Cross, the last by derricks and lifts. The organization's name was additionally to be changed once more, to Metropolitan Railway. Imperial consent was conceded toward the "North Metropolitan Railway Act" on 7 August 1854.
