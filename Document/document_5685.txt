Archeological proof from Soba proposes a decrease of the town, and in this way conceivably the Alodian kingdom, from the twelfth century. By 1300 the decay of Alodia was very much progressed. No earthenware or dish sets postdating the thirteenth century has been distinguished at Soba. Two holy places were evidently decimated amid the thirteenth century, in spite of the fact that they were remade in no time a short time later. It has been proposed that Alodia was enduring an onslaught by an African, potentially Nilotic, individuals called Damadim who started from the fringe district of present day Sudan and South Sudan, along the Bahr el Ghazal River. As indicated by geographer Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, they assaulted Nubia in 1220. Soba may have been vanquished as of now, enduring occupation and demolition. In the late thirteenth century, another intrusion by an unspecified people from the south happened. In a similar period artist al-Harrani composed that Alodia's capital was presently called Waylula, depicted as "extremely vast" and "based on the west bank of the Nile". In the mid fourteenth century geographer Shamsaddin al-Dimashqi composed that the capital was a spot named Kusha, situated a long way from the Nile, where water must be gotten from wells.
