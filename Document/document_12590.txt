The last area of the questionable I-696 opened at an expense of $436ÃÂ million (comparable to $ in ) on December 15, 1989; the turnpike's focal fragment was deferred over concerns identified with its directing through Detroit's northern rural areas. The Interstate Highway arrange in Michigan was finished in 1992 with the remainder of I-69 close to the Lansing zone.

A detour of St. Johns along USÃÂ 27 (presently USÃÂ 127) opened on August 31, 1998. M-6, a southern turnpike sidestep of Grand Rapids previously proposed during the 1960s, was worked somewhere in the range of 1997 and 2004; that interstate was questionable dependent on the decision of a minority-claimed subcontractor and course area. Sidesteps of Cadillac and Manton opened in 2001 and 2003, expanding the USÃÂ 131 expressway northward. The last fragment of the M-5 Haggerty Connector opened to traffic on November 1, 2002. Another endeavor was the development of another extension over the Grand River in Ottawa County for a thruway assigned M-231; that expressway opened in October 2015.
