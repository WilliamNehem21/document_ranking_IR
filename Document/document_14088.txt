Imprint Wright of "The Stage" suggested the conversation starter: "How on Earth do you audit that?". Wright put the scene as "the most bonkers, scrumptious, venturesome, splendid, senseless, energizing and terrifying bit of Doctor Who found in the 45-year history of [the] TV arrangement", and portrayed it as "Specialist Who at its most show halting, engaging and splendid best." In his audit, Wright clarified his affection for hybrid fiction and praised Davies for the bearing he took "Specialist Who" into getting to be what Wright viewed as a "little broadcast business". Wright complimented the manner in which the scene was keeping with convention, explicitly viewpoints, for example, "Daleks trundling around spaceships having shouty discussions with one another"; "UNIT [being] as futile as ever at repulsing outsider raiders", and the visual appearance of Davros. He depicted Bleach's depiction as a "shelter between the first form as played by Michael Wisher and the more exuberant...turn by Terry Molloy". He additionally thought decidedly about the last scenes; he remarked that "the most rock hearted more likely than not had a hazy eye as Rose discovered her Time Lord again and they kept running towards one another in sweet box moderate mo" and he cheered when the "overflowing of sentiment was finished, as it ought to be in Doctor Who, by a major Dalek firearm".
