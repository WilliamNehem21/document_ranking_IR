This enabled it to approach diverse traits as important, for example, stomachs that change into mammoth mouths and creepy crawly legs growing from heads. Bottin said the weight he encountered made him long for taking a shot at plans, some of which he would observe in the wake of waking. One deserted thought incorporated a progression of dead infant beasts, which was esteemed "excessively gross". Bottin conceded he had no clue how his plans would be actualized for all intents and purposes, however Carpenter did not dismiss them. Craftsman stated, "what I would not like to finish up with in this motion picture was a person in a suit ... I grew up as a child watching sci-fi beast motion pictures, and it was dependably a person in a suit."

At a certain point, as a preemptive move against any control, Bottin recommended making the animal's brutal changes and the presence of the inner organs increasingly fantastical utilizing hues. The choice was made to tone down the shade of the blood and viscera, albeit a significant part of the shooting had been finished by that point. The animal impacts utilized an assortment of materials including mayonnaise, creamed corn, microwaved bubble gum, and K-Y Jelly.
