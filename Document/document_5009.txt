The nineteenth Battalion started its development at 03:36, joined by independent writers Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey. The TPDF started an overwhelming hour and a half long big guns assault of the Kampala at day break, and another torrent later in the first part of the day. Windows were broken by the blasts, and a few structures and streets were struck. Just a couple of non military personnel losses were accounted for, as the greater part of the city's inhabitants left the roads and looked for sanctuary inside. As the nineteenth Battalion moved down the EntebbeÃ¢ÂÂ Kampala street with its three tanks (a T-59 and two T-62s), it was joined by an expanding number of celebratory regular folks, energetic for the expulsion of the Amin routine. The segment did not experience opposition until it went under little arms fire close to the Makindye indirect from a commercial center by the left half of the street, around two kilometers from the focal point of the city. The Tanzanian troops hid in a seepage discard and returned fire while the regular people dissipated. Shoot was traded for 10 minutes until the wellspring of the restriction, a limousine involved by five Ugandan warriors outfitted with quick firing weapons, rose up out of spread and drove towards the Tanzanian section. It was immediately wrecked with little arms shoot, a rocket-moved explosive, and a 75ÃÂ mm tank shell. The Tanzanians looked through the market however found no more Ugandans, and along these lines continued their walk into the capital, joined by the cheering regular people. The brigade got some annoying flame yet took no losses and at 17:00 achieved the check tower in Kampala where the Entebbe street entered the downtown.
