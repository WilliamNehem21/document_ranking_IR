Stephen Holden from "The New York Times" wrote, "This version of "The Mummy" has no pretenses to be anything other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think "Raiders of the Lost Ark" with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think "Night of the Living Dead" stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think "Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy" grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture ("The Road to Hamunaptra"?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof." Publications like "The Austin Chronicle" and "Dallas Observer" came to the conclusion that despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion; talking about the special effects, the "Observer" lamented "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy." Other publications such as "Jump Cut" felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to "The Mummy"; "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the "Jump Cut", "is standard-issue I.L.&M.". Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic. "USA Today" gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was "not free of stereotypes", a sentiment with which the BFI concurred. "If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene. Fraser, equally quick with weapon, fist or quip, may save the day, but even he can't save the picture", "USA Today" wrote.
