"Banksia grossa" is one of five firmly related "Banksia" species that have exceedingly abnormal blossom nectar. While other "Banksia" species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is light yellow at first, yet bit by bit ends up darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green adhesive inside one to two days of discharge, and in the end turning into "a practically dark, coagulated protuberance holding fast to the base of the blossoms". It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980; he ascribed it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars. Taking note of that a significant number of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts, he estimated that they help the plant by fixing climatic nitrogen, which is then washed off the blossom heads by downpour, and consumed by the proteoid root tangle. This indicated beneficial interaction was explored by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, yet no proof of nitrogen fixing was found. Further examination by Markey and Lamont in 1996 recommended that the discolouration isn't brought about by cyanobacteria or different microorganisms in the nectar, yet is fairly "a compound wonder of plant root". Their investigations demonstrated that the nectar had curiously elevated amounts of sugar and free amino acids, however three of these species, including "B.ÃÂ sphaerocarpa", have since been appeared to have ordinary nectar sugar pieces. The reason for hued nectar is misty, particularly as pollinators, for example, nighttime warm blooded creatures are not thought to scavenge by sight. Notwithstanding, nectar that turns out to be increasingly evident by appearance or smell as it ages may urge pollinators to organize it over more up to date nectar. It is conceivable the shading change is random to fertilization.
