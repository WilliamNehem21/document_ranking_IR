The spores are spherical or nearly so, reddish-brown, thick-walled and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7â11Â Âµm; the warts are about 1Â Âµm long. The spores are non-amyloid, and will not stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy has shown that the spines are 0.90â1.45Â Âµm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5â6.5Â Âµm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11â15 by 18â24Â Âµm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3â5.5Â Âµm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4â6Â Î¼m in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6â8Â Î¼m diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3â4Â Î¼m diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3â6Â Î¼m in diameter.
