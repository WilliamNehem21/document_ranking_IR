As a tree develops, just the peripheral tree ring trades carbon with its condition, so the age estimated for a wood test relies upon where the example is taken from. This implies radiocarbon dates on wood tests can be more seasoned than the date at which the tree was felled. Moreover, if a bit of wood is utilized for different purposes, there might be a critical deferral between the felling of the tree and the last use in the setting in which it is found. This is regularly alluded to as the "old wood" issue. One model is the Bronze Age trackway at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was worked from wood that had obviously been worked for different purposes before being re-utilized in the trackway. Another model is driftwood, which might be utilized as development material. It isn't constantly conceivable to perceive re-use. Different materials can show a similar issue: for instance, bitumen is known to have been utilized by some Neolithic people group to waterproof bins; the bitumen's radiocarbon age will be more prominent than is quantifiable by the research center, paying little mind to the real age of the specific situation, so testing the container material will give a deceptive age if care isn't taken. A different issue, identified with re-use, is that of extensive use, or postponed affidavit. For instance, a wooden article that remaining parts being used for a protracted period will have an obvious age more noteworthy than the real age of the setting in which it is stored.
