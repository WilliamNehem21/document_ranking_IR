What's more, its strike flying machine assaulted Japanese transportation at Formosa, sinking no less than three trader vessels and harming four frigates. Following up on a solicitation from General Douglas MacArthur, the officer of the South West Pacific Area, the armada struck landing strips on Luzon on 6 and 7 January.

Kinkaid, the administrator of the Seventh Fleet which was in charge of the Lingayen Gulf arrivals, solicited Halsey to work west from Luzon to give air spread amid the underlying time of the attack.

These occurred on 9 January. Amid the morning of 9 January, Nimitz discharged the Third Fleet from legitimately covering the Lingayen Gulf region, and approved it to enter the South China Sea. When all the strike air ship had handled that evening Halsey issued requests to execute the arranged assault into the South China Sea.
