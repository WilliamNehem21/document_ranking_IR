Pellew too was en route back to Brest in "Tireless", joined by "Amazon" under the direction of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds. While the remainder of the Channel Fleet had been seeking after the French without progress, Pellew had his boats refitted and resupplied at Falmouth so the two frigates were at full supplement, very much outfitted and arranged for activity. At 13:00 on 13ÃÂ January, the British boats were moving toward the island of Ushant in a substantial mist when they saw another ship through the despair ahead. This ship, obviously a lot bigger than both of the British vessels, was the "Droits de l'Homme". In the meantime, posts on the French ship recognized the British, and Lacrosse was looked with the issue of whether to connect with the foe. He realized that his ship was far bigger than both of his adversaries, yet had prior spotted sails to westwards he accepted to be British and in this manner viewed himself as dwarfed and potentially encompassed. English records demonstrate that no other British vessels were in the region at the time and all things considered, Lacrosse had seen the French boats "RÃÂ©volution" and "FraternitÃÂ©" coming back to Brest from Bantry Bay. Moreover, Lacrosse was worried by the expanding hurricane and rough lee shoreline, which represented an impressive danger to his over-loaded vessel, which was at that point harmed from its winter voyage and conveyed a demi-detachment of the French Army and Humbert, neither of which could be set in danger in an immaterial maritime activity.
