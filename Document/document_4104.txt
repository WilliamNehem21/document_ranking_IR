Teresa went with Robert on his strategic missions for King Abbas to England and other regal houses in Europe. When they set off on their first international safe haven trip, Robert was caught by his adversaries. Teresa supposedly figured out how to spare him and put to flight the aggressors; for this, the Carmelite records lauded her as "a genuine Amazon". Teresa and Shirley visited the Grand Duke of Muscovy, Pope Paul V in Rome and the King of Poland. In Poland, Teresa lived in a religious community in KrakÃÂ³w for quite a while her significant other visited Prague, where Emperor Rudolph II (1576Ã¢ÂÂ 1612) presented on him the title of Count Palatine. He touched base in Rome on 27 September 1609 and met Ali Qoli Beg, Abbas I's minister, with whom he had a group of people with the Pope. Shirley then left for Savoy, Florence, Milan, Genoa, France, Flanders and Spain (Barcelona and Madrid). Teresa rejoined him in Lisbon by means of Hamburg. They at that point went to Valladolid and Madrid where Teresa came to know the Carmelite nuns, especially Mother Beatrix de Jesus (the niece of Saint Teresa) from whom she got a relic of Teresa).
