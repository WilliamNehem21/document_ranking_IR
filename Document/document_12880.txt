Lukather's 6th studio collection, "All's Well That Ends Well", was discharged on October 11, 2010, in Europe and Japan, and November 16 as a computerized download around the world. The material was composed prevalently in a joint effort with long-lasting partner C. J. Vanston, and the collection highlights stalwart performers from Lukather's visiting band. Musician Randy Goodrum, who has worked together with Lukather many occasions throughout the years including on the 1986 Toto single "I'll Be over You", adds to the track "Brody's". "All's Well That Ends Well" draws from Lukather's own encounters in the a long time since "Consistently Changing Times". Pundit Arlene Weiss noticed that the collection highlights three particular kinds of music: one that "opens up about [Lukather's] inner self and enthusiastic grief", one that dish components of mainstream culture like TMZ.com, and one that communicates good faith and eagerness about what's to come. While Lukather concentrated on instrumental composition and creation on past collections yet teamed up with lyricists, he composed a great part of the verses for "All's Well That Ends Well" himself. Lukather depicts the collection just like a "genuine" and "legitimate" impression of the period somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2010, when he encountered challenges inside his private life.
