In a bit of composing entitled "Letter to a Graduate Student," Franklin energized the material science profession of an understudy "Marcia," who is committed to woman's rights yet keen on material science and uncertain of how to incorporate the two. In the letter Franklin extolls the benefits of partner Maggie Benston, whose commitments to women's activist idea and teaching method, Franklin expressed, issued from her incorporated method for being and philosophical establishment in science. She refers to for instance Benston's point that the negative side effects of prophylactic pills are viewed as bearable as indicated by present medicinal practices that are saturated by the man centric inclination of reductionism. New philosophies are profoundly required, she worried, in harmony with Benston's works. Franklin's trust in depending on logical standards to explore even every day battles, for example, a domain "encompassed by rascals" portrays the letter's bright shutting, in which she suggests "taking field notes" and envisioning oneself as an "adventurer happen upon an abnormal clan." In the letter Franklin makes reference to as an intrigued aside the incredibly early condition of research in strong natural issue, contrasted with the great examined state of strong state material science. She conjectures that the disregard of this examination region could have a political segment, given its advantages to people as opposed to the military.
