At the point when the revelation of another component is asserted, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) collects to analyze the cases as indicated by their criteria for the disclosure of another component, and chooses logical need and naming rights for the components. As indicated by the JWP criteria, a disclosure must exhibit that the component has a nuclear number not quite the same as all recently watched qualities. It ought to likewise ideally be rehashed by different research centers, in spite of the fact that this prerequisite has been postponed where the information is of exceptionally high caliber. Such an exhibition must build up properties, either physical or substance, of the new component and set up that they are those of a formerly obscure component. The primary methods used to show nuclear number are cross-responses (making asserted nuclides as guardians or little girls of different nuclides delivered by an alternate response) and tying down rot chains to known girl nuclides. For the JWP, need in affirmation outweighs the date of the first case. The two groups set out to affirm their outcomes by these techniques.
