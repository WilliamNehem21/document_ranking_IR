Soon after coming back to Dublin, Bono composed verses for a tune about the memorial service that he titled "One Tree Hill" after the slope he recollected from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was grown from the get-go in the chronicle sessions for "The Joshua Tree". The Edge stated, "We were sticking with Brian [Eno]. He was playing consoles ... we just got this score moving, and this part started to come through. It's nearly highlife, in spite of the fact that it's not African at all ... the sound was for me around then an exceptionally intricate one. I could never have longed for utilizing a sound like that before at that point, yet it just felt right, and I ran with it." Bono recorded his vocals in a solitary take, as he felt that he couldn't sing the verses a second time. The Edge utilized a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a performance with an "overwhelming fluff" sound toward the finish of the melody. Three artists from TorontoÃ¢ÂÂDick, Paul and Adele ArminÃ¢ÂÂrecorded string pieces for the melody in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour telephone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of maker Daniel Lanois, the Armins utilized "complex 'electro-acoustic' string instrument[s]" they created called Raads to record a piece made for the tune. Dick Armin stated, "[U2] were keen on utilizing strings, yet not in the traditional style of improving. They didn't need a nineteenth century gather playing behind them." Bono found the melody so enthusiastic, he was unfit to hear it out after it had been recorded.
