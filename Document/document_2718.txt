The Lesser Hall opens the southern end of the Great Hall. Its dividers are framed with oak, and the timbers that the roof is developed of are enhanced with cross and rose shapes dating from the Victorian period. The Banqueting Hall, which opens the Lesser Hall toward the west, is accepted by Dean to be the most seasoned piece of the house. Its northern divider is potentially the most established piece of the house, not having been redesigned like the remainder of the yard dividers. The Nevills utilized this room as a pool room. The Chapel, inverse the Banqueting Hall, was the main spot of open love in Bramhall until the nineteenth century. Its reality was first recorded in 1541, when it was alluded to in the desire of the second William Davenport. It fell into decay after its conclusion somewhere in the range of 1869 and 1890, and was reestablished by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council, following its buy of the property in 1935, and religious administrations started to be held there once more. On the north divider are unglazed windows which face the mass of the Library, demonstrating that the south wing was once isolated from the Great Hall. The Ten Commandments are composed on the west divider. Underneath the Commandments, a more established, pre-Reformation Passion painting, is unmistakable. Such portrayals were restricted amid the Reformation, and whitewashed over. It was not until the twentieth century that endeavors were made to reestablish Passion artistic creations, however next to no of this specific painting endures.
