At the point when Myola was recovered in October, a Main Dressing Station (MDS) was set up there, kept an eye on by the 2/fourth Field Ambulance and a careful group from the 2/ninth General Hospital. On 1 November, 438 patients were held at Myola. After three days, Kokoda was back in Australian hands and a MDS built up there. It was trusted that air ship could arrive at Myola and empty the wiped out and injured, however Myola was above ocean level, and the pilots detailed that a completely stacked flying machine would not have the capacity to take off or land at that height, and would experience difficulty clearing the encompassing slopes. Taking a chance with the valuable transports appeared to be unwise. Five light flying machine were made accessible: three Stinson L-1 Vigilants, a De Havilland DH.50, and a Ford Trimotor. Two Stinsons emptied 35 patients, and the Ford another eight from Myola, however the Ford and a Stinson smashed while endeavoring to arrive at the Port Moresby end of the lake bed, which had turned out to be delicate after ongoing downpours, on 22 and 24 November individually. After some time, in excess of 200 patients recouped adequately to come back to their units. Strolling injured were sent down the track, while those unfit to walk were conveyed to Kokoda by Papuan bearers, and flown out from that point. The last seven strolling cases left for Ilolo on 16 December, and the last four stretcher cases for Kokoda on 18 December; the MDS at Myola shut the accompanying day.<ref name="2/6 Field Ambulance War Diary">War Diary, 2/sixth Field Ambulance, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 11/12/15</ref>
