Benjamin was a supporter of the Whig Party from the season of its development in the mid 1830s. He turned out to be progressively engaged with the gathering, and in 1841 ran ineffectively for the New Orleans Board of Aldermen. The next year, he was designated for the Louisiana House of Representatives. He was chosen, however the Democrats claimed misrepresentation: Whig supporters, to get the vote when the state had a prohibitive property capability for suffrage, obtained licenses for carriages. A voter did not need to exhibit that the carriage existed, however his permit must be acknowledged as proof of proprietorship by decision authorities. The Democratic press accused Benjamin as the strategist behind this move. In 1844, the governing body casted a ballot to hold a protected tradition, and Benjamin was picked as a representative from New Orleans. At the tradition, Benjamin effectively contradicted considering a slave three-fifths of an individual for reasons for portrayal in state decisions, as was done in government races. His position won, and slaves were not tallied at all for discretionary purposes in Louisiana state decisions. As indicated by Evans, his "politeness, graciousness, and capacity to discover bargains inspired the political older folks in all edges of the state".
