Despite the fact that Gladys was rationally and monetarily not ready for a kid, Monroe's initial adolescence was steady and upbeat. Not long after the birth, Gladys had the capacity to put her girl with temporary parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the provincial town of Hawthorne. They brought up their encourage kids as indicated by the standards of zealous Christianity. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and drove to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts constrained her to move back to the city in mid 1927. She at that point started visiting her little girl on ends of the week, frequently taking her to the film and to tour in Los Angeles. In spite of the fact that the Bolenders needed to embrace Monroe, by the late spring of 1933 Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and purchased a little house in Hollywood. They imparted it to guests, performing artists George and Maude Atkinson and their little girl, Nellie. A few months after the fact, in January 1934, Gladys had a psychological breakdown and was determined to have jumpy schizophrenia. Following a while in a rest home, she was focused on the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent a mind-blowing remainder all through emergency clinics and was seldom in contact with Monroe.
