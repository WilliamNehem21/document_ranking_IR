Another customary supposition, in light of the language of the inventories and shared by practically all scholars, was that the glass was a bit of mainstream plate, for use at table, or show on a "buffet" close to it. The "buffet" of the period was increasingly similar to an advanced Welsh dresser or shop show unit, with retreating racks for showing on essential events all the plate of the family that was not being used. Neil Stratford proposes that the container was just used to drink from on extraordinary events, including St Agnes' banquet day, while Lightbown comments that at more than four pounds in weight the glass is excessively overwhelming to drink from advantageously. Anyway John Cherry, taking note of the solely religious subjects delineated (counting that on the lost tripod stand) thinks about that the container may have been planned as a ciborium from the begin. It may have been utilized either to go with in its conveying case the duke on his voyages through his numerous mansions and castles, or maybe for his establishment of the "Holy person Chapelle" at his capital of Bourges, proposed to equal the lord's "Sainte-Chapelle" in Paris and his sibling's establishment at Champmol in Dijon.
