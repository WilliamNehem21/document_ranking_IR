Seven days after the review results were discharged, Kentucky's Executive Branch Ethics Commission revealed that Farmer was the main sacred officer who had neglected to document a required revelation of his 2011 funds by the required April 16 due date. Rancher's lawyer said the exclusion was "just a question of oversight on Richie's part given with [sic] what all has been going on." Days after the fact, First National Bank of Manchester recorded an abandonment suit against Farmer, charging that no installments had been made on his $300,000 home loan since January 2012. Under terms of his pending separation, Farmer was exclusively in charge of the home loan on the house. The separation was finished in July, and on September 24, 2012, the house was sold at sale after Farmer was not fruitful in offering it himself. Prior that week, a judge denied Farmer's solicitation to lessen his kid bolster installments, which depended on his compensation as horticulture official. Rancher, who had not been utilized since leaving office in January 2012, told the court that the examination concerning his residency as farming chief had made it hard to discover business. The judge found that Farmer was "intentionally underemployed", despite the fact that he suspended the kid bolster installments for the long periods of September and October 2012 in light of Farmer's recuperation from an August 30 hip substitution medical procedure. On November 9, 2012, the "Lexington Herald-Leader" announced that Farmer had discovered work at a vehicle vendor in Manchester.
