The club's matches began to attract the interest of the local community, and the number of spectators grew to 4,000 within a few years. As their games were played on public land, no admission fees could be charged for spectators. In 1888 Tottenham moved their home fixtures from the Tottenham Marshes to Northumberland Park, where they rented an enclosed ground and were able to charge for spectator admission. The first match there was in October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. A week later they were beaten 8â2 by Old Etonians in their first senior game at the ground. Spectators were usually charged 3d a game, raised to 6d for cup ties. By the early 1890s, a cup tie may have a few thousand paying spectators. In the early days there were no stands except for a couple of wagons as seats and wooden trestles for spectators to stand on, but for the 1894â95 season, the first stand with just over 100 seats and a changing room underneath was built on the ground. The club attempted to join the Southern League in 1892 but failed when it received only one vote. Instead, the club played in the short-lived Southern Alliance for the 1892â93 season.
