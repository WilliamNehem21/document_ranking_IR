The French Navy had caught and sent American boats to Spanish ports while holding their groups hostage compelling them to work with no charges or legal guidelines. As indicated by Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, relations between the U.S. what's more, France were "miserable." Jackson's Minister to France, William C. Rives, through strategy had the capacity to persuade the French government to sign a reparations bargain on July 4, 1831, that would grant the U.S. Ã¢ÂÂ£ 25,000,000 ($5,000,000) in harms. The French government ended up reprobate in installment because of inner money related and political troubles. The French lord Louis Philippe I and his clergymen accused the French Chamber of Deputies.
