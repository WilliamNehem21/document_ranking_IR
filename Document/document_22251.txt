For her second release, Kapoor was paired opposite Tusshar Kapoor in Satish Kaushik's box-office hit "Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai" (2001). A review in "The Hindu" noted that based on her first two films, she was "definitely the actress to watch out for". She next starred alongside Jackie Shroff and Hrithik Roshan in Subhash Ghai's flop "Yaadein", followed by Abbas-Mustan's moderately successful thriller "Ajnabee", co-starring Akshay Kumar, Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu. Later that year, she appeared in Santosh Sivan's period epic "AÅoka", a partly fictionalized account of the life of the Indian emperor of the same name. Featured opposite Shah Rukh Khan, Kapoor found herself challenged playing the complex personality of her character Kaurwaki (a Kalingan princess) with whom Ashoka falls in love. "AÅoka" was screened at the Venice and 2001 Toronto International Film Festivals, and received generally positive reviews internationally but failed to do well in India, which was attributed by critics to the way Ashoka was portrayed. Jeff Vice of "The Deseret News" described Kapoor as "riveting" and commended her screen presence. Rediff.com, however, was more critical concluding that her presence in the film was primarily used for aesthetic purposes. At the 47th Filmfare Awards, "AÅoka" was nominated for five awards including a Best Actress nomination for Kapoor.
