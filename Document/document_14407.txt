Ratnakaravarni of Mudabidri (1557), court writer at Karkala under the support of Bhairasa Wodeyar, is popular for effectively incorporating a component of common joy into plainness and for treating the point of eros with carefulness in a religious epic, his "perfect work of art" the "Bharatadesa Vaibhava". A standout amongst the most prominent artists of Kannada writing, Ratnakaravarni's compositions were famous crosswise over religions and factions. He seems to have had tense associations with both court and religious community, be that as it may, attributable to works on erotics and the art of delight, instead of simply otherworldly verse. A radical and touchy artist, he once guaranteed that otherworldly contemplation "was exhausting". Custom has it that Ratnakaravarni changed over to Veerashaivism when his "Bharatadesa Vaibhava" (additionally called "Bharatesvara Charite") was at first despised, later to come back to the Jain overlay and pen other critical works. The "Bharatadesa Vaibhava" is written in eighty cantos and incorporates 10,000 refrains. His other essential compositions incorporate the 2,000 otherworldly melodies called "Annagalapada" ("Songs of the Brothers") and the three "shatakas": the "Ratnakara sataka", the "Aparajitesvara shataka" (a talk on Jain ethics, renunciation and rationality) and the "Trilokya shataka", a record of the universe as observed by Jains, comprising of paradise, hellfire and the middle of the road universes.
