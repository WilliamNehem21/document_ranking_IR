After some months in London, Lambert was visited by JÃ³zef BoruwÅaski, a dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural Pokuttya, BoruwÅaski was generally considered to be the last of Europe's court dwarfs. He was introduced to the Empress Maria Theresa in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king StanisÅaw LeszczyÅski, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At ageÂ 60, he retired to Durham, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. BoruwÅaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. BoruwÅaski remarked "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for BoruwÅaski. Lambert enquired after BoruwÅaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied "No, she is dead, and I am not very sorry, for when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment."
