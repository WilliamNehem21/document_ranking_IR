Lear explains that the format "although popular with readers was ultimately unsuccessful, because shopkeepers found them difficult to keep folded". Potter referred to this fact late in life when she said, "Bad Rabbit and Moppet were originally printed on long stripsâThe shops sensibly refused to stock them because they got unrolled and so bad to fold up again".
