In the United Kingdom, "Time Out" magazine wrote, ""Zodiac" isn't a puzzle film in quite that way; instead its subject is the compulsion to solve puzzles, and its coup is the creeping recognition, quite contrary to the flow of crime cinema, of how fruitless that compulsion can be." Peter Bradshaw in his review for "The Guardian" commended the film for its "sheer cinematic virility," and gave it four stars out of five. In his review for "Empire" magazine, Kim Newman gave the film four out of five stars and wrote, "You'll need patience with the film's approach, which follows its main characters by poring over details, and be prepared to put up with a couple of rote family arguments and weary cop conversations, but this gripping character study becomes more agonisingly suspenseful as it gets closer to an answer that can't be confirmed." Graham Fuller in "Sight & Sound" magazine wrote, "the tone is pleasingly flat and mundane, evoking the demoralising grind of police work in a pre-feminist, pre-technological era. As such, "Zodiac" is considerably more adult than both "Seven", which salivates over the macabre cat-and-mouse game it plays with the audience, and the macho brinkmanship of "Fight Club"." Not all British critics liked the film. David Thompson in "The Guardian" felt that in relation to the rest of Fincher's career, "Zodiac" was "the worst yet, a terrible disappointment in which an ingenious and deserving all-American serial killer nearly gets lost in the meandering treatment of cops and journalists obsessed with the case."
