The horned dinosaurs discovered by Horner exemplified this phenomenon. In the lowest layers of the Two Medicine Formation, below the overlaying Bearpaw Formation, "Transitional Taxon A" was present. It seemed to be identical to "Styracosaurus albertensis", only differing from it in the possession of just a single pair of parietal spikes. The middle layers, below the Bearpaw, contained "Transitional Taxon B" that also had a single spike pair but differed in the form of its nasal horn that curved to the front over the anterior branches of the nasal bones. In the upper strata, below the Bearpaw, "Transitional Taxon C" had been excavated. It too had a spike pair but now the nasal horn was fused with the front branches. The upper surface of the horn was elevated and very rough. The orbital horns showed coarse ridges. Today, "Taxon A" has been named "Rubeosaurus", "Taxon B" has become "Einiosaurus", while "Taxon C" is "Achelousaurus". In 1992, Horner et al. did not name these as species for the explicit reason that the entire evolutionary sequence was seen as representing a grade of transitional ceratopsians between "Styracosaurus albertensis", known from the Judith River Formation, and the derived, hornless "Pachyrhinosaurus" from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which had the spike pair and bosses on the nose and above the eyes, as well as additional frill ornamentation. In 1997, Horner referred to the three taxa as "centrosaurine 1.", "centrosaurine 2." and "centrosaurine 3.".
