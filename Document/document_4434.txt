With the primary play of the period inescapable, the Horderns moved to Stratford and took brief convenience at Goldicote House, a vast nation property arranged on the River Avon. The first of his two plays, "The Tempest", caused Hordern to question his very own acting capacity when he contrasted his understanding of Caliban with that of Alec Guinness, who had assumed a similar job four years sooner. Consoled by Byam Shaw, Hordern stayed in the job for the whole run. A couple of days after the fact, the performing artist was excited to get a letter of thankfulness from Michael Redgrave, who thought Hordern's Caliban was "colossally fine, with all the pity and pathosÃÂ ... in any case, with genuine dread and amusingness also". More recognition was gotten as the season proceeded; an unknown theater analyst, cited in Hordern's personal history, called the on-screen character's depiction of Menenius Aggripa "a dryly intense investigation of the 'hilarious patrician' and one in addition that can move our empathy in the Volscian appearance", before proceeding to state "we had felt that it would be some time before Alec Guinness' Menenius could be coordinated. The way that Michael Hordern's distinctive perusing would now be able to remain close to different credits to a player will's identity a Stratford prize."
