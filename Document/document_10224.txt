In a progression of potto ("Perodicticus potto") skeletons in the accumulations of the Anthropological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich at Irchel, anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz perceived two examples with qualities he accepted particular from all pottos, and in 1996 he utilized these two examples to depict another class and types of primate, "Pseudopotto martini". The conventional name, "Pseudopotto", consolidates the component "pseudo-" (Greek for "false") with "potto", alluding to shallow likenesses between the new structure and the potto. The particular name, "martini", praises primatologist Robert D. Martin. The accurate provenance of the two examples is obscure, and one is spoken to by a total skeleton (however no skin) and the other by a skull as it were. Schwartz put the two examples in a solitary animal varieties, however noticed that further investigation may demonstrate that the two speak to particular species. He thought the connections of the new structure were obscure and hard to survey and did not relegate it to any family, yet temporarily put it nearest to the family Lorisidae, together with the potto, the angwantibos, and the lorises. The revelation, distributed in the "Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History", was included in "Logical American" and "Science"; the "Science" account noticed that Schwartz thought "Pseudopotto" may speak to another group of primates.
