The tree swallow has high rates of additional pair paternity, 38% to 69% of nestlings being a result of additional pair paternity, and half to 87% of broods containing somewhere around one settling that was the consequence of an additional pair fornication. One factor that may add to this is females have power over sex, making paternity protects ineffectual. In spite of the fact that this is valid, a recent report found correlational proof between the sex recurrence and how far away laying was as far as time, and this imaginable affected the consequence of brood paternity, there being a relationship between's inside pair sexual intercourse recurrence and the extent of youthful the inside pair male sired. In any case, a 1993 and 1994 examination did not locate this last relationship when it was considered. Additional pair paternity does not change the dimension of parental consideration the male contributes in the tree swallow, in opposition to different feathered creatures. The tree swallow additionally contrasts as far as the creation of additional pair fathers; in an investigation that found the paternity of 35 additional pair nestlings, it was resolved that 25 additional pair youthful were from dads from destinations close to the home where the female is, around three from locales inside , and seven that had dads that were floaters (those present at reproducing grounds that probably don't breed). In the tree swallow, drifting along these lines enables guys in great condition to create more chicks, while enabling guys in rough shape to be effective through parental consideration.
