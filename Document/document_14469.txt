Walsh showed up and disclosed to the board of trustees that Congress had recently approved a commission to work with state and nearby experts in anticipating observances which were to be held in December 1920 on the 300th commemoration of the "Mayflower" arrival, and were likewise to happen the accompanying summer. In spite of the fact that occasions were to be held somewhere else in Massachusetts, and even outside the express, the attention would be on Plymouth, with the beautification of the region around Plymouth Rock a noteworthy objective. The commission had prescribed the issuance of dedicatory stamps, and furthermore a government assignment, however it was not until Walsh saw an advisory group report for the Maine Centennial piece recorded on a House archive that he thought of the possibility of a memorial coin for the commemoration. This had been done in the past for the World Columbian Exposition of 1893, Walsh reviewed, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook tolled in (erroneously) that a coin had been issued for the Jamestown Exposition of 1907. Walsh expressed that more were being requested (500,000) than for the Alabama coin as a result of the extraordinary enthusiasm for the festival; he recommended that to increment provincial intrigue, the coins be struck at all the mints (Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco). Ashbrook felt the number to be issued unnecessary, he recommended 300,000 as increasingly fitting, and Walsh assented. Missouri's William L. Nelson moved that the board of trustees favor the changed bill, and this conveyed. Vestal issued a report for the benefit of his board of trustees on March 26, 1920, showing his panel's help for the bill once revised.
