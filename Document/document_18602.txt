York started 2007â08 by losing seven of their first 10 matches. Despite improving form, their home results remained poor, leading to McEwan's dismissal in November 2007. He was succeeded by his assistant Colin Walker, after the team won five of his six matches as caretaker manager. York finished the season in 14th place, and reached the semi-final of the FA Trophy, losing 2â1 on aggregate to Torquay United. In May 2008, City of York Council announced its commitment to build a community stadium, to be used by York and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights. An agreement with the FSIF was reached in September 2008; the club would stop making loan repayments and would repay the outstanding amount once Bootham Crescent was sold. At the start of 2008â09, York won only five of their 19 league matches, resulting in Walker's dismissal in November 2008. Under his replacement, former Port Vale manager Martin Foyle, the team avoided relegation in the penultimate match of the season against Weymouth, and they finished 17th in the table. York participated in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium, where they were beaten 2â0 by Stevenage Borough. After starting 2009â10 with only one win from five matches, York won eight successive matches in a bid for promotion. They finished in fifth place and faced Luton Town in the play-off semi-final, winning each leg 1â0. However, they were beaten 3â1 by Oxford United at Wembley Stadium in the final. They reached the FA Cup third round that season, and were beaten 3â1 by Premier League team Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Richard Brodie was the Conference Premier joint top scorer in 2009â10, with 26 goals.
