Andy Hoyos was the workmanship executive for "Phantasmagoria", and Kim White, Brandee Prugh and Brian Judy were among the PC specialists. It was the main PC diversion Prugh chipped away at. Imprint Hood, a veteran Sierra developer, and Mark Seibert filled in as "Phantasmagoria" venture administrators. Seibert called dealing with the venture "substantially more of a specialized and administrative critical thinking work than I at any point imagined". Not at all like past Sierra diversions, it additionally included dealing with a lot of outside assets, for example, keeping the studio and outside craftsmanship temporary workers on timetable. The amusement's three-dimensional illustrations were among the first rendered on Silicon Graphics programming. In making the vibe of the amusement, Hoyos drew specific motivation from the movies of Tim Burton, and he especially endeavored to copy the lighting, sets and "inventive edge" of "Batman" (1989). Different impacts incorporated the movies "Outsider" (1979) and "Hellraiser" (1987). "Phantasmagoria" was structured utilizing the 3-D programming bundle Alias. Hoyos begun by planning the rooms, at that point made the furnishings, and included surfaces and lighting. When complete, the PC rendered last pictures of each room, which turned into the foundations for the diversion. While most PC diversions at the time had somewhere in the range of 80 and 100 foundation pictures, "Phantasmagoria" had more than 1,000.
