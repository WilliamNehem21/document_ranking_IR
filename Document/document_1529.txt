The second period of SRÃÂ 52 from I-805 to past U.S. Highway 395 (which progressed toward becoming I-15 out of 1974) was anticipated to cost $29.4ÃÂ million (about $ in dollars). The new interstate was to give access to Tierrasanta and lessen the traffic on I-8. The U.S. Naval force was counseled in the arranging procedure because of the street's proposed directing through MCAS Miramar that would give an outline against further urban advancement. There were no worries communicated at the formal conference on NovemberÃÂ 17, 1970; notwithstanding, development did not start for over ten years, as California representative Jerry Brown slowed down the development of SRÃÂ 52 from Santo Road to SRÃÂ 67. In 1977, the province chief, a San Diego City councilman, and the city hall leaders of La Mesa and National City composed a letter to Brown to request the development of this part of SR 125 and different turnpikes, because of worries about the kinds of clog seen in Los Angeles coming to San Diego because of the inadequate interstate framework. San Diego City Councilman Tom Gade composed a message to Caltrans Director Adriana Gianturco about the conceivable erasures; accordingly, Gianturco cleared up that the plans were just being rethought and had not been evacuated, and a CHC part reprimanded the tone of the first wire, calling it "inordinate". In 1984, Leo Trombatore, the Caltrans Director under California senator George Deukmejian, mentioned to the California Transportation Commission (CTC) that "formal examinations toward this end be started right away. RouteÃÂ 52 has a high statewide need." The CTC pursued the chief's desires, affirming the examinations.
