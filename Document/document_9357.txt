Undertaking E was extended to include comparative courses of action for giving atomic weapons to the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). NATO started coordinating strategic atomic weapons into its war designs in 1954, and the BAOR received a teaching under which it would be the predominant arm on the front line as NATO powers led a battling withdrawal to the Rhine River. In 1954, the British Army obtained 113 Corporal rockets from the US. It was expected that they would be furnished with British warheads under an undertaking codenamed Violet Vision, however Project E offered a snappier, less difficult and less expensive option. Weapons were made accessible under indistinguishable terms from those of the RAF: US care and double control. The 27th Guided Weapons Regiment, Royal Artillery, based at the Napier Barracks in Dortmund, Germany, turned into the main unit to furnish with the Corporal in June 1960. A second Corporal regiment, the 47th Guided Weapons Regiment, Royal Artillery, was framed at the Napier Barracks in 1961. Between them they had around 100 Corporal rockets. The Mark 7 warheads must be drawn from US Army stockpiling destinations in southern Germany until plans were made for nearby capacity in August 1959.
