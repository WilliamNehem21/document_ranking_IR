A little service of barrier (which was renamed the Ministry of Defense and Security in 2007) was built up in 2002 to give non military personnel oversight of the F-FDTL. An absence of appropriate staff for the service and the nearby political connection between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight to a great extent insufficient and impeded the improvement of East Timor's safeguard arrangement up to somewhere around 2004. The inability to initiate viable non military personnel oversight of the F-FDTL likewise restricted the degree to which outside nations are happy to give help to the F-FDTL and added to the 2006 emergency. As at mid 2010 the Ministry of Defense and Security was sorted out into components in charge of resistance (counting the F-FDTL) and security (counting the PNTL), each headed by their very own secretary of state. As of now the East Timorese Government was attempting to grow the service's ability with help from UNMIT, however proceeding with deficiencies of qualified staff constrained the degree to which the service could give regular citizen oversight to the security division. In addition, components of the F-FDTL were proceeding to oppose regular citizen command over the security powers as of now, and the power had not opened itself to worldwide investigation.
