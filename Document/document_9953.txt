The team, similar to those of the other nine boats included, got numerous awards for its salvage endeavors. Subsequent to sending the ship a salutary wire at the season of the salvage, King Albert of Belgium made Capt. Kreibohm a Chevalier (Knight) of the Order of the Crown in January 1914. In the meantime, the Belgian government granted its Third Class Civic Cross to "Kroonland"s third officer, and First Class Civic Medals to six crew members and a steward. In March, King George V of the United Kingdom, on proposal of the Board of Trade, granted 39 of the ship's team the Silver Sea Gallantry Medal, alongside a ÃÂ£3 grant. Crew members from every one of the ten boats got Sea Gallantry Medals, however no other ship had a larger number of decorations granted than "Kroonland". Later in March, the United States Congress regarded Kreibohm with a gold watch, "Kroonland"s officersÃ¢ÂÂincluding KreibohmÃ¢ÂÂwith Congressional Gold Medals, and other crew members with five silver and 25 bronze awards. In April, the Life Saving Benevolent Association of New York granted its Life Saving Medal to Kreibohm, four officers, and 35 crew members. In June 1916, Kreibohm was given the American Cross of Honor by Congressman Henry Bruckner.
