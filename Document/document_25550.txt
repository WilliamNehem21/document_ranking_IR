A more favorable review came from Richard Watts, Jr. of the "New York Herald Tribune", who called "Greed" "the most important picture yet produced in AmericaÂ  ... It is the one picture of the season that can hold its own as a work of dramatic art worthy of comparison with such stage plays as "What Price Glory?" and "Desire Under the Elms"." The April 20, 1925, edition of "The Montreal Gazette" claimed it "impresses as a powerful film" and described the "capacity audience" screening as "one of the few pictures which are as worthy of serious consideration ... which offer a real and convincing study of life and character and that secure their ends by artistic and intellectual means rather than by writing down to the level of the groundlings." The review went on to describe the direction as "masterly", citing "its remarkable delineation of character development and the subtle touches which convey ideas through vision rather than the written word, an all too-rare employment of the possibilities of the cinema play as a distinct branch of art capable of truthful and convincing revelation and interpretation of life's realities." A review in "Exceptional Photoplays" stated that "Mr. von Stroheim has always been the realist as Rex Ingram is the romanticist and Griffith the sentimentalist of the screen, and in "Greed" he has given us an example of realism at its starkest. Like the novel from which the plot was taken, "Greed" is a terrible and wonderful thing."
