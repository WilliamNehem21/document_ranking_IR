The first mentions of "Palsgraf" in law reviews were case notes written by law students, appearing over the course of the year following the decision by the Court of Appeals. Professor Robert L. Goodhart, in the "Yale Law Journal" in 1930, was at the front of an avalanche of commentary to such an extent that by 1938, Louisiana State University professor Thomas A. Cowan deemed "Palsgraf" "a legal institution". The case entered the standard legal casebooks, from which law students learn, in the early 1930s, usually to illustrate the necessary connection between defendant's misconduct and plaintiff's injury in negligence cases. According to Posner, writing in 1990, ""Palsgraf" is now the subject of a large scholarly literature, and is, I believe, the only case reprinted in "all" American casebooks on tort law." Manz wrote, "everyone who has sat in an American law school torts class can recall the basic factsâthe crowded railroad platform, the running men, the dropped package, the explosion, and the falling scale. "Palsgraf" has become a sort of legal 'urban legend'âan allegedly true, but improbable, tale told and retold to each new class of law students." Professor W. Jonathan Cardi noted, "in law school classrooms, 'Palsgraf Day' is often celebrated with food and drink, dramatic reenactments, interpretive poems, and even mock duels between Judges Cardozo and Andrews".
