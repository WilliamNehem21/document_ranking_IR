Minh and ÃÂÃÂ´n asked Conein to verify an American airplane to remove the siblings from the nation. Two days sooner, US Ambassador to Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., had alarmed Washington that such a solicitation was likely and prescribed Saigon as the takeoff point. This solicitation put the Kennedy organization in a troublesome position, as the arrangement of a plane would freely attach it to the upset. At the point when Conein called David Smith, the acting head of the Saigon CIA station, there was a ten-minute postponement. The US government would not enable the flying machine to arrive in any nation, except if that state was happy to allow haven to DiÃ¡Â»Âm. The United States did not need DiÃ¡Â»Âm and Nhu to shape a legislature estranged abroad and needed them far from Vietnam. Right hand Secretary of State Roger Hilsman had written in August that "by no means should the Nhus be allowed to stay in Southeast Asia in closeness to Vietnam on account of the plots they will mount to endeavor to recapture control. On the off chance that the officers choose to banish DiÃ¡Â»Âm, he ought to likewise be sent outside Southeast Asia." He further proceeded to envision what he named a "GÃÂ¶tterdÃÂ¤mmerung in the castle".
