The present idea of "Oryzomys" gets from the "palustris-mexicanus" aggregate perceived inside an a lot bigger sort "Oryzomys" by Merriam (1901) and the "palustris" amass proposed by Goldman (1918). Merriam perceived 21ÃÂ species inside his gathering, however Goldman merged them into eightÃ¢ÂÂthe swamp rice rodent in the United States, "O.ÃÂ couesi" in far southern Texas, Mexico, and Central America, and six others with little appropriations. In 1960, Raymond Hall joined "O.ÃÂ couesi" and the bog rice rodent into a solitary animal types, "Oryzomys palustris", and from that point, other limited structures were additionally incorporated into "O.ÃÂ palustris". Hershkovitz depicted another species in the gathering, "O.ÃÂ gorgasi" from Colombia, in 1970 and the following year he noticed that "O.ÃÂ dimidiatus", recently named a "Nectomys", was like "O.ÃÂ palustris". After 1979, the swamp rice rodent and "O.ÃÂ couesi" were again viewed as discrete because of further work in Texas, where their reaches meet. While checking on "O.ÃÂ gorgasi" in 2001, J. SÃÂ¡nchez H. what's more, partners reclassified and described the "O.ÃÂ palustris" gathering and recorded "O.ÃÂ couesi", "O.ÃÂ dimidiatus", "O.ÃÂ gorgasi", and the bog rice rodent as its individuals; Guy Musser and Michael Carleton in the 2005 third release of "Warm blooded animal Species of the World" furthermore recorded "O.ÃÂ nelsoni" from MarÃÂ­a Madre Island in western Mexico.
