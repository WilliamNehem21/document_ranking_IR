"Battery" alludes to irate savagery, as in the expression "threatening behavior". A few pundits battled that the title really alludes to a mounted guns battery, and deciphered it as "Hetfield of a war strategy as the attacker" representing pulverization. The tune starts with bass-overwhelming acoustic guitars that expand upon multitracked layers until they are joined by a sonic mass of contorted electric guitars. It at that point breaks into quick, forceful riffing highlighting odd rhythms and intensely contorted minor dyads where root-fifth power harmonies may be normal. Hetfield ad libbed the riff while unwinding in London. "Ace of Puppets" comprises of a few riffs with odd meters and a neatly picked center area with melodic solo. The melody imparts a comparable structure to "The Four Horsemen" from the band's first collection: two section ensemble sets lead to a long break to another refrain chorale set. The opening and pre-refrain areas highlight quick downstroked chromatic riffing at 220 beats for every moment. The relentless and exact eighth-note riffing of the section is made increasingly serious by changing to an off center time signature on every fourth bar. A long break pursues the second chorale, starting with a clean, arpeggiated area over which Hetfield contributes a melodic solo; the riffing winds up misshaped and dynamically increasingly overwhelming and Hammett gives a more virtuosic solo before the tune comes back to the principle section. The tune finishes with a blur off of evil chuckling. The subject is cocaine enslavement, a theme thought about unthinkable at the time.
