Prior to the second Test, played at Lord's, a progression of occasions occurred that Fraser-Sampson later depicted as "so odd as to be absolutely mind blowing, but then [they] occurred". The prior night play started, Griffith proposed to D'Oliveira that, to spare the 1968Ã¢ÂÂ 69 arrangement, he ought to pull back himself from thought for the visit, and report that he wished in future to play for South Africa instead of England. D'Oliveira indignantly declined. The following day, E.ÃÂ W. SwantonÃ¢ÂÂa columnist actually detached with the MCC, however a dear companion of Allen and an individual from the "Foundation"Ã¢ÂÂ moved toward the player with a comparable suggestion, which D'Oliveira again rejected. Both Griffith and Swanton were against politically-sanctioned racial segregationÃ¢ÂÂSwanton had would not give an account of the 1964Ã¢ÂÂ 65 MCC voyage through South Africa due to his complaints to the framework, and he upheld D'Oliveira from a cricketing point of view. This arrangement most likely started from one of the few South Africans present at Lord's with an enthusiasm for the D'Oliveira question, including Coy and the private cricket visit coordinator Wilfred Isaacs; as per Fraser-Sampson, there is proof to propose that it initially originated from the SACA. Oborne composes that Griffith and Swanton were most likely benevolent, and places that they may have been gotten up to speed in a South African plan as they continued looking for an answer for the D'Oliveira issue. Fraser-Sampson recommends that they and other MCC figures may have felt constrained into this game-plan by the energy of the South Africans' dissents that they would not endure a group including D'Oliveira.
