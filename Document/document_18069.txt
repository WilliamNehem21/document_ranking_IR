During the late 20th century there was a gradual "retreat" from this rule; in "Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation", the courts allowed "Hansard" material to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation (but not to interpret the statute), and in "Pickstone v Freemans plc", it was allowed to assist in the understanding of delegated legislation. A noted attack on the rule was made by Lord Denning in "Davis v Johnson", where he said that asserting that the courts could not use "Hansard" was similar to saying that the judges "should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be. It is on that footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to. It is on that understanding that an amendment is not pressed. In such cases I think the court should be able to look at the proceedings." Despite these exceptions, the courts regularly maintained that it was not possible to use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation. The result of "Pepper" was a reversal of that rule; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to "the very point in question in the litigation", where a piece of legislation is "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity", with the intention being to understand "the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words".
