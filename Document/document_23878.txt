"Cortinarius violaceus" has a convex (becoming broadly convex, umbonate or flat) cap of 3.5â15Â cm (â6Â in) across with an incurved margin. In colour, it is a dark violet to blue-black, and is covered in fine, downy scales. This layer on the cap is known as the pileipellis, which is either classified as a trichodermâparallel hyphae running perpendicular to the surface and forming a layer 6â22Â Âµm wideâor rarely an ixocutis, a layer of gelatinized hyphae 2â11Â Âµm wide. The cap surface, unlike that of many other "Cortinarius" species, is neither sticky nor slimy, though it is occasionally greasy. The stipe, or stalk, is tall, and thick. Due to its swollen, bulbous nature, the base of the stipe can sometimes be as wide as . The stipe is a similar colour to the cap, and covered in wool-like fibrils; purple mycelium can be present at the base. Younger specimens feature a veil, but this vanishes quickly. The flesh is violet, but darker below the pileipellis and in the stipe. The flesh has a mild taste, indistinctly reminiscent of cedar wood, with a slight, pleasant smell, also reminiscent of cedar wood. The gills are dark violet, changing to a purplish-brown with age. They have an adnate connection to the stipe, and can be very dark in older specimens. The mushroom stains red when in contact with potassium hydroxide (KOH). Fruit bodies identified as "C. v. hercynicus" are less robust than those of the nominate subspecies.
