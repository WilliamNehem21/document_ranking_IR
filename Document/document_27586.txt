"Dilophosaurus" was featured in the 1990 novel "Jurassic Park", by the American writer Michael Crichton, and its 1993 movie adaptation by the American director Steven Spielberg. The "Dilophosaurus" of "Jurassic Park" was acknowledged as the "only serious departure from scientific veracity" in the movie's making-of book, and as the "most fictionalized" of the movie's dinosaurs in a book about Stan Winston Studios, which created the animatronics effects. For the novel, Crichton invented the dinosaur's ability to spit venom (explaining how it was able to kill prey, in spite of its seemingly weak jaws). The art department added another feature, a cowl folded against its neck that expanded and vibrated as the animal prepared to attack, similar to that of the frill-necked lizard. To avoid confusion with the "Velociraptor" as featured in the movie, "Dilophosaurus" is presented as only tall, instead of its assumed true height of about . Nicknamed "the spitter", the "Dilophosaurus" of the movie was realized through puppeteering, and required a full body with three interchangeable heads to produce the actions required by the script. Separate legs were also constructed for a shot where the dinosaur hops by. Unlike most of the other dinosaurs in the movie, no computer-generated imagery was employed when showing the "Dilophosaurus".
