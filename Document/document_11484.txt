Gaston Lachaise, an eminent painter of female nudes, executed the commission for six uncontroversial bas-reliefs for Rockefeller Center, four at the front of 1230 Avenue of the Americas (RCA Building West) and two at the back of the International Building. The "Prometheus", "Youth", and "Lady" forms that Paul Manship had made for the complex were unmistakably arranged in the unpredictable's lower court. Barry Faulkner had just a single commission for the whole of Rockefeller Center: a mosaic painting situated over the passage of 1230 Avenue of the Americas. Alfred Janniot likewise made a solitary work for Rockefeller Center, the bronze board outside La Maison Francaise's passage. Lee Lawrie was by a wide margin the complex's most productive craftsman, with 12 works. The majority of Lawrie's payments were limestone screens over the fundamental passages of structures, however he had likewise made two of Rockefeller Center's best-known works of art: the "Map book" statue in the International Building's patio, and the "Knowledge" screen over the RCA Building's principle entrance. Ezra Winter, who made the "Journey for the Fountains of Eternal Youth" wall painting in Radio City Music Hall's anteroom, to a great extent clung to Alexander's unique particulars for the wall painting.
