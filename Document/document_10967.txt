The account was partitioned into littler "bits of dramatization" like a TV arrangement as opposed to one general story piece. This was reflected by the amusement's working title "Last Fantasy XIII: Season 2" when the task was first proposed inside the organization. Not at all like "Last Fantasy X-2", which had a more merry and clever feel than "Conclusive Fantasy X", the staff individuals needed the general tone of "Definite Fantasy XIII-2" to be not kidding just as darker and more baffling than its antecedent. The first situation had called for Serah to travel alone with Mog. In any case, Kitase felt that their exchange was "girly, practically camp and somewhat ridiculous" and brought about a tonal move that was excessively like the one from "X" to "X-2". Noel was added to the story to counter this. Watanabe considered scriptwriting for the amusement's two-character party troublesome. With the absence of shifted identity qualities given by a group cast, he needed to guarantee that discussions among Serah and Noel would not be dreary or improbable. New ideas and terms in "Conclusive Fantasy XIII, for example, "l'Cie" and "fal'Cie", were esteemed too hard to even think about understanding and thus dodged in the spin-off. A story connect to "Definite Fantasy Type-0" by means of the area Valhalla was arranged however later disposed of.
