The Americans never held up their side of the detainee trade. Formally disavowing the understanding over the dissents of George Washington, Congress blamed Forster for abusing American detainees by turning them over to the Indians. In a rupture of manners, the letter containing the renouncement was conveyed to Lieutenant General John Burgoyne, rather than the British president and legislative leader of the territory, Guy Carleton. The Congressional activity may have been spoiled by excessively shocking records of the activityÃ¢ÂÂCharles Carroll, some portion of a Congressional appointment that was in Montreal at the time, revealed that "a hundred or more [American troops] were brutally killed by savages." Arnold's report of the episode included generally unconfirmed claims that two detainees were killed by Forster's Indians. A few narratives of the activity (for instance, the 1882 history by Jones) incorporate records of huge monstrosities submitted by the Indians, however small supporting proof has been found. The Congressional denial confounded an endeavored detainee trade in 1781 including Burgoyne and Henry Laurens, a congressman from South Carolina whom the British were holding in the Tower of London; Laurens was in the long run liberated in return for a guarantee to help arrange Lord Cornwallis' discharge.
