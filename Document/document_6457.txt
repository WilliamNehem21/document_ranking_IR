In spite of the fact that Truxtun's ship at first held a profitable position in the breeze known as the climate check, she was over-outfitted, and thus her leeward side obeyed so much that the gunports on that side of the vessel couldn't be opened. Truxtun chose to surrender the climate check to the French by cruising around "L'Insurgente"s leeward side and bringing "Star grouping" close to the French frigate's port side. In such a position "Star grouping" was distraught by the breeze, however had the capacity to keep away from a portion of the behaving impact on her firearms. With "Group of stars" moving toward his frigate quick, Barreaut attempted to speak with the Americans so as to stay away from a battle. The American frigate overlooked the French endeavor at hailing her and shut to inside fifty yards of "L'Insurgente" before opening up on her with a broadside. The twofold shotted American salvo seriously harmed the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel answered with her very own broadsides that harmed "Constellation's" fore topmast. Sailor David Porter, positioned in the gear of "Heavenly bodies" harmed pole, figured out how to calm weight from it and kept its breakdown. "L'Insurgente" endeavored to close on the American frigate to board her. With less harm to her apparatus, "Group of stars" was effectively ready to maintain a strategic distance from Barreaut's endeavors at boarding.
