The motivation for the movie's plot originated from a joke that essayist/executive Tom Six once made to his companions about rebuffing a youngster molester they saw on TV by sewing his mouth to the rear-end of an overweight truck driver. Six considered this to be the idea for an incredible blood and guts movie, and he started to build up the thought. He has said he was intensely affected as a movie producer by the early works of David Cronenberg and Japanese blood and gore movies. Six has said he favors blood and gore movies that are increasingly sensible over "amazing" beast films, and that he gets "a rash from an excess of political accuracy." A noteworthy impact for "The Human Centipede" was Pier Paolo Pasolini's questionable 1975 Italian show movie "SalÃÂ², or the 120 Days of Sodom", which was remarkable for its scenes delineating seriously realistic savagery, twistedness, and sexual wickedness, similar to crafted by Japanese executive Takashi Miike. Six has additionally communicated his adoration for crafted by David Lynch. Further motivation originated from Six's past job as a chief on the Dutch arrangement of "Elder sibling", where he had the capacity to watch individuals who "did insane things when they were distant from everyone else and thought they were not (being) viewed."
