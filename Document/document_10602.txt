At the turn of the seventeenth century, Monteverdi got himself the objective of melodic contention. The powerful Bolognese scholar Giovanni Maria Artusi assaulted Monteverdi's music (without naming the writer) in his work "L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the flaws of present day music)" of 1600, trailed by a spin-off in 1603. Artusi refered to separates from Monteverdi's works not yet distributed (they later shaped pieces of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605), denouncing their utilization of agreement and their advancements being used of melodic modes, contrasted with standard polyphonic routine with regards to the sixteenth century. Artusi endeavored to relate with Monteverdi on these issues; the arranger would not react, however found a boss in a pseudonymous supporter, "L'Ottuso Academico" ("The Obtuse Academic"). In the long run Monteverdi answered in the prelude to the fifth book of madrigals that his obligations at court kept him from a definite answer; yet in a note to "the studious peruser", he asserted that he would in the blink of an eye distribute a reaction, "Seconda Pratica, overo Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern Music)." This work never showed up, yet a later production by Claudio's sibling Giulio Cesare clarified that the "seconda pratica" which Monteverdi guarded was not seen by him as radical change or his own creation, however was a development from past styles ("prima pratica") which was reciprocal to them.
