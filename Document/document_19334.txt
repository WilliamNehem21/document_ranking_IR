In response, the Rotary Clubs of Port Arthur and Duluth met to discuss a solution. As an international crossing, any bridge over the river would require federal approval from both governments. Both sides agreed that the approval process would be too slow, and decided to construct the bridge regardless. "The Outlaw" bridge was opened by a travelling motorcade on AugustÂ 18, 1917, finally permitting travel between Ontario and Minnesota.
To the surprise of the Rotary Clubs, J. E. Whitson, Roads Commissioner of Northern Ontario, and Howard Ferguson, Minister of Lands, Forest and Mines, were present at the opening, and agreed to pay the $768,000 ($ in ) bridge cost. The bridge and the Canadian road approaching it fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Highways (now the Ministry of Transportation) on AprilÂ 1, 1937, and the Scott Highway became HighwayÂ 61 on OctoberÂ 6. The Outlaw was rebuilt as a steel truss structure in 1934 following several accidents.
By 1962, construction was underway to bypass the inland route of the highway as well as the bridge. This bypass opened on November 1, 1963;
the American approach was rebuilt along the shore of Lake Superior, and a new bridge constructed over the river to the east. This bridge was opened on MayÂ 23, 1964. HighwayÂ 61 was realigned as a result; the former route was redesignated as HighwayÂ 593 on SeptemberÂ 1, 1964.
