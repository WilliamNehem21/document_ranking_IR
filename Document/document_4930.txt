As an immediate aftereffect of unpredictable rearing practices, starting at 2001 just a couple of thousand thoroughbred Marwari ponies existed. Research ponders have been led to look at the hereditary qualities of the Marwari pony and its relationship to other Indian and non-Indian steed breeds. Six unique breeds have been recognized in India: the Marwari, Kathiawari, Spiti horse, Bhutia horse, Manipuri Pony, and Zanskari. These six are unmistakable from one another regarding interesting execution attributes and diverse agroclimactic conditions in the different territories of India where they started. A recent report was led to distinguish past hereditary bottlenecks in the Marwari horse. The examination found that, in the DNA of the ponies tried, there was no proof of a hereditary bottleneck in the breed's history. In any case, since the populace has diminished quickly in past decades, bottlenecks may have happened that were not recognized in the investigation. In 2007, an examination was led to evaluate hereditary variety among all Indian steed breeds with the exception of the Kathiawari. In view of investigation of microsatellite DNA, the Marwari was observed to be the most hereditarily particular type of the five contemplated, and was most inaccessible from the Manipuri; none of the breeds were found to have close hereditary connections to the Thoroughbred. The Marwari was recognizable from different breeds as far as both physical qualities (mostly tallness) and natural flexibility. The physical contrasts were credited to varying lineages: the Marwari horse are intently connected with the Arabian steed, while the four different breeds are as far as anyone knows slid from the Tibetan horse.
