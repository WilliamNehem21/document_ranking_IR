Because microcomputers in Japan were not powerful enough at the time to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming "Space Invaders", Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using the latest microprocessors from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit (CPU), displays raster graphics on a CRT monitor, and uses monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The adoption of a microprocessor was inspired by "Gun Fight" (1975), Midway's microprocessor adaptation of Nishikado's earlier discrete logic game "Western Gun", after the designer was impressed by the improved graphics and smoother animation of Midway's version. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wantedâthe Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies fasterâand he ended up considering the development of the game's hardware the most difficult part of the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster when there were fewer on the screen. Rather than design in compensation for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism.
