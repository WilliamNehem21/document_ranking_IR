Boganda was ready to turn into the primary leader of the free CAR when he loaded onto a plane at BerbÃÂ©rati for a trip to Bangui on 29 March 1959, only before authoritative decisions. The air ship detonated in midair over Boukpayanga in the sub-prefecture of Boda (about west of Bangui), executing all travelers and group. No reasonable reason has ever been found out for the secretive accident and no commission of request was ever shaped; damage was broadly suspected. The country was stunned at the demise of its adored pioneer, whose memorial service on 2 April at the house of God of Notre-Dame de Bangui saw an extraordinary overflowing of anguish from a large number of Oubanguians. The 7 May version of the Paris week after week "L'Express" uncovered that specialists had discovered hints of hazardous in the destruction, yet the French high official restricted the clearance of that magazine release when it showed up in the CAR. Many presumed that ostracize specialists from the Bangui council of business, perhaps supported by the French mystery administration, assumed a job. Michelle Jourdain was additionally associated with being included: by 1959, relations among Boganda and his significant other had decayed, and he thought of abandoning her and coming back to the brotherhood. She had a substantial protection arrangement on his life, taken only days before the mishap. As indicated by Brian Titley, creator of "Dim Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa", there are valid justifications for suspecting her association in the plane accident.
