Preceding , Rindt got offers from each group with the exception of Lotus and Honda, and moved to Brabham, who had been title holders in the two past seasons. Specialized issues confined him that year. Brabham's Repco V8 motor was not focused against the now broadly utilized Cosworth DFV and Rindt completed only two races, both in third spot. At the season opener in South Africa on New Year's Day, Rindt set third, being raised by a late retirement from Jackie Stewart and shutting on second-set Graham Hill towards the end. The race was won by Jim Clark, a dear companion of Rindt's. It was Clark's last Formula One race; he passed on three months after the fact at a Formula Two race at Hockenheim. Rindt was profoundly influenced by his demise, disclosing to Austrian writer Heinz PrÃÂ¼ller: "If Jim Clark isn't sheltered, what can transpire?" His second platform complete came in substantial downpour and haze at the NÃÂ¼rburgring at the German Grand Prix, a race commanded by Stewart, who completed four minutes in front of Hill in second spot. Rindt had shut on Hill in the last phases of the race after the Englishman spun, and completed only four seconds behind after a nearby fight amid the last lap. His eight set him twelfth in the title toward the finish of the period.
