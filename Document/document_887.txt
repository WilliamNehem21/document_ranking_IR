All through his abstract vocation, Willis was very much preferred and known for his considerate mindset among companions. All around voyaged and shrewd, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was regularly dressed richly. Some, be that as it may, commented that Willis was feminine, Europeanized, and blameworthy of "Miss Nancyism". One proofreader called him "a generic latent action wordÃ¢ÂÂa pronoun of the ladylike sexual orientation". A contemporary cartoon portrayed him wearing a chic beaver cap and firmly shut coat and conveying a stick, mirroring Willis' wide notoriety as a "dandy". Willis put extensive exertion into his appearance and his design sense, introducing himself as an individual from a forthcoming American gentry. As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. once stated, Willis was "something between a recognition of Count D'Orsay and an expectation of Oscar Wilde". Distributer Charles Frederick Briggs once composed that "Willis was too Willisy". He portrayed his compositions as the "curiosity and tattle of great importance" and was not really worried about certainties but rather with the "material of discussion and hypothesis, which might be minor gossip, might be reality". Willis' conduct in social gatherings irritated individual writer Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. "He is excessively fake", Longfellow kept in touch with his companion George Washington Greene. "What's more, his verse has now lost one of its most prominent charms for meÃ¢ÂÂits truthfulness". E. Burke Fisher, a columnist in Pittsburgh, composed that "Willis is a sort of national pet and we should view his issues as we do those of a ruined stripling, with the expectation that he will correct".
