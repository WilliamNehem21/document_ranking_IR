Rejewski considered these related sets of letters. For instance, if there were four messages that had the accompanying pointers around the same time: BJGTDN, LIFBAB, ETULZR, TFREII, at that point by taking a gander at the first and fourth letters of each set, he realized that specific sets of letters were connected. B was identified with T, L was identified with B, E was identified with L, and T was identified with E: (B,T), (L,B), (E,L), and (T,E). On the off chance that he had enough extraordinary messages to work with, he could fabricate whole successions of connections: the letter B was identified with T, which was identified with E, which was identified with L, which was identified with B (see outline). This was a "cycle of 4", since it took four bounces until it returned to the begin letter. Another cycle around the same time may be Aformula_1Fformula_1Wformula_1A, or a "cycle of 3". In the event that there were sufficient messages on a given day, every one of the letters of the letter set may be secured by various diverse cycles of different sizes. The cycles would be reliable for one day, and after that would change to an alternate arrangement of cycles the following day. Comparable investigation should be possible on the second and fifth letters, and the third and sixth, recognizing the cycles for each situation and the quantity of ventures in each cycle.
