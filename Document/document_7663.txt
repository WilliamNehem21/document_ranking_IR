In the wake of Athens' surrender, the long dividers were torn down and the troops attacking the city came back to their different homes; a Spartan battalion most likely stayed in Athens to manage the destroying of the dividers; Lysander cruised off to Samos to finish the attack of that city. Another condition of the settlement that had finished the war had enabled all outcasts to come back to Athens, and these men, a large number of them oligarchic instigators who had been thrown out by the majority rule government, were working diligently in the months after the arrangement. Five "managers" were selected by the individuals from the oligarchic social clubs to design the progress to a theocracy. In July 404 BC, they brought Lysander back to Athens, where he administered the difference in government; an oligarchic lawmaker, Dracontides, proposed in the chamber to put the administration in the hands of thirty picked men; Theramenes upheld this movement, and, with Lysander taking steps to rebuff the Athenians for neglecting to destroy the dividers rapidly enough except if they consented, it passed the gathering. Thirty men were chosen: ten selected by the "regulators", ten picked by Theramenes (counting himself), and ten picked by Lysander.
