"Prison Siege" is set in the Kingdom of Ehb, a differed district on the mainland of Aranna containing deserts, marshes, timberlands, and mountains, made three centuries sooner at the disintegration of the Empire of Stars. Toward the start of the amusement, the player character's cultivating town is assaulted by a race of animals named the Krug. The primary character, a rancher with no given foundation who is named by the player, travels through the Krug powers to the town of Stonebridge. After breaking the attack of the town, and picking up their first friend, the player character is entrusted by the town's battalion chief Gyorn with traveling to the town of Glacern and cautioning the Ehb military powers, called the tenth Legion, of the invasion and crushing any powers they experience en route. Subsequent to venturing through sepulchers, mines, and mountains, the player character comes to Glacern, where they are educated that the Krug attack happened that day that the Grand Mage Merik vanished, and are accused of making a trip over the mountains to Fortress Kroth to help the army there. In the mountains they discover Merik, who advises them that the Krug intrusion is a piece of a bigger attack by the Seck, who annihilated the Empire of Stars before being detained underneath Castle Ehb, and who have gotten away and taken the chÃÂ¢teau. Merik requests that the player help recoup the Staff of Stars from the Goblins. Before its robbery, the Staff had kept the Seck detained in the Vault of Eternity.
