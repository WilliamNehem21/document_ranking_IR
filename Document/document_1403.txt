The Youngstown club commenced the 1906 season with a display diversion against a Cleveland group, rising as victors in a nearby challenge of 3Ã¢ÂÂ 4. "Up till the end minutes it resembled the meeting group, the Cleveland Leaders, would stow the challenge away in their bat-packs and leave the field on top", the "Vindicator" detailed. "The completion was energizing, and 400 devotees who took risks on pneumonia got an opportunity to heat up and return home in great spirits.". The paper expressed that, at the highest point of the primary inning, the Cleveland group was driving by one point, when "the Youngstown noble men got occupied in the most endorsed style". As per the "Vindicator", Ohio Works player Curley Blount "ventured before a moderate pitched ball and was sent to third", while A. C. McClintock "stole second with all hands snoozing". Now, the paper included, "[Charles] McCloskey endured another base shot and Blount and McClintock scored". The "Vindicator's" synopsis of the amusement pointed out pitcher Roy Castleton, "who struck out every one of the three players in the tenth and got one in the ninth". The paper portrayed McClintock and McCloskey (the "two Macs") as the Youngstown club's "star hitters".
