Amid the years following its arrangement, the FVdG started to embrace progressively extreme positions. Amid the German communist development's discussion over the utilization of mass strikes, the FVdG propelled the view that the general strike must be a weapon in the hands of the common laborers. The league trusted the mass strike was the last advance before a communist unrest and turned out to be progressively disparaging of parliamentary activity. Debate with the standard work development at long last prompted the ejection of FVdG individuals from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1908 and the total disjoining of relations between the two associations. Rebel and particularly syndicalist positions turned out to be progressively famous inside the FVdG. Amid World War I, the FVdG rejected the SPD's and standard work development's collaboration with the German stateÃ¢ÂÂknown as the "Burgfrieden"Ã¢ÂÂ yet was unfit to compose any noteworthy protection from or proceed with its customary exercises amid the war. Following the November Revolution, the FVdG in all respects rapidly turned into a mass association. It was especially appealing to excavators from the Ruhr region restricted to the standard associations' reformist arrangements. In December 1919, the alliance converged with a few minor left socialist associations to turn into the Free Workers' Union of Germany (FAUD).
