The front-side of the half dollar delineates Liberty, who is dissipating products of the soil from a cornucopia held by a little, naked tyke. Behind them, the sun sets past San Francisco's Golden Gate, so far unadorned by its extension. Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the PanamaÃ¢ÂÂ Pacific issue, brought up that excavators viewed the Golden Gate as an indication of good karma, and proposed it may have been exceptional to portray it on a gold coin. The cornucopia, as per Burdette, exhibits the headway in exchange brought by the waterway, however the 1915 "Report of the Director of the Mint" states it "signif[ies] the unfathomable assets of the West". The front depends on Barber's prior work, particularly his awards for the yearly Assay Commission. A portrayal of waves lies between the sun and the date, speaking to the sea subjects of the work. San Francisco's mint imprint, S, is to one side of the date. The turn around portrays a bird on a Union shield, flanked by parts of olive, symbolizing harmony, something Swiatek and Breen found unexpected given the coin's issuance amid World War I, and oak, the last a decision which they were at a misfortune to clarify. The 1915 Mint Director's report regarded the oak branch an "image of solidarity". Burdette takes note of that Barber's unique structure flanked the shield with two dolphins, speaking to the two seas joined by the channel, rather than branches, and guesses, "McAdoo either did not comprehend the purposeful anecdote, did not like it, or essentially disliked oceanic well evolved creatures on coins". McAdoo may likewise have been experiencing a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear themÃ¢ÂÂthe ones on the half dollar were expelled and supplanted by the branches.
