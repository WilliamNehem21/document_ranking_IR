As per a story recorded by the sixteenth century savant John Leland, and gotten by him from a now lost book in the ownership of the Earls of Rutland at Belvoir Castle, there was previously a King Alfred III of Mercia, who reigned during the 730s. In spite of the fact that no Mercian ruler was ever named Alfred, not to mention three, if this story has any authentic premise (which Leland himself rejected) it should probably identify with ÃÂthelbald. The legend expresses that Alfred III had event to visit a certain William de Albanac, asserted progenitor of the Earls of Rutland, at his mansion close Grantham, and liked William's three attractive girls. It was the ruler's aim to accept one as his courtesan, yet William took steps to execute whichever he picked instead of have her shamed thusly, whereupon Alfred "answerid that he intended to take one of them to spouse, and picked Etheldrede that had fat bottoks, and of her he had Alurede that wan first every one of the Saxons the government of England." A sketch of this alleged episode was authorized in 1778 by the Duke of Rutland, yet was crushed in a flame in 1816.
