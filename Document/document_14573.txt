On 14 March 1915, "Preussen" went to Kiel for occasional support, and she was supplanted as the squadron lead by the warship . The last vessel held the situation for the rest of the squadron's presence, with the special cases of 19 September to 16 October 1915, 25 February to 7 April 1916, in September that year, and from 22 January to 10 February 1917; amid every one of these periods, "Preussen" incidentally continued the leader job. Beginning in April 1916, the boats of II Squadron were entrusted with watching the Danish straits; each ship of the squadron was to turn through the obligation, the others staying in the Elbe or presenting with the primary armada. "Preussen" started her first stretch on 21 April, supplanting "Hessen"; she was in like manner missing amid the barrage of Yarmouth and Lowestoft three days after the fact. On 4 May, "Preussen" was calmed and she came back to the Elbe, however she was exchanged back to the straits on 21 May, staying there until 8 June. Accordingly, she missed the Battle of Jutland, battled on 31 May Ã¢ÂÂ 1 June in the North Sea. Her sister transport "Lothringen" likewise missed the fight, as she had been considered to be in too poor a condition to partake in the armada foray.
