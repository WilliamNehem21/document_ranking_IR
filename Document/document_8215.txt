At the point when Elgar was 29, he took on another student, Caroline Alice Roberts, little girl of the late Major-General Sir Henry Roberts, and distributed creator of section and writing fiction. Eight years more seasoned than Elgar, Alice turned into his better half three years after the fact. Elgar's biographer Michael Kennedy expresses, "Alice's family was stunned by her expectation to wed an obscure performer who worked in a shop and was a Roman Catholic. She was excluded." They were hitched on 8 May 1889, at Brompton Oratory. From that point until her demise, she went about as his business chief and social secretary, managed his emotional episodes, and was a discerning melodic pundit. She did her best to pick up him the consideration of powerful society, however with restricted achievement. In time, he would figure out how to acknowledge the distinctions given him, understanding that they made a difference more to her and her social class and perceiving what she had offered up to further his profession. In her journal, she expressed, "The consideration of a virtuoso is a sufficient labor of love for any lady." As a commitment present, Elgar committed his short violin-and-piano piece "Salut d'Amour" to her. With Alice's consolation, the Elgars moved to London to be nearer to the focal point of British melodic life, and Elgar began dedicating his opportunity to organization. Their single tyke, Carice Irene, was conceived at their home in West Kensington on 14 August 1890. Her name, uncovered in Elgar's devotion of "Salut d'Amour", was a withdrawal of her mom's names Caroline and Alice.
