Washington requested Scott to lead a progression of starter strikes in mid-1791 that would keep the adversary involved while St. Clair amassed the essential attack compel. Both Isaac Shelby and Benjamin Logan had wanted to lead the crusade, and neither would acknowledge a lesser position. Shelby by and by upheld the crusade, while Logan effectively contradicted it. Scott issued a call for volunteers to gather at Frankfort, Kentucky, on May15, 1791, to do these attacks. Kentuckians reacted positively to the possibility of an all-local army crusade, and 852 men volunteered for administration, in spite of the fact that Scott was just approved to take 750; Senator John Brown was among the volunteers. After a concise postponement to gain proficiency with the destiny of a fizzled discretionary mission to the Miami clans in the Northwest Territory, Scott's men left from Fort Washington on May24. The minute men crossed the Ohio toward a grip of Miami, Kickapoo, Wea, and Potawatomi settlements close to the area of present-day Lafayette, Indiana. For eight days, they crossed tough landscape and were tousled by regular rainstorms. The cruel conditions ruined the volunteer army's provisions, and they turned to social occasion the blackberries that were developing in the zone; thus, the undertaking earned the moniker the "Blackberry Campaign".
