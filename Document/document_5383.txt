Geoffrey since quite a while ago confronted restriction from certain individuals from his church section driven by Henry Marshal, Burchard du Puiset, and Roger of London. They questioned his having given an extensive piece of York's treasury toward Richard's payment, and to a portion of his arrangements in the congregation of York. Charges of simony, blackmail, and disregard of his obligations were held up against Geoffrey, who consequently expelled the instigators more than once, and kept the groups out of chapel. Geoffrey likewise confronted troubles with his deputies to the workplace of Dean of York; his first decision, his relative Peter, was contradicted by the house of prayer section. Geoffrey's second decision, Simon of Apulia, the chancellor of York, wouldn't surrender the workplace when Geoffrey chose to grant it to a third man, Philip of Poitou. Simon was upheld by the house of God part, who chose him to the workplace notwithstanding Geoffrey's restriction. An intrigue was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon made a trip to King Richard in Germany. The lord would not enable the intrigue and endeavored to gather Geoffrey to Germany to determine the issue. Geoffrey was unfit to leave York in view of aggravations inside the house of prayer ministry, and Simon figured out how to verify ecclesiastical affirmation as Dean of York.
