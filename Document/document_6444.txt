John Eliot Gardiner, who led all Bach's congregation cantatas in 2000, put the Pentecostal cantatas amidst the venture, which he saw as a "year-long investigation of his cantatas in their occasional setting". He depicted Pentecost as "the summit of those 'extraordinary fifty days' which pursue the Resurrection, a watershed denoting the fulfillment of Jesus' work on earth and the happening to the Holy Spirit", and remarked that Bach "thinks of music of unalloyed confidence and abundance in festivity ofÃÂ ... the extraordinary start of the awesome Pentecostal sparkle which enables people to impart over the language boundary". As to the principal cantata composed for the event, he saw that Bach mirrors the "stages in the developing relationship of God with man", both by scoring and by his decision of keys. In the Weimar first form, the key of the primary developments is C major, brought down to A minor (a third lower) in the fourth, brought further down to F major (again a third lower) in the fifth and 6th. The scoring is magnificent, with three trumpets and timpani in development 1 and three trumpets again in development 3, diminished to strings in development 4 and to single instruments in development 5.
