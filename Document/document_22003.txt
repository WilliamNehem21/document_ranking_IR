Joel Asaph Allen first described "Oryzomys mexicanus" as a full species in 1897 from specimens from Jalisco. In the same publication, he also described "Oryzomys bulleri" from nearby Nayarit, but he did not compare the two with each other. Merriam added a second species from Nayarit, "Oryzomys rufus", in 1901, noting that it was smaller and more reddish than "mexicanus". Goldman synonymized the three as "O.Â couesi mexicanus" in 1918 and in 2009 Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred, arguing that the differences between "rufus" and "mexicanus" were age-related and within the normal range of variation of the animal. Another subspecies, "Oryzomys couesi lambi", was described by Burt in 1934 from central coastal Sonora, which extended the range of the species by at the time. This form is dark gray-brown, much darker than "mexicanus", and has a shorter tail and weaker jugals. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that it is similar to "mexicanus", but that further research is needed to determine whether it should be recognized as a subspecies. Large "O.Â couesi" from northern Sinaloa may also belong to this form. Goldman wrote that "mexicanus" was very similar to nominate "couesi", but usually with paler fur; the upperparts are more buffy than in "couesi" and the underparts are usually white, but may be buffy, the normal color in "couesi".
