With the patio nursery venture well close by, Ammanati turned his considerations to making a substantial yard promptly behind the main faÃÂ§ade, to connect the palazzo to its new garden. This patio has substantial grouped directed rustication that has been broadly duplicated, eminently for the Parisian "palais" of Maria de' Medici, the Luxembourg. In the primary faÃÂ§ade Ammanati likewise made the "finestre inginocchiate" ("stooping" windows, in reference to their envisioned similarity to a "prie-dieu", a gadget of Michelangelo's), supplanting the passageway inlets at each end. Amid the years 1558Ã¢ÂÂ 70, Ammanati made a momentous staircase to lead with more grandeur to the "piano nobile", and he broadened the wings on the greenery enclosure front that grasped a patio unearthed into the steeply slanting slope at a similar dimension as the piazza in front, from which it was obvious through the focal curve of the storm cellar. On the greenery enclosure side of the yard Amannati developed a cave, called the "cave of Moses" because of the porphyry statue that possesses it. On the porch above it, level with the "piano nobile" windows, Ammanati developed a wellspring fixated on the pivot; it was later supplanted by the "Fontana del Carciofo" ("Fountain of the Artichoke"), planned by Giambologna's previous right hand, Francesco Susini, and finished in 1641.
