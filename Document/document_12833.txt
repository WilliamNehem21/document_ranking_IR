Beach front southern California from 60,000YBP as far as possible of the Last Glacial Maximum was cooler and with a more adjusted supply of dampness than today. Amid the Last Glacial Maximum, the mean yearly temperature diminished from down to degrees, and yearly precipitation had diminished from down to . This locale was unaffected by the climatic impacts of the Wisconsin glaciation, and is thought to have been an Ice Age refugium for creatures and cold-delicate plants. By 24,000YBP, the plenitude of oak and chaparral diminished, however pines expanded, making open parklands like the present waterfront montane/juniper forests. After 14,000YBP, the bounty of conifers diminished, and those of the cutting edge beach front plant networks, including oak forest, chaparral, and seaside sage scour, expanded. The Santa Monica Plain lies north of the city of Santa Monica and stretches out along the southern base of the Santa Monica Mountains, and 28,000Ã¢ÂÂ 26,000YBP it was overwhelmed by waterfront sage clean, with cypress and pines at higher heights. The Santa Monica Mountains upheld a chaparral network on its inclines and disconnected coast redwood and dogwood in its secured ravines, alongside stream networks that included willow, red cedar, and sycamore. These plant networks recommend a winter precipitation like that of present day seaside southern California, yet the nearness of coast redwood currently found toward the north shows a cooler, moister, and less regular atmosphere than today. This condition upheld substantial herbivores that were prey for desperate wolves and their rivals.
