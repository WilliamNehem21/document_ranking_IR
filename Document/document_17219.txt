In 1906, as Potter was finishing "The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher", she considered developing books for a younger audience. Three stories were the result: "The Story of Miss Moppet", "The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit" and "The Sly Old Cat". Inspired by George Cruikshank's illustrations, she intended to have the stories published in "panoramic format in the style of Cruikshank's "Comic Alphabet"", as explained by Taylor. The panorama format consisted of "long strips of paper, on which the individual pages of pictures and text were arranged in order from left to right."
Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 during the development of "Miss Moppet", and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject. "[A]n exasperating model," Potter wrote, "I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle." Biographer Linda Lear explains that "pickle" was a word Potter used to describe "free-thinking exuberant people, like her cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." Potter used the same drawings of the kitten as a model for her next book, "The Tale of Tom Kitten", which she dedicated in 1907 "to all Picklesâespecially those that get upon my garden wall". Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten's sisters, and appears as a character in both books featuring him: "The Tale of Tom Kitten" and "The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding" (1908).
