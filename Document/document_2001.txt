Paterson and Fehlmann, alongside normal colleagues Hughes, Nick Burton, and Phillips, composed and delivered "Cydonia" for an arranged 1999 discharge. Highlighted on the collection were appearances from Robert Fripp, John Roome (Witchman), and Fil Le Gonidec, one of the Orb's live entertainers. Artists Nina Walsh and Aki Omori showed up on two tracks each, furnishing vocals and co-composing verses with Paterson. Paterson felt this new bearing of songwriting for the Orb was progressively like the test work of "Orbus Terrarum" than to the techno-fly of "Orblivion". Island Records was in a time of rebuilding because of its ongoing buy by Universal Music Group, and "Cydonia" was not discharged until 2001. Upon discharge, pundits noticed that "Cydonia" combined pop, daze, and encompassing name music, which they felt to be a mixture of dull vocals and uninventive vibe that came up short on the intrigue of the Orb's prior work. "NME" cruelly depicted it as "a stillborn relic, imperfect all through by constantly hindered aspirations" and portraying its solitary proper gathering of people to be "old ravers" looking for wistfulness. The Orb were for the most part viewed by the British press as past their prime and a "surrounding dinosaur" strange in the present move music condition. After the arrival of "Cydonia", Hughes left the gathering for undisclosed reasons, turning into "another sharp takeoff from the Orb" as indicated by "The Guardian".
