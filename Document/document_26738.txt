In a 2007 interview with GameTrailers, "God of War" creator and game director David Jaffe explained his original intention for the series, which is different from the actual ending of "God of War III", which was based on game director Stig Asmussen's vision. Jaffe's idea was that ""God of War" explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths". He said that it would have been "hell on earth" as the gods and Titans battled each other for domination. Other mythological pantheons would have become involved after Kratos killed Zeus and the other Greek gods, and the result would be that humankind no longer believed in the godsâaccording to Jaffe, the only way a god can truly die. "God of War III" was first mentioned by "God of War II" game director Cory Barlog at a "God of War II" launch event. Barlog said that the game would have full 1080p HD resolution (changed to 720p in final release) and support Sixaxis tilt and vibration functions. Announced before the DualShock 3 controller was introduced, this caused confusion since the Sixaxis controller does not support rumble. During the 2009 Game Developers Conference (GDC), the creative team said that the Sixaxis tilt capability had been removed because they "could not find a suitable situation to use Sixaxis in the game effectively".
