Preceding , a thriving exchange course for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. In any case, after the war started, a ban was set on French Percherons, forbidding them from exportation. Other than an exemption in April 1916 to enable 59 steeds to be transported from France to the US, this ban stayed set up until the finish of the war. The war negatively affected the Percheron breed as ponies, grub, and handlers were ordered for the battling, and even after the ban was lifted France did not have the quality or amount of stock to satisfy the requirements of American reproducers. The ban made a rearing blast in the US, supplanting the past routine with regards to bringing in most of Percherons from France, and late in the war steeds were sent the other wayÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ from the US to EuropeÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ to supply those required in the war. The absence of feathering on the Percheron's lower legs made them simpler to think about in the mud that they regularly worked in amid wartime. Their snappy run on cleared streets made them more flexible than mechanized vehicles, and they were helpful for work with weapons and in forward units because of their quiet demeanors.
