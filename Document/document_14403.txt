The railroad highlighted the "Lilly Belle", a 1:8-scale live steam train named after Disney's significant other and worked by the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop group driven by Roger E. Broggie. The train's plan, picked by Disney in the wake of seeing a littler train show with a similar structure at the home of rail student of history Gerald M. Best, depended straightforwardly on duplicates of the plans for the Central Pacific No. 173, a 4-4-0 steam train reconstructed by the Central Pacific Railroad in 1872. The initials for the Carolwood Pacific Railroad, "CPRR", coordinated the initials for the Central Pacific Railroad, one of the railways that finished the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Under Broggie's direction, Disney helped fabricate a few sections for the "Lilly Belle", including its smokestack and headlamp. The greater part of the machining was finished by Broggie's machine shop group, and the wooden taxi was worked by Disney by and by. On December 24, 1949, the "Lilly Belle" and its delicate were first trial on a little circle of track amid the studio's Christmas party before the staff. The delicate could convey up to of water and of coal pulverized to scale-sized irregularities to fuel the train. Disney ran the "Lilly Belle" on the Carolwood Pacific Railroad out of the blue on May 7, 1950.
