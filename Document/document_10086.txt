Quite a bit of MacLaren's time was presently taken up working for Ranjitsinhji, who visited England between October 1907 and December 1908. MacLaren played only nine matches in 1908; Lancashire were excited for him to play, yet he had little effect. His most prominent achievement wanted the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval, when he imparted an association of 141 to C. B. Broil. Altogether, he scored 428 keeps running at a normal of 28.53. In the mean time, Ranjitsinhji lived luxuriously in Sussex, running up immense bills and disregarding most endeavors to make him pay. MacLaren was associated with a few cases which brought about either lawful activity or grumbling to the India Office. At the point when a craftsman needed to go to court to make Ranjitsinhji pay for work she had done, MacLaren's endeavors to postpone and impede her caused the India Office, in its arbitration, to depict him as Ranjitsinhji's "strange private secretary". In October, MacLaren was prosecuted himself over non-installment of lease. He had a house near Ranjitsinhji's living arrangement, and guaranteed in court that Ranjitsinhji leased the house for his sake, and, as a decision sovereign, couldn't be arraigned. The judges deviated, ruled MacLaren at risk, and constrained him to payÃ¢ÂÂin spite of the fact that Ranjitsinhji presumably paid for him.
