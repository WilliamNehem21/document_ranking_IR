The residency of Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger as Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee was set to lapse in May 1966, and a substitution must be chosen from the administration boss. The Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, had among barrier and military circles been thought to be the common successor. In any case, mounting hypothesis emerged from late 1965 over who was to be chosen for the situation as it progressed toward becoming known Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies favored McNicoll for the post, as did Secretary of the Department of Defense Sir Ted Hicks, who thought McNicoll more astute and target than his military partner. McNicoll campaigned fervently for the position, and was upheld by his significant other, Frances, who effectively crusaded for her better half's sake. By December 1965, Scherger's substitution had still not been settled on and Menzies deferred the choice until the new year. Be that as it may, Menzies resigned in January 1966 and was prevailing by his representative, Harold Holt. Holt and the recently designated Minister for Defense, Allen Fairhall, favored Wilton and eventually chosen him to succeed Scherger. In any occasion, McNicoll was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1966 New Year Honors for his administration as CNS.
