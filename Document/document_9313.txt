The maxilla (the principle part of the upper jaw) was broad, and shaped the greater part of the side of the nose. It contained all the upper teeth, with the exception of the incisors. The infraorbital foramina (openings at the lower front of the maxilla) were cut like in certain examples and adjusted in others, and differed in number from one to three. A standout amongst the most trademark highlights of the substance of "Catopsbaatar" was the extremely extensive front zygomatic edge on the sides of the upper jaw (a site for jaw-muscle connection). It was a lot higher than in different djadochtatheriids with the exception of "Djadochtatherium", from which it varied in that the edge was crescent instead of generally trapezoidal (other genera have circular edges). The front edge of the foremost zygomatic edge was thickened, which delivered a lump as an afterthought edge of the nose when seen from the side or more. The lower some portion of the suture between the maxilla and the squamosal bone reached out along the rear fringe of the foremost zygomatic edge. The palatal procedures of the maxilla framed the majority of the sense of taste. The real palatine foramina had shallow depressions reaching out forward. The postpalatine torus (a hard distension on the sense of taste) of "Catopsbaatar" was less noticeable than was that of "Tombaatar". The frontal bone was vast, and framed a large portion of the cranial rooftop. The suture between the frontal and parietal bones framed a U-molded part in the center which pointed in reverseÃ¢ÂÂlike the condition in "Kryptobaatar" however less profound, with littler U-formed structures along the edges. This contrasted from "Djadochtatherium", which had a smaller V-molded suture between the frontal and parietal bones.
