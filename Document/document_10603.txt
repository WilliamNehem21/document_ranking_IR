The armada withdrew for a voyage in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had planned to utilize the Harwich Force to clear the Heligoland Bight yet terrible climate avoided activities in the southern North Sea and the task was limited toward the northern end. Another breadth started on 6 March yet was deserted the next day as the climate became unreasonably serious for the destroyer escorts. The evening of 25 March, "Erin" and the remainder of the armada cruised from Scapa Flow to help Beatty's battlecruisers and other light powers striking the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. When the Grand Fleet moved toward the zone on 26 March, the British and German powers had just withdrawn and a solid storm undermined the light specialty, so the armada was requested to come back to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet directed an exhibition off Horns Reef to occupy the Germans while the Russian Navy re-laid its cautious minefields in the Baltic Sea. The armada came back to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refueled before cruising south, over knowledge reports that the Germans were going to dispatch a strike on Lowestoft. The Germans had pulled back before the armada arrived. On 2Ã¢ÂÂ 4 May, the Grand Fleet directed another exhibition off Horns Reef to keep German consideration on the North Sea.
