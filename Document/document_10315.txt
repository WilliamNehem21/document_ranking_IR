Under expanding strain to leave, Agnew took the position that a sitting VP couldn't be arraigned and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, requesting an examination. He refered to as point of reference a 1826 House examination of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was asserted to have taken ill-advised installments while a bureau part. Albert, second in line to the administration under Agnew, reacted that it would be inappropriate for the House to act in an issue under the watchful eye of the courts. Agnew likewise documented a movement to hinder any arraignment in light of the fact that he had been biased by ill-advised holes from the Justice Department, and endeavored to rally general sentiment, giving a discourse before an agreeable crowd in Los Angeles affirming his blamelessness and assaulting the indictment. All things considered, Agnew went into arrangements for a supplication deal, and wrote in his journals that he did as such on the grounds that he was exhausted from the all-encompassing emergency, to secure his family, and in light of the fact that he dreaded he couldn't get a reasonable preliminary. He settled on his choice on October 5, and request dealings occurred over the next days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and educated the President of his approaching abdication.
