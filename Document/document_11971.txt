Amid the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender cover without precedent for an ordinary season diversion. In spite of the fact that Plante had utilized his cover practically speaking since 1956 in the wake of missing 13 amusements as a result of a sinusitis task, head mentor Toe Blake was apprehensive it would disable his vision and would not allow him to wear it amid guideline play. Be that as it may, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot discharged by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a diversion against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the changing area for join. When he returned, he was wearing the rough home-made goaltender cover that he had been utilizing in practices. Blake was outraged, yet he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante would not come back to the objective except if he wore the veil. Blake conceded to the condition that Plante dispose of the veil when the cut mended. The Canadiens won 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1. Amid the next days Plante would not dispose of the cover, and as the Canadiens kept on winning, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak extended to 18 diversions. Plante did not wear the cover, at Blake's solicitation, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3Ã¢ÂÂ 0, and the veil returned for good the following night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.
