At the point when the 17 August strike happened, two units of the 21st Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts were pushing ahead to retake Kokoda and get ready for tasks to recover Buna. On being educated by Potts that just 10,000 rather than the foreseen 40,000 proportions were at Myola, Rowell found a way to facilitate the supply circumstance. He kept down the third legion of Potts' detachment, the 2/27th Infantry Battalion, and requested Allen to restore the 39th Infantry Battalion to Port Moresby. Kienzle had 933 Papuans working among Myola and Isurava. Not all were bearers; some gathered supplies from the drop territory, and others were occupied with other work, for example, building cabins and havens. Rowell diverted down a solicitation from Potts for 800 additional transporters to push supplies ahead from Myola, permitting him just another 300 from the Port Moresby-Myola bearer line until stocks at Myola were developed. Potts' job was to be a guarded one up to that point, and the 2/fourteenth and 2/sixteenth were to stay in the Myola territory. On 23 August, an airplane dropped proportions, medicinal supplies, two 3-inch mortars and 120 mortar bombs. Another four burdens were dropped the next day before mists shut in over Myola. Allen announced that 5,000 crisis apportions and 1,500 adjusted proportions had been dropped, alongside of bread rolls and of other proportion parts, and 21,000 quinine tablets. Somewhere in the range of 237,000 rounds of .303 ammo for the rifles, 140,000 rounds of .45 for the Thompson submachine weapons, and 1,050 hand projectiles had been sent to Myola.
