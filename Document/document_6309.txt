At the loft, Father John and Lloyd discover Linda has moved out, however they find she had a 12-year-old news cut-out about Father John's appointment. Father John offers Lloyd an occupation assisting at the congregation, which Lloyd acknowledges. Father John at that point comes back to his congregation and cries, dreading he is past the point where it is possible to spare Linda. In the interim, Linda goes to an extension and is going to bounce off when she experiences Gus, who offers her the rosary he got before from Father John. A thankful and passionate Linda embraces Gus. It isn't uncovered whether she ends it all or not. In an admission to Father Ralph, Father John communicates blame he didn't vindicate Linda before her admission unexpectedly finished. Father Ralph says that regardless of whether Linda is dead, her spirit is undying, and that Father John's repentance is to exculpate her now. Father John does as such. The film closes with a beloved memory of youthful Linda at chapel, where a gathering of young men giggle at her old torn garments until she is safeguarded by a youthful John Buerlein, whose demonstration appears to have a solid constructive outcome upon her.
