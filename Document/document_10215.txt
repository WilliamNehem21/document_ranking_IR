Gordon-Cumming was supplanted in the observer box by the sovereign. Inspected by Clarke, he expressed that he had not seen any tricking, and was uninformed of the allegations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. Following 20 minutes of inquiries from both Clarke and Russell, the ruler was allowed to withdraw. As the sovereign was leaving the observer box, an individual from the jury put two inquiries to Edward: regardless of whether the beneficiary had seen "nothing of the supposed misbehaviors of the offended party?", and "what was your Royal Highness' feeling at the time with regards to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" To the primary inquiry the ruler answered that he had not, despite the fact that he clarified that "it isn't regular for an investor to see anything in managing cards"; to the second, he expressed that "the charges seemed, by all accounts, to be unanimous to the point that it was the best possible courseÃ¢ÂÂno other course was available to meÃ¢ÂÂthan to trust them". In examination with Gordon-Cumming's execution in the observer box, Edward did not establish a solid connection; the journalist for "The New York Times" saw "that the beneficiary evident was positively uneasy, that he continued changing his position, and that he didn't appear to be ready to keep his hands stillÃÂ ... But to those close him, just a few of his answers were genuinely capable of being heard all through the court". "The Daily News" concurred, and expressed that the impression picked up from the sovereign's execution was negative.
