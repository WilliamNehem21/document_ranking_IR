The polish lies flush with the gold surfaces; it was a planning of finely ground glass glue connected with incredible consideration to the readied recessed zones, and afterward terminated. Distinctive shades of lacquer meet each other with a flawless limit, which was accomplished by terminating one shading with a holding outskirt of gum tragacanth before including the following. The trouble was expanded by the utilization of tints of an alternate shading to a base shade of finish before terminating, so the additional shading mixes step by step out of spotlight shading around the edges of the tinted zone. This is particularly utilized on "transition", or lackluster lacquer, as in the ground regions, shakes and trees. Transition was additionally utilized for substance zones as on a gold foundation it obscures marginally when terminated to a reasonable shading for skin. The "rouge clair" or "ruby glass" red, utilized so successfully here, was made by including minor particles of copper, silver and gold to the glass; here logical tests have demonstrated that copper was utilized. Subsequent to terminating the lacquer was cleaned flush with the encompassing metal. The strategy had been known to the Ancient Romans (see the Lycurgus Cup, additionally in the British Museum), yet was lost toward the finish of the Middle Ages until the 17thÃÂ century. The additional barrels utilize obscure finish, with the exception of the red on the Tudor roses, which is translucent "rouge clair", of a comparable creation to the first reds. Translucent finish is more delicate than hazy, and medieval survivals in great condition are extremely uncommon.
