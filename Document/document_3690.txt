Leno considered the woman jobs in two of his last emulates, "Bluebeard" (1901) and "Mother Goose" (1902), composed by J. Hickory Wood, to be his top choices. He was paid ÃÂ£200 (ÃÂ£ in 2019 balanced for expansion) for every one of the emulate seasons. Leno showed up at Drury Lane as Sister Anne in "Bluebeard", a character portrayed by Wood as "a buoyant, to some degree underneath moderately aged individual who was of a going ahead air and who had not yet surrendered expectation" "The Times" dramatization commentator noted: "It is a very exceptional and unique Sister Anne, who moves breakdowns and sings odd melodies to a still more odd harp and plays ping-pong with a skillet and potatoes and vaudevilles Sherlock Holmes and wears the most bizarre of pieces of clothing and dresses her hair like Miss Morleena Kenwigs, and talks in a funneling voiceÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ in short it is none other than Dan Leno whom we as a whole know". "Mother Goose" gave Leno a standout amongst the most testing jobs of his profession, in which he was required to depict a similar lady in a few distinct appearances. Wood's thought, that neither fortune nor magnificence would bring joy, was delineated by a progression of mysterious character changes. Poor people, unkempt and by and large terrible Mother Goose in the end turned into a rich and delightful however bland parvenu, scanning for a suitor. The creation was one of Drury Lane's best emulates, running until 28 March 1903.
