"Las Meninas" is set in VelÃÂ¡zquez's studio in PhilipÃÂ IV's AlcÃÂ¡zar royal residence in Madrid. The high-ceilinged room is exhibited, in the expressions of Silvio Gaggi, as "a straightforward box that could be isolated into a viewpoint matrix with a solitary evaporating point". In the focal point of the frontal area stands the Infanta Margaret TheresaÃÂ (1). The five-year-old infanta, who later hitched Holy Roman Emperor LeopoldÃÂ I, was now Philip and Mariana's solitary enduring youngster. She is gone to by two women in-pausing, or "meninas": doÃÂ±a Isabel de VelascoÃÂ (2), who is ready to bow to the princess, and doÃÂ±a MarÃÂ­a Agustina Sarmiento de SotomayorÃÂ (3), who bows before Margaret Theresa, offering her a beverage from a red glass, or "bÃÂºcaro", that she hangs on a brilliant plate. To one side of the Infanta are two smaller people: the achondroplastic German, Maribarbola (4) (Maria Barbola), and the Italian, Nicolas PertusatoÃÂ (5), who energetically attempts to stir a drowsy mastiff with his foot. The puppy is believed to be slid from two mastiffs from Lyme Hall in Cheshire, given to Phillip III in 1604 by James I of England. Behind them stands doÃÂ±a Marcela de UlloaÃÂ (6), the princess' chaperone, wearing grieving and conversing with a unidentified guardian (or "guardadamas")ÃÂ (7).
