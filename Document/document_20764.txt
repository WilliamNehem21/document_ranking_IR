Both ships had reached Japan by February 1898.
At the start of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, "Fuji" and "Yashima" were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet. They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February, when Admiral TÅgÅ HeihachirÅ led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. TÅgÅ chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as his and six-inch guns inflicted very little damage on the Russian vessels, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships. "Yashima" was not struck during the battle, but "Fuji" was hit twice, two men being killed and 10 wounded.
On 10 March, the two ships blindly bombarded the harbour of Port Arthur from Pigeon Bay, on the southwest side of the Liaodong Peninsula, at a range of , but did little damage. When they tried again on 22 March, they were attacked by Russian coastal defence guns that had been transferred there, and also from several Russian ships in Port Arthur using observers overlooking Pigeon Bay. The Japanese ships disengaged after "Fuji" was hit by a 12-inch shell.
