The best hockey players on their secondary school group, Ross and the Patrick siblings were welcome to play incidental diversions for nearby class groups in Montreal. Ross previously played in a sorted out alliance in 1905, joining Montreal Westmount of the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL), the top beginner class in Canada. He scored ten objectives in eight diversions amid the season. His adversaries viewed him as a standout amongst the best surging defencemen. Most safeguards at the time either shot the puck down the ice or go to a forward; conversely, Ross skated up the ice, bringing the puck into the hostile zone. Soon thereafter, wishing to seek after a vocation in banking, he moved to Brandon, Manitoba, where he joined the Brandon Elks of the Manitoba Hockey League, the senior class in the region. In 1906, his first season, he scored six objectives in seven amusements while he recorded six objectives in ten recreations in 1907. Around this time, the Kenora Thistles, the Manitoba League champions, needed to reinforce their group for the Stanley Cup challenge against the Montreal Wanderers in Montreal amid January 1907. They paid Ross $1,000 to play the two matches, a typical practice at the time, and the Thistles won the Cup. While neglecting to score, Ross began many has and demonstrated a critical impact of the group. In spite of the fact that he played for the contradicting group, he got a decent gathering from the Montreal swarm. Ross did not play for the Thistles when the two groups played for the Cup again in March, which the Wanderers won to reclaim the Cup.
