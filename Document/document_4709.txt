The contrast between check classifiers and mass-classifiers can be depicted as one of evaluating as opposed to ordering: as it were, mass-classifiers "make" a unit by which to quantify something (for example boxes, gatherings, lumps, pieces, and so on.), though check classifiers just "name" a current thing. Most words can show up with both tally classifiers and mass-classifiers; for instance, pizza can be depicted as both ("yÃÂ¬ bÃÂsÃÂ ", "one pizza", truly "one of pizza"), utilizing a check classifier, and as ("yÃÂ­ bÃÂsÃÂ ", "one of pizza"), utilizing a mass-classifier. Notwithstanding these semantic contrasts, there are contrasts in the linguistic practices of tally classifiers and mass-classifiers; for instance, mass-classifiers might be changed by a little arrangement of descriptive words (as in ÃÂ "yÃÂ­ dÃÂ  rÃÂ©n", "a major of individuals"), while check classifiers for the most part may not (for instance, *ÃÂ "yÃÂ­ dÃÂ  rÃÂ©n" is never said for "a major individual"; rather the modifier must alter the thing: ÃÂ "yÃÂ­ dÃÂ  rÃÂ©n"). Another distinction is that check classifiers may frequently be supplanted by a "general" classifier (), "gÃÂ¨" with no evident change in significance, though mass-classifiers may not. Syntacticians Lisa Cheng and Rint Sybesma suggest that tally classifiers and mass-classifiers have distinctive fundamental syntactic structures, with tally classifiers shaping "classifier expressions", and mass-classifiers being a kind of relative statement that just "looks" like a classifier expression. The qualification between check classifiers and mass-classifiers is regularly hazy, in any case, and different etymologists have recommended that tally classifiers and mass-classifiers may not be in a general sense unique. They place that "check classifier" and "mass-classifier" are the boundaries of a continuum, with most classifiers falling some place in the middle.
