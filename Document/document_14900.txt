A progressively total example of comparative creature was found in a quarry in Maidstone, Kent, in 1834 (Lower Greensand Formation), which Mantell before long procured. He was directed to distinguish it as an "Iguanodon" in light of its particular teeth. The Maidstone piece was used in the main skeletal reproductions and aesthetic renderings of "Iguanodon", however because of its deficiency, Mantell committed a few errors, the most well known of which was the situation of what he thought was a horn on the nose. The disclosure of much better examples in later years uncovered that the horn was really an altered thumb. Still encased in shake, the Maidstone skeleton is right now shown at the Natural History Museum in London. The ward of Maidstone celebrated this find by including an "Iguanodon" as a supporter to their escutcheon in 1949. This example has turned out to be connected with the name "I. mantelli", a species named in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer instead of "I. anglicus", yet it really originates from an unexpected arrangement in comparison to the first "I. mantelli"/"I. anglicus" material. The Maidstone example, otherwise called Gideon Mantell's "Shelf piece", and formally marked NHMUK 3741 was in this manner rejected from "Iguanodon". It is delegated "cf." "Mantellisaurus" by McDonald (2012); as cf. "Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis" by Norman (2012); and made the holotype of a different animal types "Mantellodon carpenteri" by Paul (2012).
