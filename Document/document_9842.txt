"Bellerophon" was quickly refitted in January 1810, after which she was tied down at the Nore. She at that point continued her barricade obligations in the North Sea, serving under a progression of administrators. Warren was prevailing by Captain John Halsted on 23 August, and he by Captain Augustus Brine on 5 November. Salt water's direction kept going until February 1813, amid which time "Bellerophon" stayed with the North Sea barring squadron. Skipper Edward Hawker touched base to assume control over direction on 11 February 1813, and arrangements were made for "Bellerophon" to turn into the lead of Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Goodwin Keats, the recently delegated Governor of Newfoundland. "Bellerophon" transported Keats to St. John's, and afterward cruised south to Bermuda as a caravan escort. Coming back to St John's in the late spring, she caught a few American boats, including the 16-weapon privateer "Genie". She spent the remainder of the year watching off Cape Race, before coming back to Britain with a caravan in November. 1814 was spent on comparable obligations: "Bellerophon" escorted a guard to St John's among April and June, and afterward watched off Cape Race until December. She at that point moved to the Nore, and on 9 April 1815 Hawker was supplanted by Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland.
