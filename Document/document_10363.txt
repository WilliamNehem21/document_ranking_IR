Packaging, or fixing a gap with a cylinder, is important at whatever point boring activities require that the borehole be separated from the encompassing penetrable snow and firn. Uncased gaps can be bored with liquid by utilizing a hose brought down into the opening, yet this is probably going to prompt expanded penetrating liquid utilization and natural defilement from holes. Steel packaging was utilized during the 1970s, however rust from the packaging made harm the drills, and the packaging was not fixed, prompting liquid breaks. There were likewise issues with the packaging tubes not being focused, which made harm the boring tool as it was brought down through the packaging. Fiberglass and HDPE packaging has turned out to be progressively normal, with intersections fixed with PTFE tape, yet spills are visit. Warmth combination welding for HDPE packaging is a conceivable arrangement. To seal the base of the packaging, water can be siphoned to the base of the opening once the packaging is set, or a warm head can be utilized to liquefy ice around the packaging shoe, making a seal when the water solidifies once more. Another methodology is to utilize a hotpoint drill, immersing the snow and firn with dissolved water, which will at that point stop and seal the borehole.
