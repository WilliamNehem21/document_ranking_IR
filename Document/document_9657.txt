The following day, McClellan started his assault with a few advances by the Union right flank, a long way from the situation of the 21st. For a great part of the day, the IX Corps could hear the battling and anticipated requests to take the scaffold in their front. The 21st even was sufficiently blessed to have a mail call that morning, and the men sat down to peruse letters from home while battling seethed around the Dunker Church two miles (3ÃÂ km) away. At long last, orders came around early afternoon and Ferrero's detachment was drawn nearer to the extension. It was a troublesome target. On the contrary bank, a lush feign transcended the stream. Covered there was a little power of 400 Confederates who might effectively hold a huge number of Union troops under control for a considerable length of time. The men of the 21st viewed a few progressive charges on the scaffold by detachments of the IX Corps, which were all shocked. At last, Ferrero's unit was requested forward. Achieving the extension at a run, the 21st was requested to take up a situation beside the left projection, providing covering fire, while the 51st New York Infantry and the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry at last conveyed the position. As the Confederates withdrew, Ferrero's detachment was before long positioned at the highest point of the feign. Later toward the evening, around dusk, a Confederate counterattack almost drove the IX Corps back crosswise over Antietam Creek. Ferrero's unit held the feign, be that as it may, assuming a key job in checking the counterattack, and taking serious losses all the while. The 21st recorded 10 executed and 35 injured, losses of 30 percent.
