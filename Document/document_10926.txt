The Civil War brought monetary unsettling influences which brought about the evacuation of certain coins, including the base-metal penny, from flow. Paper money (esteemed as low as three pennies), postage stamps, and private tokens, filled the hole. A considerable lot of the tokens were penny measured, yet more slender and made of bronze. Mint experts paid heed that these metal pieces were effectively flowing, and got enactment for a bronze penny. Longacre's Indian head structure proceeded in its place with the new metal; later in 1864 he engraved his underlying "L" in the hat. The demonstration which approved the bronze penny likewise issued a two-penny piece; Longacre outfitted a structure, which Lange calls an "especially alluring arrangement" with bolts and a tree wreath flanking a shield. In any case, workmanship history specialist Cornelius Vermeule expressed that components of the plan "need just flanking gun to be the quintessential articulations of Civil War heraldry." Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Pursue favored setting an outflow of the country's confidence in God in a period of war on the coinage, and wrote to Mint Director Pollock, "You will make a gadget be set up immediately with a proverb communicating in the least tersest terms conceivable this national acknowledgment." Several witticisms were considered by Pollock, including "God Our Trust" and "God and Our Country". Longacre's two-penny piece was the principal coin engraved with "In God We Trust".
