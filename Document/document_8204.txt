While these game plans continued, Thorpe kept in touch with Sir Jack Hayward, the Bahamas-based tycoon representative, who had offered liberally to the Liberal Party before. In the wake of the Liberals' February 1974 race victories, Thorpe requested ÃÂ£50,000 to recharge the gathering's assets. He further mentioned that ÃÂ£10,000 of this aggregate be paid, not into the gathering's customary records but rather to Nadir Dinshaw, a colleague of Thorpe's who was occupant in the Channel Islands. Thorpe clarified that this subterfuge was important to manage an uncommon classification of unspecific decision costs. Hayward confided in Thorpe, and sent the ÃÂ£10,000 to Dinshaw who, trained by Thorpe, passed the cash to Holmes. After the October 1974 decision Thorpe again mentioned assets from Hayward, and again asked that ÃÂ£10,000 be sent through the Dinshaw course. Hayward obliged, however this time with more hesitance and after some postponement. No bookkeeping of this ÃÂ£20,000 was ever given; Holmes, Le Mesurier and Deakin all said that it was utilized to fund a "trick to alarm", despite the fact that they differ with respect to what amount was spent. Thorpe later changed the story he had given Hayward about exceptional classes of race costs, and said he had saved the entirety with bookkeepers "as an iron hold against any lack of assets at any resulting race." He denied that he had approved any installment to Newton or to any other individual associated with the case.
