Brodie and Hall opened the Port Phillip second innings; they included 12 of every ten minutes before Brodie was gotten at long off by Tabart and was supplanted by Hamilton. Lobby was rejected leg before wicket from the bowling of McDowall without further ado thereafter for six. Lister was gotten off the bowling of Field for three and Henty bowled Thomas for a duck. William Philpott was run out by Tabart for three and Cooper was bowled by Henty for a duck, the fifth man out with the score on 28. Wickets kept on falling, in spite of the fact that Hamilton was batting admirably at the opposite end. Richard Philpott, who scored only a solitary, was gotten by Westbrook off Henty; Marsden was bowled by McDowall for two and Hervey bowled by Henty for one. In the interim, Hamilton had batted for an hour to score 35 runs, the most noteworthy individual score of the match; he was last man out, leg before wicket to McDowall to end the innings for 57 runs. The innings had endured 17 overs and taken 80 minutes. The other batsmen had contributed 21 runs (one bye was scored) between them. Henty took five for 26 and McDowall returned figures of three for 21. Van Diemen's Land required 36 hurries to win.
