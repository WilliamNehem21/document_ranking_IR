The realistic portrayal of brutality in "The Last of Us" created significant editorial from commentators. Engadget author Ben Gilbert found the diversion's industrious spotlight on battle was "a vital abhorrence to lead the amusement's delicate hero team to wellbeing", rather than being utilized as a strategy to accomplish goals. "Kotaku"s Kirk Hamilton composed that the savagery was "overwhelming, weighty and vital", instead of needless. USGamer's Anthony John Agnello composed that the amusement reliably strengthens the pessimism related with brutality, deliberately making players feel awkward while in vicious battle. He expressed that the passings inside the diversion were not pointless or unjustified, making the story all the more dominant. Kelly of "PC and Video Games" expressed that, in spite of the "unimaginably severe" battle, the savagery never felt needless. "Eurogamer"s Welsh reverberated comparative comments, expressing that the viciousness isn't "desensitized or careless". Matt Helgeson of "Amusement Informer" saw that the diversion's viciousness prompts players scrutinizing the ethical quality of their decisions. Joystiq's Mitchell composed that the viciousness is "intended to be awkward", expressing that it adds to Joel's character. Before the arrival of the amusement, Keith Stuart of "The Guardian" composed that the worthiness of the savagery would rely upon its setting inside the diversion.
