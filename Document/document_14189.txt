It was the first run through in the historical backdrop of The Boat Race that every one of the four senior races Ã¢ÂÂ the men's, women's, men's stores' and ladies' stores' Ã¢ÂÂ were hung around the same time and on a similar course along the Tideway. Preceding 2015, the ladies' race, which originally occurred in 1927, was typically held at the Henley Boat Races along the course; on something like two events in the interwar period, the ladies contended on the Thames among Chiswick and Kew. Oxford went into the race as dominant bosses, having won the 2015 race by six and a half lengths, with Cambridge driving 41Ã¢ÂÂ 29 generally speaking. For the fourth year, the men's race was supported by BNY Mellon while the ladies' race was supported by BNY Mellon's backup, Newton Investment Management. In January 2016, it was declared that the supporters would give the title sponsorship to Cancer Research UK and that the occasion was to be retitled "The Cancer Research UK Boat Races". There is no financial honor for winning the race, as the writer Roger Alton takes note of: "It's the last extraordinary novice occasion: seven months of agony for no prize cash".
