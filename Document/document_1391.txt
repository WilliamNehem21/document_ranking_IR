Andrianampoinimerina evacuated the twin houses to assemble his a lot bigger Mahandrihono living arrangement, which was beautified with silver winged animals and chains. He likewise extended the compound and included a second nook of "voafotsy" wood (supplanted every year) around the outside of the stone dividers. Mandraimanjaka was evacuated and in its place Andrianampoinimerina constructed a house with a little pinnacle, which he named Manjakamiadana ("where it is great to govern"), assigning it as the living arrangement for the illustrious "sampy" (icon) called Imanjakatsiroa and the watchmen alloted to ensure it. Two different symbols were kept close-by: Ifantaka, kept in a house in the Bevato compound, and Kelimalaza, monitored in its home at the Ambohimanga neighborhood of Ambohimirary. Under Radama I, the stone divider was strengthened with palisades that encased three houses, two of which were twin houses like those that Andriambelomasina had manufactured. Ranavalona I amplified the compound's patio and extended Manjakamiadana. She built the stone dividers that right now encase the compound, just as its two stone entryways. Ranavalona II re-added palisades to the compound's stone dividers. She obliterated Manjakamiadana and in its place built two half and half Malagasy-European structures utilizing wood from the notable and profoundly critical Masoandro house, which had been expelled from the imperial compound of Antananarivo by Ranavalona I. French general Joseph Gallieni utilized these European-affected structures as his late spring living arrangement in the early long stretches of the French pilgrim time frame. In 2013, Andrianampoinimerina's unique house, the reproduced tombs, and the two illustrious structures are saved in the compound, which additionally incorporates a watchtower, a pen for conciliatory zebu, and two pools built amid the rule of Ranavalona I.
