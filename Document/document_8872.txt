The hosts scored the opening objective through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a situation on the right. Argentina, showing prevalent passing capacity, reacted firmly. Inside eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle got a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and evened out. In the blink of an eye before half-time driving competition goalscorer Guillermo StÃÂ¡bile gave Argentina a 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1 lead. Uruguay commander Nasazzi dissented, keeping up that StÃÂ¡bile was offside, yet without much of any result. In the second half Uruguay bit by bit ended up ascendant. Soon after Monti botched an opportunity to make the score 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1, Uruguay assaulted in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equalizer. After ten minutes an objective by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4Ã¢ÂÂ 2 to seal the success. Langenus finished the match a moment later, and Uruguay in this way included the title World Cup victors to their mantle of Olympic bosses. Jules Rimet displayed the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the leader of the Uruguayan Football Association, RaÃÂºl Jude. The next day was pronounced a national occasion in Uruguay; in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a horde tossed stones at the Uruguayan office. Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the last amazing, 30 August 2010.
