In October, MacDonald acquainted Thomson with Dr. James MacCallum. A regular guest to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) presentations, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met craftsmen, for example, John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum in the end convinced Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and begin an artistic creation vocation. In October 1913, MacCallum acquainted Thomson with A. Y. Jackson, later an originator of the Group of Seven. MacCallum perceived Thomson's and Jackson's gifts and offered to cover their costs for one year on the off chance that they subscribed to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both urged Thomson to "pay attention to up painting, [but] he demonstrated no energy. The odds of acquiring an occupation by it didn't appear to him encouraging. He was delicate and free, and dreaded he may turn into an object of support." MacCallum composed that when he previously observed Thomson's representations, he perceived their "honesty, their inclination and their compassion for the troubling interesting northlandÃÂ ... they made me feel that the North had grasped Thomson as it had held me since I was eleven when I previously cruised and paddled through its quiet places." He portrayed Thomson's sketches as "dull, sloppy in shading, tight and not needing in specialized imperfections". After Thomson's demise, MacCallum helped save and backer for his work.
