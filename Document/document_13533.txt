The different titles gave on the more youthful Edward toward the finish of 1326Ã¢ÂÂwhich recognized his exceptional position in government while abstaining from calling him rulerÃ¢ÂÂmirrored a fundamental protected emergency, of which counterparts were distinctly mindful. The central inquiry was the manner by which the crown was exchanged between two living rulers, a circumstance which had never emerged. Valente has portrayed how this "upset the acknowledged request of things, undermined the sacredness of majesty, and needed clear legitimateness or built up procedure". Counterparts were likewise questionable regarding whether Edward II had relinquished or was being dismissed. On 26 October it had been recorded in the Close Rolls that Edward had "left or relinquished his kingdom", and his nonattendance empowered Isabella and Mortimer to run the show. They could authentically contend that King Edward, having given no official amid his nonattendance (as would be normal), should make his child legislative leader of the kingdom in his dad's stead. They likewise said Edward II held Parliament in disdain by considering it a treasonous gathering and offended those going to it as swindlers". It is obscure whether the King did, truth be told, state or trust this, however it surely fit Isabella and Mortimer for parliament to think so. On the off chance that Edward denounced parliament, at that point he most likely did not understand how it could be utilized against him. Regardless, Edward's nonappearance spared the couple the humiliation of having an authoritative ruler present when they dismissed him, and Seymour Phillips proposes that if Edward had gone to he may have sufficiently discovered help to disturb their arrangements.
