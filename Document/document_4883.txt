A 1965 paper by A.K. Rozhdestvensky perceived the majority of Maleev's examples as various development phases of similar species, which he accepted to be particular from the North American "Tyrannosaurus". He made another blend, "Tarbosaurus bataar", to incorporate every one of the examples portrayed in 1955 just as more up to date material. Later creators, including Maleev himself, concurred with Rozhdestvensky's examination, albeit some utilized the name "Tarbosaurus efremovi" as opposed to "T. bataar". American scientist Kenneth Carpenter reevaluated the material in 1992. He presumed that it had a place with the sort "Tyrannosaurus", as initially distributed by Maleev, and lumped every one of the examples into the species "Tyrannosaurus bataar" aside from the remaining parts that Maleev had named "Gorgosaurus novojilovi". Woodworker thought this example spoke to a different, littler class of tyrannosaurid, which he called "Maleevosaurus novojilovi". George Olshevsky made the new nonexclusive name "Jenghizkhan" (after Genghis Khan) for "Tyrannosaurus bataar" in 1995, while likewise perceiving "Tarbosaurus efremovi" and "Maleevosaurus novojilovi", for a sum of three particular, contemporaneous genera from the Nemegt Formation. A recent report accordingly renamed "Maleevosaurus" as an adolescent "Tarbosaurus". All examination distributed since 1999 perceives just a solitary animal groups, which is either called "Tarbosaurus bataar" or "Tyrannosaurus bataar".
