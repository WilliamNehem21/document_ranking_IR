Coming back to Australia, Wilton ended up General Staff Officer GradeÃÂ 1 in Major General Stanley Savige's 3rdÃÂ Division in August 1942. Savige later reviewed that "I never had a progressively equipped staff, nor such a co-usable group, than that staff after Wilton went along." The 3rdÃÂ Division was a piece of Lieutenant General Edmund Herring's IIÃÂ Corps. In October, Herring succeeded Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell as officer of New Guinea Force, and Savige ended up acting corps administrator. With his consideration concentrated on the corps, Savige depended on Wilton to administer the preparation of the 3rdÃÂ Division. Wilton ventured out to New Guinea in February 1943 to observe the landscape and start plans for the division's inevitable crusade in Salamaua. He was connected to Kanga Force in Wau amid March 1943, preceding its retention by 3rdÃÂ Division the next month. Herring had requested that the 3rdÃÂ Division "undermine" Salamaua, and in spite of Wilton's endeavors to elucidate decisively what this implied, the request stayed dubious. Savige and Wilton translated it as implying that the 3rdÃÂ Division was to catch Salamaua, when in certainty its fundamental reason in the battle was to redirect Japanese powers from Lae. In any occasion, 3rdÃÂ Division advanced relentlessly and by August it must be requested to back off so that Lae could be assaulted before Salamaua. Wilton got a significant part of the credit for 3rdÃÂ Division's execution. He was granted the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his "expertise and capacity in New Guinea" between July 1942 and April 1943, the reference being proclaimed on 27ÃÂ April 1944.
