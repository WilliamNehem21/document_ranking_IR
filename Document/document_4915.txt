A unit of two Chinooks worked in Afghanistan amid 2006 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013. The separation was assigned the Aviation Support Element amid 2006 and 2007, and renamed the Rotary Wing Group in 2008. The underlying separation touched base at Kandahar International Airport in March 2006, and was entrusted with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the nation. The updates the helicopters had gotten demonstrated effective, and enabled them to work in battle close by other Coalition CH-47s. After the Special Forces Task Group was pulled back in September 2006 the helicopters stayed in the nation and were utilized to help Coalition powers, with a specific accentuation on the Australian units situated in Urozgan Province. The separation was pulled back to Australia in February 2007, and did not convey again until February 2008. Amid this period each of the six helicopters got further updates, which included new motors and blue power tracker hardware. Amid consequent years the separation was pulled back to Australia over the Afghan winters, and redeployed every northern spring. As the Chinooks' entrusting was constrained by the International Security Assistance Force, the ADF sanctioned a Russian Mil Mi-26 somewhere in the range of 2010 and 2013 to furnish the Australian powers in Afghanistan with a committed heavylift helicopter. Before the finish of the last revolution on 14 September 2013, the helicopters had flown over 6,000 hours in battle and transported very nearly 40,000 work force. Planning for and continuing the Rotary Wing Group revolutions assimilated the majority of C Squadron's assets all through this period, and Chinooks were infrequently accessible for other Army preparing or operational errands.
