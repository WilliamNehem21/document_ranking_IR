The Guatemalan specialists were uninformed of progressing contacts between the frontier experts in YucatÃÂ¡n and the Itza. In the second 50% of 1695 President Barrios started arranging another undertaking against the Itza from Verapaz, following brutal analysis of Juan DÃÂ­az de Velasco's retreat from close Lake PetÃÂ©n ItzÃÂ¡ in April of that year. Barrios kicked the bucket in November, and "oidor" JosÃÂ© de Escals wound up acting leader of the Guatemalan pilgrim organization. He designated "oidor" BartolomÃÂ© de AmÃÂ©squeta to lead the following undertaking against the Itza. AmÃÂ©squeta walked his men through heavy downpour from CahabÃÂ³n to MopÃÂ¡n, touching base on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were as yet unconscious of the conflicts between GarcÃÂ­a's powers and the Itza. AmÃÂ©squeta's campaign was experiencing deficiencies of local work and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were wiped out, and his development slowed down as the power rested up at MopÃÂ¡n. Skipper DÃÂ­az de Velasco volunteered to lead a gathering of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was joined by Dominican monks CristÃÂ³bal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was likewise joined by AjKÃÂ¼ixaw, the Itza aristocrat who had been taken prisoner on DÃÂ­az's past campaign, who filled in as a confided in guide, scout and interpreter. They set out from MopÃÂ¡n on 7 March and left some wiped out fighters with certain provisions following five days, they at that point made up for lost time with a development gathering of roadbuilders and their military escort at RÃÂ­o Chakal. The two powers consolidated, giving DÃÂ­az a power of 49 warriors and 34 watchmen and bowmen from Verapaz. When they touched base at IxBÃÂ¼ol, close to the shore of Lake PetÃÂ©n ItzÃÂ¡, AjKÃÂ¼ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to NojpetÃÂ©n.
