On 17 November 1917, "Kaiserin" and "Kaiser" were appointed to give spread to the II Scouting Group while it directed a minesweeping task in the North Sea. Huge British powers, including five battlecruisers and a few light cruisers, assaulted the II Scouting Group; the two ships promptly steamed to their help. In the resulting Second Battle of Heligoland Bight, "Kaiserin" scored a hit on the light cruiser . The battlecruiser quickly connected with the German gunboats, however the two powers pulled back. After the activity, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter condemned "Kaiserin"s administrator, "KzS" Kurt GraÃÂhoff, for falling too a long ways behind the minesweepers to give sufficient security. He was consequently soothed of direction of the ship. "Kaiserin" went into drydock for support on 22 December, and work endured until 5 February 1918. The ship took part in the unproductive development to Norway on 23Ã¢ÂÂ 25 April 1918, which had been expected to block an intensely protected guard among Britain and Norway; broken German insight kept the Germans from getting the escort. In the wake of coming back to port, she continued gatekeeper obligations in the German Bight. The IV Squadron embraced another preparation practice in the Baltic from 18 June to 13 August. A last round of drills occurred on 22Ã¢ÂÂ 28 October.
