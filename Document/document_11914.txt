The plot was condemned as "exhausting", and undermined by the enhancements. The "Los Angeles Times"s Linda Gross said that "The Thing" was "deprived, miserable, and agnostic", and ailing in inclination, which means the characters' demises did not make a difference. Spencer said it highlighted messy coherence, needed pacing, and was without warmth or humankind. David Ansen of "Newsweek" felt the film confounded the utilization of impacts with making tension, and that it needed show by "yielding everything at the special stepped area of blood". The "Chicago Reader"s Dave Kehr believed the exchange to be commonplace and tradable, influencing the characters to appear and sound alike. "The Washington Post"s Gary Arnold said it was a clever touch to open with the Thing having as of now conquered the Norwegian base, vanquishing the sort of devices found in the 1951 rendition, while "New York"s David Denby mourned that the Thing's danger is just appeared, without concentrating on what it resembles for somebody who supposes they have been dominated. Roger Ebert believed the film to be unnerving, yet offering nothing unique past the embellishments, while "The New York Times"s Vincent Canby said it was engaging just if the watcher expected to see creepy crawly legged heads and puppy post-mortems.
