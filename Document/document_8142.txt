In spite of its subordinate nature, Longacre's falcon has been broadly appreciated. As per craftsmanship student of history Cornelius Vermeule in his book on U.S. coins, the flying hawk theme, when utilized during the 1830s, was "the first numismatic flying creature that could be said to get from nature as opposed to from provincial cutting or heraldry". Vermeule portrayed the Flying Eagle penny's substitution, the Indian Head penny, as "far less alluring to the eye than the Peale-Gobrecht flying hawk and its variations". Stone carver Augustus Saint-Gaudens, when charged in 1905 to give new plans to American coinage, tried to restore a flying falcon structure to the penny, keeping in touch with President Theodore Roosevelt, "I am utilizing a flying bird, a change of the gadget which was utilized on the penny of 1857. I had not seen that coin for a long time, and was so inspired by it that I thought whether did with certain changes, nothing better should be possible. It is by all chances the best plan on any American coin." Saint-Gaudens returned the flying hawk to American coinage, however his structure was utilized for the turn around of the twofold falcon instead of the penny.
