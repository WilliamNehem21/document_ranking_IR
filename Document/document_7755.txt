Before long, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, yet Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff succumbed to 43, flinging Toshack to Hassett on the leg side, having put on 93 with Compton. The ball circled open to question and ventured out most of the way to the square leg limit, yet Hassett figured out how to monitor its direction through the mist. Barnett came in and together with Compton included 21 keeps running in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who finished a troublesome catch in slips. Yardley turned out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, inciting the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton snared it away for two and Miller's next conveyance slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some sneering in the group. Such a ball is known as a beamer and is illicit due to the physical risk it postures to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run association in 66 minutes before Johnston held an arrival catch to expel Yardley for 22. Britain achieved stumps at 345/6, only one keep running in front of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10. Amid the day, Johnston bowled the most overs, 30.
