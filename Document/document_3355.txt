In 2000, Dunst featured in the satire "Expedite It" as Torrance Shipman, the skipper of a cheerleading squad. The film created for the most part positive surveys, with numerous pundits saving recognition for her execution. In his survey, A. O. Scott called her "a staggering comic on-screen character, to a great extent on account of her incredible expressive range, and the agility with which she can move from tension to hostility to certified hurt." Charles Taylor of "Salon" noticed that "among contemporary high school on-screen characters, Dunst has turned into the sunniest conceivable parodist", despite the fact that he thought the film had neglected to give her as great a job as she had either in "Dick" or in "The Virgin Suicides." Jessica Winter from "The Village Voice" complimented Dunst, expressing that her execution was "as carefree and intentionally foolish as her turn in "Dick"" and remarking that "[Dunst] gives the main significant component of "Expedite It" that plays as tweaking spoof as opposed to smooth, strident, body-pummel boorishness." Peter Stack of the "San Francisco Chronicle", regardless of giving the film an ominous survey, lauded Dunst for her readiness "to be as senseless and cloyingly pleasing as it takes to get past a slapdash film."
