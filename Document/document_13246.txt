As the 1975Ã¢ÂÂ 76 class heroes, the club entered the 1976Ã¢ÂÂ 77 European Cup. They crushed Crusaders of Northern Ireland and Trabzonspor of Turkey to achieve the quarter-finals, where they confronted the sprinters up from the past season, Saint-ÃÂtienne. The French group won the principal leg 1Ã¢ÂÂ 0. The second leg at Anfield started well for Liverpool when Keegan scored in the initial two minutes. Holy person ÃÂtienne evened out to make the score 2Ã¢ÂÂ 1 on total to support them. Kennedy scored for Liverpool, yet the away objectives rule implied despite everything they required another objective to win the tie. With six minutes remaining, David Fairclough was expedited to supplant John Toshack; he quickly scored before the Kop, guaranteeing a 3Ã¢ÂÂ 2 total triumph for Liverpool. In the semi-finals, they crushed FC ZÃÂ¼rich of Switzerland 6Ã¢ÂÂ 1 on total to achieve the last, where they met their rivals from the 1973 UEFA Cup Final, Borussia MÃÂ¶nchengladbach. The last was held in Rome, four days after the club had lost the 1977 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Prior to the match, Paisley reported that striker Toshack would be fit to begin. Be that as it may, he was not named in the matchday squad. This change upset the Germans' strategy and permitted Keegan to torment his marker, Berti Vogts. Liverpool won 3Ã¢ÂÂ 1 to wind up European victors out of the blue.
