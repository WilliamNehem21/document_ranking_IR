Waters' verses to "The Dark Side of the Moon" managed the weights of present day life and how those weights can in some cases cause madness. He saw the collection's explanation of dysfunctional behavior as enlightening a general condition. Be that as it may, Waters likewise needed the collection to impart inspiration, calling it "an exhortationÃÂ ... to grasp the positive and reject the negative." Reisch depicted "The Wall" as "less about the experience of frenzy than the propensities, establishments, and social structures that "make" or "cause" franticness." "The Wall" hero, Pink, is unfit to manage an incredible conditions, and overwhelmed by sentiments of blame, gradually deters himself from the outside world inside his very own hindrance making. After he finishes his antagonism from the world, Pink understands that he is "insane, over the rainbow". He at that point thinks about how conceivable it is that his condition might be his very own blame: "have I been blameworthy this time?" Realizing his biggest dread, Pink trusts that he has disappointed everybody, his domineering mother carefully covering him, the educators properly reprimanding his idyllic yearnings, and his significant other advocated in abandoning him. He at that point stands preliminary for "appearing of a practically human instinct", further worsening his distance of species being. Similarly as with the works of logician Michel Foucault, Waters' verses recommend Pink's madness is a result of current life, the components of which, "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", add to his apprehension, as per Reisch.
