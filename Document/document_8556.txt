As a batsman, Leyland for the most part batted in the center request or sporadically opened the batting. Right off the bat in his vocation, observers proposed that his batting method was defective, notwithstanding when he was measurably fruitful. His utilization of the cut shot was doubted by some Yorkshire pundits, and they presumed that his inclination for assaulting play would be ineffective; he was a quicker scorer and more forceful batsman than a large portion of his Yorkshire counterparts. Cardus proposed that, rather, he was in the line of "clever Yorkshiremen which the expansive idea of his region delivers occasionally as a difference to and raising of the for the most part dreary irregularity. There was a twinkle in his eye and there was a twinkle in his bat, regardless of how inauspiciously and straight it might infrequently be obliged to shield a troublesome circumstance in Yorkshire." The cricket author E. W. Swanton saw that Leyland's bat was frequently not straight when he played his shotsÃ¢ÂÂin opposition to universal strategyÃ¢ÂÂyet the speed of his footwork and his capacity to watch the ball firmly compensated for any slips. Restricting bowlers proposed that the impression was a figment and that his bat was straight when he hit the ball.
