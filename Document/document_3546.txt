From 1852 until 1997, the Illinois Central Railroad possessed an option to proceed between downtown Chicago and Lake Michigan, in the zone that progressed toward becoming Grant Park and utilized it for railroad tracks. In 1871, Union Base-Ball Grounds was based on part of the site that moved toward becoming Millennium Park; the Chicago White Stockings played home recreations there until the grounds were wrecked in the Great Chicago Fire. Lake Front Park, the White Stockings' new ball grounds, was worked in 1878 with a short right field because of the railroad tracks. The grounds were improved and the seating limit was multiplied in 1883, yet the group needed to move after the season finished the following year, as the central government had given the city the land "with the stipulation that no business adventure could utilize it". Daniel Burnham arranged Grant Park around the Illinois Central Railroad property in his 1909 Plan of Chicago. In 1997, when the city picked up airspace rights over the tracks, it chose to fabricate a stopping office over them in the northwestern corner of Grant Park. In the end, the city understood that an amazing urban courtesy may bait private dollars such that a city improvement would not, and hence started the push to make Millennium Park. The recreation center was initially arranged under the name Lakefront Millennium Park.
