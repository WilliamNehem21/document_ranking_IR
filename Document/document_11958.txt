"Androcles and the Lion" (1912), a less shocking investigation of genuine and false religious frames of mind than "Blanco Posnet", kept running for about two months in September and October 1913. It was trailed by a standout amongst Shaw's best plays, "Pygmalion", written in 1912 and organized in Vienna the next year, and in Berlin without further ado a while later. Shaw remarked, "It is the custom of the English press when a play of mine is delivered, to educate the world that it's anything but a playÃ¢ÂÂthat it is dull, impious, disagreeable, and monetarily unsuccessful.ÃÂ ... Henceforth emerged an earnest interest with respect to the administrators of Vienna and Berlin that I ought to have my plays performed by them first." The British creation opened in April 1914, featuring Sir Herbert Tree and Mrs Patrick Campbell as, individually, an educator of phonetics and a cockney bloom young lady. There had before been a sentimental contact among Shaw and Campbell that caused Charlotte Shaw impressive concern, however when of the London debut it had finished. The play pulled in limit groups of onlookers until July, when Tree demanded going on vacation, and the creation shut. His co-star at that point visited with the piece in the US.
