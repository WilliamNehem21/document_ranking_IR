While Leigh made "Streetcar" in 1951, Olivier joined her in Hollywood to film "Carrie", in light of the dubious novel "Sister Carrie"; despite the fact that the film was tormented by inconveniences, Olivier got warm audits and a BAFTA designation. Olivier started to see an adjustment in Leigh's conduct, and he later described that "I would discover Vivien sitting on the side of the bed, wringing her hands and crying, in a condition of grave pain; I would normally attempt frantically to give her some solace, however for quite a while she would be hopeless." After a vacation with Coward in Jamaica, she appeared to have recuperated, yet Olivier later recorded, "I am certain thatÃÂ ... [the doctors] more likely than not made careful arrangements to reveal to me what wasn't right with my significant other; that her infection was considered hyper dejection and what that impliedÃ¢ÂÂa potentially perpetual repeating forward and backward between the profundities of sadness and wild, wild craziness. He additionally related the long periods of issues he had encountered on account of Leigh's sickness, expressing, "all through her ownership by that uncannily detestable beast, hyper despondency, with its dangerous regularly fixing spirals, she held her very own individual shrewdnessÃ¢ÂÂa capacity to camouflage her actual mental condition from practically all aside from me, for whom she could scarcely be relied upon to take the inconvenience."
