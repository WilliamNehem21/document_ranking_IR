Giovanni Villani was naturally introduced to the Florentine vendor white collar class. He was the child of Villano di Stoldi di Bellincione, who originated from an old and all around regarded "arti maggiori" group of vendors. Villani was an individual from the "Arte di Calimala" (fleece finishers) society in Florence since 1300, serving on the "mercanzia" committee of eight. Amid that year he visited Rome amid the celebration festivity. In the wake of watching the notable old landmarks of Rome and recognizing its prestigious authentic personages, he was motivated to compose the "Cronica", an all inclusive history of Florence in a carefully direct, year-by-year group. Amid the early long periods of the fourteenth century, he increased political point of view by going all through Italy, Switzerland, France and Flanders for the Peruzzi bank, of which he was an investor from 1300 to 1308. Voyaging abroad as a factor for the organization, Villani was paid a standard compensation notwithstanding his shareholding benefits. On May 15, 1306, one of the primary trade contracts ("cambium") to make reference to the city of Bruges included two gatherings: Giovanni Villani, speaking to the Peruzzi Company, conceding a credit to Tommaso Fini, speaking to the Gallerani Company of Siena. Villani and his sibling Matteo exchanged the vast majority of their financial exercises to the Buonaccorsi firm by 1322. Giovanni Villani was a co-chief of Buonaccorsi in 1324. The Buonaccorsi dealt with banking and product exchange exercises, spreading their impact all through Italy, France, Flanders, England and a few places in the Mediterranean.
