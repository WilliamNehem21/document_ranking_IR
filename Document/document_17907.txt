Over the winter of 1906â07, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" underwent a major overhaul in Kiel, which was completed by the end of April. By this time, the newest s were coming into service; along with the s, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. As a result, the "Heimatflotte" was renamed the "Hochseeflotte" (High Seas Fleet). Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22â24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in EckernfÃ¶rde Bay outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days.
