The sentiment of earnestness spread all through Greenwich Village, even to individuals who had not seen the uproars. Numerous who were moved by the insubordination went to authoritative gatherings, detecting a chance to make a move. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society played out its yearly picketing before Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Coordinators Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all taken an interest for quite a long while, took a transport alongside different picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been extremely controlled: ladies wore skirts and men wore formal outfits, and all walked unobtrusively in sorted out lines. This year Rodwell felt confined by the guidelines Kameny had set. At the point when two ladies suddenly clasped hands, Kameny broke them separated, saying, "None of that! None of that!" Rodwell, be that as it may, persuaded around ten couples to clasp hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny enraged, however they earned more press consideration than the majority of the past walks. Member Lilli Vincenz recollected that, "Plainly things were evolving. Individuals who had felt mistreated presently felt enabled." Rodwell came back to New York City resolved to change the built up calm, mild methods for endeavoring to get consideration. One of his first needs was arranging Christopher Street Liberation Day.
