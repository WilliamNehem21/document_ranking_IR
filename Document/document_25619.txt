Olivia died of complications brought on by gall bladder disease on 3Â OctoberÂ 1938. The day before her death she wrote in a letter to Dorothy: "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder troubleâawful painâsent for Doctor Barnesâhe gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually wentÂ ... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old womanÂ ... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguishedâno matter what happened she never lost her solitudeÂ ... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.
