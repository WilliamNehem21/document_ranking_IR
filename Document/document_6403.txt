By 1965, the six traveler vehicles of the DRR's "Retlaw 1" train, because of their moderate traveler stacking and emptying times, started to be eliminated of administration. In July 1974, the "Retlaw 1" traveler vehicles were resigned and put away in the DRR's roundhouse, aside from the "Great Canyon" perception mentor, which was changed over into a parlor vehicle and renamed "Lilly Belle" after Walt Disney's significant other Lillian. The "Lilly Belle" was given another outside paint plot and another inside, which included varnished mahogany framing, velour blinds and seats, a botanical designed fleece mat, and Disney family pictures confined and held tight the dividers. The principal official traveler to get on the "Lilly Belle" after its change into a parlor vehicle in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and from that point forward it very well may be routinely observed coupled on the closures of the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail authority Bill Norred procured the five other "Retlaw 1" traveler autos. Norred kicked the bucket two years after the fact, and in 1999 his family sold the four mentors of the previous "Retlaw 1" traveler train to Rob Rossi, proprietor of the Pacific Coast Railroad situated inside Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving just the "Retlaw 1" consolidate vehicle in the Norred family's ownership. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the "Retlaw 1" join vehicle to the Carolwood Foundation, which reestablished it and put it in plain view alongside Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn inside the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.
