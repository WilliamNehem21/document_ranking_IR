Notwithstanding when Henry II's malcontented sibling, Bruno, looked for asylum in Hungary in 1004, Stephen protected the harmony with Germany and arranged a settlement between his two brothers by marriage. Around 1009, he gave his more youthful sister in marriage to Otto Orseolo, Doge of Venice (r. 1008Ã¢ÂÂ 1026), a nearby partner of the Byzantine Emperor, Basil II (r. 976Ã¢ÂÂ 1025), which proposes that Hungary's association with the Byzantine Empire was likewise tranquil.

The Poles involved the Hungarian posts along the stream Morava.
