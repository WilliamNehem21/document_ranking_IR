At night, Turner called a gathering on his order transport off Guadalcanal with Crutchley and Marine leader Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift to examine the takeoff of Fletcher's bearers and the subsequent withdrawal plan for the vehicle ships. At 20:55, Crutchley left the southern gathering in "Australia" to go to the meeting, leaving Captain Howard D. Bode of "Chicago" responsible for the southern gathering. Crutchley did not illuminate the officers of the other cruiser gatherings of his nonattendance, contributing further to the disintegration of direction game plans. Bode, stirred from rest in his lodge, chose not to put his ship in the number one spot of the southern gathering of boats, the standard spot for the senior ship, and returned to rest. At the meeting, Turner, Crutchley, and Vandegrift examined the reports of the "seaplane delicate" constrain announced by the Australian Hudson team prior that day. They chose it would not be a risk that night, since seaplane tenders did not regularly take part in a surface activity. Vandegrift said that he would need to investigate the vehicle emptying circumstance at Tulagi before prescribing a withdrawal time for the vehicle boats, and he withdrew at midnight to lead the examination. Crutchley chose not to come back with "Australia" toward the southern power however rather positioned his ship simply outside the Guadalcanal transport jetty, without educating the other Allied ship administrators of his expectations or area.
