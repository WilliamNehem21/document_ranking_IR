The banner of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was embraced by pronouncement on December 25, 1951. The banner was somewhat altered in 1956 when development subtleties were included for the red star, and brilliant mallet and sickle. The last details of the banner was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and are fundamentally the same as the present Belarusian banner. The banner had a length-to-width proportion of one to two (1:2), simply like the banner of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen association republics). The principle segment of the banner was red (speaking to the Revolution), with the rest being green (speaking to the Belarusian timberlands). An example of white drawn on red enlivened the derrick part of the banner; this structure is regularly utilized on Belarusian conventional ensembles. In the upper corner of the banner, in the red bit, a gold sledge and sickle was included, with a red star sketched out in gold above it. The mallet spoke to the specialist, and the sickle the worker; as per Soviet belief system, these two images crossed together symbolized co-task between the two classes. The red star, an image normally utilized by Communist gatherings, was said to stand either for the five social gatherings (specialists, youth, laborers, military, and scholastics), the five known mainlands, or the five fingers of the laborer's hand. The sledge, sickle and star were at times not shown on the turn around of the banner. The reason for this plan was that the Byelorussian SSR, alongside the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as establishing individuals and required unmistakable banners for one another. The creator of the banner was Milkahil Gusyev.
