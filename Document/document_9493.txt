Cricket has a solid following in Northern England, and three regions are spoken to by top of the line district cricket groups: Durham, Lancashire and Yorkshire. The Roses Match (named for the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York) among Lancashire and Yorkshire is one of the hardest battled contentions in the game Ã¢ÂÂ the pride of the two sides, and their assurance not to lose, brought about the groups building up a moderate, obstinate and guarded style that demonstrated disliked somewhere else in the nation. The London-based Marylebone Cricket Club, which controlled the diversion at the time, chose couple of Northern players for Test matches, and this was seen as a reprimand to their playing style Ã¢ÂÂ the annoyance joined Lancashire and Yorkshire against the South and helped cast a mutual Northern personality that rose above the Roses contention. This separation was represented in the 1924 County Championship, when Yorkshire beat London-based Middlesex to guarantee the title. Surrey blamed Yorkshire for scraping the pitch and scaring the bowlers, while the match with Middlesex was vicious to the point that the group took steps to never play in Yorkshire again. The Lancashire skipper Jack Sharp then again was cited as saying "I'm genuine happy a rose won it. Red or white, it doesn't make a difference." Durham are an ongoing expansion to top-flight cricket, having just accomplished five star status in 1992, yet have won the County Championship multiple times.
