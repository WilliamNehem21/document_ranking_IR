Different speculations have been proposed with respect to the lineage of the originators of the Western Ganga tradition (before the fourth century). Some legendary records point to a northern cause, while hypotheses dependent on epigraphy recommend a southern starting point. As indicated by certain records, the Western Gangas were of the Kanvayana gotra and followed their heredity to the Ikshvakus and the sunlight based tradition. Students of history who propose the southern cause have additionally discussed whether the early frivolous chieftains of the family (before their ascent to control) were locals of the southern regions of present day Karnataka, the Kongu area in current Tamil Nadu or of the southern regions of present day Andhra Pradesh. These districts include a zone of the southern Deccan where the three present day states combine geologically. It is guessed that the Gangas may have exploited the disarray brought about by the attack of southern India by the northern ruler Samudra Gupta preceding 350, and cut out a kingdom for themselves. The territory they controlled was called Gangavadi and included areas of the cutting edge regions of Mysore, Hassan Chamarajanagar, Tumkur, Kolar, Mandya and Bangalore in Karnataka state. Now and again, they likewise controlled a few zones in current Tamil Nadu (Kongu district beginning from the sixth century principle of King Avinita) and Andhra Pradesh (Ananthpur locale beginning from the center of the fifth century). The establishing lord of the line was Konganivarma Madhava who made Kolar his capital around 350 and ruled for around twenty years.
