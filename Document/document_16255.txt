Although filmed to create the illusion that events occurred in real time, the episode employed several camera tricks and effects. For the opening shot, a "surreptitious cut" helped to replace actor Judson Mills with a stunt person when the cop car is overturned by the monster. Usually, an episode of "The X-Files" required editors to make between 8001200 film cuts, but "X-Cops" only required 45. During post-production, a minor argument broke out between Vince Gilligan and the network. Originally, Gilligan did not want the "X-Files" logo to appear at any time during the episode. He stressed that he wanted "X-Cops" to feel like an "episode of "Cops" that happened to involve Mulder and Scully." The network, fearing that people would not understand that "X-Cops" was actually an episode of "The X-Files", vetoed this idea. A compromise was eventually reached: the episode would open with the "Cops" theme song, but "The X-Files" credits would also appear after the opening scene. In addition, the commercial bumpers would feature red and blue lights flashing across "The X-Files" logo while dialogue is heard in the background, in a similar fashion to the "Cops" logo. The episode also features a disclaimer at the beginning informing viewers that the episode is a special installment of "The X-Files" to prevent watchers from thinking that the show "has been preempted this week by "Cops"".
