On coming back to Paramount, the craftsmanship division needed to reproduce portions of Yellowstone in a substantial "B tank", long. The tank was intended to be overwhelmed with a huge number of gallons of water to speak to vast waterways. Minor set up miniatures on the tank's floor before development and ensured that the shadows that fell on Spock at Yellowstone could be appropriately reproduced. A compressed wood base was based on metal stages to make stone outlines, fortified with chicken wire. Polyurethane froth was splashed over the structure under the supervision of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The base piece of the statue smaller than usual was spoken to by a high fiberglass foot. Weldon coordinated the impacts shot at Yellowstone utilizing dry ice and steam machines. To reproduce the presence of the whirling whirlpools of water in the genuine Yellowstone, a mix of dissipated milk, white blurb paint, and water was filled the set's pools. The weight of the steam directed into the pools through concealed tubing makes enough development in the whirlpools copy the area film. Because of the prerequisite that the sun be in a particular area for taping and that the earth be sufficiently brilliant, generation fell behind calendar when it was unseasonably shady for three days in a row. Any further scenes to reproduce Vulcan would be inconceivable, as the set was quickly torn down to fill in as a parking garage for the rest of the mid year.
