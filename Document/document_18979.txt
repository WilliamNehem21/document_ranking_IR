With the BÃ¬nh XuyÃªn vanquished, Diá»m turned his attention to conquering the HÃ²a Háº£o. As a result, a battle between government troops led by General DÆ°Æ¡ng VÄn Minh and Ba Cá»¥t's men commenced in Cáº§n ThÆ¡ on 5 June. Five HÃ²a Háº£o battalions surrendered immediately; Ba Cá»¥t and three remaining leaders had fled to the Cambodian border by the end of the month. Having surrendered his forces, Ngo excoriated Soai and Ba Cá»¥t, claiming that their activities were not consistent with HÃ²a Háº£o religious practices and accused them of fighting with communists. The soldiers of the three other leaders eventually surrendered, but Ba Cá»¥t's men continued to the end, claiming loyalty to the Emperor Báº£o Äáº¡i. Diá»m responded by replacing the officers of Báº£o Äáº¡i's personal regiments with his own men and used the royal units to attack Ba Cá»¥t's rebels near HÃ  TiÃªn and Ráº¡ch GiÃ¡, outnumbering the HÃ²a Háº£o by at least a factor of five. Knowing that they could not defeat the government in open conventional warfare, Ba Cá»¥t's forces destroyed their own bases so that the VNA could not use their abandoned resources, and retreated into the jungle. Ba Cá»¥t's 3,000 men spent the rest of 1955 evading 20,000 VNA troops who had been deployed to quell them, notwithstanding a A bounty of one million piasters was put on the head of Ba Cá»¥t, who scattered trails of money in the jungle, hoping to distract his pursuers, but to no avail. The communists claimed in a history written decades later that Ba Cá»¥t had tried to forge an alliance with them, but that talks broke down a few months later.
