Irving Blum was the first dealer to show Warhol's soup can paintings. Blum happened to be visiting Warhol in December 1961 and then May 1962, at a time when Warhol was being featured in a May 11, 1962 "Time" magazine article "The Slice-of-Cake School" (that included a portion of Warhol's silkscreened "200 One Dollar Bills"), along with Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, and Wayne Thiebaud. Warhol was the only artist whose photograph actually appeared in the article, which is indicative of his knack for manipulating the mass media. Blum saw dozens of Campbell's Soup can variations, including a grid of "One-Hundred Soup Cans" that day. Blum was shocked that Warhol had no gallery arrangement and offered him a July show at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. This would be Warhol's first one-man show of his pop art. Warhol was assured by Blum that the newly founded "Artforum magazine", which had an office above the gallery, would cover the show. Not only was the show Warhol's first solo gallery exhibit, but it was considered to be the West Coast premiere of pop art. A letter from Blum to Warhol dated June 9, 1962 set the exhibition opening for July 9th. Andy Warhol's first New York solo Pop exhibit was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6â24, 1962. The exhibit included the works "Marilyn Diptych", "Green Coca-Cola Bottles", and "Campbell's Soup Cans".
