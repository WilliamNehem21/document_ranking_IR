Walter was presumed for his valiance, verging on neglectfulness, and was certain of accomplishment, as prove by his haughty answer to the 500 hired fighters. Walter's pride and haughtiness, joined with his numerical leeway and his intrinsic faith in the prevalence of substantial respectable rangers over infantry, drove him to lethally think little of the Catalans and request a charge, despite the fact that the landscape was unfavorable to mounted force. Anxious for activity, as indicated by Muntaner, Walter shaped a mounted force line of 200 Frankish knights "with brilliant goads", trailed by the infantry, and set himself with his flag in the vanguard. The Frankish assault bombed yet the reason is misty; Muntaner's depiction is short and gives no subtleties, while in Gregoras, the overwhelming Frankish mounted force stalled out in the mud, with the Almogavars, daintily furnished with swords and darts, dispatching the knights burdened in their substantial protective layer. This is the normally acknowledged form among researchers also. The "Annal of the Morea" infers that the fight was hard-battledÃ¢ÂÂwhich, as military student of history Kelly DeVries notes, appears to repudiate GregorasÃ¢ÂÂand that the bog conceivably only diminished the effect of the charge, rather than stalling it completely. It is clear is that the Catalans vanquished the charge and that the Duke and the majority of his men fell. As the two lines conflicted, the Turkish assistants understood that there was no injustice and slid from their camp upon the Athenian armed force, freezing and steering its leftovers.
