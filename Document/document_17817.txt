For Rhodes, throffers can not merely be biconditional proposals. If "Q" proposes that "P" pay $10,000 so that "Q" withholds information that would lead to "P"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrest, then despite the fact that the proposal is biconditional (that is, "P" may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for "P" independent of "Q"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s proposal. "P"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s paying of "Q" does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain "neutral proposals", and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.
