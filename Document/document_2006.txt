Despite the fact that content with Parthia, Rome still meddled in its issues. The Roman ruler Tiberius (r.ÃÂ 14Ã¢ÂÂ 37ÃÂ AD) ended up associated with a plot by Pharasmanes I of Iberia to put his sibling Mithridates on the royal position of Armenia by killing the Parthian partner King Arsaces of Armenia. Artabanus III attempted and neglected to reestablish Parthian control of Armenia, provoking a blue-blooded revolt that constrained him to escape to Scythia. The Romans discharged a prisoner ruler, Tiridates III of Parthia, to run the area as a partner of Rome. Without further ado before his passing, Artabanus figured out how to constrain Tiridates from the position of authority utilizing troops from Hyrcania. After Artabanus' demise in 38ÃÂ AD, a long considerate war followed between the legitimate successor Vardanes I and his sibling Gotarzes II of Parthia. After Vardanes was killed amid a chasing campaign, the Parthian respectability engaged Roman head Claudius ("r". 41Ã¢ÂÂ 54ÃÂ AD) in 49ÃÂ AD to discharge the prisoner sovereign Meherdates to challenge Gotarzes. This reverse discharges when Meherdates was double-crossed by the legislative leader of Edessa and Izates bar Monobaz of Adiabene; he was caught and sent to Gotarzes, where he was permitted to live in the wake of having his ears mangled, a demonstration that excluded him from acquiring the position of royalty.
