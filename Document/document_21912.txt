Popular had added "Fantastic Novels" as a companion to "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" in 1948; the following year it launched "A. Merritt's Fantasy Magazine", in an attempt to cash in on Merritt's popularity, and "Captain Zero", a science-fictional hero pulp. Both were failures, lasting only five and three issues, respectively. Standard's "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder", both well-regarded by the end of the decade, were joined in 1950 by two reprint magazines. One was "Fantastic Story Quarterly", which was intended to carry reprints that were too long to run in "Startling"'s "Hall of Fame" department. This was initially a financial success, and Standard decided to add another title, "Wonder Story Annual". Both titles survived into the mid-1950s. Two exceptions to the reprint rule were "Future Science Fiction", which Silberkleit brought back as a bimonthly pulp in May 1950, still edited by Lowndes, and "Out of This World Adventures", also in pulp format, which combined science fiction material with a few pages of comics. The publisher, Avon, also launched a romance magazine and a western magazine with the same format, but the experiment was a failure and "Out of This World Adventures" only lasted for two issues, dated July and December 1950. At the end of 1950 "Marvel Science Stories" reappeared as the Goodman brothers saw a new boom in sf magazines getting under way; it began as a pulp, but changed to a digest the following year. The fiction was of higher quality than in the first incarnation of the magazine, but it lasted less than two years.
