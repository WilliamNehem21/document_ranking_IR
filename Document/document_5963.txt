Rehearsing all through 1899 and 1900, Bosanquet started to utilize the googly in minor matches before utilizing it in imperative cricket. His first utilization of the new conveyance in top of the line cricket came in the match against Leicestershire in 1900 in which he scored two centuries. In the second innings, Samuel Coe had scored 98 when Bosanquet, still known as a quick bowler, bowled his off break; the ball skiped multiple times and the batsman was befuddled (in spite of the fact that, writing in 1925, Bosanquet reviewed Coe had been bowled). Bosanquet later composed that the wicket "was appropriately treated as a joke, and was the subject of obscene remark". Middlesex skippers allowed him to attempt googlies if there was little weight on, however he later expressed: "However I could guarantee somewhere in the range of five or six wickets before the end of the period, my endeavors created undeniably more chuckling than frighten in the hearts of contradicting batsmen". However, Bosanquet endured with the conveyance and before long started to be seen by compelling cricketers who perceived the capability of the googly. Already, a few bowlers infrequently bowled unintended googlies, however were unfit to control them. Despite the fact that batsmen were familiar with off break or leg break bowlers, it was an extraordinary issue to confront a bowler who could bowl the two sorts of conveyance voluntarily, masking which one he bowled. Bosanquet influenced colleagues to stay quiet as he wished to keep up the feeling that his off break was a mishap so that batsmen were not anticipating it. He further attempted to play down his victories: he pretended astonishment, going about as though they were comparatively inadvertent.
