In January 1983 the British handyman and beginner fossil authority William J. Walker investigated the Smokejacks Pit, a dirt pit in the Weald Clay Formation close Ockley in Surrey, England. He found a stone wherein he found a vast paw, yet in the wake of sorting it out at home, he understood the tip of the paw was absent. Walker came back to a similar spot in the pit a little while later, and found the missing part in the wake of scanning for 60 minutes. He likewise found a phalanx bone and part of a rib. Walker's child in-law later conveyed the paw to the Natural History Museum of London, where it was inspected by the British scientistss Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner, who recognized it as having a place with a theropod dinosaur. The scientistss discovered progressively bone sections at the site in February, yet the whole skeleton couldn't be gathered until May and June because of climate conditions at the pit. A group of eight exhibition hall staff individuals and a few volunteers uncovered of grid in 54 hinders over a three-week time span. Walker gave the paw to the historical center, and the Ockley Brick Company (proprietors of the pit) gave the remainder of the skeleton and gave gear. The region had been investigated for a long time, yet no comparable remains had been found previously.
