Sackville-West made an exception to her dislike of naming plants in memory of people and purchased "Viola" 'Lady Sackville' late in her life, around 1960, planting it in the Delos. A few years after her death, a seedling appeared that seems to have been a spontaneous cross between 'Lady Sackville' and the variety 'Nellie Britton' that was growing alongside it. It had flowers of a rich pink that were larger than those of the parent varieties. The gardeners named it 'Vita'. Sackville-West had also grown a variety of rosemary ("Rosmarinus officinalis") that self-seeded in the Tower steps, and differed from the common variety in having upright rather than trailing stems, and flowers of a deeper shade of blue. It has come to be recognized as a distinct cultivar, and named 'Sissinghurst Blue'.
In 1969, a gardener in Kent bred a cultivar of dwarf bearded iris with reddish-purple flowers. He gave a specimen to Sissinghurst, where it was planted in the Purple Border, and named "Iris" 'Sissinghurst'. During the 1970s, a pink-flowered specimen of "Glandularia" ("Verbena") was given to the garden and named 'Sissinghurst'. In 1976, the garden was given a distinctive specimen of "Pulmonaria officinalis" that, unlike the species, has large white flowers (along with the white-spotted leaves of the species). It was planted in the White Garden and named 'Sissinghurst White'. Around 1977, the gardeners purchased a collection of seedlings of "Thalictrum aquilegiifolium". They selected the best plant, having larger flowers, and propagated it. This plant was added to the White Garden and named 'White Cloud'. From a planting of "Penstemon" 'Evelyn', which is a selection of "Penstemon barbatus", a specimen was named 'Sissinghurst Pink', although Lord does not consider it to be distinct from 'Evelyn'.
