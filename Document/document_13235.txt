In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General created a synopsis of the examination to date. A few challenges were nitty gritty, including the way that Parker precluded any learning from securing the wrongdoing, as did other people who were accepted to have heard the occurrence, talked about in Brown's essence. Dark colored's co-blamed, Eastwood, nom de plume "Yorkie", had fled when the examination started and had clearly left the settlement on board a whaling ship off Kangaroo Island. An essential observer named Joice had gone to the neighboring Port Phillip District of the settlement of New South Wales, and Leandermin himself, who it shows up was being kept at Guichen Bay, fled and had purportedly been "carried off". The rest of the observers were those that knew Brown, and clearly would not give proof against him. Regardless of the amazingly troublesome errand looked by the arraignment under these conditions, the Advocate General arranged that examinations proceed and issued warrants for the capture of those that had fled South Australia. Dark colored showed up at the Supreme Court once more on 10 and 28 September, however the judge again wouldn't hear the case moving forward without any more proof. By the November sittings of the court, Brown's case had been expelled from the postings, and this was the finish of the issue the extent that the formal examination was concerned. Adequately, pilgrim solidarity and the law of proof guaranteed that Brown was never striven for the homicides, in spite of the way that those associated with the examination had no uncertainty of his blame. Potentially in light of Brown's case, the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 was corrected in July 1849 to enable an individual to be sentenced on the sole declaration of an Aboriginal individual.
