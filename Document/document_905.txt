He featured as a medically introverted bookkeeper in the activity spine chiller "The Accountant" (2016), which was a sudden business achievement. Dwindle Debruge of "Assortment" felt Affleck's "kid nearby" demeanorÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "so typical and non-actorly that the vast majority of his exhibitions crave watching one of your amigos up on screen"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ was "a stupendous fit" for the job. Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" asked why Affleck, "looking fittingly dead-peered toward and hopeless," invested in the film.
