In 1997, Charig and Milner noted that two fragmentary spinosaurid snouts from the Elrhaz Formation of Niger (reported by the French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984) were similar enough to "Baryonyx" that they considered them to belong to an indeterminate species of the genus (despite their much younger Aptian geological age). In 1998, these fossils became the basis of the genus and species "Cristatusaurus lapparenti", named by Taquet and the American palaeontologist Dale Russell. The American palaeontologist Paul Sereno and colleagues named the new genus and species "Suchomimus tenerensis" later in 1998, based on more complete fossils from the Elrhaz Formation. In 2002, the German palaeontologist Hans-Dieter Sues and colleagues proposed that "Suchomimus tenerensis" was similar enough to "Baryonyx walkeri" to be considered a species within the same genus (as "B. tenerensis"), and that "Suchomimus" was identical to "Cristatusaurus". Milner concurred that the material from Niger was indistinguishable from "Baryonyx" in 2003. In a 2004 conference abstract, Hutt and Newberry supported the synonymy based on a large theropod vertebra from the Isle of Wight which they attributed to an animal closely related to "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus". Later studies have kept "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus" separate, whereas "Cristatusaurus" has been proposed to be either a "nomen dubium" or possibly distinct from both. A 2017 review paper by the Brazilian palaeontologist Carlos Roberto A. Candeiro and colleagues stated that this debate was more in the realm of semantics than science, as it is generally agreed that "B. walkeri" and "S. tenerensis" are distinct, related species.
