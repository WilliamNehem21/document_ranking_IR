Lawrence was fourteen and on a family get-away in New York City when she was spotted in the city by a headhunter who orchestrated her to try out for headhunters. Karen was not enthused about enabling her girl to seek after an acting vocation, yet she quickly moved her family to New York to let her read for jobs. After Lawrence's first virus perusing, the specialists said that hers was the best they had gotten notification from somebody that youthful; Lawrence's mom persuaded her that they were lying. Lawrence said her initial encounters were troublesome in light of the fact that she felt desolate and forlorn. She marked on with the CESD Talent Agency, who persuaded her folks to let her tryout for jobs in Los Angeles. While her mom urged her to go into demonstrating, Lawrence demanded seeking after acting. Around then, she thought acting to be a characteristic qualified for her capacities, and she turned down a few ideas for displaying assignments. Lawrence dropped out of school at age 14 without getting a GED or a certificate. She has said that she was "self-taught" and that her profession was her need. Between her acting employments in the city, she made normal visits to Louisville, where she filled in as an associate medical caretaker at her mom's camp.
