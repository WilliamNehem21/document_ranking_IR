The second period of "Murder" attracted a few correlations with "NYPD Blue", an ABC police dramatization arrangement that had appeared in September 1993. It got a lot of attention and preferred appraisals over "Murder", which a few commentators credited to the savagery and nakedness included in the show. Like "Manslaughter", "NYPD Blue" highlighted a gathering cast and interlaced subplots, and reporters recommended its prosperity may have urged NBC to help "Murder". Levinson said he was not stopped by correlations with "NYPD Blue" since "Manslaughter" appeared before that arrangement. In a news article, Fontana cited a companion who depicted "NYPD Blue" as "the TV rendition of "Crime"". Baldwin was considerably increasingly disparaging of the show, and said in a meeting: "a definitive compliment that can ever be paid [is] to be copied by another person. In this way, thank you, "NYPD Blue," since it's the knockoff of "Manslaughter."" "NYPD Blue" co-maker Steven Bochco protested that portrayal, saying he trusted his notoriety and involvement in TV demonstrated he was fit for imagining his own material. Bochco stated: I don't believe it's a knock-off. It was considered as its very own show. I wish "Crime" the best Ã¢ÂÂ and they ought to be so fortunate as to do just as we're doing well at this point."
