At the point when Weathers came back to his confidants, his uniform was canvassed in mud, he had blood running down his face, and he had five days' stubble on his jawline. He was likewise trimmed "like a Christmas tree" with souvenired German binoculars and guns. Brimming with anxious strain, he gabbed to his mates about how he had "put the breeze up" the Germans. Amid the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, the 43rd Battalion endured 67 losses. Throughout the following week, the eleventh Brigade was a piece of the quest for the Germans to the principle Hindenburg Line. Climates was elevated to brief corporal on 10 September. On 29 September, the third Division was a piece of the Battle of St Quentin Canal, one of the last Australian ground activities of the war, which included breaking the Beaurevoir Line, the third line of protections of the Hindenburg Line. Amid the fight, the 43rd Battalion was shielding in a channel when a shell burst among a little gathering of men, injuring Weathers in the head. He kicked the bucket before long, not realizing he would get the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 24 December 1918. A similar shell murdered his uncle, Lance Corporal J. J. Climates.
