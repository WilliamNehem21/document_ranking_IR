The siphon at Westonzoyland initially contained a shaft motor and scoop wheel, which is like a water wheel, then again, actually it is driven round by the motor and lifts water up to a more elevated amount. After 25ÃÂ years, there were issues siphoning the water away as the land surface had dropped as it dried out. A superior technique was looked for, and in 1861 a substitution siphon was introduced. The motor was worked by Easton and Amos of London, to a structure licensed in 1858 by Charles Amos. It is a twin barrel, vertical gathering motor, driving a divergent siphon. A comparative motor was in plain view at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was appeared to have the capacity to lift 100ÃÂ tons of water every moment (1,700 L/s), to a stature of . The Westonzoyland siphon lifts water from the rhyne (articulated "reen") into the River Parrett. The siphon worked until 1951, when another diesel-fueled siphoning station, fit for siphoning 35ÃÂ tons every moment (600 L/s) at any condition of the tide, was worked alongside the former one. The siphoning station is currently an Industrial Heritage gallery of steam fueled apparatus and land seepage, and houses the vast majority of the hardware from the neglected Burrowbridge siphoning station.
