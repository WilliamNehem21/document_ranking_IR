The LCA trusted that rather than bring forth spread spillage, the more reasonable justification of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s misfortune was shoaling or establishing in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of Caribou Island when the vessel "accidentally raked a reef" amid the time the Whitefish Point light and radio reference point were not accessible as route helps. This hypothesis was upheld by a 1976ÃÂ Canadian hydrographic review, which revealed that an obscure shore ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than appeared on the Canadian diagrams. Officers from "Arthur M. Anderson" saw that "Edmund Fitzgerald" cruised through this definite region. Guess by defenders of the Six Fathom Shoal hypothesis presumed that "Edmund Fitzgerald"s brought down fence rail revealed by McSorley could happen just if the ship "hoarded" amid shoaling, with the bow and stern bowed descending and the midriff raised by the reef, pulling the railing tight until the links ousted or tore under the strain. Jumpers looked through the Six Fathom Shoal after the disaster area happened and found no proof of "an ongoing impact or establishing anyplace." Maritime creators Bishop and Stonehouse composed that the shoaling hypothesis was later tested based on the higher nature of detail in Shannon's 1994ÃÂ photography that "unequivocally show[s] the demolition of the "Edmund Fitzgerald"". Shannon's photography of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s toppled stern demonstrated "no proof on the base of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would show the ship struck a reef."
