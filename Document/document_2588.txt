The morning after the communicate, the British broadsheets seemed liberal or modestly good to "This Week"; "The Times" told perusers that "Passing on the Rock" "appeared a noteworthy, altogether capable and genuine examination of a most irritating case" and that it "basically brought up major issues and recommended they required profound examination". The sensationalist newspapers, be that as it may, criticized the program and its creators. "The Sun" blamed the producers for a "modest scoop" and marked the program "IRA purposeful publicity". The "Every day Mail" was similarly strong; its fundamental feature read "rage over SAS 'preliminary by TV'", while in an inside article, it called the program "woefully uneven", and blamed Bolton for having recently worked together with the IRA for electrifying news stories. That night, Bolton consented to show up on Channel 4's "Entitlement to Reply", a show which enabled customary watchers to scrutinize the creators of questionable TV programs; the program was pre-recorded, and, curiously, the makers consented to cut the finish of the chronicle after one of the membersÃ¢ÂÂa previous individual from Margaret Thatcher's own staff professing to be a fair-minded watcherÃ¢ÂÂpropelled an assault on Bolton, in which he blamed Bolton for partner with psychological oppressors.
