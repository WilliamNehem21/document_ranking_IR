Following the foundation of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish friends stopped to choose delegates, in spite of the fact that those effectively chose were permitted to serve forever; the remainder of the fleeting companions, The fourth Earl of Kilmorey (a companion from a Ulster family), kicked the bucket in 1961. Debate at that point emerged with respect to whether agent friends could even now be chosen. The Act setting up the Irish Free State was quiet on the issue, in spite of the fact that the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had annulled the workplace of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose association was required in the decision procedure; the workplace of Clerk of the Crown had likewise been abrogated in Ireland. Different Irish companions appealed to the House of Lords for a rebuilding of their entitlement to choose agents. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the following year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, in addition to other things, gave all friends in the Peerage of Scotland the privilege to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, a correction to also enable Irish companions to go to was crushed, ninety to eight. Rather, the new Act gave every single Irish friend the privilege to represent decision to the House of Commons, and to cast a ballot at parliamentary races.
