The "Punch" serialisation attracted little critical comment; "The Athenaeum"s literary critic thought the series "may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes". When the "Diary" was published as a book, "Punch" heralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as "very funny", adding: "not without a touch of pathos". However, apart from a warmly approving report in "The Saturday Review", the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The "Review"s critic thought the book "admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius", with a natural and irresistible appeal: "The "Diary" has amused us from cover to cover". This contrasted with the negative judgement of "The Athenaeum", which opined that "the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: "Besides, it is all so dull". "The Speaker"s critic thought the book "a study in vulgarity", while "The New York Times", reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: "There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the waterÂ ... Our way of manufacturing fun is different". Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.
