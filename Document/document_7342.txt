Maylam inferred that at the time, there was just a single hooden horse still in dynamic use in Thanet, that put away at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was drawn out every Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington, and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The individuals incorporated a man in female attire, known as the Mollie, in their parade, however included this had not been accomplished for quite a while and was in this manner reintroduced for Maylam's advantage. In his book, Maylam incorporated a photo of the pony taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam experienced a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This pony came into the neighborhood inn coffee bar at about 6.30ÃÂ pm, joined by two artistsÃ¢ÂÂone playing the tambourine and the other the concertinaÃ¢ÂÂand a man named Robert Laming who drove the steed itself. They were wearing common garments, yet educated Maylam that they had once worn coverall gowns as a feature of the custom. They had no Mollie, and the individuals couldn't review a Mollie regularly having been a piece of their custom. The inn proprietor's little girl set a tip in the steed's mouth, before the troupe proceeded onward to the nearby shops, where they were likewise given tips along these lines. Maylam conversed with the troupe about the custom, and in the end sorted out the capturing of the Walmer horse and the individuals who went with it in March 1907.
