They incorporate, for example, General JosÃÂ© MarÃÂ­a CarreÃÂ±o, an individual from the company, whose correct arm was cut off after a battle wound, and who once uncovered a military mystery by talking in his rest. At different occasions, they are prostheses for the General's currently falling flat powers: Fernando, for instance, the General's nephew, is "the most eager and patient of the General's numerous assistants", and the General wakes him "at any hour to have him perused out loud from a dull book or take notes on critical extemporizations". A standout amongst the least created of the minor characters is the General's better half, MarÃÂ­a Teresa RodrÃÂ­guez del Toro y Alayza, who had kicked the bucket, perusers are told, in strange conditions not long after their marriage. The General has "covered her at the base of a water-tight obscurity as a severe methods for living without her"; she just briefly enters his recollections in the book's last part. As per Menton, she is "upstaged" by Manuela SÃÂ¡enz, whose later history GarcÃÂ­a MÃÂ¡rquez describes as though she rather were the General's widow. MarÃÂ­a Teresa's demise, in any case, denoted the General's "introduction to the world into history", and he has never attempted to supplant her.
