As indicated by Patti Bellantoni, hues are utilized emblematically all through the film, none more so than red, which is a critical topical mark that drives the story and "[defines] Lester's curve". First found in dull hues that mirror his lack of involvement, Lester encircle himself with red as he recaptures his singularity. The American Beauty rose is over and over utilized as image; when Lester fantasizes about Angela, she is normally bare and encompassed by flower petals. In these scenes, the rose symbolizes Lester's craving for her. At the point when related with Carolyn, the rose speaks to a "faÃÂ§ade for rural achievement". Roses are incorporated into pretty much every shot inside the Burnhams' home, where they connote "a veil covering a grim, unbeautiful reality". Carolyn feels that "insofar as there can be roses, everything is great". She cuts the roses and places them in vases, where they enhance her "meretricious vision of what makes for magnificence" and start to kick the bucket. The roses in the vase in the AngelaÃ¢ÂÂ Lester temptation scene symbolize Lester's past life and Carolyn; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela draw nearer, at long last taking the rosesÃ¢ÂÂand in this way CarolynÃ¢ÂÂout of the shot. Lester's revelation toward the finish of the film is communicated by downpour and the utilization of red, working to a crescendo that is a conscious difference to the discharge Lester feels. The steady utilization of red "quiets [the audience] subliminally" into getting to be utilized to it; thusly, it leaves the group of onlookers ill-equipped when Lester is shot and his blood scatters on the divider.
