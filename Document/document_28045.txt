The current concept of "Oryzomys" derives from the "palustris-mexicanus" group recognized within a much larger genus "Oryzomys" by Merriam (1901) and the "palustris" group proposed by Goldman (1918). Merriam recognized 21Â species within his group, but Goldman consolidated them into eightâthe marsh rice rat in the United States, "O.Â couesi" in far southern Texas, Mexico, and Central America, and six others with small distributions. In 1960, Raymond Hall united "O.Â couesi" and the marsh rice rat into a single species, "Oryzomys palustris", and thereafter, other localized forms were also included in "O.Â palustris". Hershkovitz described another species in the group, "O.Â gorgasi" from Colombia, in 1970 and the next year he noted that "O.Â dimidiatus", previously classified as a "Nectomys", was similar to "O.Â palustris". After 1979, the marsh rice rat and "O.Â couesi" were again regarded as separate as a result of further work in Texas, where their ranges meet. While reviewing "O.Â gorgasi" in 2001, J. SÃ¡nchez H. and colleagues redefined and characterized the "O.Â palustris" group and listed "O.Â couesi", "O.Â dimidiatus", "O.Â gorgasi", and the marsh rice rat as its members; Guy Musser and Michael Carleton in the 2005 third edition of "Mammal Species of the World" additionally listed "O.Â nelsoni" from MarÃ­a Madre Island in western Mexico.
