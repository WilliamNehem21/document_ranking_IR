Since 1962, the disclosure of the "Dormition" and the broad documented research has slowly persuaded researchers that Wethey's evaluations were not by any stretch of the imagination right, and that his list choices may have mutilated the view of the entire idea of El Greco's causes, improvement and . The revelation of the "Dormition" prompted the attribution of three other marked works of "DomÃÂ©nicos" to El Greco ("Modena Triptych", "St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child", and "The Adoration of the Magi") and afterward to the acknowledgment of more fills in as bona fideÃ¢ÂÂsome marked, some not, (for example, "The Passion of Christ (PietÃÂ  with Angels)" painted in 1566),Ã¢ÂÂ which were brought into the gathering of early works of El Greco. El Greco is presently observed as a craftsman with a developmental preparing on Crete; a progression of works light up his initial style, some painted while he was still on Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his resulting remain in Rome. Indeed, even Wethey acknowledged that "he [El Greco] most likely had painted the little and much questioned triptych in the Galleria Estense at Modena before he left Crete". By and by, arguments about the precise number of El Greco's bona fide works stay uncertain, and the status of Wethey's list is at the focal point of these contradictions.
