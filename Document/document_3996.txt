In his lifetime Shaw claimed numerous convictions, frequently conflicting. This irregularity was mostly a purposeful incitementÃ¢ÂÂthe Spanish researcher statesman Salvador de Madariaga portrays Shaw as "a shaft of contrary power set in a people of constructive power". In one territory at any rate Shaw was consistent: in his long lasting refusal to pursue ordinary English types of spelling and accentuation. He supported age-old spellings, for example, "shew" for "appear"; he dropped the "u" in words like "respect" and "support"; and wherever conceivable he dismissed the punctuation in constrictions, for example, "won't" or "that's". In his will, Shaw requested that, after some predetermined inheritances, his residual resources were to frame a trust to pay for major change of the English letter set into a phonetic variant of forty letters. In spite of the fact that Shaw's goals were clear, his drafting was imperfect, and the courts at first led the planned trust void. A later out-of-court understanding gave a total of ÃÂ£8,300 to spelling change; the majority of his fortune went to the residuary legateesÃ¢ÂÂthe British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the National Gallery of Ireland. The vast majority of the ÃÂ£8,300 went on an exceptional phonetic version of "Androcles and the Lion" in the Shavian letters in order, distributed in 1962 to a generally aloof gathering.
