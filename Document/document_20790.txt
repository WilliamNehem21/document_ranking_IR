When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, USÂ 25 was included in Michigan's section of the system. The US Highway designation was assigned to run along Dixie Highway replacing that segment of M-56. From Monroe northward, USÂ 25 overlapped USÂ 24 on Telegraph Road to the Dearborn area and then followed M-17 (Ecorse Road) to Fort Street and into Downtown Detroit. From there, the highway replaced M-19 to Marysville and overlapped M-29 into Port Huron to an intersection with M-21; the remainder of the highway to Port Austin was numbered M-29 only. The highway was rerouted off Telegraph Road along DixâToledo Highway into downtown Detroit in 1929. By the end of 1932, USÂ 25 was rerouted from downtown Monroe along Dixie Highway north to USÂ 24 instead of turning westward in the city. The next year, USÂ 25 was extended northward from Port Huron to Port Austin, replacing that section of M-29 in the process. The remainder of M-29 westward to Bay City was renumbered M-25.
In 1936, USÂ 25 was changed to traffic along a one-way pairing of streets on the southwest side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two USÂ 25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near Erie, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered USÂ 24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access to the Blue Water Bridge from the mainline of the highway starting in 1940. That last segment of USÂ 25 to be paved was completed near Port Hope at the end of the 1950s.
