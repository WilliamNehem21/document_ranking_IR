In 1997, correlations of rehashed DNA successions inside the family Indriidae bolstered Simon's characterization, setting the brilliant delegated sifaka as a sister gathering to the next sifakas. In 2001, an examination including mitochondrial DNA proposed an ongoing disparity among it and the Coquerel's sifaka, at that point considered a subspecies of the "P. verreauxi" gathering. In the event that this were valid, the brilliant delegated sifaka would not justify species status and would shape a subclade with the Coquerel's sifaka inside the "P. verreauxi" gathering. In 2004, a relative investigation of the karyotypes of the three customary types of sifakas gave understanding into the chromosomal courses of action of each of the three gatherings. This investigation found that the brilliant delegated sifaka contrasts from "P. verreauxi" gathering and "P. diadema" gather by 9 and 17 chromosomal revisions individually, and on the other hand contended that the brilliant delegated sifaka is surely a different animal varieties and is all the more firmly identified with the "P. verreauxi" gathering. All the more as of late, in 2007 a craniodental (skull and tooth) think about gave proof to 9 or 10 particular sifaka species, including the brilliant delegated sifaka. It likewise set the brilliant delegated sifaka inside the "P. verreauxi" gathering.
