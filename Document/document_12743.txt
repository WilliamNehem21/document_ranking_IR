Marshall's rival in the general race was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the crusade concentrated on moderation and forbiddance. Similarly as it started, the Republican-controlled state government passed a neighborhood choice law that enabled districts to boycott the clearance of alcohol. The law turned into the main issue of discussion between the gatherings and their gubernatorial competitors. The Democrats suggested that the nearby alternative law be changed so the choice to boycott alcohol deals could be made at the city and township level. This drew help from enemies of prohibitionists, who considered it to be a chance to move back restriction in certain zones, and as the main option accessible to the complete denial which the Republican Party pushed. The Democratic position likewise held prohibitionists' help by enabling denial to remain instituted in networks where a larger part upheld it. The Republican Party was amidst a time of precariousness, part along dynamic and traditionalist lines. Their inner issues turned out to be the central factor in the decision, giving Marshall a tight triumph: he got 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48.0 percent. He was the primary Democratic representative in two decades. Democrats likewise came to control in the Indiana House of Representatives just barely, however Republicans held control of the Indiana Senate.
