The biggest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the biggest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. Altogether, the Leave vote in the Northern England areas was 55.9% Ã¢ÂÂ higher than in the Southern England districts and the other Home Nations, however lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) situated themselves as the primary challenger to Labor in Northern electorates, and came next in numerous at the 2015 general decision. UKIP initially battled in the district because of vote part with the extreme right British National Party (BNP), who abused racial pressures in the wake of the 2001 Bradford riots and different mobs in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs chose at the 2009 European races originated from Northern bodies electorate. After 2013, BNP support in the area fallen as most voters swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote thus crumpled after the EU choice, with most UKIP voters coming back to their previous devotions.
