The second is the circular bodied plucked lute, the "yueqin". Percussion instruments include the "daluo", "xiaoluo", and "naobo". The player of the "gu" and "ban", a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, "Xipi" and "Erhuang", originally differed in subtle ways. In the "Xipi" style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In "Erhuang", on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including "manban" (a slow tempo), "yuanban" (a standard, medium-fast tempo), "kuai sanyan" ("leading beat"), "daoban" ("leading beat"), "sanban" ("rubato beat"), and "yaoban" ("shaking beat"). The "xipi" style also uses several unique tempos, including "erliu" ("two-six"), and "kuaiban" (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, "yuanban", "manban", and "kuaiban" are most commonly seen. The tempo at any given time is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. "Erhuang" has been seen as more improvisational, and "Xipi" as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.
