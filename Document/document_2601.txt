Tyler was undeterred when the Whig-controlled Senate dismissed his settlement by a vote of 16Ã¢ÂÂ 35 in June 1844; he felt that addition was currently inside reach by joint goals as opposed to by arrangement, and made that solicitation to the congress. Previous President Andrew Jackson, a staunch supporter of extension, induced Polk to invite Tyler once again into the Democratic party and requested Democratic editors to stop their assaults on him. Fulfilled by these advancements, Tyler dropped out of the race in August and embraced Polk for the administration. Polk's tight triumph over Clay in the November decision was seen by the Tyler organization as an order for finishing the goals. Tyler reported in his yearly message to Congress that "a controlling lion's share of the general population and a vast greater part of the states have proclaimed for quick extension". In late February 1845, the House endorsed a joint goals offering extension to Texas by a significant edgeÃ¢ÂÂthe Senate affirmed by an exposed 27Ã¢ÂÂ 25 lion's share, and three days before the finish of his term, Tyler marked the bill into law. After some discussion, Texas acknowledged the terms and entered the association on December 29, 1845, as the 28th state.
