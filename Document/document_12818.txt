The voters returned Sherman to office for a third term in 1858. After a short unique session in March 1859, the 36th Congress suspended, and Sherman and his significant other traveled to Europe. When they restored that December, the circumstance was like that of four years sooner: no gathering had an outright lion's share. Republicans held 109 seats, Democrats 101, and the blend of Oppositionists and Know Nothings 27. Once more, sectional pressure had expanded while Congress was in break, this time because of John Brown's assault on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The race for Speaker of the House guaranteed to be argumentative. This time, Sherman was among the main hopefuls, getting the second-biggest number of votes on the primary ticket, with no applicant accepting a larger part. The decision for Speaker was derailed by a stir over an abolitionist bondage book, "The Impending Crisis of the South", composed by Hinton Rowan Helper and embraced by numerous Republican individuals. Southerners blamed Sherman for having embraced the book, while he dissented that he just supported its utilization as a crusade instrument and had never perused it. Following two months of balloting, no choice had been come to. After their endeavors to receive a majority rule fizzled, Sherman acknowledged that he couldn't be chosen, and pulled back. Republicans at that point moved their help to William Pennington, who was chosen on the forty-fourth vote.
