A ragged bush, "Banksia aculeata" grows up to tall, with fissured dark bark on its trunk and branches. In contrast to numerous other banksia species, it doesn't have a woody base, or lignotuber. The leaves go from long and wide, with strongly pointed unbending projections on the edges. Showing up in February and March, the barrel shaped bloom spikesÃ¢ÂÂknown as inflorescencesÃ¢ÂÂextend from long, developing at the finishes of short verdant 2Ã¢ÂÂ 3-year-old side branches. Hanging descending instead of developing upstanding like those of most different banksias, they are made out of a focal woody spike or pivot, from which many minimized individual blooms emerge oppositely. These botanical units are comprised of a smooth cylindrical perianth that wraps the bloom's sexual organs. The perianth is long and pink at the base evaluating into cream. In late bud, the finish of the perianth has a trademark four-calculated (squarish) appearance. It at that point parts at anthesis to uncover the smooth straight pistil, which is somewhat shorter than its encompassing structure at long. The fruiting cone, known as an infructescence, is a swollen woody spike in which up to 20 monstrous follicles are inserted; the shriveled blossom parts endure on the spike, giving it a shaggy appearance. Oval fit as a fiddle, the follicles are wrinkled in surface and secured with fine hair. They are long, high, and wide.
