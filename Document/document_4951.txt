On 11 October 1900, Beerschot AC privileged president Jorge DÃÂ­az declared that Antwerp would have a progression of test coordinates between Europe's best football crews. After some hierarchical issues, on 28 April 1901, Beerschot's pitch facilitated its first competition, in which a Belgian A-squad and a Dutch B-group challenged the Coupe Vanden Abeele. Belgium won, and beat the Netherlands in every one of the three follow-up matches; FIFA does not perceive these outcomes since Belgium handled some English players. On 1 May 1904, the Belgians played their first official match, against France at the Stade du Vivier d'Oie in Uccle; their draw left the ÃÂvence CoppÃÂ©e Trophy unclaimed. After twenty days, the football sheets of the two nations were among the seven FIFA organizers. Around then, the Belgian squad was picked by a panel drawn from the nation's six or seven noteworthy clubs. In 1906, the national cooperative people got the epithet Red Devils due to their red shirts, and after four years, Scottish ex-footballer William Maxwell supplanted the UBSSA advisory group as their director. From 1912, UBSSA represented football just and was renamed UBSFA. Amid the Great War, the national group just played unrecognized friendlies, with matches in and against France.
