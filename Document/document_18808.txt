A bonus feature section, "Rare Revealed", contains over an hour of behind-the-scenes footage focusing on Rare's major and unreleased games. The player completes in-game challenges to collect stamps, which increase the player's rank and unlock the bonus features; to collect all the stamps, the player has to finish every game. The compilation automatically grants stamps for prior progress in the package's Xbox 360 games. Current and former Rare employees, such as Grant Kirkhope, feature in the documentary clips, though studio founders Tim and Chris Stamper do not appear. Rare Revealed unveils gameplay footage from several unreleased games: for example, in the open world adventure game "Black Widow", the player controls a spider-like robot equipped with missiles. The spider was expected to be recycled in "Kameo 2", an unreleased sequel to "Kameo" which was designed with a darker tone than the original. Rare also worked on "The Fast and the Furriest", a spiritual successor to "Diddy Kong Racing" with vehicle customization and track alterations. The company's other planned intellectual properties included the survival game prototype "Sundown" and the airplane-based "Tailwind". The "Rare Revealed" videos include trivia behind some game design decisions such as "Blast Corps" character design, the fate of "Banjo-Kazooie" Stop 'n' Swop features, and audio overrides built into "Killer Instinct". Additional Rare Revealed featurettes not present in "Rare Replay" have been released since the game's launch via the company's official YouTube channel.
