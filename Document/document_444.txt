Head servant declared on 6 March 1963 that he would meet a gathering to choose the Federation's future. It would be incomprehensible (or if nothing else troublesome) for Britain to break down the association without Southern Rhodesia's co-activity as the last mentioned, acting naturally administering, had been co-signatory to the Federal understanding in 1953. As indicated by Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF government officials, Butler made a few oral autonomy assurances to guarantee Southern Rhodesia's participation and backing at the gathering, however more than once would not give anything on paper. Field and Smith guaranteed that Butler advocated this to them the day preceding the gathering started by saying that coupling Whitehall to a record as opposed to his oath would be against the Commonwealth's "soul of trust"Ã¢ÂÂ a contention that Field in the end acknowledged. "We should recall the trust you accentuated," Smith cautioned, as indicated by Field's record swaying his finger at Butler; "on the off chance that you break that you will live to think twice about it." No minutes were made of this gathering. Head servant denied a short time later that he had ever constructed such a guarantee. Southern Rhodesia went to the meeting, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over seven days beginning from 28 June 1963, and in addition to other things it was consented to formally sell the Federation toward the finish of 1963.
