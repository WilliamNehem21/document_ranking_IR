"The Riddle of the Sphinx" was written in the late spring of 2015, one of the remainder of the arrangement, and was shot in December that year. The greater part of the scene was recorded in Langleybury, a nation house in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, which had past been utilized for "Within No. 9" scenes "The Harrowing" and "SÃÂ©ance Time", just as the place of Oscar Lomax in the Shearsmith and Pemberton TV arrangement "Psychoville". The opening outside shot was taped in a court of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The plan to set the scene amid a tempest, which gave it a gothic quality, was Morales's. For Shearsmith and Pemberton, this was a case of favorable position to hosting a third gathering direct scenes, rather than "Limited consolidation" and "Nana's Party" from the second arrangement, which they had guided themselves. Close-up shots of the crossword and the board were taped later, some on the arrangement of "Private View", which presented potential progression issues. The scene was taped following two days' practices. The content was 32 pages long, bringing about a first cut that was 38 minutes in length. The BBC allowed the last form to be somewhat longer than the half hour run of the mill of "Inside No. 9", yet the generation group still expected to lose a few minutes in the alter. The last run-time for the scene is 31 minutes and 35 seconds.
