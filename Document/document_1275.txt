While the Hornet Upgrade Program has been effective, the RAAF's Hornets are moving toward retirement. It is normal that the flying machine will be progressively costly to work as they age, and enhancements to the contender flying machine and air safeguards worked by different nations will lessen the Hornets' battle adequacy. The Australian Government is as of now intending to supplant the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornets with Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II warriors from 2018 onwards. The Defense Materiel Organization's Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B determines that 72 F-35A warriors will be procured to prepare three squadrons and an operational preparing unit. No. 3 Squadron will be the principal Hornet unit to be reequipped, and stopped working the sort in December 2017. It started to progress to the F-35 in mid 2018. The squadron's Hornets and a large portion of its faculty were exchanged to No. 77 Squadron, which was extended from a few flights as a component of this change. The majority of the F/A-18A and Bs are planned to be resigned by 2023. The RAAF's Hornet manageability arranging has been intended to enable the sort to be held in administration for more if the F-35 program encounters further deferrals.
