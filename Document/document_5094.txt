On 1 January 1901, the settlements of Australia unified to shape the Commonwealth of Australia. At the point when Chauvel came back to Australia on 17 January, he found that amid his nonattendance he had turned into an officer in the recently shaped Australian Army. A power of 14,000ÃÂ troops was amassed for the opening of the main Federal Parliament on 9 May 1901 in Melbourne; Chauvel was chosen as unit major of the mounted unforeseen, his first Federal posting. He progressed toward becoming Staff Officer, Northern Military District, based at Townsville, Queensland, in July. In 1902, Chauvel was named to direction of the seventh Commonwealth Light Horse, a unit recently brought for administration up in South Africa, with the nearby position of lieutenant colonel. Withdrawing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902, the seventh Commonwealth Light Horse touched base at Durban on 22 June, three weeks after the war finished. It thusly re-set out for Brisbane, where it was disbanded. Chauvel stayed in South Africa for half a month so as to visit the front lines. On coming back to Australia he progressed toward becoming Staff Officer, Northern Military District afresh. He was elevated to the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1902.
