Under front of dim the men pushed ahead, making holes in the spiked metal and minefields before their positions and spanning Tobruk's enemy of tank dump. At 06:30, on 21ÃÂ November, the division started its assault on the places of the "Bologna" Division and the German 90th Light Division (in spite of the fact that the last had not been normal). The Axis positions were well dove in, behind mines and spiked metal, bolstered by automatic weapons and mounted guns. The main position, codenamed "Butch", was caught by 09:00, in a matter of seconds pursued by "Jill", yet two endeavors to catch "Tugun" were spurned by the Italian safeguards. The blend of Italian and German troops holding "Tiger" presented the most obstruction of the day. The supporting Matilda tanks kept running into undetected minefields and were locked in occasionally by Axis hostile to tank firearms. The Black Watch, under flanking fire from different Axis solid focuses and being terminated upon straightforwardly by the protectors of "Tiger", drove a pike charge to the sound of bagpipes and caught the situation, related to components of the first Royal Tank Regiment (1 RTR) and the fourth Royal Tank Regiment (4 RTR). The Black Watch endured 75 percent setbacks, being decreased to 165 men.
