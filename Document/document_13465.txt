"Monsieur Bertin" was shown at the 1833 Salon close by his 1807 "Representation of Madame Duvaucey". It met with close general recognition to turn into his best work of art to that point. It fixed his notoriety for being a portraitist, venturing sufficiently far into open awareness to turn into a standard for paper political parodies. Today it is viewed as his most noteworthy representation. Ingres saw this as a blended gift, commenting that "since my pictures of Bertin and MolÃÂ©, everyone needs representations. There are six that I've turned down, or am dodging, since I can't stand them." Before the official show, Ingres showed the composition in his studio for companions and understudies. Most were luxurious in their acclaim, in spite of the fact that Louis Lacuria trusted to a companion that he dreaded individuals may "discover the shading somewhat bleak". He demonstrated right; at the Salon, pundits applauded the draftsmanship, however some felt the representation exemplified Ingres' shortcoming as a colourist. It was routinely blamed for its "purplish tone"Ã¢ÂÂ which the maturing of the oil medium has changed after some time to warm grays and tans. Bertin's significant other Louis-Marie supposedly disliked the work of art; his little girl, Louise, thought it changed her dad from an "incredible master" to a "fat rancher".
