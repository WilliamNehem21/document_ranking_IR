Clint Boyd and associates distributed a reassessment of "Thescelosaurus", "Bugenasaura", and "Parksosaurus" in 2009, utilizing new cranial material as a beginning stage. They found that "Parksosaurus" was in fact unmistakable from "Thescelosaurus", and that the skull of "Bugenasaura infernalis" was basically equivalent to a skull found with a postcranial skeleton that coordinated "Thescelosaurus". Since "B infernalis" couldn't be separated from "Thescelosaurus", they viewed the variety as an equivalent word of "Thescelosaurus", the species as questionable, and SDSMÃÂ 7210 for instance of "T." sp. They found that LACMÃÂ 33542, albeit fragmentary, was an example of "Thescelosaurus", and concurred with Morris that the lower leg structure was particular, returning it to "T. garbanii". At long last, they noticed that another example, RSMÃÂ P.1225.1, contrasted from "T. neglectus" in some anatomical subtleties, and may speak to another species. In this manner, "Thescelosaurus" per Boyd et al. (2009) is spoken to by somewhere around two, and perhaps three substantial species: type species "T. neglectus", "T. garbanii", and a conceivable anonymous animal types. In December 2011, RSMÃÂ P.1225.1 was doled out to its own species, "Thescelosaurus assiniboiensis". It was named by Caleb M. Darker, Clint A. Boyd and Anthony P. Russell and is known just from its holotype, a little, enunciated and practically total skeleton from the Frenchman Formation (late Maastrichtian organize) of Saskatchewan.
