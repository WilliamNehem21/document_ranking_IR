At the point when Owen Hart was to challenge The Godfather for the WWF Intercontinental Champion's title, he was executing as the Blue Blazer. The character, initially utilized by Hart in the late 1980s, had as of late been restored as a superhuman trick that mocked different wrestlers. At Over the Edge, Hart was to copy World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler Sting's (Steve Borden) ring passage by plunging from the field rafters into the ring. The passageway was effectively tried on the November 15, 1998, scene of "Sunday Night Heat" (that year's Survivor Series pre-show, and utilizing an alternate tackle arrangement); in any case, amid his drop at Over the Edge, a link withdrew from the security vest he wore, and he fell more than from the rafters into the ring. As he fell, he landed chest-first on one of the ring's cushioned turnbuckles. The mishap was not seen by audience members. A pre-recorded meeting video was appeared toward the beginning of Hart's plummet, and when the communicate returned live, the cameras immediately gotten some distance from the ring to the group of onlookers. Before long subsequently, Jim Ross, one of the observers of the occasion, educated pay-per-see watchers that Hart had tumbled from the rafters, that the episode was "not a piece of the stimulation" and that it was "a genuine circumstance". EMTs came down to the ring and gave Hart CPR, yet he demonstrated no reaction to the treatment. Bringing Hart out on a gurney, the EMTs boarded the vigorously harmed wrestler into an emergency vehicle and took him to an adjacent medical clinic in Kansas City.
