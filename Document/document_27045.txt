In addition to his various Batman commitments, Affleck appeared in two other films in 2016. He starred as an autistic accountant in the action thriller "The Accountant" (2016), which was an unexpected commercial success. Peter Debruge of "Variety" felt Affleck's "boy-next-door" demeanorÂ â "so normal and non-actorly that most of his performances feel like watching one of your buddies up on screen"Â â was "a terrific fit" for the role. Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" wondered why Affleck, "looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable," committed himself to the film. "Live by Night", which Affleck wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in, was released in late 2016. Adapted from Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, the Prohibition-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. David Sims of "The Atlantic" described it as "a fascinating mess of a movie" and criticized Affleck's "stiff, uncomfortable" performance. He noted that one of the last action scenes "is so wonderfully staged, its action crisp and easy to follow, that it reminds you what skill Affleck has with the camera". In October 2016, Affleck and Damon made a one-off stage appearance for a live reading of the "Good Will Hunting" screenplay at New York's Skirball Theater.
