The piano works frequently use arpeggiated figures, with the song scattered between the two hands, and incorporate finger substitutions characteristic for organists. These angles make them overwhelming for certain musicians. Indeed, even a virtuoso like Liszt said that he discovered FaurÃÂ©'s music difficult to play. The early piano works are obviously impacted by Chopin. A considerably more noteworthy impact was Schumann, whose piano music FaurÃÂ© cherished more than some other. In Copland's view, it was with the 6th Nocturne that FaurÃÂ© completely rose up out of any forerunner's shadow. The musician Alfred Cortot stated, "There are not many pages in all music equivalent to these." The commentator Bryce Morrison has noticed that piano players as often as possible want to play the beguiling prior piano works, for example, the Impromptu No. 2, as opposed to the later piano works, which express "such private enthusiasm and disconnection, such rotating annoyance and renunciation" that audience members are left uneasy. In his piano music, as in a large portion of his works, FaurÃÂ© avoided virtuosity for the established clarity frequently connected with the French. He was disinterested by simply virtuoso piano players, saying, "the more noteworthy they are, the more regrettable they play me."
