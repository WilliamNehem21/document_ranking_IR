Each maxilla had space for about 14 or 15 teeth, whereas "Giraffatitan" had 11 and "Camarasaurus" 8 to 10. The maxillae contained replacement teeth that had rugose enamel, similar to "Camarasaurus", but lacked the small denticles (serrations) along the edges. Since the maxilla was wider than that of "Camarasaurus", "Brachiosaurus" would have had larger teeth. The replacement teeth in the premaxilla had crinkled enamel, and the most complete of these teeth did not have denticles. Each dentary had space for about 14 teeth. The only well preserved tooth of this skull is large, spoon-shaped, and may be from the front part of the left dentary. It differs from those of "Giraffatitan" in that the crown is much wider than the root, similar to "Camarasaurus". That the tooth is not worn implies that it had erupted around the time the animal died. The outer and inner sides of the tooth were crenelated (had indented vertical grooves); the crenelations of one side met with those of the other side at the top of the tooth, where they formed denticles. The maxillary tooth rows of "Brachiosaurus" and "Giraffatitan" ended well in front of the antorbital fenestra (the opening in front of the orbit), whereas they ended just in front of and below the fenestra in "Camarasaurus" and "Shunosaurus".
