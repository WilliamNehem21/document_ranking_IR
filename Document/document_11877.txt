Crane chose to distribute it secretly, with cash he had acquired from his mom. The tale was distributed in late February or early March 1893 by a little printing shop that normally printed restorative books and religious tracts. The typewritten cover sheet for the Library of Congress copyright application read essentially: "A Girl of the Streets,/A Story of New York. / Ã¢ÂÂ ByÃ¢ÂÂ/Stephen Crane." The name "Maggie" was added to the title later. Crane utilized the pen name "Smith" for the novel's underlying distribution, later telling companion and craftsman Corwin Knapp Linson that the "pseudonym" was the "commonest name I could consider. I had a manager companion named Johnson, and put in the "t", and nobody could discover me in the crowd of Smiths." Hamlin Garland inspected the work in the June 1893 issue of "The Arena", calling it "the most honest and unhackneyed investigation of the ghettos I have yet perused, piece however it is." Despite this early commendation, Crane wound up discouraged and down and out from having burned through $869 for 1,100ÃÂ copies of a novel that did not sell; he wound up giving a hundred duplicates away. He would later recollect "what I looked like forward to distribution and envisioned the sensation I figured it would make. It failed. No one appeared to see it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first adores."
