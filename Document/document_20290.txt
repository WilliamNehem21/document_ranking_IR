The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy "L'heure espagnole" was premiered in 1911. The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the OpÃ©ra-Comique, Albert CarrÃ©, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot â a bedroom farce â would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the OpÃ©ra-Comique's audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.
In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered. The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of "Ma mÃ¨re l'Oye", opened at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Arts in January. The reviews were excellent: the "Mercure de France" called the score "absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature". The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall, London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year. "The Times" praised "the enchantment of the workÂ ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing." New York audiences heard the work in the same year. Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was "AdÃ©laÃ¯de ou le langage des fleurs", danced to the score of "Valses nobles et sentimentales", which opened at the ChÃ¢telet in April. "Daphnis et ChloÃ©" opened at the same theatre in June. This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete.
