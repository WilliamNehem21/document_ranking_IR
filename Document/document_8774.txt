The race restarted on lap 476, when a seventeenth alert was issued in light of the fact that Earnhardt reached Kahne in the wake of endeavoring to pass him; Earnhardt spun at turn three. Martin again went to pit street in light of water issues, and Johnson kept up the lead at the restart. On lap 484, Hamlin passed Labonte for second spot. Five laps later Wallace spun leaving turn two in the wake of being hit by McMurray, inciting the race's eighteenth (and last) alert, yet had the capacity to proceed. Johnson remained the pioneer at the lap-495 restart, with Hamlin not far behind. Hamlin knock Johnson leaving turn two, making Johnson move to the outside path, and went to within path to draw nearby him on the back stretch. They stayed one next to the other for one lap, when Johnson drew in front of Hamlin at turn four. He pulled away, holding the lead for the staying six laps to win the race. Hamlin completed second, in front of Labonte in third, Stewart in fourth and Gordon in fifth. Mears, Kahne, Green, Harvick and Petty adjusted the main ten finishers. The race had an aggregate of 18 alerts and 16 lead changes by five drivers. Johnson drove multiple times for a sum of 245 laps, more than some other contender. The success was the 23rd of Johnson's Cup Career, just as his last of five triumphs he posted in the 2006 season.
