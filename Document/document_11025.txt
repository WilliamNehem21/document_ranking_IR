The decision was among Buchanan and Republican John C. FrÃÂ©mont in the north and among Buchanan and Millard Fillmore, designated by a professional subjection group of the Know Nothings, in the South. Tennessee Governor Andrew Johnson and "Congressional Globe" proofreader John C. Rives advanced the likelihood that Douglas and Pierce supporters would back Fillmore in the Southern states, denying Buchanan a greater part in the Electoral College and tossing the race to the House of Representatives. There, Buchanan's rivals would keep a vote, and the Senate's decision for VPÃ¢ÂÂsure to be BreckinridgeÃ¢ÂÂwould move toward becoming president. There is no proof that Breckinridge countenanced this plan. Challenging contemporary political tradition, Breckinridge talked much of the time amid the crusade, focusing Democratic loyalty to the constitution and charging that the Republican emancipationist plan would destroy the nation. His appearances in the basic territory of Pennsylvania eased Buchanan's feelings of trepidation that Breckinridge wanted to toss the race to the House. "Buck and Breck" won the decision with 174 discretionary votes to FrÃÂ©mont's 114 and Fillmore's 8, and Democrats conveyed Kentucky out of the blue since 1828. Thirty-six at the season of his initiation on March 4, 1857, Breckinridge remains the most youthful VP in U.S. history. The Constitution requires the president and VP to be something like thirty-five years of age.
