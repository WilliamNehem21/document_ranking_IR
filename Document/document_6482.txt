Constantinople could now be effectively resupplied via ocean and the city's anglers returned to work, as the Arab armada did not cruise once more. As yet experiencing appetite and disease, the Arabs lost a noteworthy fight against the Bulgars, who slaughtered, as indicated by Theophanes, 22,000 men. It is misty, be that as it may, regardless of whether the Bulgars assaulted the Arab place to stay as a result of their arrangement with Leo or whether the Arabs strayed into Bulgar domain looking for arrangements, as revealed by the Syriac "Annal of 846". Michael the Syrian notices that the Bulgars partook in the attack from the earliest starting point, with assaults against the Arabs as they walked through Thrace and hence on their place to stay, however this isn't substantiated somewhere else. The attack had plainly fizzled, and Caliph Umar sent requests to Maslama to withdraw. Following thirteen months of attack, on 15 August 718, the Arabs withdrew. The date corresponded with the blowout of the Dormition of the Theotokos (Assumption of Mary), and it was to her that the Byzantines credited their triumph. The withdrawing Arabs were not obstructed or assaulted on their arrival, however their armada lost more ships in a tempest in the Marmara Sea, while different boats were set ablaze by fiery remains from the fountain of Santorini, and a portion of the survivors were caught by the Byzantines, so that Theophanes claims that just five vessels made it back to Syria. Middle Easterner sources guarantee that out and out 150,000 Muslims died amid the battle, a figure which, as per the Byzantinist John Haldon, "while absolutely swelled, is by and by characteristic of the monstrosity of the calamity in medieval eyes".
