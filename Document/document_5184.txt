In 1955, when Go Man Go was a two-year-old, A.B. Green boasted that he expected to purchase the pony from Ferguson. Despite the fact that Ferguson did not have any desire to sell, he believed he needed to at any rate set a cost. In the wake of hearing gossipy tidbits that Green was set up with a clerk's check for $40,000 (roughly $ starting at 2019), Ferguson set the cost at $42,000 money (around $ starting at 2019) and twenty-oneÃÂ breedings to the stallion. Amazingly, Green had that a lot of money accessible; Ferguson felt constrained to sell Go Man Go. After two years, at a Los Alamitos race meet, Green guaranteed that his most up to date horse, Double Bid, could outrace Go Man Go. This angered Ferguson, who had quite recently entered Go Man Go's full sibling Mr Mackay in a race with Double Bid. Ferguson wager Green $42,000 (around $ starting at 2019) against Go Man Go that Mr Mackay would beat Double Bid in the up and coming race. Mr Mackay won the race, and Ferguson recaptured responsibility for Man Go. Later in 1960, in light of the fact that he likewise claimed Go Man Go's full sibling, father, and mother, he sold Go Man Go to Frank Vessels Sr. furthermore, Bill and Harriet Peckham for $125,000 (roughly $ starting at 2019). Afterward, be that as it may, each of the three steeds held by Ferguson kicked the bucket rashly.
