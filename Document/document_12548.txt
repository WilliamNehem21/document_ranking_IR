In the wake of completing "Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg" (2003), Sonic Team started to design its next task. Among the thoughts the group was thinking about was an amusement with a sensible tone and a propelled material science motor. At the point when Sega reassigned the group to begin chipping away at another amusement in the smash hit "Sonic" arrangement, they chose to hold the sensible methodology. "Sonic the Hedgehog" was imagined for 6th era comforts, yet Sonic Team understood its discharge would agree with the arrangement's fifteenth commemoration and chose to create it for seventh era consoles, for example, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Arrangement co-maker and foreman Yuji Naka needed the primary "Sonic" diversion for seventh era frameworks to be a reboot of the establishment. Naka noticed the achievement of hero movies, for example, "Arachnid Man 2" (2004) and "Batman Begins" (2005)Ã¢ÂÂ which contacted a group of people a long ways past fanatics of the funnies those movies depended onÃ¢ÂÂand needed to emulate this achievement. In this manner, improvement of "Sonic the Hedgehog" started in late 2004. Sonic Team chose to utilize a similar title as the first 1991 diversion that had propelled the establishment to demonstrate that it would be a noteworthy development from the past recreations.
