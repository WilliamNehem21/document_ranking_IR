At the point when the Admiral passed on following 46 years of dealing with the bequest it was sold for ÃÂ£250,000, in spite of the clearance of some of the grounds initially incorporated into it. The house fell into decay under the responsibility for Arthur, the 6th and last laird, who had acquired his dad's way of life. The whole bequest was put available in September 1909 yet stayed unsold until after the First World War; the house and what survived from the domain were at long last acquired by a theorist, Edgar Fairweather, from London in 1926. Fairweather purchased a few other Scottish bequests, including those close-by at Auchmeddan and Strichen; he constantly diminished the domains into littler property that he at that point sold on or leased. The house was sold to an Aberdeen building organization and was obliterated at some point somewhere in the range of 1927 and 1930. After destruction, the chateau's veranda was introduced at the front of Kinloch Farmhouse in St Fergus. Different stays from the manor have been found at the farmhouse, including a peak over the center entryway and tiles engraved with the Ferguson of Pitfour family peak. The stone from the manor was transported to Aberdeen and used to build Torry Junior Secondary School.
