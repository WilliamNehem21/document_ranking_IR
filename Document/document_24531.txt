Following CortÃ©s' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of NojpetÃ©n for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from MÃ©rida in YucatÃ¡n on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central PetÃ©n. BartolomÃ© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. AndrÃ©s Carrillo de PernÃ­a, a "Criollo" who was the "alcalde" of Bacalar (a colonial official), joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipuj, returning to Bacalar once he was certain of the friars receiving a good welcome there. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan EkÊ¼. They stayed at NojpetÃ©n for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan EkÊ¼ refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan EkÊ¼ informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert. In the time since CortÃ©s had visited NojpetÃ©n, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left NojpetÃ©n on friendly terms with Kan EkÊ¼.
