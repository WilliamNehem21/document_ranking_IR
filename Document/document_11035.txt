The Nationalists lost eleven seats and their dominant part in the House of Representatives in the decision of 1922. Just three of these seats were gotten by the Labor Party however, Labor still did not have the numbers to frame government in their own right. Or maybe, a breakaway enemy of Hughes Liberal Party took five government seats, while the Country Party expanded their number to 14 and now held the parity of intensity. The main politically practical alternative for the Nationalists to remain in office was to go to a concurrence with the Country Party. Notwithstanding, Country Party pioneer Earle Page would not bolster a Nationalist government with Hughes as head administrator, and arrangements all through January and February neglected to break the impasse. Instead of hazard being vanquished in the assembly, which may have brought about the Governor-General requesting that Labor structure government, Hughes astounded his associates by declaring his expectation to leave on 2 February. With agent pioneer Walter Massy-Greene having lost his seat at the 1922 decision, Hughes currently sent for Bruce to take over as pioneer of the gathering. After some hesitance, Bruce at long last concurred, despite the fact that Hughes later lamented the choice and wound up one of the new leader's most candid depreciators.
