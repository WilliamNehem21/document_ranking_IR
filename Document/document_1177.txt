The resistances of the main slope stronghold were reconstructed on somewhere around one event; the discard was developed by . The ruin from re-burrowing the discard was saved on the back of the defense. In the meantime, the guards around the eastern passages were made progressively unpredictable. A bank and discard were worked outside the two passageways, and a bank was raised between them. The bank had a divider looked with limestone, which was brought from more than away. Sharples trusts this would have made an amazing passage and was a showing of the settlement's high status. The Early Iron Age prehistoric studies has been to a great extent wrecked because of later movement on the site. In any case, adjacent Poundbury and Chalbury date to a similar period, so through correlation it is conceivable to construe the Early Iron Age action at Maiden Castle. From parallels at these locales, Sharples finds that it was likely thickly involved, with discrete regions for home and capacity. Very little is thought about the material culture and economy of the Early Iron Age, and the scarcity of finds from this period at Maiden Castle makes it hard to make inferences about movement on the site.
