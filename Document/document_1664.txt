The red wattlebird gives off an impression of being a lasting inhabitant in a lot of its range, however its developments are ineffectively known. It has all the earmarks of being incompletely transient in Western Australia and the north shore of New South Wales. In southeastern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it seems to move to bring down elevations for winter. For example, winged animals empty the Brindabella Range over the cooler months. Generally speaking, little example is noticeable in the species' developments, however red wattlebirds seem to move to benefit from populaces of blossoming banksias and eucalypts, for example, winter-blooming banksias in Perth over the cooler months. Vast numbers touch base so as to benefit from blooming local apples ("Angophora") in Mudgee and Cobbora areas in focal western New South Wales, and on white box ("Eucalyptus albens") at Barrington in focal northern New South Wales. A predominantly inhabitant populace on the Swan Coastal Plain north of Perth is enhanced amid winter by all the more touching base from inland zones. South of Perth, red wattlebirds are all the more locally itinerant, moving to new fixes of sprouting wildflowers. East of Perth in zones around Kellerberin, Kwolyin and Nangeenan, the red wattlebird is available from late harvest time to spring, reproducing in August and September. Around Lake Grace, the red wattlebird is available all year.
