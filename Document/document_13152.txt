Wit is a key component in Wodehouse's composition. This can appear as plays on words, for example, in "Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit", when Bertie is discharged following a night in the police cells, and says that he has "a squeezed look" about him. Etymological disarray is another diverting component, for example, in "Uncle Dynamite" when Constable Potter says he has been "struck by the duck lake." In answer, Sir Aylmer, confounding the two implications of "by", asks: "How the fiend would you be able to be ambushed by a duck lake?" Wodehouse likewise utilizes representation and blended similitude to include humor. Some come through misrepresentation, for example, Bingo Little's baby tyke who "not just has the part of a mass killer, yet that of a mass killer experiencing an ingrown toenail", or Wooster's protest that "the uproars that Bobbie Wickham is as of now beginning might delight her, however not to the awful amphibians underneath the harrow whom she mercilessly dives into the soup." Bertie Wooster's half-overlooked vocabulary likewise gives a further funny gadget. In "Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit" Bertie asks Jeeves "Let a plugugly like youthful Thos free in the network with a cosh, and you are welcoming catastrophe andÃÂ ... what's the word? Something about felines." Jeeves answers, "Upheavals, sir?"
