The conference started with presentations from different lawful agents, including a legal counselor employed for Lucan by his mom. Thurston acquainted the jury with the case and clarified their obligations. He had chosen 33ÃÂ witnesses to be brought over the accompanying couple of days, including Veronica Lucan, who every day wore a dim coat and white headscarf. Thurston scrutinized her on her association with Lucan, her marriage, her money related issues, her work of Rivett and what had occurred the evening of the assault. The Dowager Countess' Queen's Counsel endeavored to get some information about the idea of their relationship, on the off chance that she despised her significant other, yet Thurston ruled his line of addressing forbidden. Lady Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken an announcement from Frances on 20ÃÂ November 1974, read the young lady's words to the court. Frances had heard a shout, and a couple of minutes after the fact had looked as her mom (blood all over) and father had gone into the room. Her mom had then sent her to bed. She later heard her dad requiring her mom, asking where she was, and looked as he left the washroom and strolled first floor. She likewise portrayed how Sandra Rivett did not typically take a shot at Thursday evenings.
