In June 1940, No.ÃÂ 12 Squadron was "ripped apart" to frame two extra units, Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin and No.ÃÂ 13 Squadron. No.ÃÂ 12 Squadron held its Wirraway flight, while its two flights of Ansons went to the new squadron; these were supplanted soon thereafter by progressively competent Lockheed Hudsons. Eaton was selected CO of the base, picking up advancement to transitory gathering skipper in September. His squadrons were utilized in escort, oceanic observation, and waterfront watch obligations, the exhausted airplane being sent to RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, after at regular intervals flying timeÃ¢ÂÂwith a resulting three-week misfortune from Darwin's qualityÃ¢ÂÂas profound support was not yet conceivable in the Northern Territory. Not long after the foundation of Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin, Minister for Air James Fairbairn visited the base. Steering his own light plane, he was welcomed by four Wirraways that continued to escort him into getting; the Minister along these lines complimented Eaton on the "sharp ness and proficiency everything being equal", especially thinking about the difficult condition. At the point when Fairbairn kicked the bucket in the Canberra air catastrophe in no time a while later, his pilot was Flight Lieutenant Robert Hitchcock, child of Bob Hitchcock of the "Kookaburra" and furthermore a previous individual from Eaton's No.ÃÂ 21 Squadron.
