At O Smach, FUNCINPEC-adjusted troops battled alongside the Khmer Rouge powers against CPP-adjusted troops until February 1998, when a truce expedited by the Japanese government happened. In March 1998, Ranariddh was indicted in absentia by a military court of unlawfully sneaking ammo in May 1997, and of plotting with the Khmer Rouge to cause shakiness in the nation. He was condemned to a sum of 35 years' detainment, yet this was invalidated by an acquittal from Sihanouk. Ranariddh came back to Cambodia toward the finish of March 1998 to lead FUNCINPEC's race crusade, which concentrated on ace monarchical assumptions and hostile to Vietnamese talk. FUNCINPEC confronted various snags, including absence of access to TV and radio channels which had gone under CPP's elite control following the 1997 conflicts, and the troubles of its supporters in getting the opportunity to party energizes. In the vote on 26 July 1998, FUNCINPEC surveyed 31.7 percent and verified 43 out of a sum of 122 parliamentary seats. The CPP won the races by surveying 41.4 percent everything being equal and verifying 64 parliamentary seats. The Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), Rainsy's renamed KNP, was in third spot with 14.3 percent of the vote and 15 parliamentary seats.
