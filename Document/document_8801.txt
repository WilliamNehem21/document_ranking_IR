After the finish of the First World War, the regiment continued interchange postings home and abroad. The first Battalion finished voyages through obligation in Ireland, where it caught the Irish republican SeÃÂ¡n Moylan, and Germany, which considered a home posting, and came back to the UK in 1923. Then, the second Battalion was presented on India, with a five-month break in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 while warring Chinese groups compromised the Shanghai International Settlement. In 1928, the second Battalion came back to the UK and the first Battalion was posted abroad, serving three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before winding up in Burma in 1938. Incited by worries of an Italian attack following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the second Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, coming back to the UK in January 1937. The next year, the fifth Battalion turned into the regiment's sole regional unit when the fourth Battalion was changed over to the 66th Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery (RA), and the sixth Battalion changed over to the 44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment. On the eve of the Second World War, the Territorial Army (TA), as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was multiplied in size, and the seventh Battalion was made in August 1939 as the second-line copy of the fifth Battalion.
