A Joint RAN-USN Board of Inquiry was built up to explore the occurrence, and was in session over June and July 1969. The Board discovered "Evans" halfway to blame for the impact, yet in addition blamed "Melbourne" for not making equivocal move sooner, despite the fact that universal ocean guidelines managed that in the number one spot up to a crash, the bigger ship was required to keep up course and speed. It was found out amid the request that "Evans" leader was snoozing in his quarters at the season of the episode, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the previous had fizzled the capability test to stand watch, while the last was adrift out of the blue. Consequent to the request, the three USN officers and Stevenson were court-martialled by their separate naval forces on charges of carelessness, with the three USN officers discovered blameworthy and Stevenson 'Respectably Acquitted'. Regardless of the discoveries, Stevenson's next posting was as a minor banner officer's head of staff, seen by him as a downgrade in everything except name. In a rehash of the result of the "Voyager" crash, "Melbourne"s chief surrendered in the midst of allegations of scapegoating. In December 2012, Stevenson declared that he had gotten a letter from the Minister for Defense, saying 'sorry' for his treatment by the RAN and the legislature of the day.
