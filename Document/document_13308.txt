For a large portion of the war, Poulenc was in Paris, giving presentations with Bernac, focusing on French tunes. Under Nazi principle he was in a helpless position, as a known gay (Destouches barely kept away from capture and expelling), yet in his music he made numerous signals of disobedience of the Germans. He set to music stanzas by writers noticeable in the French Resistance, including Aragon and ÃÂluard. In "Les Animaux modÃÂ¨les", debuted at the OpÃÂ©ra in 1942, he incorporated the tune, rehashed a few times, of the counter German melody "Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine". He was an organizer individual from the Front National (pour musique) which the Nazi experts saw with doubt for its relationship with prohibited performers, for example, Milhaud and Paul Hindemith. In 1943 he composed a cantata for unaccompanied twofold choir planned for Belgium, "Figure humaine", setting eight of ÃÂluard's ballads. The work, finishing with "LibertÃÂ©", couldn't be given in France while the Germans were in charge; its first execution was communicated from a BBC studio in London in March 1945, and it was not sung in Paris until 1947. The music pundit of "The Times" later composed that the work "is among the best choral works within recent memory and in itself expels Poulenc from the class of "petit maÃÂ®tre" to which numbness has for the most part been substance to consign him."
