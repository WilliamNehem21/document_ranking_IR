The PanzerÃÂ I's execution in defensively covered battle was constrained by its flimsy protection and light weapon of two automatic weapons, which were never planned for use against heavily clad targets, rather being perfect for infantry concealment, in accordance with between war convention. As a structure planned for preparing, the PanzerÃÂ I was less able than some other contemporary light tank structures, for example, the Soviet T-26, in spite of the fact that it was still moderately progressed contrasted with more established structures, for example, the Renault FT, still in administration in a few countries, and others. Albeit ailing in defensively covered battle as a tank, it framed an extensive piece of Germany's automated powers and was utilized in every single real crusade between September 1939 and December 1941, where despite everything it performed much helpful administration against settled in infantry and other "delicate" targets, which were unfit to react even against meager protective layer, and who were very defenseless against assault rifle shoot. The little, defenseless light tank, alongside its to some degree all the more dominant successor the Panzer II, would before long be outperformed as a bleeding edge protected battle vehicle by increasingly incredible German tanks, for example, the Panzer III, and later the Panzer IV, Panzer V, and Panzer VI; by and by, the PanzerÃÂ I's commitment to the early triumphs of Nazi Germany amid World War II was critical. Later in that war the turrets of a considerable lot of the then-outdated PzKpfw Is and PzKpfw IIs were repurposed as firearm turrets on extraordinarily assembled cautious shelters, especially on the Atlantic Wall.
