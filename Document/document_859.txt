In 1903, Poundstone's plans started accepting consideration from American maritime specialists. Subsequent to being refined by Washington Irving Chambers, Poundstone's work was conveyed to the Naval War College, where it was tried in war diversions amid the 1903 Newport Conference. The outcomes showed that a hypothetical war vessel that abstained from the middle of the road 8-and 7-inch combat hardware and was furnished with just twelve 11-or 12-inch weapons, all ready to discharge on a solitary broadside, was worth "three" of the ships at that point in administration. As indicated by the men who led the tests, the primary thinking for the finding was that the proportion of compelling weapon ranges was legitimately identified with the greatest length of a foe's torpedo extend. As of now, the last was generally ; at that separate, the 7-and 8-inch weapons regular to American moderate batteries would not have the capacity to infiltrate the covering of adversary war vessels. More awful still, it was sure thatÃ¢ÂÂas the United States was building up a torpedoÃ¢ÂÂfirearm range would need to ascend sooner rather than later, making the middle of the road weapons even less valuable. Notwithstanding, a homogeneous principle battery of 11-or 12-inch weapons would almost certainly infiltrate the protection and have adequate touchy capacity to handicap an adversary capital ship, and including whatever number firearms as could be allowed would give a solid safeguard against torpedo-conveying however unarmored destroyers. As it turned out, occasions in the Russo-Japanese War before long demonstrated that maritime fights could be battled at fundamentally more noteworthy separations than had been suspected conceivable.
