Coleridge and William Wordsworth were dear companions and teammates; when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy relocated to the Lake District in late 1799 it was, in Bott's assertion, inescapable that Coleridge would go with the same pattern. A half year after the Wordsworths moved into Dove Cottage at Grasmere, Coleridge rented Greta Hall in Keswick, away. In 1803 Robert Southey, Coleridge's brother by marriage, consented to impart the house to Coleridge and his family. Southey stayed at Greta Hall after Coleridge left in 1804, and it remained Southey's family home until his demise in 1843. Numerous acclaimed scholarly figures remained at Greta Hall in these years, including the Wordsworths, Charles and Mary Lamb, Thomas de Quincey, William Hazlitt, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Sir Walter Scott. Sheep, a Londoner committed to his local city, stayed far fetched of the attractions of the Lake District, yet a large portion of the guests to Greta Hall composed persuasively of the magnificence of the view, and further upgraded the open respect for, and want to visit, the region. Southey was all around respected locally, yet had little impact in the life of the town. He is covered in Crosthwaite churchyard and there is a commemoration to him inside the congregation, with an engraving composed by Wordsworth.
