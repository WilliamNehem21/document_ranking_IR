Goya did not title any of the 14 "Black Paintings"; their modern names came about after his death. They are not inscribed, mentioned in his letters, and there are no records of him speaking of them. The works today are known by a variety of titles, most of which date to around the 1860s: his children were largely responsible for the names, with close friend Bernardo de Iriarte contributing the rest. The title "El Gran CabrÃ³n" ("The Great He-Goat") was given by painter Antonio Brugada (1804â1863). The Basque term for a Witches' Sabbath, "akelarre", is the source of the Spanish title "Aquelarre" and a derivation of "akerra", the Basque word for a male goat, which may have been combined with the word "larre" ("field") to arrive at "akelarre".
The historical record of Goya's later life is relatively scant; no accounts of his thoughts from this time survive. He deliberately suppressed a number of his works from this period Â â most notably the "Disasters of War" seriesÂ â which are today considered amongst his finest. He was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness, the latter possibly from anxiety caused by an undiagnosed illness that left him deaf from the early 1790s. Goya had been a successful and royally placed artist, but withdrew from public life during his final years. From the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside Madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio. The house had become known as "La Quinta del Sordo" (The House of the Deaf Man), after the nearest farmhouse had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man.
