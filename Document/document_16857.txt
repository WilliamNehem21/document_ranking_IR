After completing the reconstruction, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was assigned to the Reserve Formation of the Baltic, spending most of the year out of service. She was reactivated for the annual fleet maneuvers in August and September 1910 with what had since been reorganized as the "Hochseeflotte" (High Seas Fleet). The ship was recommissioned on 2 August and assigned to the III Battle Squadron, serving as the flagship of "Vizeadmiral" Max Rollmann, who came aboard four days later. The squadron was disbanded after the maneuvers on 8 September, and "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned again on 15 September. The ship spent most of 1911 in reserve as well, being activated only for the annual fleet maneuvers. After recommissioning on 31 July, she briefly served as the flagship of the deputy commander of the III Squadron, "Konteradmiral" Heinrich SaÃ. The ships initially trained individually before joining the rest of the fleet on 17 August. The maneuvers lasted until 11 September, after which "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned yet again. This proved to be the last time the ship would be activated before the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. She and her sister ships were removed from the Reserve Formation in May 1912, having been replaced by the "Wittelsbach"-class vessels.
