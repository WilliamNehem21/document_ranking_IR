The cricket essayist A. A. Thompson relates an alternate story advised to him fifty years after the fact by Hirst, who played in the match. As per this record, Hirst was eating when Peel came in alcoholic. On edge that Peel would be seen, and stressed over bringing the group into notoriety, Hirst constrained Peel to come back to bed and went to the ground, where he told Lord Hawke that Peel had become sick in the night and would not have the capacity to play. Hawke guaranteed to see Peel that night and took the twelfth man onto the field. As indicated by Thompson, when Hirst went onto the field, he saw "with unfolding alarm that there were not eleven fieldsmen present but rather twelve. There, his face red, his top amiss, the ball in his grasp, stood Peel". Strip was much more tanked than at breakfast, and Hawke requested him from the field. Strip answered that he was fine, and as indicated by Hirst bowled a ball to exhibit his wellness, however in his perplexity did as such off course. Strip was then driven from the field. Subsequent to nodding off in the lodging, he was prompted by Hirst to apologize to Lord Hawke, however cannot, asserting that he was fundamental to the group and would be reviewed.
