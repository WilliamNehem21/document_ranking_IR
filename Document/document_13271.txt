An official review in October 1950 detailed that it would not be hard to improve the old street into a sensible track, which would then have a superior possibility of pulling in help from Main Roads. The Mandurah Road Board burned through ÃÂ£1200 out and about, while the Harvey Road Board mentioned a ÃÂ£500 allow from Main Roads for their bit of the street. After two years little advancement had been made, and Main Roads thusly would not support feeder streets to associate with Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had stopped as Main Roads trusted that the current, twisting course around the estuary was excessively inclined to flooding. Pioneers in the zone reviewed it never flooding already, and the Mandurah Road Board was worried that should another street be fabricated, they would in any case need to keep up the old street for access to properties. The street was examined by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Filter, and the locale engineer H. A. Smith. They demonstrated that another street would likely intently pursue the old street, however that a nitty gritty overview would be required. Close-by limestone stores would be reasonable for the street's establishment, with the expense assessed at ÃÂ£11 per chain.
