After the demise of Henry II, and the promotion of Richard as lord, the priests of Christ Church Priory appealed to Richard to mediate in the long-running question among them and the ecclesiastical overseer. In November 1189, Richard and the entire court, including the Queen Mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, made a trip to Canterbury trying to end the debate before the papacy become included. Richard at last settled the debate by influencing Baldwin to desert his congregation building venture and to reject Norreys. Not long after this, Richard left England and Baldwin announced that he was going to establish the proposed church at Lambeth, and afterward join Richard on campaign. Both Richard and Baldwin consented to choose Norreys to Evesham Abbey, as the past abbot of Evesham, Adam of Evesham, had as of late kicked the bucket. This arrangement in the end drove, after Baldwin's demise, to the Case of Evesham. In August 1189 Baldwin protested the marriage of Prince John, later King John, to Isabel of Gloucester, on the grounds of affiliation. John guaranteed to acquire an ecclesiastical regulation, yet never did as such. Baldwin laid John's properties under forbid, yet it was lifted by an ecclesiastical legate who proclaimed the marriage legitimate. Richard additionally reestablished to the diocese supervisors of Canterbury the privilege to work a mint, staffed by three moneyers.
