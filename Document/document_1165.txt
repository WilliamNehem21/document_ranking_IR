The MSHD began contemplates for an expressway directing of USÃÂ 31 from the state line northward to I-94 of every 1967. The main area northward to Niles was affirmed in 1972, and the rest of the course was endorsed in 1981. From that point forward, MDOT reexamined the St. Joseph Valley Parkway augmentation east of Benton Harbor, because of ecological, financial, and verifiable site issues. One of the natural worries that was contemplated identifies with the living space of a jeopardized species, the Mitchell's satyr butterfly, which has its living space in the territory of the proposed interstate. The natural surroundings is home to the second-biggest populace of the uncommon butterfly. The interstate among Niles and Benton Harbor was arranged as a progression of five fragments when endorsed in 1981. Since that endorsement, the butterfly was found in the Blue Creek Fen in the late 1980s, and it was recorded as an imperiled species in 1992. This posting slowed down MDOT's arranging and development of the fifth interstate portion north of Berrien Springs. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued a sentiment two years after the fact that the venture would endanger the species. MDOT was offered consent to change the recently endorsed turnpike to cross the Blue Creek on longer scaffolds; the USFWS likewise necessitated that any development be done from raised stages, among different confinements. Meanwhile, MDOT continued with development of the southern bit of the last interstate fragment, finishing it northward from Berrien Springs to the Napier Avenue trade in August 2003.
