The upgrades made amid the main recreation expanded "FusÃÂ"s draft by , drenching the two premier six-inch weapons, so they were evacuated amid the primary period of the ship's second modernization in 1937 and 1938. Amid this equivalent stage, the Type 93 automatic rifles were supplanted by eight 25ÃÂ mm Type 96 light AA weapons in twin-firearm mounts. Four of these mounts were fitted on the forward superstructure, one on each side of the pipe and two on the back superstructure. This was the standard Japanese light AA firearm amid World War II, however it experienced extreme structure inadequacies that rendered it a to a great extent inadequate weapon. As per student of history Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts "needed adequate speed in train or height; the firearm sights were unfit to deal with quick focuses on; the weapon showed over the top vibration; the magazine was excessively little, and, at long last, the weapon created inordinate gag impact". The setup of the AA firearms changed altogether; in July 1943, 17 single and two twin-mounts were included for an aggregate of 37. In July 1944, the ship was fitted with extra AA firearms: 23 single, six twin and eight triple-mounts, for an aggregate of 95 in her last setup. These weapons had a compelling scope of , and a successful roof of at a height of +85 degrees. The most extreme successful rate of flame was just somewhere in the range of 110 and 120 rounds for every moment in light of the incessant need to change the fifteen-round magazines.
