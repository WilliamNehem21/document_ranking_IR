Walk 1917 saw the heaviest besieging effort completed by the squadron to date; shy of its customary weapons, the pilots extemporized by dropping howitzer shells on Turkish powers along the GazaÃ¢ÂÂ Beersheba line. Amid one such mission on 20ÃÂ March, Lieutenant Frank McNamara earned the Victoria Cross for finding his Martinsyde in the desert under foe fire and safeguarding an individual pilot whose B.E.2 had been constrained down. On 26ÃÂ March, No.ÃÂ 1 Squadron partook in the First Battle of Gaza; it endured its first battle demise the following day, when one of its B.E.2s was assaulted by a German Rumpler. The unit took an interest in the Second Battle of Gaza on 19ÃÂ April; like its antecedent, the assault was a disappointment for the Allies. Williams, later known as the "Father of the RAAF", expected direction of the squadron in May. Two B.E.12s were conveyed that month; like the Martinsydes, they were equipped with a forward-terminating automatic rifle and utilized as escorts for the B.E.2s. By June, mechanical issues brought about by sweltering summer climate and the risk from new German Albatros scouts were rendering the B.E.2s to a great extent ineffectual, and Williams critically mentioned more current models. Present day airplane were in the long run conveyed, first the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in October, and after that the Bristol F.2 Fighter in December. "Presently out of the blue," composed Williams, "following 17 months in the field we had flying machine with which we could manage our adversary noticeable all around."
