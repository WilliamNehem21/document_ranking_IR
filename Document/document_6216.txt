Lindemann and LÃÂ¼tjens now contrasted on how best to proceed with the mission. Lindemann, as authority of a warship, was guided by the strategic circumstance, and needed to chase down the harmed "Sovereign of Wales". (The Germans did not around then realize the ship to be "Sovereign of Wales", yet realized that it was a war vessel.) LÃÂ¼tjens, clearly aware of the armada request to maintain a strategic distance from superfluous contact with comparable foe units, dismissed this without discourse. Lindemann and LÃÂ¼tjens likewise contrasted on where to take the ship for fixes; Lindemann supported following their course through the Denmark Strait and coming back to Bergen, Norway. LÃÂ¼tjens overruled him and requested a course set for Saint-Nazaire, France. Toward the evening, Admiral LÃÂ¼tjens requested "Prinz Eugen" to split far from "Bismarck" and work autonomously against the foe's trader shipping. "Prinz Eugen" and "Bismarck" isolated at 18:14 that night. "Prinz Eugen" arrived securely at Brest, France on 1 June 1941. No immediate observers to this distinction of sentiment endure the sinking, however "Matrosengefreiter" (Leading Seaman) Heinz Staat, the helmsman on the extension, recollected a phone call between the First Watch Officer, Commander Hans Oels, and an armada staff officer which recommended that Lindemann had been endeavoring to convince LÃÂ¼tjens to seek after the adversary. A courier coming back to his confidants beneath discussed ""dicke Luft"" ("thick air" or a "terrible environment") on the scaffold.
