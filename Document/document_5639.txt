Murphy featured in "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" (2006), a film about the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and turned into the best Irish free film at the Irish film industry. Murphy was particularly excited about showing up in the film because of his cozy associations with Cork, Ireland, where the film was shot. Murphy needed to try out multiple times for the job of Damien O'Donovan, a youthful specialist turned progressive, before winning the part. Murphy thought of it as an exceptional benefit to have been given the job and expressed that he was "immensely pleased" of the film, commenting that the "recollections run, very deepÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ the legislative issues, the divisions and everyone has accounts of relatives who were made up for lost time in the battle." Critic Denby noticed Murphy's snapshots of profound stillness and eccentricities in depicting the character. Kenneth Turan of the "Los Angeles Times" composed that "Murphy is particularly great at playing the fanaticism just as the spirit seeking and the lament, at demonstrating to us a man who is eaten up alive in light of the fact that he's compelled to act in manners that are in opposition to his experience and his preparation." "GQ UK" gave Murphy its 2006 Actor of the Year grant for his work in "The Wind That Shakes the Barley".
