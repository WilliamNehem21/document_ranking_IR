With the idea of gravity and round stages being the focal components of interactivity, the improvement group drafted a few thoughts on the most proficient method to actualize them into the diversion. Koichi Hayashida, a co-architect of the diversion, at first communicated wariness of consolidating a round playing field into a bounce based stage amusement, expressing that it would be "a terrible match". Shimizu likewise had a negative response to the thought, with his fundamental concern being that the usage of round stages would be difficult to accomplish because of specialized reasons, and "felt a feeling of risk" when the arrangement was in the end endorsed. Be that as it may, once Shimizu began troubleshooting the amusement he understood that the experience felt "absolutely crisp" and imagined that he was "playing a diversion like nothing that is preceded it". Futoshi Shirai, the amusement's dimension planner, expressed that not at all like Hayashida and Shimizu, he had a positive impression of the new interactivity components. Shirai loved having the capacity to keep running on various kinds of planetoids, and thought of structures, for example, planets in the state of dessert and apples. Since the diversion was in space, the group could devise thoughts that would have generally been difficult to actualize in other "Super Mario" amusements. Shirai said that the advantage of working with a round molded world was that they could structure and find new things, with Kenta Motokura, the amusement's craftsman, comparatively expressing that the player would be ceaselessly making the most of their experience by going to new planets. Koizumi valued the "free and open" feel of building up the amusement, saying that it empowered the group to make the diversion increasingly a good time for the player.
