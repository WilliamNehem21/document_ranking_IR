Kiedis was melodiously impacted by affection, his sweetheart, and the feelings communicated when one experienced passionate feelings for. Melodies composed for the collection, for example, "Incidentally," "I Could Die for You," "Dosed," "Warm Tape" and non-collection tracks "Somebody" and "Waterway" all strayed into the numerous sides of affection. Medications additionally had an essential impact in Kiedis' works, as he'd just been calm since December 2000. Tracks like "This Is the Place" and "Remember Me" communicated his serious association with opiates, the unsafe physical and enthusiastic impacts they caused him and the ever-present peril of backslide (as Kiedis has endured unending backslide into medication reliance). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in "This Is the Place" and depicts how sedate utilize constrained him to miss the burial service: "On the day my closest companion kicked the bucket/I couldn't get my copper clean." "Venice Queen" was made melodiously as a tribute to Kiedis' medication recovery specialist, Gloria Scott, who passed on not long after he obtained her a home on California's Venice Beach. It grieved her demise as an excruciating misfortune: "We as a whole need to advise her/Tell her that we cherish her/Venice gets a ruler/Best I've at any point seen."
