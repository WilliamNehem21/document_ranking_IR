The sixth Division had been shaped in September 1939 as a feature of an expeditionary power, the Second Australian Imperial Force. Leader Robert Menzies requested that all directions in the division were to go to reservists instead of to ordinary officers, who had been freely reproachful of the safeguard approaches of conservative government officials. These approaches supported the Royal Australian Navy, which got most of safeguard spending in the interwar period. The outcome was that when war came, the Army's gear was of World War I vintage, and its manufacturing plants were just fit for delivering little arms. Luckily, these World War I-period little arms, the LeeÃ¢ÂÂ Enfield rifle and the Vickers automatic weapon, were strong and dependable weapons that would stay in administration all through the war; they were expanded by the later Bren light assault rifle. Most other hardware was out of date and would need to be supplanted, however new production lines were required to create the most recent things, for example, 3-inch mortars, 25-pounders and engine vehicles, and War Cabinet endorsement for their development was moderate in coming. The sixth Division's preparation in Palestine, while "enthusiastic and sensible", was in this way hampered by deficiencies of hardware. These deficiencies were slowly helped by conveyances from British sources. So also, No. 3 Squadron RAAF must be sent to the Middle East without air ship or gear, which must be provided by the Royal Air Force, to the detriment of its own squadrons.
