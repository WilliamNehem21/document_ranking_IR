Not long after the port gatekeeper pontoon's takeoff, the port quarter watercraft, with around twelve ladies and five team on board, was being prepared for bringing down into the water when it, as well, was surged by individuals from the group. In the general scuffle the watercraft was overturned, sending everything except three of its inhabitants into the water, where they suffocated. On the opposite side of the ship, Luce requested Second Officer Baalham to dispatch the starboard watchman watercraft and continue with it to the stern, where ladies and youngsters travelers would be passed down. No sooner was it propelled when it was overpowered by men, who jumped into the water and scrambled into the pontoon; everything except one of these were group individuals. With his vessel presently full, Baalham neglected Luce's guidelines to get ladies and kids, and floated away. In the interim, the overturned port quarter vessel had been corrected, yet in spite of Luce's endeavors to give ladies travelers need, it was again hurried by group and male travelers, who push aside the holding up ladies and cut the pontoon unfastened from the ship while it was just incompletely filled.
