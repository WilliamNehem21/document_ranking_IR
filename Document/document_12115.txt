English generation organization Granada TV moved toward Ray Davies toward the beginning of January 1969, communicating enthusiasm for building up a film or play for TV. Davies was to work together with essayist Julian Mitchell on the "exploratory" program, with a soundtrack by the Kinks to be discharged on a going with LP. Understandings were settled on 8 January, yet the venture was not uncovered until an official statement on 10 March. Independently, the Kinks started chip away at the program's friend record, entitled "Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)". Advancement of "Arthur" happened amid a harsh period for the band, because of the business disappointment of their past collection "The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society" and the resulting single, "Plastic Man", just as the flight of establishing part and bassist Pete Quaife. In mid 1969, Quaife had told the band he was stopping, however different individuals did not pay attention to the comment. At the point when an article in the "New Musical Express" referenced Maple Oak, the band that he had shaped without the remainder of the Kinks' learning, Davies ineffectively approached Quaife to return for the up and coming sessions of "Arthur". As a substitution, Davies called up bassist John Dalton, who had recently filled in for Quaife.
