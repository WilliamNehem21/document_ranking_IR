In 1958, the Bureau of Ships prepared two feasibility studies to explore whether "Alaska" and "Guam" could be suitably converted into guided-missile cruisers. The first study involved removing all of the guns in favor of four different missile systems. At $160Â million, the cost of this proposed removal was seen as prohibitive, so a second study was initiated. The study left the forward batteries (the two 12-inch triple turrets and three of the 5-inch dual turrets) unchanged, and added a reduced version of the first plan on the stern of the ship. Even though the proposals would have cost approximately half as much as the first study's plan ($82Â million), it was still seen as too expensive. As a result, both ships were stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. "Alaska" was sold for scrap on 30 June 1960, and "Guam" on 24 May 1961.
The still-incomplete was considered for a conversion to be the Navy's first guided-missile cruiser; this thought lasted until 26 February 1952, when a different conversion to a "large command ship" was contemplated. In anticipation of the conversion, her classification was changed to CBC-1. This would have made her a "larger sister" to , but a year and a half later (9 October 1954) she was re-designated CB-3. "Hawaii" was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 June 1958 and was sold for scrap in 1959.
