Charles IX kicked the bucket in 1574 and the Duke of Anjou acquired the French honored position as Henry III. Somewhere in the range of 1578 and 1581 the Queen restored endeavors to arrange a marriage with Henry III's most youthful sibling, the Duke of AlenÃÂ§on, who had put himself forward as a defender of the Huguenots and a potential chief of the Dutch. Walsingham was sent to France in mid-1581 to talk about an Anglo-French collusion, yet the French needed the marriage concurred first and Walsingham was under guidance to get a bargain before focusing on the marriage. He came back to England without an understanding. By and by, Walsingham contradicted the marriage, maybe to the point of empowering open restriction. AlenÃÂ§on was a Catholic and as his senior sibling, Henry III, was childless, he was beneficiary to the French honored position. Elizabeth was past the period of childbearing and had no unmistakable successor. On the off chance that she kicked the bucket while wedded to the French beneficiary, her domains could fall under French control. By contrasting the match of Elizabeth and AlenÃÂ§on with the match of the Protestant Henry of Navarre and the Catholic Margaret of Valois, which happened in the week prior to the St. Bartholomew's Day slaughter, the "most appalling display" he had ever seen, Walsingham raised the apparition of religious mobs in England in case of the marriage continuing. Elizabeth endure his unpolished, frequently unwelcome, counsel, and recognized his solid convictions in a letter, in which she called him "her Moor [who] can't change his shading".
