The skull was very extensive in extent to the remainder of its body. It quantifies long in the "C. nasicornis" holotype, estimated from the tip of the nose to the , which interfaces with the primary cervical vertebra. The width of this skull is hard to recreate, as it is intensely contorted, and Gilmore's 1920 reproduction was later observed to be excessively wide. The genuinely total skull of example MWC 1 was assessed to have been long and in width; this skull was fairly more prolonged than that of the holotype. The back of the skull was more daintily worked than in some other bigger theropods because of broad skull openings, yet the jaws were profound to help the relatively substantial teeth. The lacrimal bone shaped not just the back edge of the antorbital fenestra, a huge opening among eye and , yet in addition part of its upper edge, dissimilar to in individuals from the related Abelisauridae. The quadrate bone, which was associated with the lower jaw at its base end to shape the jaw joint, was slanted so the jaw joint was dislodged in reverse in connection to the occipital condyle. This additionally prompted an expanding of the base of the horizontal worldly fenestra, a vast opening behind the eyes.
