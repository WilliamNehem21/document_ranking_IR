Hershkovitz and Ray's order was never generally pursued, and from 1976 on creators began to restore a portion of different gatherings lumped in "Oryzomys" as independent genera. The variety was decreased to 43ÃÂ species (out of 110 in Oryzomyini) in the third version (2005) of "Well evolved creature Species of the World", however it was as yet not a characteristic, monophyletic gathering; rather, it generally joined those oryzomyines that came up short on the obvious specializations of other genera. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler's complete phylogenetic examination created additional proof that the class was polyphyletic, as types of "Oryzomys" were scattered everywhere throughout the oryzomyine tree. He suggested that eleven new genera ought to be made to oblige those species that were not firmly identified with the sort types of "Oryzomys", the bog rice rodent; he considered different choices that would require less new genera, yet contended that that would result in less important variety level gatherings in Oryzomyini. Later around the same time, Weksler, Percequillo, and Voss made ten new generaÃ¢ÂÂ"Aegialomys", "Cerradomys", "Eremoryzomys", "Euryoryzomys", "Hylaeamys", "Mindomys", "Nephelomys", "Oreoryzomys", "Sooretamys", and "Transandinomys"Ã¢ÂÂ for species earlier put in "Oryzomys" and put six additional species identified with ""Oryzomys" alfaroi" in "Handleyomys" pending the depiction of all the more new genera for them. They left just five species in "Oryzomys", which was presently at last a characteristic, monophyletic gathering. As a result of consequent ordered work, the quantity of species has since expanded to no less than eight.
