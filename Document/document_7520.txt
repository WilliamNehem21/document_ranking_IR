The second bill looked for consent for augmentations east and west from the endorsed course. The eastern expansion was to veer from the fundamental course quickly west of Piccadilly Circus station, which was to be extended to have east and westward stages on the two lines. The augmentation was then to go under Leicester Square to a station at Charing Cross. Proceeding with eastwards under Strand, the passages were to cross under the branch from Holborn, with a trade at Strand station. The line was then to proceed under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus, where a station was to be developed to exchange with the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's Ludgate Hill station (since pulverized). It would then continue south under New Bridge Street, and east under Queen Victoria Street, to associate with the DR's proposed profound dimension line west of Mansion House station. The western expansion was to separate from the affirmed course at Albert Gate, east of Knightsbridge station. This station was to have extra stages on the new branch line which would travel west under Knightsbridge, Kensington Road and Kensington High Street, with stations at the Royal Albert Hall, the DR's High Street Kensington station and Addison Road. The passages were then to pursue Hammersmith Road to the DR's Hammersmith station. There they would turn north under Hammersmith Grove and east under Goldhawk Road, to end on the south side of Shepherd's Bush Green close to the CLR's Shepherd's Bush end.
