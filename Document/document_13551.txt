The folio and the outlined Shakespeare release were "by a wide margin the biggest single etching endeavor at any point attempted in England". As print authority and seller Christopher Lennox-Boyd clarifies, "had there not been a business opportunity for such inscriptions, not one of the works of art would have been authorized, and hardly any, of the craftsmen would have gambled painting such expand pieces". Researchers trust that an assortment of etching techniques were utilized and that line etching was the "favored medium" since it was "clear and hardwearing" and in light of the fact that it had a high notoriety. Stipple etching, which was snappier and regularly used to deliver shading impacts, destroyed speedier and was esteemed less. Numerous plates were a blend of both. A few researchers have proposed that mezzotint and aquatint were additionally utilized. Lennox-Boyd, be that as it may, claims that "nearby examination of the plates affirms" that these two strategies were not utilized and contends that they were "absolutely unacceptable": mezzotint wore rapidly and aquatint was excessively new (there would not have been sufficient specialists equipped for executing it). The majority of Boydell's etchers were additionally prepared specialists; for instance, Bartolozzi was famous for his stippling system.
