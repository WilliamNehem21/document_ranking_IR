Since UDI professed to make Rhodesia autonomous under the Queen as a powerful domain, numerous nations defended their maintenance of missions in Rhodesia simultaneously with their non-acknowledgment of the state by pointing out that the emissaries' accreditation was to the Queen and not to Smith's legislature "as such". In any case, Rhodesia moved far from its unique line of autonomy as an established government and towards republicanism amid the late 1960s, planning to end uncertainty with respect to its asserted protected status and inspire official outside acknowledgment. In March 1970, after the electorate had casted a ballot "yes" in a choice the earlier year both to another constitution and to the surrendering of emblematic connections to the Queen, Smith's legislature announced Rhodesia a republic. A long way from inciting acknowledgment, this drove all nations separated from Portugal and South Africa to pull back their offices and missions, as the avocation of imperial accreditation could never again be utilized. After Portugal's Carnation Revolution in 1974, the Rhodesian mission in Lisbon was shut in May 1975, with its partner in LourenÃÂ§o Marques following a month later on Mozambican freedom. Portugal additionally pulled back its own residual authorities from Rhodesia, leaving South Africa as the main nation with connections to Salisbury. Rhodesia's political exercises were from there on significantly reduced.
