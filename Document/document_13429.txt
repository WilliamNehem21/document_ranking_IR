Many have given proposals as Jason's inspiration for slaughtering. Ken Kirzinger alludes to Jason as a "crazy mom's kid gone horrendously awry...very versatile. You can't murder him, however he feels torment, dislike every other person." Kirzinger proceeds to state that Jason is a "psycho-academic", and trusts his activities depend on satisfying his mom, and nothing close to home. Andrew O'Hehir has expressed, "Coursing hormones act, obviously, as smelling salts to smug Jason, that ever-careful authority of William Bennett-style esteems." Todd Farmer, essayist for "Jason X", composed the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation similarly as two of the youngsters are engaging in sexual relations. Rancher enjoyed the possibility that sex demonstrations activated Jason back to life. Whatever his inspirations, Kane Hodder accepts there is a breaking point to what he will do. As indicated by Hodder, Jason may fiercely kill any individual he goes over, yet when "Jason Takes Manhattan" called for Hodder to kick the lead character's pooch, Hodder won't, expressing that, while Jason has no second thoughts against killing people, he isn't sufficiently terrible to hurt creatures. Another model from "Jason Takes Manhattan", includes Jason being gone up against by a road posse of youthful young men one of whom compromises him with a blade, anyway Jason decides not to slaughter them and rather frightens them away by lifting up his veil and demonstrating to them his face. Similarly, chief Tom McLoughlin decided not to have Jason hurt any of the youngsters he experiences in "Jason Lives," expressing that Jason would not slaughter a kid, out of a compassion toward the predicament of kids created by his very own demise as a tyke.
