According to Gracey, a number of critics have compared Argento with the character of Peter Neal, speculating that he serves as an alter-ego for the director. Gracey refers to "Tenebrae" as a "reflexive commentary on [the director's] earlier work." The director himself saw the film in the same light, claiming it was a reaction to accusations that "[he] was a misogynistÂ ... a criminalÂ ... a murderer." Argento resolved to include all of these aspects of his previous films into "Tenebrae". A scene in which a woman criticizes the lead character's books as "sexist", featuring "women as victims, cipers, male heroes [and] macho bullshit" echoes criticisms of Argento's own work. Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene "essentially autobiographical", and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side, to "let it speak". With "Tenebrae" in particular, he felt he was making a joke or playing a game with his critics, creating a front or mystique about himself. Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and sending up this perception. Newman agrees that Argento used "Tenebrae" to address his own public image, the notion that someone who creates art as "sick and twisted" as his, must himself be sick and twisted. With "Tenebrae"s reveal that the author is the killer, Newman argues that Argento is saying, "What if I were?"
