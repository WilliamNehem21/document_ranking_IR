During the Classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages. The split between Proto-Yucatecan (in the north, that is, the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula) and Proto-ChÊ¼olan (in the south, that is, the Chiapas highlands and PetÃ©n Basin) had already occurred by the Classic period, when most extant Maya inscriptions were written. Both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the Maya sites of the time, and both are commonly referred to as "Classic Maya language". Although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts, evidence for at least five different varieties of Mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpusâan Eastern ChÊ¼olan variety found in texts written in the southern Maya area and the highlands, a Western ChÊ¼olan variety diffused from the Usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on, a Yucatecan variety found in the texts from the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, a Tzeltalan variety found in the Western Lowlands (i.e. ToninÃ¡, Pomona), and possibly a highland Maya language belonging to KÊ¼ichean major within texts painted on Nebaj ceramics. The reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the Maya region; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite.
