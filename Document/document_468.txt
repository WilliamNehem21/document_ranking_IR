Road and Smith, one of the longest settled and most regarded distributers, shut down the majority of their mash magazines in the late spring of 1949. The pulps were kicking the bucket, somewhat because of the accomplishment of soft cover books. Standard proceeded with "Frightening" and "Exciting", yet the end came just a couple of years after the fact. In 1954, Fredric Wertham distributed "Enticement of the Innocent", a book in which he attested that funnies were inducing youngsters to savagery. A consequent Senate subcommittee hearing prompted a reaction against funnies, and the distributers dropped titles accordingly. The monetary effect spread to mash magazines, since regularly a distributer would distribute both. A 1955 strike by American News Corporation, the principle wholesaler in the U.S., implied that magazines stayed in stockrooms and never made it to the newspaper kiosks; the unsold duplicates spoke to a critical monetary blow and added to distributers' choices to drop magazines. "Alarming" was one of the losses. The calendar had just come back from month to month to every other month in 1953, and it turned into a quarterly in mid 1954. "Exciting Wonder" distributed its last issue in mid 1955, and was then converged with "Alarming", as seemed to be "Incredible Story Magazine", another partner production, however the consolidated magazine kept going just three additional issues. Mines left the magazine toward the finish of 1954; he was prevailing for two issues by Theron Raines, who was trailed by Herbert D. Kastle for the last two. The last issue was dated Fall 1955.
