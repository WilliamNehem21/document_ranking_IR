Holst composed few large-scale works in his final years. "A Choral Fantasia" of 1930 was written for the Three Choirs Festival at Gloucester; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, "knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of "Egdon Heath"". Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight "Canons" of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The "Brook Green Suite" (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the "St Paul's Suite". The "Lyric Movement" for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for Lionel Tertis. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists. Robin Hull, in "Penguin Music Magazine", praised the work's "clear beautyâimpossible to mistake for the art of any other composer"; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains "a frail creation". Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier musicâ"a summing up of Holst's orchestral art", according to Short. Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.
