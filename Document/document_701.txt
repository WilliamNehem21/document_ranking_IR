Meanwhile, al-Muttaqi with Sayf al-Dawla had fled to Raqqa before Tuzun's development, however the caliph became progressively suspicious of the Hamdanids, and kept in touch with al-Ikhshid (maybe as ahead of schedule as the winter of 943), requesting help. The last quickly reacted by driving a military into Syria. The Hamdanid armies pulled back before him, and in September 944, al-Ikhshid came to Raqqa. Doubting the Hamdanids given their treatment of Ibn Ra'iq, he held up until Sayf al-Dawla had left the city before entering it to meet the caliph. Al-Ikhshid attempted without progress to influence al-Muttaqi to accompany him to Egypt, or possibly to remain in Raqqa, while the caliph endeavored to get al-Ikhshid to walk against Tuzun, which the last can't. The gathering was not by any stretch of the imagination vain, as al-Ikhshid verified an understanding that practically rehashed the terms of a comparative settlement between the Tulunid Khumarawayh and Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 886. The caliph perceived the expert of al-Ikhshid over Egypt, Syria (with the "thughur"), and the Hejaz (conveying with it the lofty guardianship of the two sacred urban areas of Mecca and Medina), for a time of thirty years, with the privilege of genetic progression for al-Ikhshid's children. This improvement had just been foreseen by al-Ikhshid the earlier year, when he named his child Unujur as his official amid his unlucky deficiencies from Egypt, in spite of the fact that Unujur had not yet grown up, and had required a vow of loyalty ("bay'a") to be vowed to him. By and by, as Michael Brett remarks, the regions presented were "blended gifts", as the heavenly urban communities were presented to Qarmatian strikes, while the walks of the "thughur" were progressively menaced by the Byzantines, and Aleppo (with northern Syria) was desired by the Hamdanids.
