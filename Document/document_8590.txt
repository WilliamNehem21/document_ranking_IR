The low setbacks the Commonwealth flying corps caused amid the Battle of Normandy prompted an over-supply of prepared aircrew. While the quantity of pilots and other aviators experiencing preparing through the EATS had started to be decreased in mid 1944, by 30 June there were a large number of qualified aviatorsÃ¢ÂÂincluding 3,000 AustraliansÃ¢ÂÂin the UK sitting tight for posts in operational units. This number enormously surpassed the necessities of the Allied flying corps. In like manner, the stream of aviators from EATS preparing offices in Canada to the UK was significantly reduced, and Australia stopped sending pilots abroad to prepare under the plan in August. While 1,245 Australian aviators landed in the UK amid the most recent a half year of 1944 (a decrease from the 5,181 who had touched base in the initial a half year of the year), just the individuals who were qualified as air heavy weapons specialists were commonly ever appointed to battle units. It was impractical to discover flying positions for a large portion of the staying unattached aviators who landed after June 1944, and some were presented back on Australia; the rest of the remainder of the war in instructional classes and different non-flying jobs.
