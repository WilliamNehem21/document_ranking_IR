In the mean time, in the Caribbean theater, an extensive power of regulars and volunteers assembled close Tampa, Florida, for an intrusion of Cuba. The military confronted troubles in providing the quickly extending power even before they withdrew for Cuba, yet by June, Corbin had gained ground in settling the issues. After extensive postponements, the military, driven by Major General William Rufus Shafter, cruised from Florida on June 20, arriving close Santiago de Cuba two days after the fact. Following a clash at Las Guasimas on June 24, Shafter's military drew in the Spanish powers on July 2 in the Battle of San Juan Hill. In an exceptional day-long fight, the American power was triumphant, albeit the two sides endured substantial losses. The following day, the Spanish Caribbean squadron, which had been protecting in Santiago's harbor, down and out for the untamed ocean yet was blocked and devastated by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson's North Atlantic Squadron in the biggest maritime clash of the war. Shafter laid attack to the city of Santiago, which surrendered on July 17, putting Cuba under compelling American control. McKinley and Miles likewise requested an attack of Puerto Rico, which met little opposition when it arrived in July. The separation from Spain and the demolition of the Spanish naval force made resupply incomprehensible, and the Spanish government started to search for an approach to end the war.
