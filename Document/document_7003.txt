The best test to the nation's harmony amid the Pierce organization was the section of the KansasÃ¢ÂÂ Nebraska Act. Arranging the to a great extent disrupted Nebraska Territory, which extended from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, and from Texas north to what is currently the CanadaÃ¢ÂÂ US outskirt, was a vital piece of Douglas' arrangements for western extension. He needed a cross-country railroad with a connection from Chicago to California, through the tremendous western domain. Arranging the region was essential for settlement as the land would not be overviewed nor set available to be purchased until a regional government was approved. Those from slave states had never been substance with western points of confinement on subjection, and felt it ought to have the capacity to venture into regions acquired with blood and fortune that had come, to some degree, from the South. Douglas and his partners intended to sort out the region and let nearby pioneers choose whether to permit servitude. This would nullify the Missouri Compromise of 1820, as its greater part was north of the 36ÃÂ°30Ã¢ÂÂ² N line the Missouri Compromise regarded "free". The region would be part into a northern part, Nebraska, and a southern part, Kansas, and the desire was that Kansas would permit subjection and Nebraska would not. In the perspective on master bondage Southern government officials, the Compromise of 1850 had just invalidated the Missouri Compromise by conceding the province of California, including domain south of the trade off line, as a free state.
