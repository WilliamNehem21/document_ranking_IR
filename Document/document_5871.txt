With the sponsorship of the Stalwarts and requires a "man of iron" to supplant the "man of straw" in the White House, Grant was certain that he would get the Republican designation for the administration. Roscoe Conkling, the pioneer of the Stalwart group, framed a "triumvirate" with J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois to lead the battle for Grant's arrival to the White House. With a Grant triumph, Conkling and different Stalwarts would have incredible impact in the White House. Allow realized he could rely on the Stalwart heads to harden their particular states so as to ensure a Grant triumph. Conkling was so certain about Grant's designation that he didn't utter a word, "however a demonstration of God could keep Grant's assignment." An assistant to the ex-president, Adam Badeau, remarked that Grant had moved toward becoming "amazingly on edge to get the selection" and did not imagine that there was any opportunity of disappointment.
