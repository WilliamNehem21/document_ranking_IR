Amid the 12thÃÂ century, the fundamental sponsors of the cloister were the Barons of Halton, however after 1200 their blessings diminished, for the most part since they exchanged their interests to the Cistercian nunnery at Stanlow, which had been established in 1178 by John fitzÃÂ Richard, the 6th aristocrat. Classicist J. Patrick Greene expresses that it is impossible that any of the Barons of Halton were covered in Norton Priory. The main individuals from the family known to be covered there are Richard, sibling of Roger deÃÂ Lacy, the seventh noble, and a female named Alice. The character of Alice has not been affirmed, however Greene thinks about that she was the niece of William, Earl Warenne, the 5thÃÂ Earl of Surrey and in this way a relative of the Delacy family, who were around then the Barons of Halton. The baron made an allow to the convent of 30ÃÂ shillings per year so as to "keep up a concession for her spirit". As the pretended by the Barons of Halton declined, so the significance of individuals from the Dutton family expanded. The Duttons had been promoters since the cloister's establishment, and from the thirteenth century they turned into the chief advocates. There were two fundamental parts of the family, one in Dutton and the other in Sutton Weaver. The Dutton family had their own internment house of prayer in the monastery, and entombment in the sanctuary is indicated in three wills made by individuals from the family. The Aston group of Aston were additionally imperative supporters.
