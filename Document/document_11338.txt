Almost certainly, Munir and Sirhan bought the firearm in such a furtive way since they were both mindful that it was unlawful for outsiders to possess handguns. Sirhan first shot the weapon in March 1968 and rehearsed with it about multiple times among March and May 1968. He said he "enjoyed firearms."' Munir said Sirhan kept the weapon in the glove compartment of his De Soto. Munir regularly heard Sirhan playing with something that made a "tick, click" sound, and he trusted it was the firearm." Munir had been "scared" by the look in Sirhan's eye when his sibling dealt with the weapon. Truth be told Munir was so stressed he made Sirhan swear on their dead sister, Aida, that he would not utilize the firearm in a "terrible" manner. Sirhan had disregarded three California laws simply by having the gun he used to murder Robert Kennedy. Therefore, if Sirhan were essentially an accidental patsy associated with an intrigue, the plotters must have intentionally picked a man who had been taking a chance with the entire conspiratorial endeavor by having an illicit weapon and discharging it at a police extend. Had Sirhan been gotten with the illicit weapon, the implied intrigue would have crumpled.
