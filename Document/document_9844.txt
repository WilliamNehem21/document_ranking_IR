Gabinius was put on preliminary in Rome for manhandling his power, for which he was absolved, yet his second preliminary for taking hush-money prompted his outcast, from which he was reviewed seven years after the fact in 48 BC by Caesar. Crassus supplanted him as legislative head of Syria and stretched out his commonplace direction to Egypt, yet he was murdered by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. Ptolemy XII had Berenice IV and her well off supporters executed, catching their properties. He permitted Gabinius' to a great extent Germanic and Gallic Roman battalion, the Gabiniani, to pester individuals in the avenues of Alexandria and introduced his long-lasting Roman agent Rabirius as his CFO. Inside a year Rabirius was set under defensive authority and sent back to Rome after his life was jeopardized for depleting Egypt of its assets. In spite of these issues, Ptolemy XII made a will assigning Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint beneficiaries, regulated real development activities, for example, the Temple of Edfu and a sanctuary at Dendera, and settled the economy. On 31 May 52 BC Cleopatra was made an official of Ptolemy XII as shown by an engraving in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. Rabirius was unfit to gather the whole of Ptolemy XII's obligation when of the last's demise, thus it was passed on to his successors Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII.
