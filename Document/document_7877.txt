The yellow-followed dark cockatoo is found up to AMSL over southeastern Australia including the island of Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait (King, Flinders, Cape Barren islands), and furthermore on Kangaroo Island. On Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait it is the main local dark hued cockatoo. On the terrain, it is found from the region of Gin and Gympie in south and focal eastern Queensland, south through New South Wales, where it happens along the Great Dividing Range and to the coast, and into and crosswise over the majority of Victoria bar the northern and northwestern corner, to the Coorong and Mount Lofty Ranges in southeastern South Australia. A minor populace numbering 30 to 40 winged creatures occupies the Eyre Peninsula. There they are found in sugar gum ("Eucalyptus cladocalyx") forest in the lower promontory and relocate to the mallee zones in the northern landmass in the wake of rearing. There is proof that feathered creatures on the New South Wales south coast move from raised territories to bring down lying zones towards the coast in winter. They are commonly normal or locally exceptionally regular in a wide scope of propensities, in spite of the fact that they will in general be locally uncommon at the points of confinement of their range. Their rearing extent is limited to territories with huge old trees.
