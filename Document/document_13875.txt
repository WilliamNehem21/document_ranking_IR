In 1949 KetÃÂ¨lbey and his new spouse moved to the Isle of Wight, and obtained Rookstone, Egypt Hill, in Cowes, where he incompletely resigned, in spite of the fact that despite everything he created sometimes. Tastes in famous music had changed amid and after the war and his music declined in fame; his pay in 1940 had been ÃÂ£3,493, which dropped to ÃÂ£2,906 in 1950Ã¢ÂÂan especially steep drop when wartime expansion is considered. McCanna composes that separated from a commission for the National Brass Band rivalry in 1945, KetÃÂ¨lbey created nothing paramount after the war, and his biographer Keith Anderson thinks about that in the after war time frame KetÃÂ¨lbey's work "...ÃÂ lacked curiosity. Of the bunch of works publishedÃÂ ... most were reworkings of old material, in spite of the fact that the arranger endeavored to mask the inceptions". The BBC additionally started to overlook his work. In their 1949 Festival of Light Music, none of his organizations were played, which he discovered upsetting. In his letter to the Director-General of the BBC, Sir William Haley, KetÃÂ¨lbey said the prohibition was "an open affront". His music still found a group of people: in 1952 and 1953 "With Honor Crowned" was again played as a moderate walk at the Trooping the Color function.
