As the battle in Al Anbar entered its fourth year the Marine Corps scored a noteworthy triumph when it embraced a vehicle initially structured during the 1970s to withstand mine assaults: the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle. As ahead of schedule as 2004, the Marine Corps perceived that it required a trade for its shielded Humvees. The couple of Cougar MRAP at first sent yielded noteworthy outcomes. In 2004, the Marines revealed that no troops had passed on in more than 300 mine assaults on Cougars. In April 2007, General Conway evaluated that the far reaching utilization of the MRAP could diminish mine setbacks in Anbar by as much as 80 percent. Presently Commandant of the Marine Corps, he mentioned an extra 3,000 MRAPs for Anbar and told the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he needed to require each Marine making a trip outside bases to ride in one. In April, the Deputy Commander for MEF said that in the 300 assaults on MRAPs in Anbar since January 2006, no Marines had been murdered. On 8 May 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates expressed that the securing of MRAPs was the Department of Defense's most astounding need and reserved 1.1 billion US dollars for them. The Marine Corps acquired and handled huge quantities of MRAPs all through 2007. That October, General Conway depicted the MRAP as the "highest quality level" of power assurance. Passings from mine assaults dove and in June 2008, "USA Today" announced that roadside bomb assaults and fatalities in Iraq had dropped just about 90 percent, mostly due to MRAPs.
