As indicated by Dunn, Willkie's central goal was to be Roosevelt's own agent, "showing American solidarity, gathering data, and talking about with key heads of state plans for the after war future". Subsequent to leaving the U.S. on August 26, Willkie's first stop was in North Africa, where he met General Montgomery and visited the front at El Alamein. In Beirut, he remained with General de Gaulle, pioneer of the Free French. In Jerusalem, Willkie met with Jews and Arabs, told the British leaders of Palestine that the two people groups ought to be brought into the administration, and he later composed that the contention there was so old, it was unreasonable to feel that it could "be illuminated by positive attitude and straightforward trustworthiness". Willkie had been moved to add the Soviet Union to his schedule when three Western columnists there asked him by message to do as such. There, he met with Stalin, and upon his arrival he supported increasingly liberal Lend-Lease expressions for the USSR. In China, Willkie was facilitated by Chiang Kai-shek and was interested by Madame Chiang. Willkie was taken to the front so as to watch the Chinese military powers in their battle against the Japanese, and he took a stand in opposition to imperialism, in China and somewhere else. His announcements were accounted for generally in Britain, enraging Churchill, who reacted by saying, "We intend to stand our ground. I have not turned into the King's First Minister so as to manage the liquidation of the British Empire."
