At the same time, Michael and his successors continued the well-established practice of using foreigners in the fleet. Alongside the mistrusted Italian city-states, with whom alliances shifted regularly, mercenaries were increasingly employed in the last centuries of the Empire, often rewarded for their services with fiefs. Most of these mercenaries, like Giovanni de lo Cavo (lord of Anafi and Rhodes), Andrea Morisco (successor of de lo Cavo in Rhodes) and Benedetto Zaccaria (lord of Chios and Phocaea), were Genoese, the Byzantines' major ally in the period. Under Michael VIII, for the first time a foreigner, the Italian privateer Licario, became "megas doux" and was given Euboea as a fief. In 1303, another high rank, that of "amÄralÄs" ( or ) was introduced. The term had already entered Byzantine usage through contact with the Kingdom of Naples and other Western nations, but was rarely used; it was adopted as part of the imperial hierarchy, coming after the "megas doux" and the "megas droungarios", with the arrival of the mercenaries of the Catalan Company. Only two holders are known, Ferran d'AunÃ©s and Andrea Morisco, both from 1303â1305, although the rank continued to be mentioned in various lists of offices long after that. Thus, according to the mid-14th century "Book of Offices", the subordinates of the "megas doux" were the "megas droungarios tou stolou", the "amÄralios", the "prÅtokomÄs", the junior "droungarioi", and the junior "komÄtes". Pseudo-Kodinos also records that, while the other warships flew "the usual imperial flag" (Î²Î±ÏÎ¹Î»Î¹Îºá½¸Î½ ÏÎ»Î¬Î¼Î¿ÏÎ»Î¿Î½, "basilikon phlamoulon") of the cross and the firesteels, the "megas doux" flew an image of the emperor on horseback as his distinctive ensign.
