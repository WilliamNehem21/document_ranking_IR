In the medieval time the stream was utilized to transport Hamstone from the quarry at Ham Hill for the development of chapels all through the district. Afterward, in the nineteenth century, coal from south Wales, for warming, Bath blocks, blocks and tiles would be conveyed. Block making, which had been completed irregularly in Bridgwater from the seventeenth century, by the late eighteenth century had ventured into an industry dependent on perpetual brickyards in the Bridgwater zone adjoining the Parrett. The block and tile industry utilized the neighborhood alluvial muds and the Parrett's beach front exchange, utilizing ketches generally based at Bridgwater to transport their items, which were substantial and massive, and to acquire coal to warm the furnaces. The nineteenth century mechanical upheaval opened up mass markets prompting further development of the business, especially starting in 1850 when the obligation (charge) on blocks was canceled. Block and tile works, utilizing stream transport, were opened during the 1850s south of Bridgwater at North Petherton and Dunwear, in Bridgwater itself, and downstream at Chilton Trinity, Combwich, Puriton and Pawlett. Various brickworks were additionally opened somewhere else in Somerset, yet a considerable lot of them utilized the railroads to transport their items; about 264 locales are recorded in the Somerset Industrial Archeological Society's "Gazetteer of destinations". Sediment was likewise dug from the stream over a stretch between Somerset Bridge and Castle Fields, Bridgwater, to make Bath blocks, an early grating cleaning material protected in 1827.
