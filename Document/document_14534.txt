Before Michigan turned into an express, the main land transportation halls were the Indian trails. The first Mackinaw Trail ran generally parallel to the course of the advanced USÃÂ 131 from east of Kalkaska to Petoskey. In the nineteenth century, the Michigan Legislature contracted privately owned businesses to manufacture and work board streets or freeways in the state. These streets were initially made of oak boards, yet later enactment allowed rock also. Two lanes in the Grand Rapids region, Division and Plainfield roads, were initially board streets. The organizations were supported through the gathering of tolls. The framework was costly to keep up, and regularly the expressways fell into decay as the wood distorted and spoiled away. Imprint Twain once remarked that "the street couldn't have been awful on the off chance that some unconscionable rapscallion had not currently and, at that point dropped a board crosswise over it," after a stumble on the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank Road. By the primary decade of the twentieth century, just 23 of the 202ÃÂ chartered freeways were still in activity; numerous organizations that got a contract never manufactured their predefined roadways. The rest of the board streets were swung over to the state or obtained by railroad organizations in the early piece of the century.
