Buffy's numbers are the most mind boggling, changing key and beat when she starts to uncover the mysteries she swore she never would. This shows up explicitly in "Something to Sing About", which begins with uptempo axioms: "We'll sing a cheerful tune/And you can chime in:/Where there's life, there's expectation/Every day's a blessing/Wishes can materialize/Whistle while you workÃÂ ..." While singing, she kills Sweet's cronies with a pool signal. Whedon endeavored to make the tune tuneful yet disorganized to express the central matter of the scene. It advances abruptly into her longing to resemble typical young ladies, at that point changes once more, abating the rhythm as she challenges Sweet not to give her a tune, however "something to sing about". Musicologist Amy Bauer orders the rhythm moves as "shake ditty to punk polka to psalm" that demonstrates Buffy's unrest. The key and beat moderate once more, as Buffy at long last uncovers "I live in damnation/'Cause I've been ousted from paradise/I think I was in paradise" with the harmony changing from B minor to B decreased, each time she rehashes "paradise". When answering to her, Spike has a similar move from minor to lessened each time he rehashes "living."
