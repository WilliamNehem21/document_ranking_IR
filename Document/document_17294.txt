"xx" was released by Young Turks in August 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. According to Alexis Petridis, it was the most acclaimed album of the year, and at Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 87, based on 25 reviews. Critics particularly praised the group's sound on the album; Simon Price wrote in "The Independent" that they were being universally lauded for their "atmospheric indie rock, and rightly so". "The Daily Telegraph"s Jack Arnhold regarded it as "one of this year's most beautiful and original debut albums". In a review for "The New Yorker", Sasha Frere-Jones remarked that "xx" rewarded repeated listens because of the band's disciplined playing, while Mark Edwards of "The Sunday Times" said it succeeded with simple but "very near perfect" pop songs. AllMusic's Heather Phares called the instrumentation impeccable and said she was impressed by how poised and refined such a young group sounded. In "The Irish Times", Jim Carroll said the exceptional chemistry of Croft and Sim's melancholic duets was the highlight of "this drop-dead gorgeous dream-pop symphony". Matthew Cole from "Slant Magazine" believed their rapport gave an emotional weight to the music, which he said sounded timeless and capable of appealing to both indie and popular tastes. Christgau, writing in "MSN Music", was somewhat more impressed by the music than by the lyrics, although he said the underlying force behind the singers' charmingly minimalist songs was a "spiritual dimension" offered by their ability to "shift roles without ever seeming hostile, cold or even unsupportive".
