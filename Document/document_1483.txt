Moore said he left DC in 1989 because of the language in his agreements for "Guardians" and his "V for Vendetta" arrangement with craftsman David Lloyd. Moore felt the inversion statements were eventually useless in light of the fact that DC did not expect to release the productions no longer in production. He told "The New York Times" in 2006, "I stated, 'sufficiently reasonable,' [...] 'You have figured out how to effectively cheat me, thus I will never work for you again. In 2000, Moore openly separated himself from DC's arrangements for a fifteenth commemoration "Guards" hardcover discharge just as a proposed line of activity figures from DC Direct. While DC needed to repair its association with the essayist, Moore felt the organization was not treating him decently concerning his America's Best Comics engrave (propelled under the WildStorm comic engraving, which was purchased by DC in 1998; Moore was guaranteed no immediate impedance by DC as a major aspect of the course of action). Moore included, "The extent that I'm concerned, the fifteenth commemoration of Watchmen is absolutely a fifteenth Anniversary of when DC figured out how to take the Watchmen property from me and Dave [Gibbons]." Soon thereafter, DC Direct dropped the "Guards" activity figure line, notwithstanding the organization having shown models at the 2000 San Diego Comic-Con International.
