Because no contemporary Roman sources mention his name, the exact identity of the "Astronomica"s author is a tantalizing question, but his name was probably Marcus Manilius. This uncertainty has led to Marcus Manilius being confused over the years with Manilius Antiochus (fl.c.100BC, mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his "Naturalis Historia"); Flavius Manlius Theodorus (fl.c.AD376409, a consul in AD399) and BoÃ«thius (the sixth-century Roman senator and author of "De consolatione philosophiae", whose full name was Anicius Manlius Severinus BoÃ«thius). Although the poem suggests that the writer was a citizen and resident of Rome, some have contended that Manilius was a non-Roman; according to Katharina Volk, a Latinist who specializes in Manilius, this belief is generally based on either "the poet's supposedly inferior Latinity" or "the wish to see Manilius as the member of a Greek intellectual milieu at Rome". The 19th-century classicist Fridericus Jacobs and the 19th- and 20th-century historian Paul Monceaux have argued that he was an African, based largely on his writing style, which they say resembles that of other African authors. Volk counters this view, arguing that Manilius writes "from ... a conventional Roman perspective" and "takes recourse to Roman history to illustrate the astrological facts he discusses".
