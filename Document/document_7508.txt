The next day, as Australia confronted a huge shortfall on the main innings, Bert Oldfield played a long innings in help of Bill Ponsford, who scored 85. Over the span of the innings, the English bowlers utilized bodyline against him, and he confronted a few short-pitched conveyances yet took a few fours from Larwood to move to 41. Having quite recently surrendered a four, Larwood bowled partially shorter and somewhat slower. Oldfield endeavored to snare yet dismissed the ball and edged it onto his sanctuary; the ball cracked his skull. Oldfield amazed away and tumbled to his knees and play halted as Woodfull went onto the pitch and the irate group scoffed and yelled, yet again achieving the point where a mob appeared to be likely. A few English players contemplated equipping themselves with stumps should the group go onto the field. The ball which harmed Oldfield was bowled to a traditional, non-bodyline field; Larwood promptly apologized however Oldfield said that it was his own blame before he was sponsored to the changing area and play proceeded. Jardine later covertly sent a message of compassion to Oldfield's significant other and masterminded presents to be given to his young little girls.
