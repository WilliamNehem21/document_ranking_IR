In 1880, while Brown was as yet alive, the lay preacher Christina Smith composed a book, "The Booandik Tribe of South Australian Aborigines", which was distributed in Adelaide. It included journals from her time in the Rivoli Bay area, some southeast of Guichen Bay. One of these was around an Aboriginal kid called Wergon, whom she had received during the 1840s. Wergon had changed over to Christianity and went on a few adventures to attempt to change over the nearby Aboriginal individuals. One of these outreaching visits was to the nation of the Wattatonga clan, a gathering whose customary grounds incorporated the recently settled Avenue Range Station. He came back from this trek to reveal to Smith that eleven of the clan had been slaughtered by two white men. Wergon had induced an observer whose guardians had evidently been slaughtered in the slaughter to come back with him. As indicated by Wergon, "the white men showed demonstrated no benevolence to the dark headed elderly person or to the vulnerable newborn child on its mom's bosom", and the clear thought process in the slaughter was the executing of sheep having a place with a pilgrim in the Guichen Bay region. Smith's record did exclude how the slaughter was done, yet included the subtleties that it was examined, the groups of the unfortunate casualties were copied, and the killer was released for absence of proof. Smith did not name the pioneers. In their 2001 book, the students of history Robert Foster, Rick Hosking and Amanda Nettelbeck thought about this obvious, given that Brown was alive and living close-by at the time Smith's book was distributed. While cautious about naming Brown, Smith basically described essential subtleties of the slaughter in her book distributed more than thirty years after it happened.
