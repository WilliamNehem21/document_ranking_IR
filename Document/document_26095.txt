After "Halo 3", development studio Bungie created an internal team to work on Peter Jackson's planned "Halo" game, "Halo Chronicles". "Chronicles" was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion projectâ"Halo 3: ODST"âwhile another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on "Reach". The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to "Halo 3". The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first "Halo" game in brainstorming sessions. It would take place on the planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [to] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," said Lehto. "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the "Halo" trilogy, Bungie used "Reach" to introduce new characters and settings. As "Reach" ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing all the way to the end," said Lehto.
