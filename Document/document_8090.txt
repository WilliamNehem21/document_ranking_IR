The record of Appian: Antiochus X was ousted from Syria by Tigranes II of Armenia. Appian gave Tigranes II a reign of fourteen years in Syria finishing in 69 BC. That year saw the retreat of the Armenian lord because of a war with the Romans. Consequently, the attack of Syria by Tigranes, in light of the record of Appian, likely occurred in 83 BC. Bellinger rejected this record, and thought about that Appian mistook Antiochus X for his child Antiochus XIII. Kuhn thought about a disarray among dad and child to be not feasible in light of the fact that Appian referenced the sobriquet Eusebes when discussing the destiny of Antiochus X. In the perspective on Kuhn, Antiochus X withdrew to Cilicia subsequent to being crushed by Tigranes II, and his children decided that district after him and were accounted for visiting Rome in 73 BC. In any case, numismatic proof demonstrates that Demetrius III controlled Cilicia following the downfall of Antiochus X, and that Tarsus printed coins in his name SE (88/87 BC). The Egyptologist Christopher J. Bennett, thought of it as conceivable that Antiochus X withdrew to Ptolemais in the wake of being vanquished by Tigranes since it turned into his widow's base. In his history, Appian neglected to make reference to the reigns of Demetrius III and Philip I in the capital which went before the rule of Tigranes II. As indicated by Hoover, Appian's obliviousness of the mediating lords between Antiochus X and Tigranes II may clarify how he befuddled Antiochus XIII, who is known to have fled from the Armenian ruler, with his dad.
