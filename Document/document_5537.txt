In the book, the storyteller isn't just mindful, yet in addition caution to everything about her. "Pioneer's" second section characterizes two sorts of seeing: as "verbalization" (dynamic) and as "a giving up" (detached). The storyteller alludes to the contrast between the two techniques as "the distinction between strolling with and without a camera." Whereas the previous requires the need to "break down and pry", the last just requires riveted consideration. The demonstration of seeing is comprehensive and depleting, as one of the sections relates: "I take a gander at the water: minnows and shiners. In the event that I am thinking minnows, a carp will fill my mind till I shout. I take a gander at the water's surface: skaters, air pockets, and leaves sliding down. All of a sudden my own face, reflected, frightens me stupid. Those snails have been following my face! At last, with a shivering wrench of the will, I see mists, cirrus mists. I'm unsteady. I fall in. This looking business is hazardous." Sandra Johnson alludes to the structure of the book itself prompting a revelation of mindfulness, or a "magical encounter"; as the storyteller watches a falling maple key, she feels "lost, sunk ... looking toward Tinker Mountain and feeling the earth reel down".
