The tail club (or tail knob) of "Ankylosaurus" was composed of two large osteoderms, with a row of small osteoderms at the midline, and two small osteoderms at the tip; these osteoderms obscured the last tail vertebra. As only the tail club of specimen AMNH 5214 is known, the range of variation between individuals is unknown. The tail club of AMNH 5214 is long, wide, and tall. The club of the largest specimen may have been wide. The tail club of "Ankylosaurus" was semicircular when seen from above, similar to those of "Euoplocephalus" and "Scolosaurus" but unlike the pointed club osteoderms of "Anodontosaurus" or the narrow, elongated club of "Dyoplosaurus". The last seven tail vertebrae formed the "handle" of the tail club. These vertebrae were in contact, with no cartilage between them, and were sometimes co-ossified, which made them immobile. Ossified tendons attached to the vertebrae in front of the tail club, and these features together helped strengthen it. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) and neural spines of the handle vertebrae were U-shaped when seen from above, whereas those of most other ankylosaurids are V-shaped, which may be due to the handle of "Ankylosaurus" being wider. The larger width may indicate that the tail of "Ankylosaurus" was shorter in relation to its body length than those of other ankylosaurids, or that it had the same proportions but with a smaller club.
