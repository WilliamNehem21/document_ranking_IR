The little, adjusted ears are secured with thick brilliant hairs on the external and with ruddy darker hairs on the inward surface. The mystacial vibrissae (stubbles on the upper lip) are long, typically expanding a little past the ears when laid back against the head, however the superciliary vibrissae (hairs over the eyes) are short and don't reach out past the ears. The upper surface on the forefeet is secured with dark colored hide, and there is white or shiny hide on the digits. Ungual tufts (hide around the bases of the paws) are available on the second through fourth digits. On the short, genuinely expansive hindfeet, the upper side is secured thickly with gleaming to white hairs close to the tips of the feet and toes, and with dark colored hide generally. No other oryzomyine has such dark colored hide on its hindfeet. The second through fourth digits have long gleaming white ungual tufts, yet those on the principal digit are short. On the sole, the cushions are extremely expansive. Among oryzomyines, just "Oecomys" and the wiped out "Megalomys" have comparatively expansive cushions between their digits. There is a thick front of short darker hairs on both the upper and lower sides of the tail. Dissimilar to in "Eremoryzomys", the tail is a similar shading above and underneath. The last parts in a tuft, a surprising component among oryzomyines.
