The molars are marginally increasingly high-delegated (hypsodont) than in many oryzomyines, and a considerable lot of the extra peaks are decreased, yet they are strongly unmistakable from the exceedingly determined, hypsodont molars of "Holochilus". The primary cusps are situated inverse one another and have adjusted edges. The lacquer folds don't stretch out past the midlines of the molars. The mesoloph, an extra peak on the upper molars that is typically very much created in oryzomyines, is available yet short on the first and second upper molar; it is substantially more decreased in "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys". The relating structure on the lower molars, the mesolophid, is available on the first and second molars in "Lundomys", however missing in both "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys". Another embellishment peak, the anteroloph, is available, however little, on the main upper molar in "Lundomys", yet completely missing in both other genera. As in "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys", the foremost cusp on the primary lower molar, the anteroconid, contains a profound pit. Every one of the three upper molars has three roots; not at all like in both "Holochilus" and "Pseudoryzomys", the primary upper molar comes up short on an adornment fourth root. The primary lower molar has four roots, including two little frill roots situated between bigger front and back roots. The second molar has either a few roots, with the foremost root split into two littler roots in certain examples.
