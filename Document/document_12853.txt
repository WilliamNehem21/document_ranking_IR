The scapula (shoulder bone) was short and bended, meager at the front end, and thick at the back. It was associated moderately feebly with the coracoid, which was vast and profound start to finish. Generally speaking, the forelimbs did not vary much from those of different ornithomimids, which were all similarly powerless. The humerus (upper arm bone), which had a close round cross-segment, was long and wound. The deltopectoral peak on the upper front piece of the humerus was similarly little, and accordingly given minimal surface to connection of upper arm muscles. The ulna was slim, long and feebly bended, with an almost triangular shaft. The olecranon (the projection from the elbow) was conspicuous in grown-ups, however not all around created in adolescents. The sweep (the other bone in the lower arm) was long and slim with a progressively extended upper end contrasted with the lower. The manus (hand) was relatively short contrasted with those of different ornithomimosaurs, having the littlest manus to humerus length proportion of any individual from the gathering, however was generally comparative in structure. It had three fingers, which were comparably built up; the first (the "thumb") was the most grounded, the third was the weakest and the second was the longest. The unguals (paw bones) were solid, to some degree bended (that of the main finger was most bended) and compacted sideways with a profound furrow on each side. The unguals were correspondingly grown, however the third was somewhat littler. The forelimbs seem to have turned out to be relatively longer amid development.
