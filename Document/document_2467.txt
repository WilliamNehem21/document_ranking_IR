The East Tilbury Blockhouse was assembled incompletely with stone taken from St Margaret's Chapel in Tilbury, which was broken down in 1536. Its structure isn't known however it likely comprised of a block and stone structure, maybe in a D-shape, with a bulwark and dump to encase its landward side. It was recorded as having fifteen iron and metal gun of different gauges in 1540; these had been expanded to 27 by 1539Ã¢ÂÂ 40. It had a little changeless army, comprising of an authority and his appointee, a doorman, two officers and four heavy armament specialists. The strong house may have been modified in 1545 however in 1553 it was incapacitated. In spite of the fact that the comparing brick house at Gravesend proceeded being used and that at Tilbury was in the end consolidated into Tilbury Fort somewhere in the range of 1670 and 1683, the one at East Tilbury appears to have been deserted before the finish of the sixteenth century. By 1735 it had been immersed by the waterway and was in vestiges. Its site by the shoreline has since been dissolved away by tidal activity, however it is conceivable that remaining parts from the brick house may even now get by under the waterway mud.
