Likewise in 1908, Jack London ended his quiet on his judgment amid the debate by distributing a paper in "Collier's Weekly" entitled "The Other Animals". Legitimately tending to Roosevelt's past analysis of his books, London called the President "homocentric" and "novice". He further expressed: "I have been blameworthy of composing two creatureÃ¢ÂÂtwo books about puppies. The composition of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a challenge against the 'acculturating' of creatures, of which it appeared to me a few 'creature authors' had been significantly liable. On numerous occasions, and commonly, in my stories, I composed, talking about my pooch saints: 'He didn't think these things; he only did them,' and so on. What's more, I did this over and again, to the stopping up of my account and infringing upon my imaginative standards; and I did it so as to pound into the normal human understanding that these pooch saints of mine were not coordinated by conceptual thinking, however by impulse, sensation, and feeling, and by straightforward thinking. Likewise, I attempted to make my accounts in accordance with the realities of development; I cut them to the imprint set by logical research, and stirred, at some point, to end up packaged neck and yield into the camp of the nature-fakers."
