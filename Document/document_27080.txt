On 25 April, the UstaÅ¡e arrested a Serb named Milan RadovanoviÄ when he stopped by the Bjelovar police station to hand over his rifle. He had fought with the VKJ at the time of the invasion and spent two weeks hiding in the forests before returning to his home in Prgomelje. His relatively late return prevented him from handing over his rifle before the UstaÅ¡e deadline on 24 April. On the morning of 26 April, as RadovanoviÄ and another Serb prisoner were being escorted from the county jail by two UstaÅ¡e guards, two unidentified gunmen opened fire on the detainees and guards. A skirmish ensued, and RadovanoviÄ and one of the guards were killed. The second guard was wounded. That afternoon, a Croatian Home Guard (or "domobran") was killed by a stray bullet in his yard while on leave. Kvaternik immediately blamed the deaths on "Serb agitators". In their internal documents, the UstaÅ¡e attributed the deaths to "local Chetniks", a claim that has never been proven. Some historians have hypothesized that the attack on the county jail and the death of the Home Guard were false flag attacks intended to rally Croats against local Serbs. This allegation has also never been proven.
