At the point when Prince John revolted in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset set aside their fight to suppress the uprising. Geoffrey fortified Doncaster's safeguards and went to the guide of Puiset, who was assaulting Tickhill Castle. In 1194 Geoffrey strayed into the red to the crown for the total of 3000 imprints to purchase the workplace of Sheriff of Yorkshire for himself. Soon thereafter Geoffrey started to fight with Hubert Walter over the supremacy of England, which Canterbury guaranteed and York debated. Walter's choice to have his episcopal cross conveyed before him in the bishopric of York in March 1194 was representative of his case to power over York and all of England. Geoffrey reacted by having his very own cross conveyed before him in the bishopric of Canterbury the next month. Lord Richard did not decry Geoffrey for this demonstration of incitement, and even ventured to such an extreme as to reestablish a portion of his appropriated homes. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he named Walter as Justiciar; that late spring Walter started an examination concerning Geoffrey's activities, which prompted Geoffrey's bequests being seized by and by. Geoffrey engaged the ruler, who was then in Maine; Richard over-ruled Walter, reestablished Geoffrey's domains, and acquitted him as an end-result of an installment of 1000 imprints and the guarantee of 1000 more to pursue.
