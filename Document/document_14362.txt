A few later pundits have translated the play as an impression of Rand's initial enthusiasm for the thoughts of German logician Friedrich Nietzsche. Writing teacher Shoshana Milgram saw components of Nietzsche's profound quality in the depictions of Bjorn Faulkner, who "never thought of things as right or off-base". Others discovered criticalness in Rand's esteem of the play's criminal characters. Student of history Jennifer Burns said Rand "discovered guiltiness an overpowering representation for independence" on account of the effect on her of "Nietzsche's transvaluation of qualities [that] changed culprits into legends". Rand kept up culpability was not the essential quality of the characters; she said a criminal could fill in as "a smooth image" of autonomy and resistance to congruity, however expressed, "I don't think, nor did I think when I composed this play, a swindler is a courageous character or that a good broker is a scoundrel". Rand biographer Ronald Merrill expelled this clarification as a concealment for the play's advancement of Nietzschean thoughts that Rand later rejected. He called the play "an incredible and smooth supplication for the Nietzschean perspective" of the predominance of the "superman"; this is spoken to by Faulkner, whom Merrill translates as dismissing outer good expert and the "slave ethical quality" of customary individuals. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand "later revoked her sentimental interest with hoodlums", making the characters' guiltiness a shame for her.
