Id had no clear expectations for "Wolfenstein"s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000. "PC Zone" quoted a shareware distributor as saying "Wolfenstein 3D" was the top shareware seller of 1992. By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of "Wolfenstein 3D" as well as "Spear of Destiny" had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space. By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id sold another 150,000 retail copies as "Spear of Destiny"; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide. Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being banned from sale in Germany due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons in 1994, and again in 1997 for "Spear of Destiny". The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier "Commander Keen" series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where "Commander Keen" games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, "Wolfenstein 3D" brought in $200,000 per month.
