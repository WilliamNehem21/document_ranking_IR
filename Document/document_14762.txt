A chorale welcomes the day break as Ariadne, following a pained night's rest, comes back to the shore with her partner, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has withdrawn. Dorilla offers her solace. In hopelessness at the prospect that Theseus won't return, Ariadne by the by chooses to go to the arrival region to sit tight for him. In a peaceful interval an ensemble sings of the delights of country life, and communicates the expectation that Theseus won't overlook Ariadne. Prepared by an agent with the news that Ariadne is separated from everyone else and distressing, the melody again sings in compassion for her. On the shoreline, Ariadne sings her mourn for her lost love and gets ready to slaughter herself. Now exhibitions are heard proclaiming an entry, making Ariadne trust that it is Theseus returning. In another break the melody understands, a second emissary reports that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having shown compassion for Ariadne. A sung "ballo" praises the foreseen pre-wedding assurance of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the last scene Cupid returns, and Venus ascends from the ocean before Jupiter talks his approval from the sky. The association is fixed as Bacchus guarantees Ariadne interminability in paradise, and a crown of stars.
