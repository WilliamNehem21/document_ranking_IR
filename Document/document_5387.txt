For this, it focuses on the British mystery administration specialist James Bond. Due to a limited extent to his job in the thrashing of the SMERSH operators Le Chiffre, Mr Big and Hugo Drax, Bond has been recorded as an adversary of the Soviet state and a "demise warrant" is issued for him.

Kronsteen, SMERSH's chess-playing expert organizer, and Colonel Rosa Klebb, the head of Operations and Executions, devise the task. They train an appealing youthful figure assistant, Corporal Tatiana Romanova, to erroneously abandon from her post in Istanbul having, she would guarantee, become hopelessly enamored with Bond in the wake of seeing a photo on his document. As an additional bait for Bond, Romanova will furnish the British with a Spektor, a Russian interpreting gadget much pined for by MI6. She isn't told the subtleties of the arrangement.
