After various solicitations for structure adjustments from the Brazilian Navy were suited or dismissed, an agreement was marked for a ship with fourteen 12-inch weapons on 3 June 1911 for ÃÂ£2,675,000, and "Rio de Janeiro"s bottom was laid for the fourth time on 14 September. It didn't take long for the Brazilian government to reexamine their choice once more; by mid-1912, ships with 14-inch weapons were under development, and abruptly it appeared that "Rio de Janeiro" would be bulldozed upon finish. Exacerbating the situation, an European sadness after the second's end Balkan War in August 1913 decreased Brazil's capacity to get outside credits. This harmonized with a breakdown in Brazil's espresso and elastic fares, the last because of the loss of the Brazilian elastic imposing business model to British estates in the Far East. The cost of espresso declined by 20 percent and Brazilian fares of it dropped 12.5 percent somewhere in the range of 1912 and 1913; elastic saw a comparative decrease of 25 and 36.6 percent, separately. The Brazilian Navy later guaranteed that selling "Rio de Janeiro" was a strategic choice, so they could have two divisions of war vessels: two with 12-inch firearms (the "Minas Geraes" class), and two with 15-inch weapons.
