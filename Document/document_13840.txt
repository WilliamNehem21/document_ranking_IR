In spite of the fact that the Mr. Hankey short film was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related vivified short movies called "The Spirit of Christmas", which filled in as forerunners toward the "South Park" arrangement. At the point when the shorts started to create enthusiasm for a conceivable TV arrangement, Parker and Stone initially imagined the possibility of a "South Park"- like show with four kids characters, however with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's principle hero; they wanted to call it "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the plan to companion Brian Graden, at that point a TV official with the Fox Broadcasting Company, yet he dismissed it and stated, as indicated by Matt Stone, "I'm not putting crap on my system". Parker and Stone adjusted their unique thought into a show rotating around the South Park town and four kids without Mr. Hankey as a hero, yet they intended to resuscitate the character as a minor supporting job in a future scene. Afterward, when Comedy Central communicated enthusiasm for the arrangement, Parker and Stone raised the possibility of a Mr. Hankey scene amid dealings with the system officials. Parker asserted amid a gathering, he stated, "One thing we need to know before we truly go any further: what is your opinion about talking crap?" The administrators were open to the thought, which Parker said was one of the principle reasons he and Stone chose to sign on with the channel.
