The soonest felids are known from the Oligocene of Europe, for example, "Proailurus", and the most punctual one with saber-tooth highlights is the Miocene class "Pseudaelurus". The skull and mandible morphology of the soonest saber-toothed felines was like that of the advanced blurred panthers ("Neofelis"). The heredity further adjusted to the accuracy murdering of expansive creatures by creating extended canine teeth and more extensive expands, in the process yielding high chomp compel. As their canines turned out to be longer, the assortments of the felines turned out to be increasingly hearty for immobilizing prey. In determined smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar area of the spine and the tail wound up abbreviated, as did the rear appendages. In light of mitochondrial DNA groupings extricated from fossils, the heredities of "Homotherium" and "Smilodon" are assessed to have wandered around 18 Ma prior. The most punctual types of "Smilodon" is "S.ÃÂ gracilis", which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years back (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of "Megantereon", from which it presumably advanced. "Megantereon" itself had entered North America from Eurasia amid the Pliocene, alongside "Homotherium". "S.ÃÂ gracilis" achieved the northern locales of South America in the Early Pleistocene as a component of the Great American Interchange. The more youthful "Smilodon" species are likely gotten from "S.ÃÂ gracilis". "S.ÃÂ fatalis" existed 1.6 millionÃ¢ÂÂ 10,000 years prior (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and supplanted "S.ÃÂ gracilis" in North America. "S.ÃÂ populator" existed 1 millionÃ¢ÂÂ 10,000 years prior (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it happened in the eastern pieces of South America.
