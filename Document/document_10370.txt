Streets around the track were shut to the general population at 5ÃÂ am on the morning of the race. A draw occurred among the thirteen groups to decide the beginning request, and relegate each group a number. Every one of a group's three passages was doled out a letter, one of "A", "B", or "C". Two lines of vehicles shaped behind the begin line at Montfort: autos denoted "An" in one line and autos checked "B" in the other. Vehicles relegated the letter "C" were the last away; they framed a solitary line along the edge of the track with the goal that any autos which had finished their first circuit of the track would almost certainly pass. Vehicles were dispatched at 90-second interims, starting at 6ÃÂ am. Lorraine-Dietrich driver Fernand Gabriel (numbered "1A") was planned to be the main rival to begin, however he slowed down hanging in the balance and couldn't restart his vehicle before the FIAT of Vincenzo Lancia, who was next in line, headed out. Renault's lead driver, the Hungarian Ferenc Szisz, began straightaway, and behind him Victor HÃÂ©mery of Darracq, Paul Baras of Brasier, Camille Jenatzy of Mercedes, Louis Rigolly of Gobron-BrilliÃÂ© and Alessandro Cagno of Itala. Philippe Tavenaux of GrÃÂ©goire, planned straightaway, was unfit to begin; the main other non-starter was the sole Vulpes of Marius Barriaux, which was pulled back before the race when it was observed to be over as far as possible. The remainder of the thirty-two startersÃ¢ÂÂthe ClÃÂ©ment-Bayard of "de la Touloubre", numbered "13C"Ã¢ÂÂ left the begin line at 6:49:30ÃÂ am.
