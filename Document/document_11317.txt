Hemingway went on safari to Africa in 1933 with his second spouse Pauline and constantly planned to return. That visit enlivened Hemingway's "Snows of Kilimanjaro" distributed in "The Green Hills of Africa", surely understood pieces of the Hemingway standard. After two decades in 1953, having wrapped up" The Old Man and the Sea", he arranged a trek to Africa to visit his child Patrick who lived in Tanganyika. Whenever "Look" magazine offered to send him to Africa, paying $15,000 for costs, $10,000 for rights to a 3500 word piece about the outing, and Earl Theisen as official picture taker to run with him, he immediately acknowledged. Hemingway and Mary left Cuba in June, making a trip first to Europe to make courses of action and leaving from Venice to Tanganyika a couple of months after the fact. They touched base in August, and Hemingway was excited to be assigned as a privileged officer, writing in a letter, "because of crisis (Mau resistance) been acting diversion officer". Philip Percival, Hemingway's safari control in 1933, joined the couple for the four-month campaign; they went from the banks of the Salengai, where Earl Theisen captured Hemingway with a crowd of elephants, to the Kimana Swamp, the Rift Valley and after that on to visit Patrick in focal Tanganyika. Subsequent to visiting Patrick at his homestead, they agreed to two months on the north slants of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Amid this period Percival left their camp to come back to his ranch, leaving Hemingway as diversion superintendent with neighborhood scouts answering to him. Hemingway was glad to be an amusement superintendent and trusted a book would happen to the experience.
