In 1873, Spanish novelist Antonio de Trueba published the purported reminiscences of Goya's gardener, Isidro, on the genesis of the series. de Trueba claims to have spoken to Isidro in 1836, when the gardener recalled accompanying Goya to the hill of Principe Pio to sketch the victims of the executions of 3 May 1808. Goya scholars are sceptical of the account; Nigel Glendinning described it as a "romantic fantasy", and detailed its many inaccuracies.
Detailing and protesting the ugliness of life is a common theme throughout the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego VelÃ¡zquez to Pablo Picasso's "Guernica" (1937). Reflecting on "The Disasters of War", biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth "be seen andÂ ... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see itÂ ... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say." The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian lifeâprobably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as "Les Grandes MisÃ¨res de la guerre" (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisÂ XIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.
