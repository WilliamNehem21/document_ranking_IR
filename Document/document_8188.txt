On July 17, 2015, Leblanc marked as a free operator to a one-year contract with the New York Islanders. Subsequent to neglecting to verify a spot in New York's lineup and being appointed to New York's AHL member, Bridgeport Sound Tigers, the group consented to discharge him from his agreement and he immediately marked with HC Slovan Bratislava of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Visa issues at first kept Leblanc from joining the group, so he was credited to MsHK ÃÂ½ilina of the Slovak Extraliga. When cleared to join Slovan, Leblanc just played seven diversions, neglecting to record a point, before being discharged. He was censured by the mentor, MiloÃÂ¡ ÃÂÃÂ­ha, for playing "un-Canadian" (not sufficiently physical). As the KHL had a point of confinement on remote players, Leblanc should have been among the best players to hold his place; the mentor did not judge Leblanc to fulfill that guideline. Rather, he marked with Lausanne HC of the Swiss National League A (NLA). He completed the season with them, scoring one objective in four diversions, and chose to resign in June. He was viewed as one of the Canadiens' greatest draft busts in the period somewhere in the range of 2000 and 2009, having neglected to achieve the potential expected at the season of his determination.
