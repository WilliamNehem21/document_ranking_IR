We can likewise evaluate the measure of land expected to create this measure of grain, on account of Wolfram Eberhard who "assesses the normal yield as being 1.0 to 1.5 "shih" per mu," however Hsu takes note of that, "exceptional returns could reach as much as 6.4 "hu" per "mu"." Swann gives 1 shi Ã§ÂÂ³ (which she deciphers as "picul" with a weight of "64 lbs. 8.8 oz.") as somewhere in the range of 1 and 2 "hu", contingent upon the kind of grain. In light of on Eberhard's yields and Swann's scope of transformation among "shi" and "hu", a rancher would require between around 85 and 254 "mu" (between about 9.7 and 29 sections of land) so as to deliver the 127 "hu" of grain Eberhard regards important to the subsistence of a group of five. Different researchers give different numbers, in any case. Hsu claims that 50 "mu" (about 5.7 sections of land) was in truth "the grounds required for subsistence living," while Wang Zhongshu computes that "there was on the normal 24.6 mou per family, or under 6 mou per individual (with each mou comparable to 456 square m)." Both Li Kui and Chao Cuo guaranteed that 100 "mu" was the measure of land required to help a family, however it ought to be noticed that the measure of land signified by "mu" had changed between Li Kui's time and Chao Cuo's.
