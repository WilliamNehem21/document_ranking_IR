"Kalidas" is the primary sound film to be delivered in South Indian film, and the first in Tamil. It depended on the life of the Sanskrit artist and dramatist KÃÂlidÃÂsa. The movie was delivered by Ardeshir Irani, who coordinated India's first stable movie "Alam Ara", and was coordinated by his previous associate, H. M. Reddy, for the studio Imperial Movietone. P. G. Venkatesan was picked to assume the title job. L. V. PrasadÃ¢ÂÂwho later established Prasad StudiosÃ¢ÂÂshowed up in a comic job as a sanctuary minister. Theater artiste T. P. Rajalakshmi was picked to play the female hero; as per film student of history Randor Guy, she was the "programmed decision to play the courageous woman." Before this, Rajalakshmi had acted in numerous quiet movies, and "Kalidas" was her first stable film. Supporting jobs were played by Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila, and M. S. Santhanalakshmi. The sound was recorded by German professionals utilizing German-made hardware. "Kalidas" was shot in Bombay (presently Mumbai) on the arrangements of "Alam Ara"; it was finished in eight days, utilizing either or of film, as sources contrast. Film student of history Film News Anandan expressed that "Kalidas" "was delivered in a rush, and was in fact imperfect."
