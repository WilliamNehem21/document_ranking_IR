An ice center is a vertical section through an ice sheet, inspecting the layers that framed through a yearly cycle of snowfall and soften. As snow amasses, each layer goes ahead lower layers, making them denser until they transform into firn. Firn isn't thick enough to keep air from getting away; however at a thickness of about 830ÃÂ kg/m it swings to ice, and the air inside is fixed into air pockets that catch the creation of the air at the time the ice framed. The profundity at which this happens shifts with area, yet in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64ÃÂ m to 115ÃÂ m. Since the rate of snowfall changes from site to site, the age of the firn when it swings to ice shifts a lot. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the profundity is 77 m and the ice is 230 years of age; at Dome C in Antarctica the profundity is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers develop, the weight increments, and at about 1500ÃÂ m the precious stone structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, permitting air particles to move into the cubic gems and structure a clathrate. The air pockets vanish and the ice turns out to be progressively straightforward.
