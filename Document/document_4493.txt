Since its execution in late 1998 the posting framework has been vigorously scrutinized. Ichiro Suzuki's operator commented that "the player actually gets zero favorable position from [the posting system]... the Japanese groups advantage by holding the players prisoner". Wear Nomura considered the procedure a "slave sell off". A significant part of the analysis of the framework comes from its compelling NPB players to arrange their agreements exclusively with the MLB group that presented the most elevated offer. "The Japan Times" writer Marty Kuehnert trusts that since no other group is permitted to submit focused counter-offers, arrangements result in compensations beneath the player's reasonable worth. Kuehnert additionally trusts the framework encourages an "accept the only choice available" circumstance; if the group and the player have not settled contract exchanges before the finish of a 30-day time frame, the group can make a low offer realizing that the player's solitary other alternative is to play in Japan for one more year. It has been proposed this is an infringement of the Anti-Monopoly Act, a Japanese antitrust law that denies parties from consenting to a worldwide arrangement or contract that "contains such issues as establish an irrational limitation of exchange or unjustifiable business rehearses".
