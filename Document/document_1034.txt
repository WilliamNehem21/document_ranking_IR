Anna was hitched: Bede alludes to the holy person SÃÂ¦thryth as "little girl of the spouse of Anna, lord of the East Angles". In Abbott Folcard's "Life of St Botolph", written in the eleventh century, Botolph is portrayed as having been at one time the cleric to the sisters of a lord, ÃÂthelmund, whose mother was named SÃÂ¦wara. Folcard names two of SÃÂ¦wara's family as ÃÂthelhere and ÃÂthelwold. Since these are the names of two of Anna's siblings, Steven Plunkett proposes that it is "enticing" to think about that SÃÂ¦wara was hitched to Anna, and that ÃÂthelmund may either be Anna's full name, or the name of a generally obscure East Anglian sub-lord. The "Liber Eliensis" names Hereswith, the sister of Hild, abbess of Whitby, as Anna's better half and the mother of SÃÂ¦thryth, Seaxburh of Ely and ÃÂthelthryth. Notwithstanding, the "Liber Eliensis" is respected with alert by antiquarians: Rosalind Love says that the medieval authors who deciphered Bede's data about Hereswith made an "incorrect supposition" in regards to her association with Anna and his family. History specialists presently trust that Hereswith was Anna's sister-in-law and that around the time that she wedded into the East Anglian illustrious family, Anna had just been lord for 10 years.
