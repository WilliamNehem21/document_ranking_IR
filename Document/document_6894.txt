Mary Shelley extended and reexamined the Roman writer Ovid's account of Proserpine, which is a piece of his bigger "Transforms". The story depends on the Greek legend of Demeter and Persephone, which clarifies the difference in the seasons through Persephone's visits to the Underworld: when she is limited to Hades' domain, harvest time and winter spread the earth, and when she comes back to live with her mom, spring and summer sprout. The fantasy portrays the triumph of male brutality over female reproduction. Like Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron, Mary Shelley was keen on reworking the traditional fantasies; in any case, as other Romantic ladies essayists, she was especially keen on testing their man centric topics. In reexamining the Proserpine fantasy, she put ladies and their capacity at the focal point of the account. For instance, Ovid speaks to Proserpine as "an unreflective kid, adamantly straying after blooms in childish relinquish" while "Shelley depicts Proserpine as a mindful, sympathetic youthful" who needs to discover blossoms for her mom. Ovid's variant of the fantasy centers around viciousness, especially the snatching and assault of Proserpine, while Shelley's play centers around the thrilling quest for Proserpine. Her form features Ceres and the sprites' melancholy and Proserpine's own craving to escape from the Underworld rather than the assault (the assault happens offstage). Interestingly, other nineteenth-century adjustments regularly extended the assault scene, romanticizing it and transforming it into a scene of romance.
