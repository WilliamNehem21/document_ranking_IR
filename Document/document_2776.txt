In September, the collection entered "Billboard"s collection outlines; the most elevated position "Freewheelin" came to was number 22, yet it in the long run came to offer one million duplicates in the U.S. Dylan himself came to recognize "Freewheelin"' as the collection that denoted the beginning of his prosperity. Amid his debate with Albert Grossman, Dylan expressed in a testimony: "Despite the fact that I didn't have any acquaintance with it at the time, the second collection was bound to turn into an incredible achievement since it was to incorporate 'Blowin' in the Wind'." Besides "Blowin' in the Wind", "Experts of War", "Young lady from the North Country", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" have all been acclaimed as artful culminations, and they have been backbones of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The collection's harmony between genuine topic and levity, sincere blame dispensing melodies and strange jokes caught a wide group of onlookers, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of worldwide achievement. John Lennon reviewed: "In Paris in 1964 was the first occasion when I at any point heard Dylan by any stretch of the imagination. Paul got the record ("The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan") from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't quit playing it. We as a whole went potty about Dylan."
