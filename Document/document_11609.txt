Pentland enrolled as a private in the AIF on 5ÃÂ March 1915, cruising for Egypt with the twelfth Light Horse Regiment on board HMAT A29 "Suevic" on 13ÃÂ June. In August, his unit sent to Gallipoli, where he battled as a heavy weapons specialist before being hospitalized the next month, experiencing typhoid fever; he was cleared to England in December. Resolved to abandon the channels in the wake of recouping, he volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and was released from the AIF on 21ÃÂ February 1916 to take up his bonus as an impermanent second lieutenant in the RFC. His first solo trip in a Maurice Farman Longhorn at Brooklands, following two hours of double guidance, finished with him overshooting the runway and smashing in a sewage ranch, yet he was safe and quickly embraced a second solo endeavor, landing effectively. It was at Brooklands that he was first nicknamed "Jerry". In the wake of finishing pilot preparing, he was presented on France in June, flying B.E.2s with No.ÃÂ 16 Squadron. Despite the fact that the moderate and helpless B.E.2 was considered "Fokker grain" by its groups, Pentland and his onlooker immediately figured out how to score the previous' first airborne triumph, cutting down a German "Eindecker" over Habourdin on 9ÃÂ June. He was then presented on No.ÃÂ 29 Squadron and was changing over to DH.2 "pusher" warriors when he broke his leg playing rugby. Subsequent to recuperating, he taught at London Colney until June 1917, when he joined No.ÃÂ 19 Squadron, flying SPAD S.VIIs. This would turn into Pentland's most loved sort because of its quality and mobility, despite the fact that it must be 'flown' continually and was unforgiving at low speed.
