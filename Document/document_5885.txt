The 1919 season was the first in which the Yankees played recreations at the Polo Grounds on Sundays; up to that point, blue laws had prohibited Sunday baseball in New York state. The Yankees' participation dramatically increased in 1919, ascending to around 619,000. The Giants before long moved to constrain the Yankees out of the Polo Grounds, with an end goal to verify more Sunday home recreations. On December 26, 1919, the Yankees made a concurrence with the Red Sox to buy outfielder Babe Ruth for $25,000 money and $75,000 in promissory notes. The arrangement, which was reported on January 5, 1920, was classified "the most popular exchange in games" by creator Glenn Stout. Subsequent to tying for the MLB grand slam lead in 1918 with the Athletics' Tilly Walker (with 11), Ruth broke the single-season record with 29 of every 1919. In the meantime, he looked for another agreement that would twofold his $10,000 yearly compensation. After the exchange, Boston did not win a different universe Series title until 2004; a supposed curse against the Red Sox, which was known as the Curse of the Bambino (after an epithet for Ruth), was first raised when they lost the 1986 World Series and turned out to be broadly talked about after Dan Shaughnessy created a book with the title. The arrangement turned into an image of "how things [would] dependably turn out badly for the Red Sox and ideal for the Yankees", as per Stout.
