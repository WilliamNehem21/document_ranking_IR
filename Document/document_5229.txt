As advancement advanced, the 757 progressively left from its 727 beginnings and embraced components from the 767, which was a while ahead being developed. To decrease hazard and cost, Boeing consolidated structure take a shot at the two twinjets, bringing about shared highlights, for example, inside fittings and taking care of attributes. PC supported structure, first connected on the 767, was utilized for more than 33% of the 757's plan illustrations.

Cathode-beam tube (CRT) shading shows supplanted regular electromechanical instruments, with expanded computerization wiping out the flight engineer position normal to three-man cockpits. In the wake of finishing a short transformation course, pilots appraised on the 757 could be fit the bill to fly the 767 and the other way around, inferable from their structure likenesses.
