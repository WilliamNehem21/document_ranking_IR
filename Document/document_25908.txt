"Triaenops menamena" is a medium-sized species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown to gray. It is larger and darker than "Paratriaenops auritus" and "P.Â furculus". Among living "Triaenops" species, it is smaller than "T.Â persicus" and "T.Â afer", but somewhat larger than "T.Â parvus". The extinct "Triaenops goodmani", which is known only from three mandibles (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped noseleaf (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth), "T.Â menamena" has the trident structure characteristic of "Triaenops" and "Paratriaenops": three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In "T.Â menamena", the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in "Paratriaenops". The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal process and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches on the inner side. The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6Â mm long. The wing membrane is dark and translucent and the end of the tail usually projects from the uropatagium (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305Â mm (10.6 to 12.0Â in).
