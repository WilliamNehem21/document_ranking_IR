In 1990, Gibson added to "Visionary San Francisco", a display at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art appeared from June 14 to August 26. He composed a short story, "Skinner's Room", set in a rotting San Francisco in which the San FranciscoÃ¢ÂÂ Oakland Bay Bridge was shut and taken over by the destitute Ã¢ÂÂ a setting Gibson at that point nitty gritty in the Bridge set of three. The story motivated a commitment to the show by draftsmen Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that imagined a San Francisco in which the rich live in cutting edge, sun oriented controlled towers, over the run down city and its disintegrating span. The planners display highlighted Gibson on a screen talking about the future and perusing from "Skinner's Room". "The New York Times" hailed the display as "a standout amongst the most eager, and praiseworthy, endeavors to address the domain of design and urban communities that any historical center in the nation has mounted in the most recent decade", regardless of calling Ming and Hodgetts' response to Gibson's commitment "an incredible, yet pitiful and not somewhat pessimistic, work". A marginally extraordinary form of the short story was included a year later in "Omni".
