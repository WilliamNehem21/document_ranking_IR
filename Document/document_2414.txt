Waugh had chosen in the late spring of 1955 that he would sell Piers Court. By October 1956 the deal had been finished and he had obtained another home in the Somerset town of Combe Florey. While the turmoil of the move went on around him, Waugh chipped away at the novel; in November he moved to his pre-war bolthole, the Easton Court Hotel at Chagford, where he would have liked to complete the book. As the date for the defamation body of evidence against Nancy Spain and the "Express" drew closer, Waugh was engaged with a second slander activity, against the writer and columnist Rebecca West and Pan Books, an extra diversion that deferred the novel's fruition. In January 1957 Waugh changed the completion, making a circularity with an arrival to the words that present the novel, and furthermore gave the book its caption, "A Conversation Piece". Waugh did not clarify his decision of wording for the caption, however David Wykes in his abstract account trusts it is an amusing reference to the customary British works of art of families and companions in parties; for this situation the "discussion" is with foes, not companions. The principle title is a reverberation of George Meredith's Victorian epic "The Ordeal of Richard Feverel". Before the finish of January 1957 the book was in the distributers' hands.
