On 10 August, Patton entered the getting tent of the medical clinic, addressing the harmed there. Patton moved toward Bennett, who was clustered and shuddering, and asked what the inconvenience was. "It's my nerves," Bennett reacted. "I can't stand the shelling any longer." Patton apparently wound up irritated at him, slapping him over the face. He started hollering: "Your nerves, heck, you are only a goddamned quitter. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these daring men who have been shot at seeing this yellow jerk staying here crying." Patton then allegedly slapped Bennett once more, thumping his protective cap liner off, and requested the getting officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to concede him. Patton then undermined Bennett, "You're returning to the cutting edges and you may get shot and slaughtered, however you're going to battle. On the off chance that you don't, I'll stand you facing a divider and have a terminating squad slaughter you intentionally. Actually, I should shoot you myself, you goddamned crying defeatist." Upon saying this, Patton hauled out his gun threateningly, inciting the medical clinic's officer, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically isolate the two. Patton left the tent, hollering to medicinal officers to send Bennett back to the forefronts.
