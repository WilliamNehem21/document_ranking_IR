Much of the Saturn's library comes from Sega's arcade ports, including "Daytona USA", "The House of the Dead", "Last Bronx", "Sega Rally Championship", the "Virtua Cop" series, the "Virtua Fighter" series, and "Virtual-On". Saturn ports of 2D Capcom fighting games including "Darkstalkers 3", "Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter", and "Street Fighter Alpha 3" were noted for their faithfulness to their arcade counterparts. "Fighters Megamix", developed by Sega AM2 for the Saturn rather than arcades, combined characters from "Fighting Vipers" and "Virtua Fighter" to positive reviews. Highly rated Saturn exclusives include "Panzer Dragoon Saga", "Dragon Force", "Guardian Heroes", "Nights", "Panzer Dragoon II Zwei", and "Shining Force III". PlayStation games such as "", "Resident Evil", and "Wipeout 2097" received Saturn ports with mixed results. Lobotomy Software's "PowerSlave" featured some of the most impressive 3D graphics on the system, leading Sega to contract them to produce Saturn ports of "Duke Nukem 3D" and "Quake". While Electronic Arts' limited support for the Saturn and Sega's failure to develop a football game for the 1996 fall season gave Sony the lead in the sports genre, "Sega Sports" published Saturn sports games including the well-regarded "World Series Baseball" and "Sega Worldwide Soccer" series. With about 600 official releases, the Saturn's library is nearly twice as large as the Nintendo 64's.
