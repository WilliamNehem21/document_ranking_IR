Beginning in November, the I SquadronÃ¢ÂÂless the "Wittelsbach"- class ships, which were as yet busy with preliminariesÃ¢ÂÂled various short travels, finishing in the yearly winter voyage that started on 1 December. The boats steamed into the Kattegat and halted in Frederikshavn, Denmark, before proceeding to Bergen, where they remained from 6 to 10 December. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the remainder of the squadron came back to Kiel, arriving two days after the fact. On 2 April 1903, the squadron went to ocean once more, and started gunnery preparing two days after the fact. These activities proceeded for the remainder of the month, hindered just by substantial tempests. A noteworthy preparing journey pursued the following month; on 10 May the boats withdrew the Elbe stream and advanced into the Atlantic. They traveled south to Spain, passing Ushant on 14 May and achieving the Iberian Peninsula five days after the fact. There, they directed a surveillance practice off Pontevedra before tying down in Vigo on 20 May. Sovereign Heinrich left "Kaiser Friedrich III" for a visit to Madrid. After he restored, the squadron left Spain on 30 May. The boats went through the Strait of Dover on 3 June and proceeded into the Kattegat. There, they rendezvoused with the torpedo vessels of the I "Torpedobootsflotille" (Torpedo Boat Flotilla)Ã¢ÂÂ instructed by "KorvettenkapitÃÂ¤n" (Lieutenant Commander) Franz von HipperÃ¢ÂÂfor a fake assault on the fortresses at Kiel.
