Meryle Secrest, in her biography of Rodgers, theorizes that "South Pacific" marks a transition for the pair "between heroes and heroines who are more or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them". Lovensheimer, however, points out that this pattern really only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, "The King and I" and "The Sound of Music", and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words. He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with "South Pacific", involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest's world to be successful and accepted herself. He notes that both "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel" involve a man entering his wife's world, Curly in "Oklahoma!" about to become a farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in "Carousel" fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker. Lovensheimer deems "Allegro" to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe's world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage. He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.
