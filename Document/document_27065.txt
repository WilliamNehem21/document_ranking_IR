Two resistance movements emerged following the invasion: the communist-led, multi-ethnic Partisans, and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, although during 1941, within the occupied territory, even the Partisans consisted almost entirely of Serbs. The Partisans were led by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito; the Chetniks were led by Colonel DraÅ¾a MihailoviÄ, an officer in the interwar Royal Yugoslav Army. The two movements had widely divergent goals. Whereas the Partisans sought to turn Yugoslavia into a communist state under Tito's leadership, the Chetniks sought a return to the pre-war "status quo", whereby the Yugoslav monarchyâand, by extension, Serb political hegemonyâwould be restored. Communist resistance commenced in early July, shortly after the invasion of the Soviet Union, targeting both the Germans and the puppet authorities. By late August 1941, the Partisans and Chetniks were carrying out joint attacks against the Germans. The Partisans were well organised and many of their commanders had ample military experience, having fought in the Spanish Civil War. Within several months of the invasion, they had 8,000Â fighters spread across 21Â detachments in Serbia alone. Many Chetniks were either veterans of the Balkan Wars and World WarÂ I or former members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. They boasted around 20,000Â fighters in the German-occupied territory of Serbia at the time of the massacre.
