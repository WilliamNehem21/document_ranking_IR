In a key scene in the contention, Set explicitly mishandles Horus. Set's infringement is incompletely intended to debase his opponent, however it likewise includes gay want, with regards to one of Set's significant qualities, his mighty and aimless sexuality. In the most punctual record of this scene, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual experience starts when Set requests to engage in sexual relations with Horus, who concedes to the condition that Set will give Horus a portion of his quality. The experience places Horus in threat, in light of the fact that in Egyptian custom semen is an intense and hazardous substance, much the same as toxin. As per a few messages, Set's semen enters Horus' body and makes him sick, yet in "Contendings", Horus upsets Set by getting Set's semen in his grasp. Isis strikes back by putting Horus' semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's thrashing ends up obvious when this semen shows up on his temple as a brilliant circle. He has been impregnated with his opponent's seed and thus "conceives an offspring" to the plate. In "Contendings", Thoth takes the circle and places it all alone head; in prior records, it is Thoth who is delivered by this abnormal birth.
