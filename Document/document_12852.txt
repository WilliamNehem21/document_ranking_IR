In 1925, numismatist George H. Clapp found a Lafayette dollar that marginally varied from distributed depictions. He inquired about the issue further over the next decade, and found two extra assortments. These exist in light of the fact that different bites the dust, for both front-side and turn around, were utilized in striking the Lafayette piece, and the passes on were not indistinguishable. Swiatek, writing in 2012, noticed a fifth pass on mix he had found, and analyzed pictures of many Lafayette dollars he possessed or that were on the Internet. He revealed that two assortments joined for over 90% of the examples, with the staying ones a lot rarer. Along these lines, he estimated that the dollars were struck on something like two machines, not one as typically revealed, with the rarer assortments the aftereffect of substitution bites the dust being embedded as the first ones wore out. The distinctions are minor (for instance, regardless of whether the M in "America" is raised or even with the A that goes before it on the front, and subtleties of the palm branch on the turn around) and the currency is infrequently gathered by bite the dust type, implying that little premium esteem connects to the less regular assortments.
