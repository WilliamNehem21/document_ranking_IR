Sooner or later in the mid-1940s, most likely in summer 1945, Sibelius and Aino together consumed countless arranger's compositions on the stove in the lounge area at Ainola. There is no record of what was scorched; while most reporters accept that the Eighth Symphony was among the works crushed, KilpelÃÂ¤inen sees that there had been something like two compositions of the workÃ¢ÂÂthe first and Voigt's duplicateÃ¢ÂÂjust as portrayals and parts of prior variants. It is conceivable, says KilpelÃÂ¤inen, that Sibelius might not have consumed them all. Aino, who found the procedure agonizing, reviewed later that the consuming seemed to facilitate Sibelius' brain: "After this, my better half seemed more settled and his disposition was increasingly hopeful. It was a cheerful time". The most hopeful translation of his activity, as indicated by "The Philadelphia Inquirer's" music faultfinder David Patrick Stearns, is that he disposed of old drafts of the orchestra to clear his psyche for a new beginning. In 1947, in the wake of visiting Ainola, the conductor Nils-Eric Fougstedt professed to have seen a duplicate of the Eighth on the rack, with isolated choral parts. The musicologist Erkki Salmenhaara sets the possibility of two burnings: that of 1945 which crushed early material, and another after Sibelius at last perceived that he would never total the work agreeable to him.
