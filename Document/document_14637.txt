Notwithstanding those struck at the Royal Mint, in 1912, 1918 and 1919 a few pennies were created at the Heaton Mint in Birmingham, and are recognized by a "H" mint imprint to one side of the date. In 1918 and 1919 some were delivered at the Kings Norton Metal Co. Ltd, likewise in Birmingham, and have a "KN" there. The two firms likewise given spaces to the Royal Mint for striking into pennies from 1912 to 1919. This was because of extreme interest for little change, at first brought about by the 1911 execution of the National Insurance Act by the Asquith government, and from that point by the war years. Likewise nourishing the interest for pennies were programmed opening machines, a pattern saw as right on time as 1898. To lessen the quantity of worn pieces in trade, the Royal Mint had in 1908 consented to acknowledge the arrival of worn pre-1895 pennies and halfpennies through banks and post workplaces, and from 1922, pieces dated 1860 to 1894 would be reclaimed in any condition, however they stayed adequate available for use. The pre-1860 copper penny had been demonetised after 1869 in Britain (however acknowledged at full assumed worth by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the states.
