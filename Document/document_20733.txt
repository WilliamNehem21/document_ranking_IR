The Rodrigues rail was a flightless rail with bright grey plumage, perhaps flecked with white. Its beak and legs were red, and it had a red, naked area (or wattle) around its eyes. Its exact size is unknown, but it was about the size of a chicken, and somewhat smaller than the related red rail. Subfossil remains exhibit a large variation in size, which may reflect sexual dimorphism. The cranium of the Rodrigues rail was slightly elongate, convex in every direction, and was long and wide. The cranium had a narrow, long frontal region, at its least width. The beak varied greatly in size and shape; some specimens had short and almost straight beaks, and others had much longer beaks (up to one third longer) that were prominently curved. It is unknown whether this was related to the overall size of an individual bird or to sexual dimorphism. The culmen of the beak was almost straight above the nostril, and the nasal bone was slightly longer than the cranium. The beak was up to long, the lower jaw up to long, and at its greatest depth. The scapula (shoulder blade) was long, the humerus ranged from , and the ulna from . The pelvis was large and strongly built in proportion to the size of the bird, was long, wide at the front, and wide at the back. The femur ranged from in length, the tibia from , and the metatarsus was long.
