As these changes were being completed, questions emerged regarding whether the choices were really made by Tkach himself or by others in the congregation authority. The congregation authority around then included Mike Feazell, official associate and publication consultant to Tkach, Greg Albrecht, proofreader of "The Plain Truth", and Joseph Tkach, Jr., the child of Joseph W. Tkach, and church organization chief. One paranoid notion expressed that the choices did not originate from Tkach himself but rather from the congregation initiative. Another expressed that the thoughts originated from Tkach yet he framed them right off the bat in his profession, kept them escaped Armstrong, and just enabled the plans to happen as expected after Armstrong's passing. Feazell claims that the changes were at first determined by a reconsideration of chapel writing that was for the most part prodded by inquiries presented by chapel clergymen and individuals. These examinations were finished by Tkach and Feazell, however a ultimate conclusions and endorsement of materials for production were made by Tkach. By 1990, Tkach approved the development of a "Doctrinal Manual Group", comprising of thirteen clergymen and Ambassador College employees with the mission of guaranteeing doctrinal consistency, refinement, and exhortation to the Pastor General. Tkach investigated and settled on an official choices on all proposals made by the gathering.
