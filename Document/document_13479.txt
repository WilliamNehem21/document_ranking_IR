"xx" was not a quick graph achievement, yet in the long run turned into a sleeper hit. It appeared at number 36 on the UK's Official Albums Chart and sold 4,180 duplicates in the main week after it was discharged, while in the United States it didn't graph higher than number 92 on the "Board" 200. The collection sold consistently for the following 44 weeks until July 2010, when its declaration as a Mercury Prize chosen one prompted a sharp increment in deals and a bounce from number 44 to 16 on the British outline. By at that point, it had sold in excess of 150,000 duplicates in the UK and 179,000 duplicates in the United States. "xx" stayed in the best 20 of the Official Albums Chart in the weeks paving the way to the Mercury Prize service. Following its success that week, it moved from number 16 to 3 on its most noteworthy week by week dealsÃ¢ÂÂ28,666 duplicatesÃ¢ÂÂand achieved a sum of 212,835 duplicates sold. As indicated by McCormick, "its triumph is an uncommon case of the Mercury Prize doing music sweethearts an administration." In the US, the collection achieved offers of 350,000 duplicates by June 2012 with predictable week by week deals amid its initial two years of discharge, which "Time" magazine's Melissa Locker said was "a significant accomplishment" in a period of music theft, media spilling, and YouTube.
