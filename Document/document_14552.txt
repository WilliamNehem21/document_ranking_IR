Kathie Lee Gifford, at that point a TV entertainer on the morning television show "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee", was the first of numerous famous people to be parodied in a "South Park" scene. The "South Park" makers said they picked Gifford totally at irregular, not founded on a specific reason or dislike for her. Soon after "Weight Gain 4000" broadcast, the newspaper "The Globe" procured Suzen Johnson to film herself enticing Frank Gifford, Kathie Lee's better half, for a news story. The episode was the first of what Parker and Stone called the "South Park Curse", in which something terrible or humiliating evidently happens to a superstar in the blink of an eye previously or after they were included in "South Park". Performing artist Karri Turner gave the voice of Gifford in "Weight Gain 4000", denoting her solitary visitor appearance on "South Park". Gifford shows up at a motorcade covered up inside an impenetrable glass bubble. The air pocket was roused by an appearance Pope John Paul II made in the Popemobile amid an excursion to Denver, which was gone to by Parker and Stone. They thought the structure of the Popemobile, which has an impenetrable corner incorporated with the back of a changed truck, was "comical". The plan of the trophy that Gifford was to provide for Cartman is a reference to Parker and Stone's 1997 film "Orgazmo".
