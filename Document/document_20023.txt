Bana is a motor racing enthusiast, and participates in various motor racing competitions in Australia. At the age of 14, he wanted to leave school to focus full-time on becoming a motor mechanic, but his father convinced him to complete school, advising him to avoid making his hobby a job. Bana purchased his first car, a 1974 XB Ford Falcon coupÃ©, at the age of 15 for A$1100 and, driving it, made his motor sport racing debut in Targa Tasmania 1996, a week-long race around Tasmania. (Bana has had this car for more than a quarter century. In 2009 he released a documentary named "Love The Beast". The film details the central role that racing and fixing this same car has played in his life and the lives of his friends.) In 2004, Bana purchased a Porsche 944 to compete in Australia's Porsche Challenge. Competing throughout 2004, he often finished in the top ten and in November, finished fourth at the Sandown event, a personal best. On 21 April 2007 Bana crashed his 1974 XB Falcon Coupe in the Targa Tasmania rally. Neither he nor his co-driver were injured. Bana appeared on the British motoring show "Top Gear" on 15 November 2009 as a guest for its "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" segment.
