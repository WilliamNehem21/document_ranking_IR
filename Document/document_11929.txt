Activity Tractable started at 12:00 on 14 August, when 800 Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax substantial aircraft of RAF Bomber Command struck German positions along the front. As with Totalize, huge numbers of the planes erroneously dropped their bombs shy of their objectives, causing 400 Polish and Canadian setbacks. Secured by a smoke screen set somewhere around their ordnance, two Canadian divisions moved advances. Despite the fact that their viewable pathway was decreased, German units still figured out how to exact extreme setbacks on the Canadian fourth Armored Division, which incorporated its Armored Brigade administrator Brigadier Leslie Booth, as the division pushed south toward Falaise. For the duration of the day, nonstop assaults by the Canadian fourth and Polish first Armored Divisions figured out how to compel an intersection of the Laison River. Constrained access to the traverse the Dives River permitted counterattacks by the German 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The town of Potigny tumbled to Polish powers in the late evening. Before the finish of the primary day, components of the Canadian third and fourth Divisions had achieved Point 159, straightforwardly north of Falaise, despite the fact that they had been unfit to break into the town. To support his hostile, Simonds requested the Canadian second Infantry Division to advance toward the front, with the expectation that this fortification would be adequate to empower his divisions to catch the town.
