Toward the beginning of July 2017, the eruv was finished in part of Upper Saddle River. Montvale acted first against the eruv, with Mayor Michael Ghassali issuing a stop work request on July 10, after the eruv affiliation had leased hardware and organized with neighborhood police to give security. Montvale experts protested in light of the fact that the lechis established a sign, illegal by ward law. This was done before development with the outcome that the eruv did not reach out into Montvale. On July 18, Upper Saddle River's lawyer sent a letter requesting the evacuation of the lechis that had been raised there, with a due date of July 26, yet the precinct consented to give them a chance to stay for the time being after two New York State inhabitants recorded suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark, mentioning a brief controlling request against the ward and Mayor Joanne Minichetti. The ward's understanding was in return for an endeavor from the eruv affiliation not to grow the eruv, and the movement for a limiting request was pulled back. The eruv was vandalized on July 26 and 27, requiring prompt fix work. Mahwah's township engineer, Mike Kelly, sent a letter to the eruv relationship on July 21, taking a position like Montvale's, and requesting the expulsion of the eruv by August 4. City hall leader Bill Laforet expressed, "This sends a solid message to the individuals who abuse our sign laws."
