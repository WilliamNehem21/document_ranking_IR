The ship's superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at that time. The fore-and-aft arresting gear was not intended to stop landing aircraftâthe landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwindâbut rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges used minimised turbulence.
"Furious" was not lengthened, but her beam was increased to and her average draught was now at deep load, deeper than before the conversion. She displaced at normal load and at deep load, over 3000 long tons more than her previous displacement. Her metacentric height was at deep load, a reduction of after her conversion. During the ship's post-conversion sea trials she reached . Her fuel capacity was increased by during her reconstruction, which increased her range to at a speed of or at a speed of .
