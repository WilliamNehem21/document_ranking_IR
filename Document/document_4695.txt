Norreis was delegated to the abbacy of Evesham Abbey in 1190 and was honored as abbot on 13 January 1190. He owed his arrangement to King Richard and to Baldwin's endeavors to make the rejection from Christ Church look less like a thrashing for the ecclesiastical overseer. Norreis likewise asserted that he got the workplace as a byproduct of unspecified administrations he rendered to Richard. There was no endeavor at a decision by the priests, a need which conflicted with ordinance law. Amid his residency of office, his priests blamed him for sex, inordinate drinking, intemperance, setting up top choices, starving the priests, and appropriating religious property for his very own utilization. A further offense was his propensity for wearing mainstream garments as opposed to the ascetic propensity recommended by the Benedictine Rule. Every one of these charges originate from one of his priests, the student of history Thomas of Marlborough, who composed a great part of the historical backdrop of Evesham known as the "Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham". Thomas' record of Norreis' standard is one-sided against the abbot and is a self-aggrandising record of how Thomas without any assistance triumphed over the two his and his nunnery's adversaries. Norreis benefited oversee for the nunnery, as it was while he was abbot that the intersection tower of the ascetic church was finished.
