The main realized fossil that was later named "Cetiosauriscus" incorporates the vast majority of the back portion of a skeleton just as a hindlimb (NHMUK R3078). Found in Cambridgeshire during the 1890s, it was portrayed by Arthur Smith Woodward in 1905 as another example of the species "Cetiosaurus leedsi". This was changed in 1927, when Friedrich von Huene discovered NHMUK R3078 and the "C. leedsi" type example to be excessively not quite the same as "Cetiosaurus", justifying its own family, which he named "Cetiosauriscus", which means ""Cetiosaurus"- like". "Cetiosauriscus leedsi" was alluded to the sauropod family Diplodocidae in view of likenesses in the tail and foot, and had the questionable or middle of the road species "Cetiosauriscus" "greppini", "C." "longus", and "C." "glymptonensis" allocated to it. In 1980, Alan Charig named another types of "Cetiosauriscus" for NHMUK R3078 in light of the absence of practically identical material to the kind of "C. leedsi"; this species was named Cetiosauriscus stewarti. In view of the poor condition of conservation of the "Cetiosauriscus leedsi" fossil, Charig sent an appeal to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to rather make "C. stewarti" the sort species. "Cetiosauriscus stewarti" turned into the most seasoned affirmed diplodocid until a phylogenetic examination distributed in 2003 rather found the species to have a place with Mamenchisauridae, and pursued by concentrates in 2005 and 2015 that discovered it outside Neosauropoda, while not a mamenchisaurid legitimate.
