Women of high status lived in seclusion at court and, through strategic marriages, were used to gain political power for their families. Despite their seclusion, some women wielded considerable influence, often achieved through competitive salons, dependent on the quality of those attending. IchijÅ's mother and Michinaga's sister, Senshi, had an influential salon, and Michinaga probably wanted ShÅshi to surround herself with skilled women such as Murasaki to build a rival salon.
ShÅshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki joined her court. According to Arthur Waley, ShÅshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living arrangements were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women writers such as Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emonâthe author of an early vernacular history, "The Tale of Flowering Fortunes". The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; but there is something not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not seem to me that in herself she is really a poet at all."
