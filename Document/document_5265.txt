All the writer's significant works and a considerable lot of the minor ones have been recorded. There have been various finished LP and CD sets of the nine orchestras, starting with Boult's Decca cycle of the 1950s, a large portion of which was recorded in the arranger's quality. Albeit infrequently organized, the musical dramas have fared well on circle. The most punctual account of a Vaughan Williams musical drama was "Hugh the Drover", in an abbreviated adaptation directed by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic accounts of "Hugh the Drover", "Sir John in Love", "Riders to the Sea", "The Poisoned Kiss", and "The Pilgrim's Progress". The greater part of the instrumental accounts have been by British ensembles and directors, however prominent non-British directors who have influenced chronicles of Vaughan Williams' attempts to incorporate Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Leopold Stokowski, and, most much of the time, AndrÃÂ© Previn, who led the London Symphony Orchestra in the principal complete stereo cycle of the orchestras, recorded somewhere in the range of 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most intently connected with Vaughan Williams' music on plate and in show in the ages after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley, Richard Hickox, Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis. Record organizations with broad arrangements of Vaughan Williams accounts incorporate EMI, Decca, Chandos, Hyperion and Naxos.
