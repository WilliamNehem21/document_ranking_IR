When balloting started on June 5 at the tradition in Cincinnati, Ohio, Pierce anticipated a majority, if not the required 66% larger part. On the principal ticket, he got just 122 votes, a large number of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass getting the rest. By the next morning fourteen tallies had been finished, yet none of the three primary competitors had the capacity to get 66% of the vote. Puncture, whose help had been gradually declining as the polls passed, guided his supporters to break for Douglas, pulling back his name in a final desperate attempt to crush Buchanan. Douglas, just 43 years old, trusted that he could be selected in 1860 on the off chance that he let the more established Buchanan win this time, and got confirmations from Buchanan's chiefs this would be the situation. After two increasingly stopped polls, Douglas' administrators pulled back his name, leaving Buchanan as the reasonable champ. To mollify the hit to Pierce, the tradition issued a goals of "inadequate support" in commendation of his organization and chose his partner, previous Kentucky Representative John C. Breckinridge, as the bad habit presidential chosen one. This misfortune denoted the main time in U.S. history that a chosen president who was a functioning possibility for re-appointment was not designated for a second term.
