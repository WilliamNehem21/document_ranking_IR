There are a few music classifications Nine Inch Nails has been depicted as, including elective shake, mechanical shake, modern move, modern, electro-mechanical, modern metal, and electronic shake. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that "Nine Inch Nails were the most well known modern gathering ever and were to a great extent in charge of conveying the music to a mass crowd". Reznor has never alluded to his very own work as mechanical music, however confesses to acquiring methods from such early modern groups as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Notwithstanding the difference between those craftsmen at first working under the expression "modern" and Nine Inch Nails, it has turned out to be normal in journalistic depictions of Reznor's assemblage of work to portray it all things considered. Reznor recognized in "Turn" magazine that "Down in It" was affected by early Skinny Puppy, especially the band's tune "Burrow It"; different tunes from "Lovely Hate Machine" and "With Teeth" have been portrayed as synth-pop. Assessing "The Fragile", commentator Steve Cooper noticed that the collection compares broadly shifted classes, for example, solo piano in "The Frail" and drum and bass components in "Starfuckers, Inc." Ambient music has been highlighted in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on "Apparitions IÃ¢ÂÂ IV" (which is explicitly dim encompassing), "Dithering Marks", "The Downward Spiral", "The Slip", and "The Fragile".
