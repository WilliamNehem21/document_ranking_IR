McLachlan was designated Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1959, preceding being presented on Washington, DC, as attachÃÂ© heading up the Australian Joint Services Staff in 1961. Amid his term in the US, Australia requested the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing plane as a trade for the Canberra. In spite of what was touted as a firm timetable and cost plan for the request, McLachlan trusted to an associate that he had genuine worries about when and if the RAAF would really get the F-111, and what the last expense would be. As per Air Force antiquarian Alan Stephens, "notwithstanding for such a clever and scornful man as McLachlan, that was to demonstrate an agonizingly farsighted perception", as the new aircraft was conveyed six years late and hugely over spending plan. Following his arrival from Washington, McLachlan moved toward becoming Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) in February 1964. As AMSE he sat reporting in real time Board, the administration's controlling body that comprised of its most senior officers, led by the Chief of the Air Staff. In this position he attempted to expand the extent of tertiary instructed supply officers, following comparative accomplishments among building officers in the RAAF's Technical Branch. He was delegated a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 New Year's Honors, the reference taking note of especially his chairmanship of the two "noteworthy" boards of trustees that redesigned RAAF College and the Air Force's direction structure in the late 1950s. The utilization of electronic information handling turned out to be increasingly across the board amid McLachlan's residency as AMSE, and by 1968 the RAAF's supply framework had been mechanized.
