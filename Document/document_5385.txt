Clashing reports have been made as to its favored natural surroundings; two papers propose it favored channels to floodplains, yet another recommends it favored the inverse. The conceivable inclination for channels depends on the overall wealth of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones, speaking to channel conditions, in contrast with mudstones, speaking to floodplain situations. No bonebeds or aggregations of different people have yet been accounted for. Dale Russell, in a prevalent work, noticed that "Thescelosaurus" was the most well-known little herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck zone. He portrayed the earth of the time as a level floodplain, with a generally dry subtropical atmosphere that upheld an assortment of plants going from angiosperm trees, to uncovered cypress, to greeneries and ginkgos. Albeit most dinosaur skeletons from this region are fragmented, perhaps because of the low safeguarding capability of timberlands, "Thescelosaurus" skeletons are substantially more total, recommending that this class frequented stream channels. In this manner when a "Thescelosaurus" passed on, it might have been in or close to a stream, making it simpler to cover and save for later fossilization. Russell likely contrasted it with the capybaras and ungulates. Different dinosaurs that mutual its time and spot incorporate the ceratopsids "Triceratops" and "Torosaurus", hadrosaurid "Edmontosaurus", ankylosaurid "Ankylosaurus", pachycephalosaurian "Pachycephalosaurus", and the theropods "Ornithomimus", "Troodon", and "Tyrannosaurus". "Thescelosaurus" was likewise inexhaustible in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this family are the most widely recognized finds after fossils of "Triceratops" and "Edmontosaurus", and it might have been the most well-known dinosaur there throughout everyday life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational inclination against little creatures.
