The Canadian government was drawn nearer, and Dean Mackenzie, the leader of the National Research Council of Canada, promptly invited and bolstered the proposition. The expenses and pay rates would be partitioned between the British and Canadian governments, yet the British offer would originate from a billion dollar war blessing from Canada. The initial eight staff touched base in Montreal toward the finish of 1942, and involved a house having a place with McGill University. After three months they moved into a zone in another structure at the University of Montreal. The research center developed rapidly to more than 300 staff; about half were Canadians enlisted by George Laurence. A subgroup of theoreticians was selected and headed by a Czechoslovak physicist, George Placzek. Placzek turned out to be an entirely competent gathering pioneer, and was by and large viewed as the main individual from the staff with the stature of the most astounding logical position and with close to home contacts with many key physicists associated with the Manhattan venture. Friedrich Paneth moved toward becoming leader of the science division, and Pierre Auger of the exploratory material science division. Von Halban was the chief of the lab, yet he ended up being a heartbreaking decision as he was a poor chairman, and did not function admirably with the National Research Council of Canada. The Americans considered him to be a security hazard, and questioned the French nuclear licenses guaranteed by the Paris Group (in relationship with ICI).
