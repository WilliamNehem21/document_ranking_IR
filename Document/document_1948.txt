Wykes trusts that, of the novel's three focal characters, just Tony is illustrative of his genuine equalÃ¢ÂÂWaugh in his pre-Catholic skeptical state. Brenda is depicted in the novel as run of the mill of a large number of the ladies in Waugh's initial storiesÃ¢ÂÂvery much reared, trifling and irresoluteÃ¢ÂÂhowever Wykes contends that she isn't a portrayal of Evelyn Gardner, "neither in internal nor outward characteristics". Nor, he declares, is Beaver proposed as an exact depiction of Evelyn Gardner's sweetheart, the "terrifying nullity" of Beaver being a type of artistic vengeance on the educated Heygate. There is general understanding among analysts that different characters are drawn from life: Mr Todd is unmistakably founded on the offbeat but instead less vile Mr Christie; Dr Messinger, the clumsy wayfarer, reflects W. E. Roth, the caretaker of the Georgetown gallery whom Waugh thought about going with into the wilderness, just to be prevented by reports of Roth's flippancy and dismissal of peril. ThÃÂ©rÃÂ¨se de VitrÃÂ©, the object of Tony's hopeless endeavor at a shipboard sentiment, was named "Bernadette" in the first original copy; the change was made as a kind of perspective to Waugh's non-romantic companion Teresa Jungman. ThÃÂ©rÃÂ¨se reports her predetermination to wed a rich Catholic, and, in a reverberation of Jungman, draws back from Tony when she finds that despite everything he has a spouse. The summit of Tony's incidents, his oppression to Mr Todd and Dickens, is foreshadowed in Waugh's life by his dad's propensity for perusing his most loved writing out loud to his family, three or four nights per week: "...ÃÂ most of Shakespeare, a large portion of Dickens, a large portion of TennysonÃÂ ... venturing about the room and depicting the charactersÃÂ ... he held us enchanted".
