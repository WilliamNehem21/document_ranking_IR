While driving the group, Blackley received a free style of supervision. As per "Opening the Xbox" creator Dean Takahashi, "Blackley [was not] ultra-sorted out. His concept of good administration was to welcome somebody over for a gourmet supper and have an easygoing discussion about work". In any case, Takahashi composed that "Blackley endeavored to move his group", and he portrayed craftsman James Dollar's conviction that, "rather than other Looking Glass chiefs, he didn't assume control over undertakings and make others feel idiotic". Amid the initial two years of creation, the group was partitioned into little gatherings that took a shot at the amusement's components independently. For instance, Blackley modified the amusement's material science, while Eric Twietmeyer and Tim Day made the landscape renderer. In any case, Doug Church later said that, while "the group [did] a cluster of cool stuff, the FBO, the flight show, the educator, the renderer, so on", the outcome "was practically similar to four separate projects, with no association". Following the consummation of the simultaneously created "Framework Shock", a critical piece of that amusement's groupÃ¢ÂÂincluding Church, Marc LeBlanc and Rob FermierÃ¢ÂÂmoved to "Flight Unlimited" to include connective material. At the time, Church said that it was hard to merge the amusement's components, yet he later expressed that they to a great extent mixed by the end.
