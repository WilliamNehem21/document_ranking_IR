Santa Clause Anna and a littler power had stayed in BÃÂ©xar. In the wake of getting word that the acting president, Miguel BarragÃÂ¡n, had passed on, Santa Anna genuinely viewed as coming back to Mexico City to harden his position. Dread that Urrea's triumphs would position him as a political adversary persuaded Santa Anna to stay in Texas to by and by manage the last period of the crusade. He left on March 29 to join RamÃÂ­rez y Sesma, leaving just a little power to hold BÃÂ©xar. At sunrise on April 7, their consolidated power walked into San Felipe and caught a Texian warrior, who educated Santa Anna that the Texians intended to withdraw further if the Mexican armed force crossed the Brazos River. Unfit to cross the Brazos because of the little organization of Texians blockaded at the waterway crossing, on April 14 a baffled Santa Anna drove a power of around 700 troops to catch the between time Texas government. Government authorities fled insignificant hours before Mexican troops touched base in Harrisburg, and Santa Anna sent Colonel Juan Almonte with 50 rangers to catch them in New Washington. Almonte arrived similarly as Burnet left in a paddle boat, headed for Galveston Island. Despite the fact that the vessel was still inside scope of their weapons, Almonte requested his men to hold their shoot so as not to imperil Burnet's family.
