Games for the Master System are in two formats: ROM cartridges are capable of holding up to 4 Mbit of game code, while Sega Cards (My Cards in Japan) can hold up to 256 kbit. Cards were cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges and included games such as "Spy vs. Spy" and "Super Tennis", but Sega Cards were eventually dropped due to their lack of memory. Master System cartridges were initially branded Mega Cartridges to emphasize their large ROM size compared with cards, but this label fell into disuse after Sega ceased production of new card software. Games manufactured for the system include "Psycho Fox", "Golvellius", and "Phantasy Star", which became a successful franchise for Sega and is considered one of the benchmark role-playing games. The Master System also hosted games featuring Sega's flagship character at the time, Alex Kidd, including "Alex Kidd in Miracle World". "" has garnered recognition as "a genuine milestone in video game design" due to its innovative blend of platforming gameplay with RPG elements. Built-in games are common in Master System hardware, including "Snail Maze" and "Hang-On", as well as "Alex Kidd in Miracle World" and "Sonic the Hedgehog". Additional games were released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of "Street Fighter II" and "Dynamite Headdy" after the Master System was discontinued elsewhere.
