Other production sites began to appear in the 1880s. British engineer James Fern Webster launched the industrial production of aluminium by reduction with sodium in 1882; his aluminium was much purer than Deville's (it contained 0.8% impurities whereas Deville's typically contained 2%). World production of aluminium in 1884 equaled 3.6 tons. In 1884, American architect William Frishmuth combined production of sodium, alumina, and aluminium into a single technological process; this contrasted with the previous need to collect sodium, which combusts in water and sometimes air. In 1886, American engineer Hamilton Castner devised a method of cheaper production of sodium, which decreased the cost of aluminium to $8 per pound, but he did not have enough capital to construct a large factory like Deville's. In 1887, he constructed a factory in Oldbury; Webster constructed a plant nearby and bought Castner's sodium to employ it in his own production of aluminium. In 1887, Aluminium- und Magnesiumfabrik started production in Hemelingen. In 1889, German metallurgist Curt Netto launched a method of reduction of cryolite with sodium that produced aluminium containing 0.5â1% of impurities. The United States Department of the Interior estimated in 1890 that the total amount of unalloyed aluminium produced from 1860 to 1889 in France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany equaled , suggesting that "the indications are that the manufacture will be so largely increased from now on that this amount will soon be exceeded from now on by the annual production".
