Mary, Joseph, the Christ tyke and the four encompassing holy messengers consume a space apportioned in the front by the opening and by the divider at the back. A crescent of figures is situated around Christ, reverberated in the half circle of rocks set legitimately inside the doorsill. Mary and Joseph are resounded by the beautiful vertical porphyry segments on the sides, and by the statues of Adam and Eve.
