In 2000, Bartley and ÃÂ Briain had been promised "exclusive access" to ChÃ¡vez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, "We hadÂ ... this notion of investigating ChÃ¡vezâwas he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here is a guy who is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began to see him as more transparentâwhat you see is what you get." Bartley and ÃÂ Briain began by attempting to build a relationship with ChÃ¡vez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÃÂ Briain finally got through to ChÃ¡vez. They calculated that they needed to "press the right buttons" to gain his support, so they presented him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, who had fought alongside SimÃ³n BolÃ­var. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright SeÃ¡n O'Casey. Slowly, Bartley and ÃÂ Briain gained their subjects' trust, "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".
