Joshua Logan, in his journals, expressed that following quite a while of exertion in the primary portion of 1948, Hammerstein had composed just the principal scene, a diagram, and a few verses. Hammerstein was experiencing difficulty because of absence of learning of the military, an issue with which Logan, a veteran of the military, had the capacity to help. The exchange was written in conference among them, and inevitably Logan approached to be credited for his work. Rodgers and Hammerstein chose that while Logan would get co-composing credit on the book, he would get no writer's eminences. Logan expressed that an agreement putting these progressions into power was sent over to his legal counselor with guidelines that except if it was marked inside two hours, Logan need not appear for practices as chief. Logan marked, despite the fact that his attorney did not then enlighten him concerning the final offer. During that time that pursued, Logan conveyed the issue up every now and then, requesting remuneration, yet when he incorporated his variant of the occasions in his 1976 journals, it was questioned by Rodgers (Hammerstein had kicked the bucket in 1960). Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest proposes that Logan was remunerated when "South Pacific" was recorded in 1958, as Logan got a generous offer of the benefits as executive. As per Michener biographer Stephen J. May, "it is hard to evaluate exactly the amount of the last book Josh Logan was in charge of. A few appraisals express 30 to 40 percent. However, that rate isn't as basic maybe as his insight into military legend and coordinating for the theater, without which the production of "South Pacific" would have fell amid that late spring of 1948."
