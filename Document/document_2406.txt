On August 20, 1845, Griswold wedded Charlotte Myers, a Jewish lady; she was 42 and he was 33. Griswold had been compelled into the marriage by the lady's aunties, in spite of his worry about their distinction in religious convictions. This distinction was sufficient that one of Griswold's companions alluded to his significant other just as "the little Jewess". On their wedding night, he found that she was, as per Griswold biographer Joy Bayless, "through some physical incident, unequipped for being a spouse" or, as Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman clarifies, unequipped for engaging in sexual relations. Griswold considered the marriage void and not any more legitimate "than there would have been hosted the service occurred between gatherings of a similar sex, or where the sex of one was suspicious or equivocal". In any case, the couple moved together to Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte's main residence, and lived under a similar rooftop, though resting in isolated rooms. Neither one nor the other was content with the circumstance, and toward the finish of April 1846 she had an attorney review an agreement "to separate, inside and out and forever,ÃÂ ... which would as a result be a separation". The agreement denied Griswold from remarrying and paid him $1,000 for costs in return for his girl Caroline remaining with the Myers family. After this division, Griswold promptly moved back to Philadelphia.
