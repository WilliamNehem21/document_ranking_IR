Bernhard brought in Elinor Mavor to edit both "Amazing" and "Fantastic". Mavor had previously edited "Bill of Fare", a restaurant trade journal, and was a long-time science fiction reader, but she had little knowledge of the history of the magazines. She was unaware, for example, that she was not the first woman to edit them, and so adopted a male pseudonymâ"Omar Gohagen"âfor a while. She suggested a campaign to increase circulation, and went so far as to gather information about costs while on a trip to New York in 1979. Bernhard decided instead to merge the two magazines. Circulation was continuing to drop; the figures for the last two years are not available, but sf historian Mike Ashley estimates that "Fantastic"'s paid circulation may have been as low as 13,000. Bernhard felt that since "Fantastic" had never been profitable, whereas "Amazing" had made money, it was best to keep "Amazing". Until the March 1985 issue, "Amazing" included a mention of "Fantastic" on the spine and on the contents page. In 1999, the fiction magazine formerly known as "Pirate Writings" revived the "Fantastic" title and Cele Goldsmith-era logotype for several issues, ultimately unsuccessfully, though this was not intended as a continuation of the original magazine.
