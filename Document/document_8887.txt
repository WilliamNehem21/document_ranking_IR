At the point when the magazine was restored, the expressed arrangement was still to distribute lead books and fill the rest of the space with short stories, however truth be told, with couple of special cases, the lead fiction was not of novel length. There were no more reprints, as there had been for the primary arrangement. Lowndes was unfit to pay his scholars rates that were aggressive with the magazines that were driving the field, however he was a capable proofreader and created a magazine of sensible quality each quarter. The Futurians still at times showed up in "Sci-fi Quarterly", yet Lowndes likewise pulled in a portion of the more up to date scholars, for example, Poul Anderson, William Tenn, and Arthur C. Clarke. Clarke's "Second Dawn", which showed up in the August 1951 issue, is among the better stories Lowndes had the capacity to acquire; he likewise distributed Isaac Asimov's "The Last Question" in the November 1956 issue, and James Blish's "Regular Time", in August 1953. Lowndes was likewise ready to gain some great quality true to life for the magazine, including a progression of articles by James Blish on science in sf, and articles on sci-fi by Thomas D. Clareson and L. Sprague de Camp. Blish, composing as William Atheling, Jr., remarked in 1953 that Lowndes was completing a "shockingly great job" with the majority of Silberkleit's sci-fi magazines, in spite of the low rates and the moderate installment to creators.
