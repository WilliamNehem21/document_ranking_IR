Researchers started to discuss the capacity of the American paddlefish's platform when the species was depicted in the late 1700s. They had once trusted it was utilized to unearth base substrate or worked as an adjusting instrument and navigational guide. Be that as it may, research center examinations in 1993 that used trend setting innovation in the field of electron microscopy have built up indisputably that the platform of American paddlefish is secured with a huge number of tactile receptors. These receptors are morphologically like the ampullae of Lorenzini of sharks and beams, and are without a doubt detached ampullary-type electroreceptors utilized by American paddlefish to identify tiny fish. Bunches of electroreceptors likewise spread the head and operculum folds. The American paddlefish's eating regimen comprises basically of zooplankton. Their electroreceptors can recognize feeble electrical fields, which flag the nearness of zooplankton, yet in addition the individual sustaining and swimming developments of zooplankton limbs. At the point when a swarm of zooplankton is distinguished, the paddlefish swims forward ceaselessly with their mouth wide open, compelling water over the gill rakers to sift through prey. Such nourishing conduct is viewed as slam suspension-encouraging. Further research has demonstrated that their electroreceptors may likewise fill in as a navigational guide for snag evasion.
