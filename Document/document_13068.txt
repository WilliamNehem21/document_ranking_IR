I saw the kid getting harmed in his leg, and the dad requesting help. At that point I saw him getting harmed in his arm, the dad. The dad was requesting that the ambulances help him, since he could see the ambulances. I can't see the ambulanceÃÂ ... I wasn't far away, perhaps from them [Jamal and Muhammad] eye to eye around 15 meters, 17 meters. Be that as it may, the dad didn't prevail to get the emergency vehicle by waving to them. He took a gander at me and he stated, "Help me." I stated, "I can't, I can't support you." The shooting till then was truly heavyÃÂ ... It was truly raining slugs, for more than for 45ÃÂ minutes. ThenÃÂ ... I hear something, "blast!" Really is accompanying a ton of residue. I took a gander at the kid, I recorded the kid resting in the dad's lap, and the dad truly, getting truly harmed, and he was truly unsteady. I stated, "Goodness my god, the kid has executed, the kid has murdered," I was shouting, I was losing my psyche. While I was recording, the kid got killedÃÂ ... I was exceptionally apprehensive, I was extremely disturbed, I was crying, and I was recollecting my youngsters... This was the most awful thing that has transpired as a writer.
