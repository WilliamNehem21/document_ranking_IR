In 1988, the scientist Gregory S. Paul presumed that the skulls of ornithomimids were more like each other than recently suspected and moved most species into similar class, "Ornithomimus", bringing about the new mix "O. bullatus". In 2010, he rather recorded it as ""Gallimimus" (or "Struthiomimus") "bullatus"", yet came back to utilizing just the class name "Gallimimus" in 2016. The species included have by and large been kept in isolated genera by different scholars. An ornithomimid vertebra from Japan casually named "Sanchusaurus" was accounted for in a 1988 magazine, however was alloted to "Gallimimus" sp. (of unsure species) by the scientist Dong Zhiming and associates in 1990. Barsbold casually alluded to an about total skeleton (IGM 100/14) as "Gallimimus mongoliensis", however since it varies from "Gallimimus" in certain subtleties, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and Barsbold proposed in 2006 that it likely has a place with an alternate sort. In 2000, the scientist Philip J. Currie suggested that "Anserimimus", which is just known from one skeleton from Mongolia, was a lesser equivalent word of "Gallimimus", yet this was rejected by Kobayashi and Barsbold, who called attention to a few contrasts between the two. Barsbold noticed some morphological variety among more current "Gallimimus" examples, however this has never been distributed.
