Discontent with the developing Parthian impact at their doorstep, Roman Emperor Nero sent General Corbulo with a huge armed force toward the east so as to reestablish Roman customer lords. A Hasmonean named Aristobulus was given Lesser Armenia (Nicopolis and Satala) and Sohaemus of Emesa got Armenia Sophene. In the spring of 58, Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and progressed towards Artaxata, while Parasmanes I of Iberia assaulted from the north, and Antiochus IV of Commagene assaulted from the southwest. Upheld by his sibling, Tiridates I sent flying sections to assault the Romans far and wide. Corbulo struck back utilizing similar strategies and the utilization of the Moschoi clans who attacked peripheral areas of Armenia. Tiridates I fled from the capital, and Corbulo consumed Artaxata to the ground. In the late spring, Corbulo started moving towards Tigranocerta through unpleasant landscape and going through the Taronitida (Taron), where a few of his administrators kicked the bucket in a snare by the Armenian opposition; in any case, the city opened its entryways, except for one of the strongholds, which was obliterated in the following attack. At this point most of Armenians had relinquished opposition and acknowledged the sovereign supported by Rome.
