Sylvester detects the influence of late works by Titian in other aspects, especially in the deep and rich colouring, and VelÃ¡zquez's portrayals of Philip IV, such as "Portrait of Philip IV in Fraga", and agrees with identification of pastels of Degas as a source. He believes Bacon borrowed from Degas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what Degas described as "shuttering", as seen in the earlier artist's "After the Bath, Woman drying herself". Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian's "Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto". He believes the folds serve to "push the viewer back", creating a distance from the subject, an effect he sees as similar to the separation between an orchestra and setting; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison. Sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter. In his series of books "Interviews with Francis Bacon", he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant. The artist replied, "Well, it means that the sensation doesn't come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps."
