At the point when Ward was building up the arrangement's title groupings, the unfinished copy variant comprised of speedy shots and vignettes that were "simply kind of insane [and] silly", which suggested the show's topic of idiosyncratic experiences. These drafts included "the charactersÃÂ ... simply punching irregular phantoms and beasts, bouncing through everything without exception [and] there were a cluster of nuclear bombs toward its finish". Ward later called this rendition "actually senseless". He sent the draft to Cartoon Network; they didn't care for it and needed something increasingly graphical like the prologue to "The Brady Bunch". Motivated by the title successions of "The Simpsons" and "Pee-small's Playhouse", Ward built up another title grouping that highlighted a panning scope of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note climbed gradually until the principle subject was played. Ward's draft for this thought was given to design artists, who at that point finished the planning for the arrangement. From that point, the grouping developed; while Ward included "senseless character stuff", Patrick McHale concentrated on the Ice King's shot and gave him a "secondary school [year]book" grin. The team likewise attempted to get the shadows in the shot including Marceline right. After the panning clear, the arrangement slices to the signature tune, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are appeared. For this piece of the arrangement, Ward was propelled by the "straightforward" parts of the prologue to the 2007 satire film "Superbad". At the point when the topic makes reference to "Jake the Dog" and "Finn the Human", the characters' names are shown by their heads, with a strong shading out of sight. The grouping was finished preceding the arrangement circulated.
