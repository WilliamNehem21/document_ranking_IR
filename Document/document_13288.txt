While HBO excitement president Carolyn Strauss felt "CarnivÃÂ le" had reached a characteristic end with its second season and gave this as the system's clarification for not reestablishing "CarnivÃÂ le", it was accounted for HBO president Chris Albrecht had initially needed to finish up the second period of "CarnivÃÂ le" with a wonderful and close-finished showdown between Brother Justin and Ben. Albrecht purportedly favored a distinct downfall of Brother Justin to a cliffhanger, yet show maker Daniel Knauf expressed Albrecht may have been misquoted. As indicated by Knauf, Albrecht had wished in preproduction talks to close season 2 with a battle between Brother Justin and Ben, which had dependably been Knauf's aim. HBO had then endorsed the open completion by greenlighting the last scene in the composition stage, planning the recording including the last shot, and owning the privileges of the finished edition everything being equal. There was never an arrangement to drop "CarnivÃÂ le" rashly, and HBO had just chosen the wiping out in no time before their declaration. Be that as it may, Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) recollects the first last shot of the arrangement as Iris watching the corn bite the dust, not of Ben in Management's trailer.
