Hordern initially met the British theater chief Jonathan Miller in 1968. Mill operator, who had for some time been an admirer of Hordern, offered him the piece of the agonistic Professor Parkin in his prospective TV show "Whistle and I'll Come to You". Hordern, who had heard positive things of Miller from showy companions, similarly had a favorable opinion of the executive, and rushed to take up area shooting in Norfolk that year. He came to like Miller's method for working, for example, having the opportunity to extemporize as opposed to holding fast to the severe principles of a content; the on-screen character wrote in his personal history that he had never encountered that level of expert opportunity. The program was discharged towards the finish of 1968 and was a hit with gatherings of people and faultfinders. Imprint Duguid of the British Film Institute called it "a gem of practical frightfulness that remaining parts just as chilling as the day it was first communicated", while a columnist for "The Telegraph", writing in 2010 about that year's change featuring John Hurt, helped perusers to remember the "splendid Sixties creation by Jonathan Miller [in which] Michael Hordern made a fine, dried up Parkin". The year finished with a job in Peter Hall's creation of Edward Albee's "A Delicate Balance" at the Aldwych Theater. The piece got tepid surveys, with Hilary Spurling of "The Spectator" thinking Hordern was "poorly served" as the foremost character, Tobias.
