In 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, who was the Librarian at the Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) in London, was expected to resign. John Gilmour, presently right hand chief at the Kew Gardens, set forward Stearn's name, together with Bowles, a VP of the Society, who had found Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he started work at the library, at first as collaborator custodian, before assuming control over Hutchinson's situation following a half year. He later clarified his arrangement at such a youthful age just like the aftereffect of World War I: "Every one of the general population who ought to have had those employments were dead." There he teamed up with Bowles on various plant monographs, for example, Bowles' "Handbook of Crocus" and their work on "Anemone japonica" ("Anemone hupehensis" var. "japonica"). Written in 1947, it is still viewed as a standout amongst the most far reaching records of the causes and terminology of fall-sprouting anemones. Stearn was one of the last individuals to see Bowles alive, and when Bowles kicked the bucket, Stearn composed a valuation for him, and later contributed the passage on Bowles to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Quite a bit of his extra time was spent learning at the Kew Gardens.
