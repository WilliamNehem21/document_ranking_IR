In Greek historiography, Herodotus (484Ã¢ÂÂ 425 BC) had composed brief portrayals of antiquated Ethiopians, who were likewise referenced in the New Testament. Despite the fact that the Byzantine Empire kept up customary relations with Ethiopia amid the Early Middle Ages, the Early Muslim victories of the seventh century separated the association among Ethiopia and the remainder of Christendom. Records of these contacts urged medieval Europeans to find if Ethiopia was as yet Christian or had changed over to Islam, a thought reinforced by the nearness of Ethiopian pioneers in the Holy Land and Jerusalem amid the Crusades. Amid the High Middle Ages, the Mongol triumphs of Genghis Khan (r. 1206Ã¢ÂÂ 1227) drove Europeans to guess about the presence of a holy, amazing warrior ruler named Prester John, who was thought to occupy inaccessible grounds in Asia related with Nestorian Christians and might vanquish rival Islamic forces. The movement writing of Marco Polo and Odoric of Pordenone with respect to their different adventures to Yuan-tradition China amid the thirteenth and fourteenth hundreds of years, individually, and unproductive quests in southern India, scattered the idea that Prester John's kingdom existed in Asia. An Ethiopian conciliatory mission sent to Christian Europe by Ethiopian ruler Wedem Arad (r. 1299Ã¢ÂÂ 1314) in 1306 permitted the opportunity for the minister and cartographer Giovanni da Carignano (1250Ã¢ÂÂ 1329) to scrutinize the international safe haven as they remained in Genoa, after which he distributed a work depicting the geographic area of their kingdom and the idea of their Christian confidence.
