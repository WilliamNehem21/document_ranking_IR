Agnew was confirmed alongside Nixon on January 20, 1969; as was standard, he sat down following being confirmed, and did not deliver a discourse. Not long after the introduction, Nixon delegated Agnew as leader of the Office of Intergovernmental Relations, to head government commissions, for example, the National Space Council and allocated him to work with state governors to cut down wrongdoing. It turned out to be evident that Agnew would not be in the internal hover of counsels. The new president liked to manage just a confided in bunch, and was irritated when Agnew endeavored to call him about issues Nixon esteemed paltry. After Agnew imparted his insights on a remote approach matter in a bureau meeting, a furious Nixon sent Bob Haldeman to caution Agnew to remain quiet about his suppositions. Nixon whined that Agnew had no clue how the bad habit administration functioned, yet did not meet with Agnew to share his very own understanding of the workplace. Herb Klein, executive of interchanges in the Nixon White House, later composed that Agnew had enabled himself to be pushed around by senior helpers, for example, Haldeman and John Mitchell, and that Nixon's "conflicting" treatment of Agnew had left the VP uncovered.
