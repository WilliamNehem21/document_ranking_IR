The animal's tendency was portrayed by Walter Gregor, a folklorist and one of the principal individuals from the Folklore Society, as "valuable", "pernicious", or looking for "human camaraderie"; at times, kelpies bring their exploited people into the water, eat up them, and toss the insides to the water's edge. In its equine structure the kelpie can broaden the length of its back to convey numerous riders together into the profundities; a typical topic in the stories is of a few youngsters getting onto the animal's back while one stays on the shore. Normally a young man, he at that point pets the steed yet his hand adheres to its neck. In certain varieties the chap removes his fingers or hand to free himself; he endures yet different kids are stolen away and suffocated, with just a portion of their guts being discovered later. Such an animal said to occupy Glen Keltney in Perthshire is viewed as a kelpie by twentieth century folklorist Katharine Mary Briggs, however a comparable story likewise set in Perthshire has an "each uisge" as the offender and precludes the frivolity of the young man. The fellow cuts his finger off when the occasion happens in Thurso, where a water kelpie is distinguished as the guilty party. A similar story set at Sunart in the Highlands gives a particular figure of nine kids lost, of whom just the innards of one are recuperated. The enduring kid is again spared by removing his finger, and the extra data is given that he had a Bible in his pocket. Gregorson Campbell considers the animal mindful to have been a water horse as opposed to a kelpie, and the story "clearly a devout misrepresentation to shield youngsters from meandering on Sundays".
