The Royal Navy fixed "Chesapeake" and accepting her into administration as HMSÃÂ "Chesapeake". She served on the Halifax station under the direction of Alexander Dixie through 1814, and under the order of George Burdett she cruised to Plymouth, England, for fixes in October of that year. A while later she made a voyage to Cape Town, South Africa, until learning of the harmony settlement with the United States in May 1815. Soon thereafter a report was made concerning "Chesapeake"s execution in British administration. Her commander saw that she was emphatically built, yet condemned the unreasonable shade of the stern. He inferred that she was not a reasonable ship to fill in as a model for replicating. Her speed under sail was not especially amazing: close-pulled and huge. In July 1819 the Commissioners of the Royal Navy put her available to be purchased at Plymouth. A Portsmouth timber trader bought her for ÃÂ£500; he destroyed the ship and sold her timbers to Joshua Holmes for ÃÂ£3,450. In the long run her timbers turned out to be a piece of the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham, Hampshire, England, where one can in any case see them. In 1996 a timber piece from the Chesapeake Mill was come back to the United States. It is in plain view at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.
