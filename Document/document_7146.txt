In the mid year, the privations of the bondage, including their closer repression at the Ipatiev House contrarily influenced the family. As indicated by certain records, at one point Anastasia turned out to be so vexed about the bolted, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get natural air. A guard allegedly observed her and terminated, barely missing her. She didn't attempt once more. On July 14, 1918, neighborhood ministers at Yekaterinburg directed a private community gathering for the family. They announced that Anastasia and her family, in spite of custom, fell on their knees amid the petition for the dead, and that the young ladies had turned out to be miserable and sad, and never again sang the answers in the administration. Seeing this sensational change in their mien since his last visit, one minister told the other, "Something has transpired in there." But the following day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters showed up in great spirits as they kidded and helped move the beds in their common room so cleaning ladies could clean the floors. They helped the ladies scour the floors and murmured to them when the watchmen were not viewing. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, the leader of the separation, when he immediately turned his back and left the room.
