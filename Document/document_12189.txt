Modin considered Burgess the pioneer of the Cambridge spies: "He held the gathering together, mixed it with his vitality and drove it into fight". He sent a lot of data to Moscow: a huge number of records including arrangement papers, Cabinet minutes and notes of Imperial General Staff gatherings. As per Holzman, "Burgess and Maclean guaranteed that scarcely anything done by the British Foreign Office was not known to the Soviet remote insight administrations". Perspectives are separated regarding what utilize the Soviets made of this data, or whether they confided in it. Discharged papers by the Foreign Intelligence Services of the Russian Federation record that "of specific esteem was the data [he] acquired about the places of Western nations on the after war settlement in Europe, Britain's military system, NATO [and] the exercises of British and American insight organizations". In any case, the clear simplicity with which Burgess and his associates could gain and send such volumes of information likewise made doubts in Moscow that they were being bolstered falsehood. Subsequently, the degree of harm to British interests endured by Burgess' exercises involves guess; Kerr infers that "in spite of much fevered theory ... there is too little proof on the impacts of [Burgess's] undercover work and his impact upon global legislative issues for a solid appraisal to be possible."
