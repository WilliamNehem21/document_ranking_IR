President Dwight Eisenhower declared eight states as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal aid. The Small Business Administration opened 18Â temporary offices in the eastern United States for people to take out disaster loan applications. In the months after the storm, both the United States federal government and the American Red Cross had difficulty raising enough funds for the storm victims; collectively, the Red Cross, the Small Business Administration, and Farmers Home Administration raised $37Â million, which was less than 8% of Diane's damage total. Throughout 1955, the Red Cross assisted about 10,000Â families in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states; some of the families received aid to move to a new house not in a flood zone. The Small Business Administration provided about 1,600Â loans, totaling $25Â million, for small businesses. Senator Herbert H. Lehman proposed a $12Â billion federal flood insurance program. In 1956, the United States Congress passed the Federal Flood Insurance Act, but the program was not enacted due to lack of funding. A nationwide flood program was not enacted until the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. After the floods from Diane, the American federal government provided funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to construct dams and reservoirs throughout New England to mitigate future flooding. In about 14Â years, the Corps built 29Â dams in Connecticut alone at the cost of $70Â million, including three along the Connecticut River. The federal government restored plans from the 1930s to build dams along the Delaware River, one of which along Tocks Island. A controversy arose there due to the long reservoir the dam would have created, causing 600Â families to be displaced. The project was canceled in 1975, and the acquired lands became the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.
