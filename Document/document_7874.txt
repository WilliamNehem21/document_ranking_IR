In 1918 Lancaster was sent to St Ronan's private academy, Worthing. The rÃÂ©gime at the school inclined intensely towards game, in which he was neither intrigued nor capable. The dean, Stanley Harris, was a commended beginner footballer and incidental top notch cricketer, yet he was sensibly tolerant of Lancaster's despise for recreations, and all in all Lancaster making the most of his time at the school. His training there was, he later remarked, of more significance to him than anything he adapted later in his school and college vocation. He left St Ronan's in 1921, matured thirteen, and went to Charterhouse, where his dad and uncles had all been sent. There he was stunned by the harassing and awful language, however notwithstanding its lively, philistine "bloods", the school had a scholarly and stylish custom. Lancaster's biographer Richard Boston expresses, "The healthy Baden-Powell, for instance, was counterbalanced by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Robert Graves, while gifted Carthusian craftsmen had included Thackeray, Leech, Lovat Fraser and Max Beerbohm". The craftsmanship ace, P.J.("Purple")Johnson, energized Lancaster, demanding that a sound procedure was an essential for compelling self-articulation in illustration or painting; in that regard the kid's time at the school was profitable, however generally the dean discovered him "hopelessly ignoble ... a pitiful frustration". Lancaster shared Beerbohm's view that being an old kid of the school was more pleasurable than being a student there.
