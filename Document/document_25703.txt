For the next nine seasons, MalmÃ¶ FF finished in the top three in the league. The club won the Swedish Championship in 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1953, and were runners-up in 1946, 1948 and 1952. The club also won Svenska Cupen in 1944, 1946, 1947, 1951 and 1953, and finished as runners-up in 1945. Between 6 May 1949 and 1 June 1951, the team were unbeaten in 49 matches, of which 23 were an unbroken streak of victories.
The club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan twice more, in 1956 and 1957. The following year the club left MalmÃ¶ IP for MalmÃ¶ Stadion, which had been built for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, and was to host the club for the next 50 years. In 1964 MalmÃ¶ FF contracted Spanish manager Antonio DurÃ¡n; this was the first of a series of changes that led to the most successful era in the club's history. Young talents such as Lars GranstrÃ¶m and Bo Larsson emerged during the early 1960s and would prove to be crucial ingredients in the success that would come in the 1970s. The club finished second in 1964 but went on to win their sixth Swedish Championship in 1965, when Bo Larsson scored 28 goals to finish as the league's top goal scorer. MalmÃ¶ FF once again won Allsvenskan in 1967, after a less successful year in 1966. The club's young players, as well as talents bought in from neighbouring clubs in Scania in 1967, became a team that consistently finished in the top three in Allsvenskan.
