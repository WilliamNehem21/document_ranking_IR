As in past "Musical gang" amusements, effectively hitting the best possible notes in succession procures focuses for every player and lifts their "execution meter". Each different instrument is given a dimension, characterized by their instrument symbol, and the normal dimension is additionally shown. On the off chance that a player neglects to coordinate the notes, their execution meter drops. In the event that the meter exhausts, that player is compelled to drop out of play, which thusly makes the band's general execution drop. Any player to drop out can be "spared" if another player actuates "Beatlemania" (alluded to as "Overdrive" in other "Musical crew" titles), which is gathered by effectively finishing uniquely checked expressions. These expressions show up in white, and if the expression is finished, the vitality bar, showed at the base of each track, fills by one quarter. Beatlemania can likewise be utilized to incidentally build the measure of focuses the band procures. Enacting Beatlemania is explicit to each "instrument". For guitar, the controller must be incidentally moved to an upstanding position; for drums, an extraordinary "cymbal" (Green, or red for "Lefty" mode) is hit; and for vocals, a commotion must be enrolled by the receiver when provoked.
