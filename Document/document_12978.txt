On 14 November, "84ÃÂ F", "92ÃÂ F", "94ÃÂ M", "99ÃÂ M" and "100ÃÂ M" experienced four Italian destroyers off the mouth of the Piave, yet the torpedo pontoons were again ready to escape their followers by cruising behind a minefield. After two days, the waterfront safeguard boats and "Budapest" cruised to draw in an Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo close to the mouth of the Piave, with an escort that included "84ÃÂ F", "92ÃÂ F", "94ÃÂ F", "98ÃÂ M"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "100ÃÂ M" and a few minesweepers. Both "Wien" and "Budapest" were hit, yet none of the torpedo water crafts endured any harm. After an Italian power of seven destroyers and three MAS water crafts showed up, the shelling power pulled back. On 28 November, 250t-class pontoons were associated with two shore assault missions. In the primary mission, "79ÃÂ T", "86ÃÂ F" and "90ÃÂ F" upheld the barrage of Senigallia by three destroyers, before they were joined by "78ÃÂ T", "82ÃÂ F", "87ÃÂ F", "89ÃÂ F" and "95ÃÂ F" and another three destroyers for the siege of Porto Corsini, Marotta and Cesenatico. On 19 December, an expansive Austro-Hungarian power drew in the Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo. The power comprised of the pre-man of war ship , the light cruiser , "Budapest", six destroyers, ten torpedo water crafts including "84ÃÂ F", "92ÃÂ F", "94ÃÂ F" and "98ÃÂ M"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ "100ÃÂ M", and ten minesweepers. None of the boats of the besieging power endured harm amid the mission.
