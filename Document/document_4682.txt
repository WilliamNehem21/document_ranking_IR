Precisely where the initial segment of the fight occurred is likewise obscure. The cutting edge antiquarian Clifford Rogers presents the defense for the street between St. Aubin-de-Langais and St. Nexans. Fowler trusts it was out and about from Montcuq to Bergerac. The French, either attracted from Bergerac by a ploy or during the time spent pulling back from their attack of Montcuq, or both, were gotten out and about by the Anglo-Gascon armed force. They were liable to a blast of English arrow based weaponry and struck by a charge by the Anglo-Gascon men-at-arms. The French were directed and a running battle occurred as they fled toward the St. Madeleine suburb of Bergerac, at the south end of the extension. Since the interest was so close, it was difficult to close the doors on the barbican at the south end of the scaffold and it was overwhelm. The followers went ahead to the extension, which was long, restricted, and blocked most of the way along by a house of prayer. The battalion endeavored to foray to verify the barbican and the extension wound up stuck with Frenchmen. English bowmen swam out to sandbanks in the waterway and enfiladed the hysterical French from the two flanks. They "were slaughtered in incredible numbers" and many surrendered to the Anglo-Gascons squeezing not far behind them. Endeavors to drop the portcullis on the north end of the scaffold were ruined by an injured pony falling in the entryway. The Anglo-Gascons proceeded to assault the town itself.
