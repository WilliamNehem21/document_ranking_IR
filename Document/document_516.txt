Data from the PBHistory reports was spread by the authorities of both the US and Guatemalan governments. US represetative Henry Cabot Lodge utilized 21 archives in a discourse he made at the United Nations. Data was likewise channeled to US envoys and Congresspeople. The US Congress in 1954 was among the couple of Republican controlled Congresses in numerous years. Republicans looked to utilize an enemy of socialist push to produce support for themselves and to disintegrate the casting a ballot base of the Democratic party. Hostile to Communist individuals from the US Congress, for example, Charles J. Kersten and Patrick J. Hillings of the Kersten Committee, eagerly included themselves with PBHistory. By August 1954, Kersten was getting PBHistory archives from Dulles so he could utilize them in talks to Congress about the Soviet Union's impact in Guatemala. In September and October 1954, the Kersten Committee held hearings purportedly researching the infiltration of socialist impact. PBHistory reports were utilized in this procedure, and Castillo Armas turned into the main head of state to affirm before a US Congress council (in spite of the fact that he did as such using a copying of his declaration). In spite of the fact that the hearings did little to uncover data about socialist nearness in Guatemala, they furnished Operation PBHistory with tremendous exposure inside the US.
