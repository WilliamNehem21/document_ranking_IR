Cooper's most important film during the post-war years was Fred Zinnemann's Western drama "High Noon" (1952) with Grace Kelly for United Artists. In the film, Cooper plays retiring sheriff Will Kane who is preparing to leave town on his honeymoon when he learns that an outlaw he helped put away and his three henchmen are returning to seek their revenge. Unable to gain the support of the frightened townspeople, and abandoned by his young bride, Kane nevertheless stays to face the outlaws alone. During the filming, Cooper was in poor health and in considerable pain from stomach ulcers. His ravaged face and discomfort in some scenes "photographed as self-doubt", according to biographer Hector Arce, and contributed to the effectiveness of his performance. Considered one of the first "adult" Westerns for its theme of moral courage, "High Noon" received enthusiastic reviews for its artistry, with "Time" magazine placing it in the ranks of "Stagecoach" and "The Gunfighter". Bosley Crowther, in "The New York Times", wrote that Cooper was "at the top of his form", and John McCarten, in "The New Yorker", wrote that Cooper was never more effective. The film earned $3.75 million in the United States and $18 million worldwide. Following the example of his friend James Stewart, Cooper accepted a lower salary in exchange for a percent of the profits, and ended up making $600,000. Cooper's understated performance was widely praised, and earned him his second Academy Award for Best Actor.
