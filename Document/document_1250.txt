Another troublesome zone was accomplishments. Albeit normal accomplishments functioned admirably, with an irregular shot of progress or disappointment, extraordinary ones would seem to flop more frequently. To stay away from this, randomization was supplanted by a level of trouble in achieving the accomplishment. Despite the fact that pen-and-paper falling harm is irregular, the PC diversion puts together harm with respect to the separation of the fall. The group's greatest test was adjusting disciplines. The pen-and-paper form may require a little blood that requires quite a while to utilize, or have no blood cost and can be utilized voluntarily; overhauled disciplines had extra prerequisites considered unreasonably befuddling for a PC amusement. Troika endeavored to balance the controls, keeping the impact unblemished and normalizing the expense, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points, etc. To adjust the families, the refined Ventrue were just permitted to benefit from respectable blood, however this was changed to enable them to benefit from lower-class people, accepting less blood. Amid character creation, the diversion had a discretionary character life story with interesting positive and negative attributes (expanding one capacity while constraining another). This was expelled from the discharged diversion; Activision felt that there was inadequate test time, and evacuating it was an increasingly steady choice.
