Berlioz composed melodies all through his vocation, yet not productively. His best-known work in the class is the melody cycle "Les nuits d'ÃÂ©tÃÂ©", a gathering of six tunes, initially for voice and piano however at this point generally heard in its later arranged structure. He stifled a portion of his initial melodies, and his last distribution, in 1865, was the "33 MÃÂ©lodies", gathering into one volume every one of his tunes that he safeguarded. Some of them, for example, "HÃÂ©lÃÂ¨ne" and "Sara la baigneuse", exist in variants for four voices with backup, and there are others for a few voices. Berlioz later coordinated a portion of the melodies initially composed with piano backup, and a few, for example, "ZaÃÂ¯de" and "Le chasseur danois" were composed with elective piano or symphonic parts. "La hostage", to words by Victor Hugo, exists in six unique variants. In its last form (1849) it was depicted by the Berlioz researcher Tom S. Wotton as like "a smaller than usual symphonic lyric". The main form, composed at the Villa Medici, had been in genuinely ordinary cadence, however for his amendment Berlioz made the strophic layout less unmistakable cut, and included discretionary symphonic parts for the last stanza, which conveys the tune to a peaceful close.
