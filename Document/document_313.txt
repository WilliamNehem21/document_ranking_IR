Seven of these hostage rhinos were sent to the United States (the other was kept in Southeast Asia), yet by 1997, their numbers had dwindled to three: a female in the Los Angeles Zoo, a male in the Cincinnati Zoo, and a female in the Bronx Zoo. In a last exertion, the three rhinos were joined in Cincinnati. Following quite a while of fizzled endeavors, the female from Los Angeles, Emi, wound up pregnant for the 6th time, with the zoo's male Ipuh. Each of the five of her past pregnancies finished in disappointment. Conceptive physiologist at the Cincinnati Zoo, Terri Roth, had gained from past disappointments, however, and with the guide of exceptional hormone medicines, Emi brought forth a sound male calf named Andalas (an Indonesian scholarly word for Sumatra) in September 2001. Andalas' introduction to the world was the main effective hostage birth of a Sumatran rhino in 112 years. A female calf, named "Suci" (Indonesian for "unadulterated"), pursued on 30 July 2004. On 29 April 2007, Emi conceived an offspring a third time, to her second male calf, named Harapan (Indonesian for "expectation") or Harry. In 2007, Andalas, who had been inhabiting the Los Angeles Zoo, was come back to Sumatra to partake in reproducing programs with sound females, prompting the siring and 23 June 2012 birth of male calf Andatu, the fourth hostage conceived calf of the time; Andalas had been mated with Ratu, a wild-brought into the world female living in the Rhino Sanctuary at Way Kambas National Park.
