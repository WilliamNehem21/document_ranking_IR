Amid the last instructional courses in Tokyo, Talbot sorted out time preliminaries for the Australians, which were held before restriction swimmers trying to threaten them. O'Brien posted a period of 2ÃÂ min 33ÃÂ s, which Talbot felt had a negative mental impact on O'Brien's adversaries. At the point when rivalry began, O'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the primary warmth by 2.0ÃÂ s. He posted a period of 2ÃÂ min 31.4ÃÂ s, lessening the past Olympic imprint by 5.8ÃÂ s, a sign of how much the world record had fallen in the first four years. Be that as it may, in the following warmth, Egon Henninger of Germany promptly brought down the imprint, and before the finish of the warms, O'Brien was the fourth quickest qualifier for the elimination rounds, with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting quicker occasions. O'Brien brought down Henninger's Olympic record by winning the second elimination round in a period of 2ÃÂ min 28.7ÃÂ s, after Jastremski had won the principal elimination round in a period that was 3.4ÃÂ s slower than O'Brien. This made O'Brien the quickest qualifier for the last, with a period that was 1.0ÃÂ s quicker than the following qualifier Prokopenko, who came next to him in the second elimination round. O'Brien intended to swim the race at an even pace and record even parts for the first and second 50% of the race. He was aware of not pursuing Jastremski, who was known for a forceful opening style, which brought about a quicker first half.
