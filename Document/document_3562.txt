In a meeting with "The Sporting News" in August 1951, Chandler refered to his choice to void an exchange between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox for outfielder Dick Wakefield as a central point in his powerlessness to verify another agreement. The Yankees exchanged Wakefield to the White Sox for money, yet Wakefield wouldn't answer to the White Sox after a pay question, which prompted a difference between the groups over who was in charge of his compensation. Chandler voided the exchange, making Wakefield's agreement the Yankees' duty and rankling their proprietor, Del Webb. It was not until the 1970s that Chandler started to refer to his association in the mix of baseball as a purpose behind his agreement not being reestablished. Student of history John Paul Hill believes that to be impossible, in any case, since two of Chandler's most grounded partners, Connie Mack and Walter Briggs, Sr., were passionately contradicted to incorporation, and Bill DeWitt, the second proprietor in the American League to coordinate, casted a ballot against him. Slope focuses to the Dick Wakefield question and Chandler's examinations of Del Webb and Cardinals proprietor Fred Saigh including their supposed associations with betting interests to be additionally convincing purposes behind Chandler's rejection.
