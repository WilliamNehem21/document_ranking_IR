The first record containing crafted by Archimedes is the Archimedes Palimpsest. In 1906, the Danish educator Johan Ludvig Heiberg visited Constantinople and analyzed a 174-page goatskin material of supplications written in the thirteenth century AD. He found that it was a palimpsest, a record with content that had been composed over an eradicated more established work. Palimpsests were made by scratching the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a typical practice in the Middle Ages as vellum was costly. The more established works in the palimpsest were recognized by researchers as tenth century AD duplicates of already obscure treatises by Archimedes. The material burned through several years in a religious community library in Constantinople before being sold to a private authority during the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at closeout to an unknown purchaser for $2 million at Christie's in New York. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the main enduring duplicate of "On Floating Bodies" in the first Greek. It is the main known wellspring of "The Method of Mechanical Theorems", alluded to by Suidas and thought to have been lost until the end of time. "Stomachion" was likewise found in the palimpsest, with a more total examination of the riddle than had been found in past writings. The palimpsest is presently put away at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it has been exposed to a scope of current tests including the utilization of bright and light to peruse the overwritten content.
