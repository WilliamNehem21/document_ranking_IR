Like the remainder of the arrangement, the scenes for the principal season scenes were shot on-area in Baltimore. The utilization of hand-held cameras enabled the film to be shot all the more effectively in the city, instead of on a sound-organize in Los Angeles or New York City, where most shows are commonly shot. Levinson said being on area consistently permitted Baltimore "to be a character in the show". The Recreation Pier Building, a Fells Point structure worked in 1914 which once housed Baltimore's marine police, was utilized as the arrangement of the police office station, which was the main set for the show. The structure looked so sensible that Baltimore occupants would incidentally meander into it to report real wrongdoings. Generation executive Vincent Peranino made the squad room set inside the Recreation Pier Building. While most sets incorporate a couple of phony dividers inverse an open space for the cameras and group, Peranino structured the whole room as though it were a genuine setting, including separate regions for the analysts' espresso room and the cross examination room known as "The Box". The performing artists started putting away their genuine assets at their work areas on the set, left genuine individual messages to one another on the notice sheets, and got business cards with their characters' real names for their work areas.
