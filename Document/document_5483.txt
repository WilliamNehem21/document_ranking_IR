Amid its voyage in the North Sea, the armada explored different avenues regarding remote telecommunication on a vast scale and searchlights around evening time for correspondence and acknowledgment signals. Following coming back to Kiel, the armada started arrangements for the pre-winter moves, which started on 29 August in the Baltic.

After three days, the armada came back to the Baltic through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it took part in further landing activities with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the moves arrived at an end. "Wittelsbach" turned into the squadron leader on 1 October, flying the banner of "KAdm" Friedrich von Baudissin.
