Trescothick was unfit to maintain a strategic distance from a repeat of his past troubles when voyaging abroad, in any case, and returned home on 15 October, refering to the equivalent "stress related sickness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had moved toward at first after Somerset's annihilation by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, discharged an announcement to the media expressing "Marcus conceded two or three days back that he wasn't 100% with the goal that's sufficiently reasonable. I think his future will be in local cricket and that may even assist him with this specific type of disease. I thoroughly consider the following a few years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing magnificently well in province cricket." Michael Vaughan, who had by then resigned from cricket, adulated Trescothick's "bold" choice, as did Vikram Solanki, at that point PCA executive. Writer Andrew Miller required a conclusion to the rising analysis of Trescothick's choice from general society, while Paul Hayward of the "Gatekeeper" additionally disparaged those condemning of the Somerset player's activities. Regardless of returning home, Trescothick kept on avowing his pledge to the club by marking another three-year contract with discretionary fourth year, in December. He was named commander for the 2010 season.
