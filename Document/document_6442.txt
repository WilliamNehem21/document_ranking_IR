On December 16, 1972, the Portuguese sixth organization of Commandos in Mozambique murdered the occupants of the town of Wiriyamu, in the area of Tete. Alluded to as the 'Wiriyamu Massacre', the troopers slaughtered between 150 (as indicated by the Red Cross) and 300 (as per an a lot later examination by the Portuguese paper "Expresso" situated in declarations from officers) locals blamed for protecting FRELIMO guerrillas. The activity, "Task Marosca", was arranged at the prompting of PIDE/DGS specialists and guided by operator Chico Kachavi, who was later killed while an investigation into the occasions was being completed. The troopers were told by this operator that "the requests were to slaughter them all", don't bother that just regular citizens, ladies and kids notwithstanding, were found. The majority of the unfortunate casualties were regular folks. The slaughter was described in July 1973 by the British Catholic minister, Father Adrian Hastings, and two other Spanish teacher clerics. Later counter-claims have been made in a report of Archbishop of Dar es Salaam Laurean Rugambwa that supposed that the killings were done by FRELIMO soldiers, not Portuguese powers. Likewise, others asserted that the supposed slaughters by Portuguese military powers were created to tar the notoriety of the Portuguese state abroad. Portuguese writer FelÃÂ­cia Cabrita reproduced the Wiriyamu slaughter in detail by talking the two survivors and previous individuals from the Portuguese Army Commandos unit that completed the slaughter. Cabrita's report was distributed in the Portuguese week by week paper "Expresso" and later in a book containing a few of the columnist's articles. On July 16, 1973, Zambia denounced the supposed slaughters completed by Portuguese troops.
