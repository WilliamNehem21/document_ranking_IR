The act forbade the company from issuing shares below Â£10 so, to make them easier for ordinary people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten so they could be paid for in instalments. The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only Â£3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept Â£500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as Â£3 million of ordinary shares and Â£4Â million of preference shares. Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. Barings and Rothschild jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully underwritten, allowing construction to begin. The first sod was cut on 11 November 1887, by Lord Egerton of Tatton, who had taken over the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from Adamson.
