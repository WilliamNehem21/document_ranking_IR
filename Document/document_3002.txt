Toward the finish of the 1970s and into the mid 1990s, USÃÂ 31 increased extra interstate portions on the two closures of the parkway. The primary segment of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway was finished in 1979 and kept running from the Indiana state line north to USÃÂ 12. The expressway was stretched out northward from Pentwater to the OceanaÃ¢ÂÂ Mason area line in 1980. Development of the Niles Bypass was done in 1987, conveying the turnpike north to Walton Road northwest of Niles. Transport. USÃÂ 31 was made along the previous steering in Niles. The northern expressway was expanded further into Mason County in two phases. In 1989, it was extended toward the south side of Ludington. The following year, Ludington was avoided, finishing the interstate to its present northern end at USÃÂ 10 east of town. One more detour, this time a non-road steering toward the west of Scottville, opened in 1991. The Berrien Springs Bypass was finished in late 1992. From that point forward, MDOT constructed a turnpike portion north from Berrien Springs to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27, 2003, at an expense of $97ÃÂ million (identical to $ in ). The last change to the directing of USÃÂ 31 happened in August 2004 when the course of Bus. USÃÂ 31 in Holland was swung back to neighborhood control; BL I-196 was rerouted to chase after USÃÂ 31 downtown as opposed to following the previous business circle through it.
