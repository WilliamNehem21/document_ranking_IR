The spotted green pigeon was deductively named by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, in view of Latham's portrayal. The first binomial name "Columba maculata" signifies "spotted pigeon" in Latin. Latham himself acknowledged this name, and utilized it in his 1790 work "File ornithologicus". Since Latham seems to have put together his 1783 depiction with respect to Davies' example, this can hence be viewed as the holotype example of the species. Consequent journalists were unsure about the legitimacy and connections of the species; James Francis Stephens proposed that it had a place in the organic product pigeon class "Ptilinopus" in 1826, and Johann Georg Wagler rather recommended that it was an adolescent Nicobar pigeon ("Caloenas nicobarica") in 1827. Tommaso Salvadori recorded the winged animal in an index about "far fetched types of pigeons, which have not yet been recognized" in 1893. In 1898, Henry Ogg Forbes bolstered the legitimacy of the species, in the wake of looking at Nicobar pigeon examples and reasoning that none took after the spotted green pigeon at any phase of advancement. He accordingly thought of it as a particular types of indistinguishable class from the Nicobar pigeon, "Caloenas". In 1901, Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert concurred that the pigeon had a place with "Caloenas", however recommended that it was presumably an "abnormity", however more than one example had been recorded.
