In comparative design, many driving executives made at least one movies for RKO amid this time, including Alfred Hitchcock yet again, with "Famous", and Jean Renoir, with "This Land Is Mine" (1943), rejoining Laughton and O'Hara, and "The Woman on the Beach" (1947). RKO and Orson Welles had an arm's-length get-together by means of "The Stranger" (1946), a free creation he featured in just as coordinated. Welles would along these lines call it his most exceedingly bad film, yet it was the just a single he at any point made that turned a benefit in its previously run. In December 1946, the studio discharged Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life"; while it would at last be perceived as one of the best movies of Hollywood's Golden Age, at the time it lost the greater part a million dollars for RKO. John Ford's "The Fugitive" (1947) and "Post Apache" (1948), which seemed acceptable before studio possession changed hands once more, were trailed by "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" (1949) and "Wagon Master" (1950); every one of the four were coproductions among RKO and Argosy, the organization kept running by Ford and RKO former student Merian C. Cooper. Of the executives under long haul contract to RKO during the 1940s, the best known was Edward Dmytryk, who previously came to see with the amazingly gainful "Hitler's Children" (1943). Shot on a $205,000 spending plan, putting it in the base quartile of Big Five studio preparations, it was one of the ten greatest Hollywood hits of the year. Another ease war-themed movie coordinated by Dmytryk, "Behind the Rising Sun", discharged a couple of months after the fact, was comparably beneficial.
