Hunching is a once in a while caught conduct of theropods, and SGDS.18.T1 is the main such track with unambiguous impressions of theropod hands, which gives important data about how they utilized their forelimbs. The hunkering stance was observed to be fundamentally the same as that of current winged creatures, and demonstrates that early theropods held the palms of their hands confronting medially, towards one another. In that capacity a stance in this way developed from the get-go in the ancestry, it might have portrayed all theropods. Theropods are frequently delineated with their palms confronting downwards, however investigations of their utilitarian life structures have demonstrated that they, similar to winged creatures, were unfit to pronate or supinate their arms (crossing the span and ulna bones of the lower arm to turn the hand). The track demonstrated that the legs were held symmetrically with the body weight appropriated between the feet and the metatarsals, which is additionally a component found in winged animals, for example, ratites. Milner and partners additionally expelled the possibility that the "Kayentapus minor" track revealed by Weems demonstrated a palm engrave made by a quadrupedally strolling theropod. Weems had proposed the trackmaker would have had the capacity to move quadrupedally when strolling gradually, while the digits would have been routinely hyperextended so just the palms contacted the ground. Milner and partners found the surmised posture superfluous, and proposed the track was rather made comparably as SGDS.18.T1, yet without leaving hints of the digits.
