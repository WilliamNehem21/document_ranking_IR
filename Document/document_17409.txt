As the hurricane accelerated eastward, it attained a peak intensity of 100Â mph (155Â km/h) on OctoberÂ 29. The rapid motion caused an asymmetry in the wind field, and the center passed approximately south of Bermuda without significantly affecting the island. A rapidly approaching cold front absorbed Grace on OctoberÂ 29, contributing moisture to the developing extratropical storm that was eventually known as the Perfect Storm. As a tropical cyclone, Grace produced squally conditions across Bermuda, but no damage was reported. The hurricane generated large swells along the East Coast of the United States, causing minor beach erosion.
The origins of the Perfect Storm were from an area of low pressure that developed off Atlantic Canada on OctoberÂ 28. It moved southward and westward as an extratropical cyclone due to a ridge to its north, and reached its peak intensity. The storm lashed the East Coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding, before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast. On NovemberÂ 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of . The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.
