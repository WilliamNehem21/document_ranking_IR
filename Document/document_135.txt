Meeker came back to the Yukon twice more, in 1899 and 1900. The greater part of the cash earned through basic needs was put resources into gold mining, and was lost. When he withdrew the Klondike once and for all in April 1901, he deserted him the body of his child Fred, dead of pneumonia in Dawson City on January 30, 1901. In his compositions, Meeker attributed his unexpected takeoff from the Yukon in 1901 to mining misfortunes and his up and coming 50th wedding commemoration. Meeker researcher Dennis M. Larsen in his book on the pioneer's Klondike experience proposes that an almost certain reason was endeavors by the individuals who had lost cash in Meeker's ventures during the 1890s to pick up the family's staying real resource, the Meeker Mansion. That property was sold by Eliza Jane Meeker to her little girl Caroline and child in-law Eben Osborne for $10,000 in mid-1901 and soon thereafter both Ezra and Eliza Jane executed records expressing that the house had been her different property, paid for with assets not getting from Ezra. The deal to the Osbornes included arrangements that Ezra and Eliza Jane were to have lifetime living arrangement and $50 every month. Ezra Meeker did not live there after his better half's passing in 1909, and the Osbornes sold the house in 1915. Eben Osborne kicked the bucket in 1922, made due by his 91-year-old dad in law.
