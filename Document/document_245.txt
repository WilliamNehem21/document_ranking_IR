After an enthusiastic meeting concerning political issues, King straightforwardly inquired as to whether there was "any situation in which [he] would keep running for president." Perot solidly expressed that he would not like to run, however unexpectedly certified that he would start a battle if "standard individuals" marked petitions and helped him accomplish ticket access in every one of the 50 states. He set up a telephone bank at his office on March 12, staffed with volunteers to advise intrigued voters and supporters on how they could help Perot's potential battle. Supporters saw the applicant as an "activity manÃÂ ... who can get things doneÃÂ ... [and who] deals with his kin". They resented President Bush for reneging on .

Yet, Republican specialist Karl Rove described Perot as an "untested wild man". He dismissed any money related gifts for more than $5, and expressed that he would by and by store a potential battle. Perot burned through $400,000 of his own cash in the primary month, be that as it may, he generally spread this message by means of TV, topped by a March 18 National Press Club discourse, which broadcast on C-SPAN.
