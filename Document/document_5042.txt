Only before the nationalization of the railroads in 1948, the Southern Railway put in a request for ten more Merchant Navy trains, with bigger tenders. A deficiency of materials implied that conveyance was deferred until September 1948, and finished in 1949; the group never conveyed Southern Railway numbers. Eastleigh was in charge of the development of the last cluster, which were in the arrangement 35021Ã¢ÂÂ 35030. Development was embraced in-house by Eastleigh works, with the boilers and tenders built at Brighton, the casings at Ashford and the rest at Eastleigh. These were furnished with wedge-formed taxi fronts from the beginning, and more noteworthy utilization of welding guaranteed lighter trains. The clump was additionally fitted with the TIA ("Traitement Integral Armand") concoction feed-water gear utilized on the "Light Pacifics". This hastened scale-framing constituents in the "hard-water" of southern England into a non-glue mud that could be cleared from the train utilizing a manual "blow-down" valve. A postponement in the development of the new bigger tenders for the new trains implied that some were fitted with the littler precedents proposed for use with "Light Pacifics" that were under development at the time. Two extra boilers for the class were likewise built at Brighton and Eastleigh amid 1950/1.
