Getting ready for the scene was physically troublesome for a portion of the cast individuals, the majority of whom had little experience singing and moving. They went through three months in voice preparing. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on move arrangements. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is prepared in artful dance, mentioned a move succession in lieu of a huge singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), as per Whedon, beseeched him not to give her numerous lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that "It took something like 19ÃÂ hours of singing and 17ÃÂ hours of moving in the middle of shooting four different scenes" and she was so on edge about singing that she "abhorred each snapshot of it". At the point when Whedon proposed utilizing a voice twofold for her, be that as it may, she stated, "I fundamentally began to cry and stated, 'You mean another person will do my enormous enthusiastic defining moment for the season?' In the end, it was an inconceivable encounter and I'm happy I did it. What's more, I never need to do it again." Davies was so awed with Hinton Battle's execution on Broadway in "The Wiz" that he requested that Battle play the evil spirit Sweet. Fight, a three-time Tony-victor, wore prosthetic compensate out of the blue to give him a wicked red face. Sweet was depicted as "smooth", smooth and a la mode; conversely, most evil spirits on the arrangement were intended to be rough and terrible. The set for The Bronze was utilized oftentimes all through the arrangement, however stairs were worked from the phase to boost floor space for Battle's move.
