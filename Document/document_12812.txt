Diem selected Bui Van LuongÃ¢ÂÂa family companion and ardent CatholicÃ¢ÂÂas the head of COMIGAL, the administration resettlement organization. COMIGAL worked in collaboration with the United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the American nearness and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. In spite of the fact that COMIGAL was simply devoted to exile issues, there was a steady turnover of community workers through their staff, and the advantages of congruity did not appear. After just a couple of months in the activity, Luong was supplanted by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were enhanced by American Catholic guide organizations and a warning gathering from Michigan State University, where Diem had stayed while in willful outcast in the mid 1950s. There were three stages in the resettlement program. With more than 4,000ÃÂ new landings every day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and VÃÂ©ng TÃÂ u in 42 alternative gathering focuses. These comprised of existing schools, cleared French dormitory, houses of worship and makeshift camps on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and PhÃÂº ThÃ¡Â»Â Racecourse. These couldn't be utilized uncertainly as the grounds should have been utilized for their prior reason, and besides, such specially appointed regions were defenseless against episodes of flame and illness.
