A great part of the music Tippett created following the musical show's culmination mirrored its melodious style. Among these works was the "Capriccio Concertante on a Theme of Corelli" (1953) for string ensemble, written to celebrate the 300th commemoration of the arranger Arcangelo Corelli's introduction to the world. The "Rhapsody" would in the long run become a standout amongst Tippett's most prevalent works, however "The Times"s commentator bemoaned the "over the top multifaceted nature of the contrapuntal writingÃÂ ... there was such a great amount of going on that the bewildered ear knew not where to turn or affix itself". Such remarks cultivated a view that Tippett was a "troublesome" arranger, or even that his music was awkward and ineffectively arranged. These observations were reinforced by discussions around a few of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was announced unplayable by its planned soloist, Julius Katchen, who must be supplanted before the premiÃÂ¨re by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had composed the "Sonata for Four Horns" (1955), griped that the work was in too high a key and expected it to be transposed down. At the point when the Second Symphony was premiÃÂ¨red by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live communicate from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work separated following a couple of minutes and must be restarted by the conciliatory director: "Completely my oversight, women and noble men". The BBC's Controller of Music guarded the symphony in "The Times", composing that it "is equivalent to every single sensible interest", a wording that suggested the blame was the composer's.
