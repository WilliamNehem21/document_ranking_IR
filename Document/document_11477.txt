After task to the staff of the Army's Chief of Ordnance from 1905 to 1906, McNair was allocated to the Watertown Arsenal, where he finished self-coordinated scholastic investigations in metallurgy and other logical themes. In this posting, he picked up involvement with both research facility and pragmatic strategies for experimentation, including investigating bronze, steel, and cast iron to decide the best materials to use in assembling guns and different weapons. What's more, he increased firsthand involvement with the utilizations and uses of a few foundry machines, including produces, steam hammers, machines, planing machines, and exhausting machines. His business school foundation in measurable examination and designing (counting specialized illustration) helped make him fruitful at testing and experimentation; because of his involvement with Watertown, for the remainder of his vocation the Army as often as possible depended on him to supervise sheets that created and tried weapons and other gear, and made suggestions on which things were most reasonable for obtainment and handling. He was elevated to brief first lieutenant in July 1905, and changeless first lieutenant in January 1907. In May 1907, McNair was elevated to impermanent chief. (His higher transitory positions connected in the Ordnance branch, however not in the Artillery.)
