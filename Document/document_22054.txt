Behind "Volage" and "DanaÃ©", the Venetian "Corona" had engaged "Cerberus" in a close range duel, during which "Cerberus" took heavy damage but inflicted similar injuries on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of "Active" caused the "DanaÃ©", "Corona" and "Carolina" to sheer off and retreat to the east. To the rear, "Amphion" succeeded in closing with and raking "Flore", and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the French colours overboard in surrender. Captain PÃ©ridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in "Flore"'s later movements. "Amphion" then attacked "Bellona" and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender. During this combat, the small ship "Principessa Augusta" fired on "Amphion" from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off. Hoste sent a punt to take possession of "Bellona" but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize "Flore". Realising "Amphion's" difficulty, the officers of "Flore", who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between "Amphion" and "Bellona", immediately set sail for the French harbour on Lesina (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.
