Lemurs are primates having a place with the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, for example, lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share tribal (or plesiomorphic) qualities with early primates. In such manner, lemurs are prominently mistaken for hereditary primates; be that as it may, lemurs did not offer ascent to monkeys and gorillas (simians). Rather, they advanced autonomously in separation on Madagascar. All advanced strepsirrhines including lemurs are generally thought to have developed from early primates known as adapiforms amid the Eocene (56 to 34ÃÂ mya) or Paleocene (66 to 56ÃÂ mya). Adapiforms, in any case, do not have a particular plan of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which about all living strepsirrhines have. A later speculation is that lemurs dropped from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is upheld by similar investigations of the cytochromeÃÂ b quality and the nearness of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in the two gatherings. Rather than being the immediate predecessors of lemurs, the adapiforms may have offered ascend to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be bolstered by sub-atomic phylogenetic investigations. The later split among lemurs and lorises is thought to have happened roughly 62 to 65ÃÂ mya as per sub-atomic examinations, albeit other hereditary tests and the fossil record in Africa recommend increasingly traditionalist evaluations of 50 to 55ÃÂ mya for this uniqueness. In any case, the most seasoned lemur fossils on Madagascar are really subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene.
