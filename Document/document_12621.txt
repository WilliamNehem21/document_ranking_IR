In the last quarter, the Australian barrier stayed solid, however their shooting did not improve. For the whole amusement, Crispin made just 3 out of 10 endeavors, and Merritt only 4 out of 16. Nott, who played the whole amusement, wound up being the group's most exact player, with four out of five endeavors. In the interim, Team USA battled back to 40Ã¢ÂÂ 39. Three timeouts were taken in the latest possible time. The diversion went down to the most recent seconds. Trailing 40-37 with under 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Intentionally fouling Merrit put Miller out of the amusement, and sent Merritt to the free-toss line. It was a hazard, however it satisfied; Merritt missed the two shots. The second was bounced back by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who brought the ball down the court, despite the Gliders' determined barrier. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the most youthful of Team USA's players. Onlookers saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with one moment to go, however the shot clock was not reset. Group USA's Alana Nichols bounced back, and put the ball in the pail, however not before time ran out and a shot clock infringement was called. This left Australia with ownership. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all finished, and Australia had a dubious one-point win.
