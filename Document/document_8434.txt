The setting was improved when, following the demise of his significant other during the 1930s, North dispatched Lutyens to structure two processional doors to Victoria Park, prompting the war remembrance, as a blessing to the city. Lutyens created a couple of cabins and doors at the Granville Road access to Victoria Park, toward the north-east of the remembrance, and a lot of entryways and entryway docks toward the north-west, driving out onto University Road. The cabins are single-story rectangular structures which flank the doors. The outer dividers are stuccoed, giving the impact of ashlar, with quoins at the points and substantial scarf windows. Both have architraves over the entryways and a pulvinated frieze beneath the pyramidal slate rooftops and expansive smokestack stacks. The four entryway wharfs are made of ashlar, coordinating the cabins. They bolster lavish iron doors which include an oust fusing Leicester's ensign. The entryway docks at the University Road entrance are in Portland stone, coordinating the remembrance, designed with Tuscan pilasters and finished with an entablature and tall urns. They bolster two littler passerby entryways, one each side of a focal pair. Over the focal doors is an oust, again highlighting the city's emblem. A processional route leads from the two doorways to the war dedication, where the two ways meet. The long way from the commemoration to the University Road doors is known as the Peace Walk (previously War Memorial Approach) and is lined by bush outskirts and formal bloom beds.
