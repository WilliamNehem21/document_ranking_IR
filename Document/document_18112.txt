The first section of the parkway, from Bloor Street to Eglinton Avenue, was opened on August 31, 1961, by Ontario Premier Leslie Frost and Metro chairman Gardiner, who presented Frost with a silver plate.
It opened initially without an interchange at Don Mills Road and had its first traffic jam that day at the Eglinton Avenue exit.
The interchange at Don Mills was approved by Metro council on November 2, 1964.
Building the section within the valley required significant civil engineering, including the rerouting of of the Don River, installation of of reinforced retaining wall
and the removal of two hills. Tumper's Hill, located near the Don Mills Road interchange, stood higher than it does today.
Sugar Loaf Hill, shaped like a cone, which stood alone in the shadow of the Prince Edward Viaduct where Bayview Avenue passes today, was removed completely. The of earth was used as fill for the parkway and a total of of earth was excavated and moved.
Besides modification of the natural landscape, the route required relocation and demolition of utilities and residences. Metro relocated of CNR and CPR railway tracks in the section from Bloor Street to Chester Hill Road to make way for the parkway.
The Todmorden sewage treatment plant, built in 1926, was also demolished.
The route required the removal of five homes on Minton Place located above the valley to facilitate the cut of the valley hillside. Four were demolished and one moved to Scarborough.
