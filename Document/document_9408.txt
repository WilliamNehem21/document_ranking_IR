Vermigli is best known for his polemics against the Catholic teaching of transubstantiation and for the Reformed convention of "hallowed nearness". He contended that transubstantiation, the conviction that the substance of bread and wine are changed into Christ's body and blood, did not depend on any contention from sacred text. He likewise contended based on Chalcedonian Christology, that since Christ held his awesome nature when he progressed toward becoming man (the heavenly nature was added to the human instinct as opposed to his human instinct being made celestial), the substance of the bread and wine continue as before instead of being changed into the substance of Christ's body and blood. At last, he utilized the relationship of the devotee's association with Christ against the possibility of transubstantiation. Since the devotee holds their human instinct despite the fact that God has gone along with them with Christ, it pursues that the Eucharistic components don't should be changed to be Christ's body. Rather than the substance of the components changing into Christ's tissue, Vermigli accentuated the activity of the ceremony as an instrument through which Christ is offered to the partaker. He additionally couldn't help contradicting the Anabaptist conviction that the Eucharist is essentially emblematic or allegorical, a view called memorialism or tropism.
