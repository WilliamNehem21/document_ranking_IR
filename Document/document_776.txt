In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office started moving in the direction of another arena, with the city distinguishing three potential destinations for development, and selecting arena manufacturer Populous to ponder each. The three destinations were a zone on the north end of The Gulch, the state-claimed parking garage on the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulfur Dell), and different territories legitimately neighboring Nissan Stadium and the eastern end of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still favored the past Thermal site because of its closeness to the city's stimulation and focal business regions, yet the city was not willing to influence a second endeavor at an arena in that area (To rise Amphitheater was in the end worked there). City hall leader Karl Dean favored the Sulfur Dell site, trying to support monetary development on downtown's slow North side, while fusing the ballpark into the encompassing neighborhoods. In pre-fall 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government achieved a consent to assemble another $37ÃÂ million downtown ballpark at Sulfur Dell. Development on First Tennessee Park started after fundamental land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time for the beginning of the 2015 season.
