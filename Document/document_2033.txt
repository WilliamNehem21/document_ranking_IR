The utilization of Viking topics and symbolism in hard shake and overwhelming metal music originates before the coming of Viking metal. For example, the verses to Led Zeppelin's "Migrant Song" (1970) and "No Quarter" (1973) highlight suggestions to Viking voyages, savagery, and investigation. The Swedish band Heavy Load frequently composed Viking-themed tunes, for example, the 1978 tune "Child of the Northern Light", and Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic claims that the 1983 melody "More grounded than Evil" sets up a case for Heavy Load as the principal Viking metal gathering. Another early case of Viking-themed overwhelming metal is the 1979 collection "From the Fjords" by the American band Legend. Swedish neoclassical metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen some of the time highlighted subjects of hyper-manliness, brave warriors, and Vikings; for instance, on his 1985 collection" Marching Out". The German band Grave Digger and American band Manowar, the two of which shaped in 1980, drew upon Norse fantasy as imagined in Richard Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen". Steadfast Breath Ã¢ÂÂ which wore hide and horned protective cap ensembles Ã¢ÂÂ and TNT additionally explored different avenues regarding Viking subjects. Manowar received Viking symbolism considerably more vigorously than different groups, and wound up known as the "bosses of the fuzzy undergarment"; they met with derision even inside the metal network, yet pulled in a faction following. Dissimilar to the later Viking metal groups, Manowar did not waste time with the accuracy of well known Viking picture, and did not at all relate to the Vikings, religiously or racially. Trafford and Pluskowski clarify that "the Manowar variant of the Vikings owes as a lot to Conan the Barbarian as it does to history, adventure, or Edda: What is important to Manowar is untamed manliness, and the Vikings are for them only the prototype savage guys."
