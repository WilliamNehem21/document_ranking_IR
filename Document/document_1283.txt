The seventh Infantry Division was shaped the next month and set under the order of Major-General Richard O'Connor. The division was sent to Palestine on interior security obligations as a component of a development of 18,500 men in the district. This power at that point started to stifle the revolt. In the mean time, Palestinian guerrillas had invade the Old City of Jerusalem. O'Connor's men continued to clear the region, pronouncing the Old City free of aggressors on 19ÃÂ October. That day, the division caught Acre and before the month's over were clearing Jaffa of agitators. Numerous Palestinians were kept and rebel movement fundamentally dropped off in the territory. In the north, the eighth Infantry Division, under Major-General Bernard Montgomery, and Special Night Squads occupied with counter-dread tasks, with O'Connor composing that one brigadier "constantly urged his men to be fierce". General Officer Commanding British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan Robert Haining wrote in late 1938 that "pointless brutality, malice ..., [and] executing without hesitating" must be checked. O'Connor was moreover contradicted to the measures in the north, and expressed "cruelty and superfluous viciousness with respect to our fighters" must be controlled. Amid the task in Jerusalem, just four to nineteen guerrillas were executed. In mid 1939, the revolt at long last arrived at an end.
