A partner of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge upheld the teaching of mainstream power as communicated in Douglas' KansasÃ¢ÂÂ Nebraska Act. He trusted entry of the demonstration would expel the issue of servitude from national governmental issues Ã¢ÂÂ in spite of the fact that it at last had the contrary impact Ã¢ÂÂ and went about as a contact among Douglas and Pierce to verify its section. Amid the discussion on the House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, exasperated by an explanation that Breckinridge had made, requested that he clarify or withdraw it. Breckinridge translated Cutting's interest as a test to duel. Under "code duello", the individual being tested held the privilege to name the weapons utilized and the separation between the warriors; Breckinridge picked rifles at 60 paces. He likewise indicated that the duel ought to be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his companion Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not planned his underlying comment as a test, trusted that Breckinridge's naming of terms comprised a test; he utilized guns at a separation of 10 paces. While the two men endeavored to illuminate who had issued the test and who claimed all authority to pick the terms, shared companions settled the issue, keeping the duel. The as of late received Kentucky Constitution forestalled any individual who took an interest in a duel from holding chose office, and the quiet goals of the issue may have spared Breckinridge's political vocation.
