Gideon Haigh proposes that Hobbs was an "unconstrained and unique", pattern setting batsman who was not reluctant to leave from universality. Gerald Howat takes note of that, beside his batting accomplishments, "Hobbs' biographers and obituarists could strike no harsh note. He was a man of good honor, religious conviction, and individual duty. Also, he was sufficiently unassuming to consider himself to be a normal individual favored with one phenomenal ability, which he put into its legitimate point of view. It was a mentality of mind which tempered the sternness of his methodology with a drawing in cleverness and a savor the experience of playing useful jokes." Among his counterparts, Hobbs was viewed as unassuming and kind, and never condemned different players. He stayed away from encounter, in spite of the fact that he was "discreetly decided", as indicated by "Wisden", and endeavored to maintain a strategic distance from exposure. As indicated by Fender, Hobbs "offered stature" to the calling of cricket. Present day faultfinders have communicated a few reservations: some have called attention to that his batting normal, albeit high, has been outperformed by others, and that among his numerous hundreds of years, few were as substantial as different players oversaw. Notwithstanding, others fight that his effect on the amusement, his accomplishment in demonstrating that experts could bat as openly and beautifully as beginners, and his thoughtfulness place him among the top cricketers ever. "Wisden" portrayed him in 2000: "More than any other individual, he lifted the status and respect of the English expert cricketer." In summing up his place ever, it stated: "He was not a craftsman, similar to a portion of his forerunners, nor yet a researcher, similar to a portion of the moderns; he was maybe the incomparable specialist."
