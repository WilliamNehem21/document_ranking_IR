The gray sturgeon's chronicled range crossed the whole Missouri River and into the Mississippi River. Verifiably, the species was uncommon to nonexistent in the upper Mississippi, most likely because of an absence of appropriate living space. Right now, the species is considered endangered all through its whole range. Starting at 2008, gray sturgeon can in any case be found all through their unique range, yet their populace numbers have seriously declined from the mid-twentieth century. The Missouri and Mississippi waterways from Montana to Louisiana, just as the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, keep on harboring a maturing populace of pale sturgeon. Pale sturgeon have never been extremely normal; as right on time as 1905 when the species was first recognized, they spoke to just a single in five of all sturgeon in the lower Missouri River and as few as one of every 500 where the Illinois River meets the Mississippi. Somewhere in the range of 1985 and 2000, the proportion of pale sturgeon to all sturgeon got declined from one in around 400 to one in almost 650. A recent report inferred that somewhere in the range of 6,000 and 21,000 gray sturgeon stayed in their regular territory around then.
