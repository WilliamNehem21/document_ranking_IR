The first of the three summit finishesÂ â Stage 14Â â was won by Alessandro De Marchi (), who had been in the day's breakaway. Quintana gained several seconds back, while Aru, RodrÃ­guez, Chaves and Majka all gained time on Dumoulin. RodrÃ­guez attacked strongly on the final climb to win Stage 15 and gained time on all his rivals, putting himself just one second behind Aru. Dumoulin lost further time to Aru, Majka and Chaves. The final stage with a summit finish was Stage 16: it was a difficult stage including seven climbs and was won by FrÃ¤nk Schleck (Trek Factory Racing). On the final climb, RodrÃ­guez gained two seconds on Aru in the final metres to put himself into the race lead for the final rest day, while Dumoulin lost more time and was nearly two minutes back.
After the rest day came the race's individual time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, who was more than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. RodrÃ­guez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.
