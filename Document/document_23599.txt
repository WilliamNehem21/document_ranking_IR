Asimov said that "The dropping of the atom bomb in 1945 made science fiction respectable" to the general public, but only eight US science fiction or fantasy magazines survived World War II: "Astounding Science Fiction", published by Street & Smith; "Weird Tales", from Delaney's Short Stories, Inc.; Standard Magazines' "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder Stories"; Ziff-Davis's "Amazing Stories" and "Fantastic Adventures"; Popular's "Famous Fantastic Mysteries"; and "Planet Stories", published by Love Romances, Inc. All had been forced to quarterly schedules by the war, except "Weird Tales", which was bimonthly, and "Astounding," still the leading sf magazine. Campbell continued to find new writers: William Tenn, H. Beam Piper, Arthur C. Clarke and John Christopher all made their first sales to "Astounding" in the late 1940s, and he published many stories now regarded as classics, including "Vintage Season" by C.L. Moore, "With Folded HandsÂ ..." by Jack Williamson, "Children of the Lens" by E.E. Smith, and "The Players of Null-A" by A.E. van Vogt. The pace of invention which had marked the war years for "Astounding" was now slackening, however, and in Ashley's words the magazine was now "resting on its laurels". In 1950, Campbell published an article on dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard; this was a psychological theory that would eventually evolve into Scientology, a new religion. Dianetics was denounced as pseudoscience by the medical profession, but to the dismay of many of "Astounding"'s readers it was not until 1951 that Campbell disavowed it.
