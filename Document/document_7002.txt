The genealogies of Otariidae and Odobenidae split practically 28ÃÂ Mya. Otariids started in the North Pacific. The most punctual fossil "Pithanotaria", found in California, is dated to 11ÃÂ mya. The "Callorhinus" genealogy split prior at 16ÃÂ mya. "Zalophus", "Eumetopias" and "Otaria" separated straightaway, with the last colonizing the shore of South America. The greater part of the different otariids differentiated in the Southern Hemisphere. The most punctual fossils of OdobenidaeÃ¢ÂÂ"Prototaria" of Japan and "Proneotherium" of OregonÃ¢ÂÂdate to 18Ã¢ÂÂ 16ÃÂ Mya. These crude walruses had a lot shorter canines and lived on a fish diet instead of a specific mollusk diet like the cutting edge walrus. Odobenids further differentiated in the center and late Miocene. A few animal groups had extended upper and lower canines. The genera "Valenictus" and "Odobenus" created prolonged tusks. The ancestry of the cutting edge walrus may have spread from the North Pacific to the Caribbean (by means of the Central American Seaway) 8Ã¢ÂÂ 5ÃÂ Mya and in this way made it toward the North Atlantic and came back toward the North Pacific through the Arctic 1ÃÂ mya. Then again, this heredity may have spread from the North Pacific to the Arctic and along these lines the North Atlantic amid the Pleistocene.
