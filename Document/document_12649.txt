To help the development, a shoreline support territory was set up at a shoreline at the mouth of the Kalueng River, which included evacuating submerged and landward snags. With the goal that the tanks and jeeps could promptly bolster the development, a scaffold was required over the Kalueng River. A starter task by the 22nd Infantry Battalion on 3 December 1943 verified an intersection zone and a log connect was developed. The task bounced off on 5 December, with the 29th/46th Infantry Battalion going through the bridgehead built up by the 22nd. It before long went under sporadic foe fire, and a tank was crippled by a land mine. Notwithstanding mounting resistance, the development was ended close to the tidal pond. It continued the following day, and the Japanese pulled back after a mounted guns barrage, their requests being "while at the same time staying away from any definitive commitment" to "do effective protection from endeavor to postpone the adversary advance". This turned into the example, with the Japanese liking to pull back as opposed to endure overwhelming losses. On 10 December, Edgar brought each of the three of his forces into the line and by 14 December they were surrounding Lakona, a key position on the twentieth Division's retreat course.
