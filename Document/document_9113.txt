Understanding that he couldn't escape and would need to battle his way past the British, Bompart shaped his squadron into a battleline and turned westwards, sitting tight for Warren's flag for the assault. As a result of the scattered idea of his squadron, Warren did not issue this flag until 07:00, when he requested "Strong" to control for the French line and assault "Hoche" straightforwardly. Chief Edward Thornbrough of "Hearty" obeyed promptly and shut with the French, terminating into the frigates "Embuscade" and "Coquille" as he go, before shutting with "Hoche" and, at 08:50, starting a severe short proximity big guns duel. Minutes after the fact "Magnanime" joined the activity, terminating on the back frigates and connecting with the French van of "ImmortalitÃÂ©", "Loire" and "Bellone", which had exhausted of the line trying to rake her. The following three British boats energetically, "Ethalion", "Melampus" and "Amelia", all raked the segregated "Hoche" as they go, before going ahead sail to seek after the French frigates, presently making separation toward the south-west. "Canada" and the ensuing British ships all overlooked "Hoche" but to shoot a couple of far off shots. When they passed, the ship was unmistakably a disaster area, having been beat over and again by "Hearty" and "Magnanime". Bompart at last surrendered at 10:50 with 270 of his team and travelers slaughtered or injured.
