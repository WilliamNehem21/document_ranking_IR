Before 20th Century Fox gave "Alien vs. Predator" the greenlight, "Aliens" writer/director James Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth "Alien" film. "Alien" director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating "I think it would be a lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right." In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film "Prometheus" (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue "Alien vs. Predator", Cameron believed the film would "kill the validity of the franchise" and ceased work on his story, "To me, that was "Frankenstein Meets Werewolf". It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." After viewing "Alien vs. Predator", however, Cameron remarked that "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five "Alien" films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the "Alien vs. Predator" films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to "Aliens". However, Scott stated in 2017 that the project has been cancelled.
