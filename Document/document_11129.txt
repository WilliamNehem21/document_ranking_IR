England was an exemption; it held DST across the nation however balanced change dates throughout the years for a few reasons, including exceptional tenets amid the 1930s to dodge clock moves on Easter mornings. Presently late spring starts every year on the last Sunday in March under an European Community mandate, which might be Easter Sunday (as in 2016).
