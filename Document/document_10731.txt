Munsey's arrangement for the magazines was spread out in a note that showed up in the initial four issues: "This magazine is the response to a great many solicitations we have gotten over a time of years, requesting a second take a gander at celebrated dreams which, since their unique production, have turned out to be acknowledged works of art. Our decision has been managed by "your" demands and our firm conviction that these are the experts of innovative fiction." The main issue included Ray Cummings' "The Girl in the Golden Atom" and A. Merritt's "The Moon Pool", both prevalent stories by understood creators. Merritt's continuation, "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", started serialization in the following issue, with delineations by Virgil Finlay. Finlay did numerous representations for "Acclaimed Fantastic Mysteries" over its lifetime, and ended up a standout amongst its most famous specialists. Forthright R. Paul started delineating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as able a craftsman as Finlay but rather was extremely prevalent with the perusers. The initial five spreads were essentially tables of substance, yet with the 6th issue, dated March 1940, pictorial spreads started, with Finlay the craftsman for that first spread. Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, yet from there on pretty much every spread was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his child, Peter Stevens, including each and every issue from February 1941 through April 1950. The high caliber of the fine art helped make the magazine a standout amongst the most prominent of its day, and sf student of history Thomas Clareson has proposed that it was Finlay's work in "Celebrated Fantastic Mysteries" and "Fabulous Novels" that made his notoriety.
