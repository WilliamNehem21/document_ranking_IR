The fundamental Swedish armed force at Rawicz, under Charles XII, struck camp at 8 August and walked towards Krotoszyn, where the caught Otto Arnold von Paykull was taken under exacting military reconnaissance, for a group of people with the ruler. A few letters and reports Paykull had conveyed with him amid the fight, which he had attempted to dispose of before his up and coming catch, had been conveyed with him to Krotoszyn. The archives educated Charles XII of the more noteworthy partnered plan, under which the Tsar, Peter I of Russia, proposed to walk into Warsaw on 30 August at the head of 40,000 men and put a conclusion to the parliament. This would, they thought, incite Charles XII to make a move and walk with the Swedish armed force to Warsaw, where he would end up encompassed by Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg and his 20,000 men, who were gathering in Saxony, to move into Poland and assault the Swedes in the back. Charles XII, who had long looked for a definitive fight with the alliance powers, demonstrated no indication of frenzy at this, yet essentially expressed to his pastors: "I wish the foe may keep their pledge". On 10 August, he by and by struck camp and initiated a fast walk with his military towards BÃÂonie, near Warsaw, touching base on 17 August. He had left General Carl Gustaf RehnskiÃÂ¶ld with 10,000 men close PoznaÃÂ to prepare for the fundamental Saxon armed force under Schulenburg which took steps to enter Poland.
