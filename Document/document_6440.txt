In 1984, previous war laborer Geraldine Hoff Doyle went over an article in "Current Maturity" magazine which demonstrated a wartime photo of a young lady working at a machine, and she expected that the photo was taken of her in mid-to-late 1942 when she was working quickly in a plant. After ten years, Doyle saw the "We Can Do It!" notice on the facade of the "Smithsonian" magazine and expected the publication was a picture of herself. Without meaning to benefit from the association, Doyle chose that the 1942 wartime photo had roused Miller to make the notice, making Doyle herself the model for the notice. Thusly, Doyle was broadly credited as the motivation for Miller's publication. From a chronicle of Acme news photos, Professor James J. Kimble got the first photographic print, including its yellowed subtitle recognizing the lady as Naomi Parker. The photograph is one of a progression of photos taken at Naval Air Station Alameda in California, appearing and her sister working at their war employments amid March 1942. These pictures were distributed in different papers and magazines starting in April 1942, amid when Doyle was all the while going to secondary school in Michigan. In February 2015, Kimble met the Parker sisters, presently named Naomi Fern Fraley, 93, and her sister Ada Wyn Morford, 91, and found that they had known for a long time about the wrong recognizable proof of the photograph, and had been repelled in their endeavor to address the chronicled record. Naomi Parker Fraley passed on age 96 on January 20, 2018.
