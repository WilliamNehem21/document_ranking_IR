The exact period when the dromon was superseded by "galea"-derived ships of Italian origin is uncertain. The term continued in use until the late 12th century, although Byzantine writers were indiscriminate in their use of it. Contemporary Western writers used the term to denote large ships, usually transports, and there is evidence to support the idea that this usage had also spread to the Byzantines. William of Tyre's description of the Byzantine fleet in 1169, where "dromons" are classed as very large transports, and the warships with two oar banks are set apart from them, may thus indeed indicate the adoption of the new bireme galley types by the Byzantines. From the 13th century on, the term "dromon" fell into gradual disuse and was replaced by "katergon" (ÎºÎ¬ÏÎµÏÎ³Î¿Î½, meaning "detailed to/owing a service"), a late-11th century term which originally applied to the crews, who were drawn from populations detailed to military service. During the latter period of the Byzantine Empire, Byzantine ships were based on Western models: the term "katergon" is used indiscriminately for both Byzantine and Latin ships, and the horse-carrying "chelandion" was replaced by the Western "taride" (itself deriving from Arabic "á¹­arrÄ«da", adopted as "tareta", ÏÎ±ÏÎ­ÏÎ±, in Greek). A similar process is seen in surviving sources from Angevin Sicily, where the term "chelandre" was replaced by the "taride", although for a time both continued to be used. No construction differences are mentioned between the two, with both terms referring to horse-carrying vessels ("usserii") capable of carrying from 20 to 40 horses.
