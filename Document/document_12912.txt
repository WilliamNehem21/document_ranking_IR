In the interim, "BlÃÂ¼cher" had been vigorously harmed; her speed had dropped to , and her guiding apparatus was stuck. Beatty requested "Dauntless" to assault her at 10:48ÃÂ a.m. After six minutes, he spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and requested a quick 90ÃÂ° swing to port to maintain a strategic distance from the submarine, despite the fact that the submarine cautioning banner was not raised in light of the fact that the vast majority of "Lion"s flag halyards had been shot away. Before long a while later "Lion" lost her residual dynamo to the rising water, which thumped out all staying light and power. At 11:02, Beatty had banners raised flagging "course north-east", to take his boats back to their quest for Hipper, and "assault the back of the adversary". Back Admiral Sir Gordon Moore, incidentally telling the squadron from , suspected that the signs intended to assault "BlÃÂ¼cher", which was going toward the north-east, and requested the four different battlecruisers far from the quest for Hipper's principle power to lock in. Beatty attempted to address the mix-up, however he was so a long ways behind the main battlecruisers that his signs couldn't be perused in the smoke and murkiness.
