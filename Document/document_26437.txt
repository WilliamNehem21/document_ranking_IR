There are two possibilities for the number of points of intersections. One is that either or , say , is the equation for . In this case, is a line through . If is tangent to , then so is every circle in the pencil, and therefore is contained in . The other possibility is that neither nor is the equation for . In this case, the function is a quotient of quadratics, neither of which vanishes identically. Therefore, it vanishes at two points and has poles at two points. These are the points in and , respectively, counted with multiplicity and with the circular points deducted. The rational function determines a morphism of degree two. The fiber over is the set of points for which . These are precisely the points at which the circle whose equation is meets . The branch points of this morphism are the circles tangent to . By the RiemannâHurwitz formula, there are precisely two branch points, and therefore meets in two points. Together, these two possibilities for the intersection of and demonstrate that is a quadric cone. All such cones in are the same up to a change of coordinates, so this completely determines the shape of .
