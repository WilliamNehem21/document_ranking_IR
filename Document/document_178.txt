"Last Fantasy X" is set in the anecdotal universe of Spira, comprising of one extensive landmass partitioned into three subcontinents, encompassed by little tropical islands. It highlights assorted atmospheres, running from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the mild Mi'ihen locale, to the sub zero Macalania and Mt. Gagazet zones. Albeit overwhelmingly populated by people, Spira highlights an assortment of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, an innovatively progressed however disappointed sub-gathering of people with unmistakable green eyes and one of a kind language. The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with stretched fingers and other arboreal highlights. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's aware races are the "unsent", the solid willed spirits of the dead that stay in bodily structure. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to begrudge the living and change into "beasts", the beasts that are experienced all through the amusement; notwithstanding, unsent with solid connections to the universe of the living may hold their human structure. Other fauna in Spira, beside those drawn from genuine creatures, for example, felines, puppies, winged animals, and butterflies, incorporate the huge, land and/or water capable shoopufs (which are like elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which shows up in most "Last Fantasy" diversions. Spira is altogether different from the predominantly European-style universes found in past "Conclusive Fantasy" diversions, being substantially more firmly displayed on Southeast Asia, most prominently as for vegetation, geography, engineering, and names.
