The possibility that the streams Mersey and Irwell ought to be made safe from the Mersey Estuary in the west to Manchester in the east was first proposed in 1660, and restored in 1712 by the English structural specialist Thomas Steers. The vital enactment was proposed in 1720, and the Act of Parliament for the route go into law in 1721. Development started in 1724, embraced by the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company. By 1734 vessels "of moderate size" had the capacity to make the voyage from quays close Water Street in Manchester to the Irish Sea, however the route was reasonable for little ships; amid times of low precipitation or when solid easterly breezes kept down the tide in the estuary, there was not constantly adequate profundity of water for a completely loaded watercraft. The finishing in 1776 of the Runcorn expansion of the Bridgewater Canal, followed in 1830 by the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, heightened rivalry for the carriage of products. In 1825 an application had been made to Parliament for an Act to permit the development of a ship waterway between the mouth of the River Dee and Manchester at an expense of ÃÂ£1ÃÂ million, however "the vital structures not having been watched", it didn't progress toward becoming law. In 1844 responsibility for Mersey and Irwell Navigation was exchanged to the Bridgewater Trustees, and in 1872 it was sold to The Bridgewater Navigation Company for ÃÂ£1.112ÃÂ million. The route had by then fallen into deterioration, its proprietors favoring rather to keep up the more beneficial trench; in 1882 the route was depicted as being "miserably gagged with residue and rottenness", and was shut to everything except the littler vessels for 264 out of 311ÃÂ working days.
