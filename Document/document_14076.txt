This delivered a plague among them . . . furthermore, their numbers started along these lines to be diminished." Encouraged by the scourge among the Rus', the Muslims moved toward the city.

Depleted by the sickness and the attack, the Rus' "left by night the fortification in which they had set up their quarters, carrying on their backs everything they could of their fortune, jewels, and fine attire, young men and young ladies as they needed, and made for the Kura River, where the boats in which they had issued from their house were in availability with their teams, and 300 Russes whom they had been supporting with segments of their goods." The Muslims at that point unearthed from the Rus' graves the weapons that had been covered close to the warriors.
