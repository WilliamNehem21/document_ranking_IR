The peaceful intermission that pursues starts with the short instrumental development, the "Pifa", which takes its name from the shepherd-bagpipers, or "pifferari", who played their channels in the avenues of Rome at Christmas time. Handel composed the development in both 11-bar and expanded 32-bar shapes; as per Burrows, either will work in execution. The gathering of four short recitatives which tail it present the soprano soloistÃ¢ÂÂalbeit regularly the prior aria "Yet who may tolerate" is sung by the soprano in its transposed G minor structure. The last recitative of this segment is in D major and messengers the certifiable ensemble "Wonder to God". The rest of Part I is to a great extent conveyed by the soprano in B level, in what Burrows terms an uncommon occasion of tonal strength. The aria "He will bolster his rush" experienced a few changes by Handel, showing up at various occasions as a recitative, an alto aria and a two part harmony for alto and soprano before the first soprano form was reestablished in 1754. The propriety of the Italian source material for the setting of the serious finishing up melody "His burden is simple" has been addressed by the music researcher Sedley Taylor, who calls it "a bit of word-paintingÃÂ ... terribly strange", however he surrenders that the four-section choral determination is a flash of brilliance that consolidates magnificence with pride.
