On end, the Menominee, which was one of the wealthiest clans preceding end, wound up one of the most unfortunate. In 1954, the clan's timber activities enabled it to act naturally adequate. The clan, which possessed service organizations, paid for a clinic, BIA compensations, neighborhood schools, and a stipend to ancestral individuals. The clan was compelled to utilize its save assets to build up an end plan that they didn't need and as opposed to having a save, they went into end with a $300,000 deficiency. Menominee County was made out of the old reservation limits and the clan promptly needed to back its very own police and flame assurance. Without government support and with no duty base, the circumstance wound up critical. The clan shut the clinic, sold its service organization, and gotten those administrations to neighboring provinces. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., framed to think about the clan's needs after end, was unfit to make good on property government expenses and started to think about auctioning off innate property. Numerous Menominee inborn individuals trusted that the patron of the end charge, Senator Arthur Wilkins of Utah, planned to constrain the loss of rich ancestral terrains to non-Indians. In 1962, the territory of Wisconsin took the position that the chasing and angling rights were repealed by the end demonstration and that the inborn individuals were liable to state chasing and angling guidelines. With the destitution in the previous reservation, the loss of chasing rights implied the loss of one of their final methods for survival.
