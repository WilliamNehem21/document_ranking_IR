Although in the center of the Russian line during the battle, "Sevastopol" was only slightly damaged during the day. In the evening, the Russians massed their fire on the Japanese flagship , at that time away. The Japanese battleships returned fire and "Sevastopol" suffered several shell hits to her superstructure, which killed one man and wounded 62 others. A few minutes later, "Mikasa" was hit by two shells and one shell from and "Sevastopol", which caused 40 casualties. Soon after that, when it seemed that the Russians would be able to escape to Vladivostok, two 12-inch shells from penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind "Tsesarevich", including "Sevastopol", to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. Prince Pavel Ukhtomski, second in command of the squadron, who was on the "Peresvet", proceeded to signal the other Russian ships via semaphore to steam back to Port Arthur, although the signals were only gradually recognized by "Pobeda", "Poltava", and "Sevastopol". "Sevastopol" had one and two guns knocked out during the battle.
