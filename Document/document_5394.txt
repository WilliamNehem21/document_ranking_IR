Elgar was crushed by the loss of his significant other. With no open interest for new works, and denied of Alice's consistent help and motivation, he enabled himself to be diverted from sythesis. His little girl later composed that Elgar acquired from his dad a hesitance to "settle down to take a shot nearby however could merrily invest hours over some flawlessly superfluous and completely unremunerative endeavor", a quality that ended up more grounded after Alice's passing. For a great part of a mind-blowing remainder, Elgar entertained himself with his few leisure activities. For an amazing duration he was a sharp beginner scientific expert, in some cases utilizing a lab in his back patio nursery. He even protected the "Elgar Sulphuretted Hydrogen Apparatus" in 1908. He delighted in football, supporting Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C., for whom he made a song of praise, ""He Banged the Leather for Goal"", and in his later years he as often as possible went to horseraces. His protÃÂ©gÃÂ©s, the conductor Malcolm Sargent and musician Yehudi Menuhin, both reviewed practices with Elgar at which he quickly fulfilled himself that all was well and after that headed out to the races.

As an old single man, he appreciated being driven about the field by his driver. In November and December 1923, he took a voyage to Brazil, venturing up the Amazon to Manaus, where he was awed by its musical show house, the Teatro Amazonas. Nothing is recorded about Elgar's exercises or the occasions that he experienced amid the trek, which gave the writer James Hamilton-Paterson impressive scope when expressing "Gerontius", an anecdotal record of the adventure.
