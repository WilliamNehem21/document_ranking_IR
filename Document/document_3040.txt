In May 1943, Cole came back to Australia, taking over as AOC North-Western Area Command from Air Commodore Frank Bladin in July. Situated in Darwin, Northern Territory, he was in charge of territorial air barrier, observation, assurance of Allied sending and, later, hostile activities in the New Guinea crusade. Cole found the direction "healthy" however considered its air barrier capacity insufficient, prescribing increase by long-run warriors, for example, the P-38 Lightning. He all things considered needed to manage with the three squadrons of Spitfires as of now on his quality, and the likelihood of approaching the USAAF's Fifth Air Force for fortifications as important. Amid August and September, he diminished normal observation missions to "increment besieging action as far as possible", after a solicitation from General Douglas MacArthur to give all accessible help to Allied strikes on LaeÃ¢ÂÂ Nadzab. North-Western Area B-24 Liberators, Hudsons, Beaufighters and Catalinas completed attacks to devastate Japanese bases and airplane, and occupy adversary powers from Allied segments. Through March and April 1944, Cole had thirteen squadrons under his control, and was supporting land and/or water capable activities against Hollandia and Aitape. In May, he coordinated besieging from North-Western Area on Surabaya as a component of Operation Transom.
