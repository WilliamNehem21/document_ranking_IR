The 1938 coins, again without an exceptional name, were struck at all three mints, the first occasion when that had been accomplished for the Oregon Trail coins in a single year. Six thousand (or more pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25. A similar practice was followed in 1939, however the cost was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage diminished to 3,000 coins, in addition to the examine pieces. As per Swiatek and Breen, these sets were additionally purchased up by theorists, and individual gatherers regularly needed to pay twofold or triple the issue cost to verify a set. The coins did not sell out in a flash; the OTMA's bookkeeping records uncover that nine months after the 1938 coins were put marked down, the association still had practically a large portion of the issue accessible. Thus, by October 1939, the Association had sold just 8,283 half dollars dated that year, not exactly the 9,000 accessible available to be purchased. In any case, authorities sent letters of dissent to congressmen and to the Treasury Department. On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing enactment that put a conclusion to every memorial issue approved before March 1939. Swiatek and Breen saw that if Congress had not mediated, "there would most likely be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980".
