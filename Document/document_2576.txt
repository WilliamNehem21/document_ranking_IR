In 97ÃÂ AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao, the Protector-General of the Western Regions, sent his emissary Gan Ying on a discretionary mission to achieve the Roman Empire. Gan visited the court of Pacorus II at Hecatompylos before leaving towards Rome. He went as far west as the Persian Gulf, where Parthian specialists persuaded him that an exhausting ocean voyage around the Arabian Peninsula was the main way to achieve Rome. Disheartened by this, Gan Ying came back to the Han court and gave Emperor He of Han ("r".ÃÂ 88Ã¢ÂÂ 105ÃÂ AD) with a nitty gritty report on the Roman Empire dependent on oral records of his Parthian hosts. William Watson theorizes that the Parthians would have been soothed at the fizzled endeavors by the Han Empire to open discretionary relations with Rome, particularly after Ban Chao's military triumphs against the Xiongnu in eastern Central Asia. In any case, Chinese records keep up that a Roman government office, maybe just a gathering of Roman vendors, touched base at the Han capital Luoyang by method for Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) in 166ÃÂ AD, amid the rules of Marcus Aurelius ("r". 161Ã¢ÂÂ 180ÃÂ AD) and Emperor Huan of Han ("r". 146Ã¢ÂÂ 168ÃÂ AD). In spite of the fact that it could be incidental, Antonine Roman brilliant emblems dated to the rules of Marcus Aurelius and his forerunner Antoninus Pius have been found at Oc Eo, Vietnam (among other Roman ancient rarities in the Mekong Delta), a site that is one of the proposed areas for the port city of "Cattigara" along the "Magnus Sinus" (for example Inlet of Thailand and South China Sea) in Ptolemy's "Geology".
