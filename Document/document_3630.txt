In December 1695 the Spanish frontier experts in MÃÂ©rida got a conciliatory visit sent by the Aj Kan EkÃÂ¼. The political contact had been consulted by Spanish commander Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, "alcalde" of Bacalar-at-ChunjujubÃÂ¼. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya minister to NojpetÃÂ©n from Tipuj in April 1695, who touched base around a similar time that the Itza were planning to protect themselves against a Spanish gathering entering from Guatemala; in any case the emissary was gotten in harmony and despatched back to Hariza with guarantees of accommodation to Spain. In August Hariza headed out to MÃÂ©rida in the organization of a gathering of seven Tipuj locals offering accommodation to Spain. Four individuals from this gathering were not from Tipuj by any stretch of the imagination, however were Itza representatives sent in secret from Yalain to talk about conceivable quiet contacts with the provincial specialists. The pioneer of the Itza designation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza ruler. At the point when minister AvendaÃÂ±o was in MÃÂ©rida in September 1695 between endeavors to reach NojpetÃÂ©n, he met with the ItzaÃ¢ÂÂ Yalain assignment and had the capacity to give a record of them when he went through Yalain in the wake of visiting NojpetÃÂ©n in January 1696. AjChan and his partners came back to NojpetÃÂ©n in November yet did not remain well before leaving for MÃÂ©rida once more.
