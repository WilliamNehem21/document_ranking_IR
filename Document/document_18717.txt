The late 1960s and early 1970s also saw the complete reconstruction of three important interchanges: the Rainbow Bridge Approach (later HighwayÂ 420) in Niagara Falls, HighwayÂ 20 (Centennial Parkway) in Hamilton, and HighwayÂ 27 in Toronto. The former two were traffic circles in place since the QEW was opened in 1940; the third was a large cloverleaf interchange that had become outdated with the expansion of HighwayÂ 27 to ten lanes throughout the 1960s. The connections with the Rainbow Bridge Approach and with HighwayÂ 27 required new massive high-speed interchanges to accommodate freeway-to-freeway traffic movements.
The junction with HighwayÂ 27 was built over and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway. Construction began in SeptemberÂ 1968, although preliminary work had been ongoing since 1966;
the interchange opened to traffic on NovemberÂ 14, 1969, and included an expansion of the QEW to ten lanes between what would become known as HighwayÂ 427 and Lake Shore Boulevard.
Construction of the three-level stack interchange between the QEW and Rainbow Bridge Approach began in 1971, removing the two traffic circles along the approach at the QEW and Dorchester Road.
The interchange between the QEW and Lundy's Lane (HighwayÂ 20) was also removed; instead, the new stack interchange provided access to Montrose Road.
The work was completed by April 1972, at which point the Rainbow Bridge Approach was designated as HighwayÂ 420.
Planning for the removal of the Stoney Creek traffic circle was completed by 1970, and reconstruction began in 1974.
This involved the removal of a rail line which crossed through the circle, and was the demise of one of two major features along the route. The new interchange opened in 1978,
completing the transformation of the QEW into a controlled-access highway.
