He starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in "Intermission" (2003), which became the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" broke the record in 2006). Reflecting on his roles in "28 Days Later" and the "sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker" in "Intermission", Sarah Lyall of the "International Herald Tribune" stated that Murphy brought "fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate good looks have, as much as his acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next Colin Farrell, albeit one who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres". He had a minor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama "Cold Mountain" (2003). He portrayed a deserting soldier who shares a grim scene with Jude Law's character, and was only on location in Romania for a week. Murphy stated that it was a "massive production", remarking that director Anthony Minghella was the calmest director he'd ever met. Murphy also had a role as a butcher in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" (2003) with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.
