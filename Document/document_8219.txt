In April 1901, the residential Yeomanry Cavalry was renamed to the Imperial Yeomanry. The revamping set a set up regimental quality of 593 (later decreased to 476) all ranksÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ sorted out as before into four squadrons, however with the expansion of an assault rifle sectionÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ supplanted carbines and swords with LeeÃ¢ÂÂ Enfield rifles and pikes, and presented a standard khaki uniform. The Imperial Yeomanry's mounted rifles job in South Africa and the redesign, alongside the new outfits and hardware, prompted fears that the yeomanry was being consigned from rangers to infantry. The regiment appealed to the King for consent to hold the sword on procession, and by 1913 the weapon had been re-presented instead of the pike for general use. The Imperial Yeomanry as an association kept going just until 1908, when the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 happened and brought every single volunteer power, including the yeomanry, together into the Territorial Force. The Royal Gloucestershire Hussars directed its first yearly preparing under the new plan somewhere in the range of 19ÃÂ May and 2ÃÂ June 1909, when the first South Midland Mounted Brigade, of which the regiment was presently part, gathered with the first South Western Mounted Brigade for activities on Salisbury Plain.
