As per GameTap's VP of substance Ricardo Sanchez, "One reason [GameTap was] so pulled in to "Uru Live" is that it had this persevering gathering that kept it alive amid the dim days of its nonappearance." While Cyan committed its opportunity to "Myst Online", it guaranteed not to close down "Until Uru" meanwhile, in spite of the fact that it would offer no new confirmation keys. GameTap discharged "Myst Online" in February 2007. A Macintosh rendition, utilizing the Cider interpretation layer motor so that Intel-processor Macs did not require a Windows establishment to run the amusement, was discharged in March. At the time, "Myst Online" was the main Mac-good amusement on GameTap. New substance for the amusement was discharged as online "scenes", including new Ages, riddles, and plot continuation with every scene.
