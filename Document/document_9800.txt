Oberhausen, who has contemplated the wellspring of the mosaics and windows, expresses that something like four recolored glass windows were motivated by the canvases of Pre-Raphaelite craftsmen that were appreciating a resurgence in prominence at the time. These windows are: "Christ in the Temple" in the east transept, in light of a sketch by William Holman Hunt; "The Annunciation" in the east nave, propelled by a work by Frederic Shields; "The Nativity" in the chancel, in view of a composition by Edward Fellowes-Prynne; and "The Good Shepherd" in the west transept, motivated by an artwork by Sibyl C. Parker, the main female craftsman spoke to in the fine art of the congregation. None of the windows of Stanford Memorial Church required substitution after the 1906 shudder, with the exception of "the celebrated rose window of the first structure" in the organ space which was supplanted by the present extensive, focal curve window. This window, entitled "Lilies of the Field", is the main window in the congregation that can't be seen from within in light of the fact that it is closed off by the focal organ. There is a cross in the focal point of this window made of "faceted bits of glass that are inset like jewels", which shimmer when light strikes it.
