Another example, in the American Museum of Natural History under example number460, which is once in a while relegated to "Apatosaurus", is considered almost total; just the head, feet, and areas of the tail are missing, and it was the primary sauropod skeleton mounted. The example was discovered north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1898 by Walter Granger, and took the whole summer to extricate. To finish the mount, sauropod feet that were found at a similar quarry and a tail formed to show up as Marsh trusted it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere included. What's more, an etched model of what the exhibition hall figured the skull of this huge animal may look like was made. This was not a sensitive skull like that of "Diplodocus"which was later observed to be more accuratebut depended on "the greatest, thickest, most grounded skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three unique quarries". These skulls were likely those of "Camarasaurus", the main other sauropod for which great skull material was known at the time. The mount development was directed by Adam Hermann, who neglected to discover "Apatosaurus" skulls. Hermann was compelled to shape a remain in skull by hand. Osborn said in a production that the skull was "to a great extent approximated and dependent on that of "Morosaurus"" (presently "Camarasaurus").
