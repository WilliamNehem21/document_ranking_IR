At first, Horner is certain that he can search out the wedded ladies who are eager to have illicit relationships since they are the ones who couldn't care less about their respect. Horner appears to trust he is in a place of control over the ladies in light of the fact that their extramarital undertaking is with him, yet his capacity melts away amid the term of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish jump into Horner's lodgings in spite of his challenge, passing on "his lower position that suggests his camouflage: a humble eunuch." They talk about him as though he was absent, alluding to him as a 'monster,' 'frog,' and eunuch. Cohen says, "As the women develop in forceful self-assurance, Lady Fidget additionally 'applauds him on the back' along these lines uncovering the adjusted socio-sexual jobs that are currently introduced." While Horner supposes he is controlling the ladies, he has "depleted his sexual assets and has, in all actuality, become that feeble and pointless article with the world freely remembers him to be." Horner's actual power isn't in relationship to the ladies, yet to the men. He demonstrates his strength over the men he cuckolds.
