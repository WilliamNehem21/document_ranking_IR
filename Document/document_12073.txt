Extra substance was added toward the North American discharge that was missing in the underlying Japanese discharge: new discretionary supervisors, one of which was named after the victor of the official site's "Name-In-Game" sweepstakes, an additional trouble level, and a mystery of "Kingdom Hearts II" open by meeting certain criteria. Nomura incorporated the secret so as to measure fan response to the likelihood of a continuation; he felt that on the off chance that the thought was disliked, at that point it is ideal to leave certain occasions in the amusement unexplained. The new substance was later added to the Japanese re-discharge "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix". "Last Mix" included further extra substance, for example, new things, cutscenes, and adversaries, for example, another mystery manager that sets up the spin-off. The new substance further alluded to plotlines that would be clarified in spin-offs. Some substance excluded from "Kingdom Hearts" was later included into "Kingdom Hearts II". A world dependent on "The Lion King", for example, was unfeasible on the grounds that an extra program was required to process development on four legsÃ¢ÂÂa need since Sora would turn into a lion in that world. Because of time limitations, the engineers forgot a discretionary manager fight, like the Sephiroth fight, against Tifa Lockhart. She was later incorporated into "Kingdom Hearts II" as an increasingly created character.
