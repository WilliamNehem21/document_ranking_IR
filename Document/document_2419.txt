The most noteworthy change was the new accentuation given to the special stepped area, which was made the focal point of consideration and "flanked by the podium, perusing work areas and platform." The "central highlights" under the Carr Smith plan were the development of the apse, set into the eastern vestry to make an asylum; the raising of the chancel floor which made a stage, five stages over the nave for the choir, surrounded by the organ isolated into two segments; the creation of another, unpretentious access to the pinnacle and western exhibition; and the evacuation of the crate seats and the eastern and northern displays. The commemoration plaques were likewise adjusted. The choir was ornamented with a mosaic floor and fancy brasswork which supplemented the expansive metal falcon podium by the English clerical providers, J. Wippell and Company, that recognized Canon Robert Allwood. The floor of the platform was produced using portions of the old three-decker one. The organ, restored and expanded by Davidson of Sydney, was introduced in 1903. With the evacuation of the organ, the south vestry was made into a side church. Eight expansive recolored glass windows were introduced somewhere in the range of 1903 and 1913, alongside another platform, special stepped area and retable, which were all given as dedications. Another improvement was "the putting of twofold windows on the King-road side to close out the sound of the traffic, which heretofore has been a genuine inconvenience to both the administering pastors and the assembly". In 1897, St James' Hall was offered to Father Dorotheos Bakalliarios, a Greek Orthodox minister from Samos for Orthodox administrations in Sydney. In 1904 the diocesan engineer, John Burcham Clamp, was utilized to plan another area lobby.
