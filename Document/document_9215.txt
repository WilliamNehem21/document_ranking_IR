The magazine lost a lot of cash under Baird's editorship: after thirteen issues, the all out obligation was over $40,000. Meanwhile, "Criminologist Tales" had been retitled "Genuine Detective Tales" and was making a benefit, as seemed to be "School Humor". Henneberger chose to pitch the two magazines to Lansinger and put the cash in "Odd Tales". This did not address the $40,000 in obligations, a lot of which was owed to the magazine's printer. The printing organization was claimed by B. Cornelius, who consented to Henneberger's proposal that the obligation ought to be changed over to a greater part enthusiasm for another organization, Popular Fiction Publishing. This did not wipe out the majority of the magazine's obligations, yet it implied that "Unusual Tales" could proceed to distribute, and maybe come back to productivity. Cornelius concurred that if the magazine at any point wound up sufficiently beneficial to reimburse him the $40,000 he had been owed, he would surrender his offers in the organization. Cornelius turned into the organization treasurer; the business director was William (Bill) Sprenger, who had been working for Rural Publishing. Henneberger had any desires for in the end renegotiating the obligation with the assistance of another printer, Hall Printing Company, claimed by Robert Eastman.
