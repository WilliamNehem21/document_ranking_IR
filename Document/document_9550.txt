Towards the finish of the war, Elgar was in weakness. His better half idea it best for him to move to the field, and she leased 'Brinkwells', a house close Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar recuperated his quality and, in 1918 and 1919, he created four extensive scale works. The initial three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in EÃÂ minor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in advancement, Alice Elgar wrote in her journal, "E. composing awesome new music". Every one of the three works were generally welcomed. "The Times" stated, "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in different structures, however as we don't at all need him to change and be another person, that is as it ought to be." The group of four and quintet were debuted at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. "The Manchester Guardian" expressed, "This group of four, with its huge peaks, inquisitive refinements of move rhythms, and its ideal symmetry, and the quintet, increasingly melodious and enthusiastic, are as ideal instances of orchestral arrangements as the incredible oratorios were of their sort."
