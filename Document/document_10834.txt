While "The Darjeeling Limited" received commonly positive auditsÃ¢ÂÂhaving achieved a 68% endorsement rating on the survey aggregator Rotten TomatoesÃ¢ÂÂa large number of the heroes of "Lodging Chevalier" would in general consolidate recognition of "Chevalier" with inconspicuous shots at "Darjeeling". Portman's execution was adulated by "TIME" analyst Richard Corliss, who proclaimed her to be "a comic on-screen character in crisp blossom" in the "dumbfounding vignette", and communicated his desire that her job in "Darjeeling" had been more noteworthy. The component, he felt, came up short on "the inclination and mind of the short film". Stephanie Zacharek of "Salon" agreed, expressing that "the untold story of "Lodging Chevalier" is multiple times all the more intriguing, and interminably more extravagant, than the one told out and out in ", and calling the short "exceptionally near impeccable". "The Guardian" reporter Danny Leigh differentiated the tepid gathering of the component among bloggers and commentators with the "certifiable fervency" that welcomed the "splendidly estimated account" of "Chevalier". He recommended that the imperatives of the short-film group fit Anderson, whose trademark vacant cleverness, peculiar set plans and decision of soundtrack slanted to deplete the watchers' understanding in a full length work. A. O. Scott of "The New York Times" hailed "Chevalier" as "a little diamond" in contrast with the "overstuffed bag" of the element, and composed that "It merits searching out, not just in light of the fact that it fleshes out piece of the narrative of the Whitman siblings yet additionally on the grounds that, all alone, it is a practically ideal refining of Mr. Anderson's vexing and charming gifts, puzzling, influencing and wry."
