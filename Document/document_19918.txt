At the Botanic Garden he developed a special interest in "Vinca", "Epimedium", "Hosta" and "Symphytum", all of which he published monographs on. A series of botanical publications followed, starting with a new species of "Allium" ("A. farreri" Stearn, 1930). Stearn repeatedly returned to the genus "Allium", and was considered a world expert on it; many species bear his name. 1930 would also see his first bibliographic work, on the botanist Reginald Farrer, whom he named "Allium farreri" after, and also described "Rosa farreri" (1933) and other species named after Farrer. It was while he was compiling Farrer's works in 1930 that he came across the latter's work, "The English Rock-Garden" (1919) and its account of Barren-worts ("Epimedium"), and kindled a lifetime interest in the genus. From 1932, he produced a series of papers on this genus, studying it at Cambridge, Kew and Paris. It became one of the genera which he was best known, and many species of which now bear his name. "Epimedium" and the related woodland perennial "Vancouveria" (Berberidaceae) would be the subject of his first monograph (1938) and were genera to which he would return at the end of his life. At the time the taxonomy of this genus was very confused, and with the help of the Cambridge Herbarium he obtained specimens from all over Europe to produce a comprehensive monograph. The work was so thorough that it was mistakenly considered a doctoral thesis by other botanists. He also began a series of contributions to the catalogue of the Herbarium, together with Gilmour and Tutin.
