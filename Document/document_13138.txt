The cadenced course of the music was periodically hindered by thickly layered percussive and electronic impacts, including continued buzzing and pounding sounds. Cosey created these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an EMS Synthi A. The last gadget was an early synthesizer with handles and catches yet no console, making it valuable for creating unique clamors instead of definite pitches and tunes. He utilized it to propose a certain soundscape amid every execution, "regardless of whether we were in space, or submerged or a gathering of Africans playingÃ¢ÂÂsimply extraordinary soundscapes". In front of an audience, he likewise had a table set up holding a mbira, claves, agogo chimes, and a few other hand percussion instruments, which he played or hit with a hammer to demonstrate an alternate break or stop. "I would hit them simply as they do at [boxing] battles!", Cosey reviewed. His synthesizer once in a while connected with the test sounds Mtume had the capacity to produce from his drum machine, as amid the "Ife" portion. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume in the wake of accepting it from Yamaha, the Japanese visit's support, and let him know "see what you can do with it." Rather than use it to make rhythms, Mtume handled the drum machine through a few unique pedals and stage shifters, for example, the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, making a sound he said was "all out woven artwork".
