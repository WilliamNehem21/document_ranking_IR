Ideologically, Varg Vikernes' one-man venture Burzum roused the Viking metal scene through his unequivocally held bigot, nationalistic, and hostile to Judeo-Christian convictions, and his yearning for an arrival to agnosticism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's assessment, Vikernes' convictions, which had finished in the consuming of a few places of worship, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, uncover the befuddled idea of thoughts regarding Vikings in the Norwegian dark metal scene. They note, "His preferences appear to be initially not for the unmediated medieval itself with respect to J. R. R. Tolkien: he received the name 'Tally Grishnackh', in light of an orc in "The Lord of the Rings", and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'dimness'." They hypothesize that just all things considered did Vikernes "shroud his activities in an OÃÂ°inic attire and guarantee the inspiration of an endeavor to reestablish Norse agnosticism for his congregation consuming". While in jail, Vikernes discharged the book "VargsmÃÂ¥l", which Trafford and Pluskowski call a resounding of the "HÃÂ¡vamÃÂ¡l," however with "an eye on "Mein Kampf"". As per Trafford and Pluskowski, "demonstrating both that it isn't only the early medieval past to which he searches for motivation, and that he will utilize any chronicled weapon available to him to insult Norwegian liberal sentiment, it is prominent that he has as of late added the name Quisling to his own, and is notwithstanding endeavoring to guarantee a type of family relationship to the wartime teammate".
