In the Wheatbelt and east of the Stirling Range, it is a hindered tree. Tree shapes have a strong trunk, by and large wavy or bowed, with thick brittle orange-dim bark which is a red-dark colored underneath. It recovers from flame by means of lignotuber or epicormic buds from its flame tolerant trunk. It has long tight gleaming green direct leaves long and wide. The leaf edges have v-or u-molded serrations along their length. The new development is a pale dark green, and happens for the most part in the pre-summer and summer, frequently subsequent to blossoming. The splendid yellow inflorescences (bloom spikes) happen from spring into summer and are up wide and up to tall. They are comprised of numerous little individual blooms; an investigation at Mount Adams north of Perth uncovered a check of 1933 (ÃÂ± a standard blunder of 88) blossoms per inflorescence, and another in the Fitzgerald River National Park yielded a tally of 1720 (ÃÂ± 76) blooms. Anthesis continues up the bloom spike over around 10 to 20 days, and is nonconcurrent. That is, a plant produces blossom spikes over a multi week time span and will hence have spikes at various phases of improvement over the blooming season.
