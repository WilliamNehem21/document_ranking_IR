The endeavor recommenced its investigations in May 1860. Raynolds drove a gathering north and west up the upstream bit of the Bighorn River, which is today called the Wind River, planning to cross the mountains at Togwotee Pass in the Absaroka Range, a mountain pass known to undertaking guide Jim Bridger. In the mean time, Maynadier drove his gathering back north to the Bighorn River to investigate it and its related tributary streams all the more completely. The arrangement was for the two gatherings to rejoin on June 30, 1860 at Three Forks, Montana, so they could mention objective facts of a complete sun based obscuration figure for July 18, 1860. Hampered by transcending basaltic bluffs and profound snows, Raynolds endeavored for over seven days to inspect to the highest point of Togwotee Pass, however was constrained south because of the June 30 due date for achieving Three Forks. Bridger then drove the gathering south over another go in the northern Wind River Range that Raynolds named Union Pass, toward the west of which lay Jackson Hole and the Teton Range. From that point the campaign went southwest, crossing the southern Teton Range at Teton Pass and entering Pierre's Hole in present-day Idaho. Despite the fact that Raynolds and his gathering figured out how to get to Three Forks by the booked date, Maynadier's gathering was a few days late, which kept a separation traveling north to watch the sunlight based overshadowing. The rejoined undertaking at that point headed home, going from Fort Benton, Montana, to Fort Union close to the Montana-North Dakota fringe through steamboat. It at that point ventured overland to Omaha, Nebraska, where the undertaking individuals were disbanded in October 1860.
