For his promise to the idea of airworthiness, as a frame of mind to quality and polished methodology that went past just whether air ship were fit to fly or not, Wackett has been depicted as one of the "exceptional officers of the post-war period". The foundation of a devoted Technical Branch, which he established in 1948, was a key factor in the Air Force building up the capacity to effectively deal with the support and update of such profoundly modern airplane as the General Dynamics F-111. Wackett's 17-year residency reporting in real time Board, which was broken down in 1976, remained the longest of any officer in the RAAF. He was trailed by a progression of pioneers of the Technical Branch (renamed Engineering Branch in 1966) who shared his vision, including Air Vice Marshals Ernie Hey (1960Ã¢ÂÂ 1972) and James Rowland (1972Ã¢ÂÂ 75). Wackett was among those considered as conceivable successors to Air Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) when the last was resigned in 1952, yet Prime Minister Robert Menzies' government picked a RAF officer for the job, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman. Regardless, Air Force guidelines around then stipulated that representatives needed to have a place with the RAAF's General Duties (Aircrew) Branch. In 1975, Air Marshal Rowland was selected as CAS, however he needed to exchange from Engineering to General Duties before this could be formalized. The next year, the prerequisite for CAS to be an individual from the General Duties Branch was expelled.
