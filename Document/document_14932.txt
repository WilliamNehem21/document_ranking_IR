UrsÃÂºa chose that any further endeavors at tranquil fuse of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were silly, and a waterbourne strike was propelled upon Kan Ek's capital on the morning of 13 March. The settlement at ChÃÂ¼ichÃÂ¼ was left shielded by 25 Spanish fighters, three Maya musketeers and a few big guns pieces. UrsÃÂºa boarded the "galeota" with 108 warriors, two common ministers, five individual workers, the sanctified through water Itza emissary AjChan and his brother by marriage and an Itza detainee from NojpetÃÂ©n. The assault pontoon was paddled east from ChÃÂ¼ichÃÂ¼ towards the Itza capital; most of the way over the lake it experienced a huge armada of kayaks spread in a circular segment over the way to deal with NojpetÃÂ©n, covering about starting with one shore then onto the next Ã¢ÂÂ UrsÃÂºa essentially gave the request to push through them. Countless had assembled along the shore of NojpetÃÂ©n and on the tops of the city. As the "galeota" drew nearer, more kayaks put out from the shore and the Spanish were encompassed. When they had encompassed the "galeota", Itza bowmen started to shoot at the trespassers. UrsÃÂºa offered requests to his men not to flame but rather bolts injured a few warriors; one of the injured troopers released his black powder gun and by then the officers lost control of their men. The guarding Itza before long fled from the shriveling Spanish gunfire.
