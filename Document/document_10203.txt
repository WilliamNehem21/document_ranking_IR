As in prior hundreds of years, Jain creators expounded on tirthankars (holy people), sovereigns and different personages essential to the Jain religion. Jain variants of the Hindu sagas, for example, the Ramayana and Bhagavata (stories of Hindu god Krishna) were likewise composed. As indicated by R. Narasimhacharya, a prominent researcher on Kannada writing, more Jain essayists wrote in Kannada than in some other Dravidian language amid the "Augustan age" of Kannada writing, from the most punctual known attempts to the 12thÃÂ century. The Veerashaiva scholars, aficionados of the Hindu god Shiva, expounded on his 25 frames in their compositions of Shaivism. Vaishnava creators composed medicines of the Hindu stories, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata. Splitting far from the old Jain custom of utilizing the "champu" structure for composing Kannada writing, Harihara wrote lyrics in the "ragale" meter in "Siva-ganada-ragalegalu" (1160). His nephew Raghavanka built up the "shatpadi" convention by composing an exceptional rendition of the account of King Harishchandra in "Harishchandra Kavya" (1200). Sisumayana presented the "sangatya" meter in his "Anjanacharita" and "Tripuradahana" (1235). Be that as it may, a few researchers kept on utilizing Sanskritic sorts, for example, "champu" ("Ramachandra Charitapurana"), "shataka" (100 refrain pieces, "Pampa sataka") and "ashtaka" (eight line stanza arrangements, "Mudige ashtaka").
