While the skipper's consideration was completely involved futile endeavors to force request, a gathering of the ship's designers, driven by Chief Engineer J. W. Rogers, discreetly appropriated one of the two residual rafts. They kept up they required the pontoon for a last endeavor at stopping the breaks; any individual who scrutinized their expectations, or endeavored to board the watercraft, was undermined with guns. With abundant sustenance and water, this watercraft left the ship half full, consumed altogether by motor room staff. Of the ship's officers just Luce and Fourth Officer Francis Dorian currently remained; for all intents and purposes every one of the designers and sailors had left. Around 300 individuals were still ready, with a solitary raft. As a last measure to give probably some of them a possibility of survival, Luce requested the structure of a pontoon. The fore and primary yardarms, with different pillars, fights and other wooden ancient rarities, were gathered and brought down into the ocean where Dorian, in the rest of the pontoon, endeavored to direct the pontoon's development. Regardless of Dorian's supplications, his vessel was quickly overpowered; to spare it he cut free, leaving a last startled scramble for whatever security the half-completed pontoon could give. Among the individuals who discovered security in Dorian's watercraft was a fire fighter, Patrick Tobin. As per his later record: "It was each man for himself. No more consideration was paid to the skipper than to some other man ready. Life was as sweet to us as to other people".
