The principal generation renditions of the AMX-30, named "AMX 30B" to recognize them from the "AMX 30A" models, were finished in June 1966, made with a welded and cast body and a completely thrown turret. The generation rendition of the tank had a battle weight of . The AMX-30's survivability depended on its portability; French specialists trusted that the tank's versatility would have been undermined had they added enough steel plating to ensure against present day hostile to tank dangers, including high unstable enemy of tank warheads (HEAT). Thus, the sort had the most slender protective layer of any fundamental fight tank created at the time. The turret has a greatest covering thickness of , the reinforcement slanted at 70 degrees on the front plate and 23 degrees as an afterthought, offering security against protective layer puncturing shots. The Line-of-Sight defensive layer esteems are: for the front of the body; for the forward sides of the structure; for the back sides and back of the body; for the frame top and base; for the turret front; for the turret sides; for the turret back and for the turret top. Further insurance is offered by an atomic, natural and substance security suit, including a ventilation framework.
