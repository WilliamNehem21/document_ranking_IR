Wrigley headed out to England in 1928 to go to RAF Staff College, Andover, getting to be one of the first RAAF officers to finish the course. Staying in England, he was selected Australian Air Liaison Officer to the Air Ministry in 1929. That October, he started correspondence with the British Air Council to talk about a proposition for the RAAF to embrace as its very own the Royal Air Force's aphorism "Per Ardua Ad Astra"; casual endorsement was allowed by letter to Wrigley in March 1930. Coming back to Australia, he moved toward becoming Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters in October 1930, and Director of Organization and Staff Duties in December 1931. He was elevated to wing administrator in December 1932. In 1935 he distributed his history of No.ÃÂ 3 Squadron, "The Battle Below", which was viewed as a definitive treatment regarding the matter of armed force co-task. He was advanced gathering skipper in July 1936, and that October took over as boss of RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, from Group Captain McNamara. Wrigley gave over the station's direction to Group Captain Adrian Cole in February 1939. In May 1939, Wrigley filled in as the senior master assessor on the board of an investigation into three late mishaps including Avro Ansons; the full report passed on in October found that preparation on the sort pursued the prospectus, however that pilots required increasingly handy involvement in managing in-flight occurrences, as human blunder was the imaginable clarification for somewhere around one accident.
