Toward the east of Stein, down an old street, lay Krems, with its little populace of a couple of hundred, at the juncture of the surge of that name and the Danube. Toward the west of Stein the Danube made a vast bend, making a bow formed floodplain among it and the mountains. At the far western end of the floodplain, where the mountains descended nearly to the waterway's edge, was DÃÂ¼renstein with its manor, known as "Schloss DÃÂ¼renstein". The manor had filled in as a jail for Richard I of England in 1193. In 1645Ã¢ÂÂ 46, amid the Thirty Years' War, the Swedes had invigorated the stronghold and after that obliterated it when they pulled back. It remains at , on the most astounding edge of a mountain fissured with clefts and zeniths of rock. Since the mountain was meagerly vegetated, it was hard to recognize the remains from the stones. Tight gulches slice through the mountain, and extend into the plain beneath. Among DÃÂ¼renstein and Stein, on the flood plain, lay the villas of Oberloiben and Unterloiben. Close to the villas, the Loiben flood plain was at its greatest, stretching out at the most from the base of the Loibenberg mountain to the bank of the waterway.
