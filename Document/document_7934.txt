Henry reasserted and stretched out past suzerainties to verify ownership of his acquired domain. In 1162 he endeavored to restore what he saw as his position over the English Church by selecting his companion Thomas Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury upon the passing of the officeholder ecclesiastical overseer, Theobald. Becket's disobedience as Archbishop distanced the lord and his guides. Henry and Becket had rehashed arguments about issues, for example, church residencies, the marriage of Henry's sibling, and tax collection. Henry responded by getting Becket and other English ministers to perceive sixteen old traditions recorded as a hard copy without precedent for the Constitutions of Clarendon, overseeing relations between the lord, his courts and the congregation. At the point when Becket endeavored to leave the nation without consent, Henry attempted to demolish him by documenting lawful cases identifying with Becket's past residency as chancellor. Becket fled and stayed in a state of banishment for a long time. Relations later improved, and Becket returned, however they declined again when Henry's child was delegated as coregent by the Archbishop of York, which Becket saw as a test to his power. Becket later banned the individuals who had insulted him. When he got this news, Henry stated: "What hopeless automatons and swindlers have I sustained and advanced in my family unit who let their master be treated with such despicable scorn by a low-conceived representative." Four of Henry's knights slaughtered Becket in Canterbury Cathedral after Becket opposed a fizzled capture endeavor. Henry was broadly considered complicit in Becket's demise all through Christian Europe. This made Henry an outsider; in compensation, he strolled shoeless into Canterbury Cathedral, where he was seriously whipped by priests.
