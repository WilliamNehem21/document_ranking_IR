Eggs are laid 36Ã¢ÂÂ 48 hours separated, and brooding, chiefly by the female, begins with the main egg. The male may brood for brief periods, particularly around first light or sunset, however goes through the day perching, once in a while outside his region or near different guys. On the off chance that the female is bothered while rearing, she runs or ripples along the ground faking damage until she has drawn the interloper away. She may likewise move the eggs a short separation with her bill. Each egg brings forth after about 17Ã¢ÂÂ 21 days. The semi-precocial wool chicks are versatile when brought forth, yet are agonized to keep them warm. They fledge in 16Ã¢ÂÂ 17 days and become free of the grown-ups around 32ÃÂ days in the wake of incubating. A second brood might be raised by early settling sets, in which case the female leaves the main brood a couple of days before they fledge; the male at that point thinks about the principal brood and helps with the second. The two grown-ups feed the youthful with chunks of creepy crawlies which are either disgorged into the chick's mouth or pecked by the chick from the grown-up's open bill.
