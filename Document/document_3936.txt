At this point Douglas had walked south to Bamburgh, maybe seeking after a rehash of the occasions of 1319, when Edward II had severed an attack of Berwick after a Scottish armed force had progressed on York, where his ruler was staying, and crushed Yorkshire. Whatever worries Edward III had for his ruler, he realized that Bamburgh could without much of a stretch withstand an attack. The Scots did not have room schedule-wise to develop the sort of hardware that would be important to take the post by strike. The Scots crushed the wide open yet Edward III overlooked this. He situated the English armed force on Halidon Hill, a little ascent of some , 2 miles toward the north west of Berwick, which gives a great perspective on the town and the region. From this vantage point, he commanded the intersection of the Tweed determined in the agreements and would have had the capacity to assault the flank of any power of men-at-arms endeavoring to enter Berwick. Getting Keith's news, Douglas felt that his solitary choice was to draw in the English in fight. Intersection the Tweed toward the west of the English position, the Scottish armed force achieved the town of Duns, 15 miles from Berwick, on 18July. On the next day it drew closer Halidon Hill from the north west, prepared to give fight on ground picked by Edward III. Edward III needed to confront a Scottish armed force to the front and gatekeeper his back against the danger of a foray by the battalion of Berwick; by certain records an extensive extent of the English armed force was left guarding Berwick.
