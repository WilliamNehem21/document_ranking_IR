Freshwater marl prairies are like quagmires yet do not have the moderate development of surface water; rather, water leaks through a calcitic mud called marl. Green growth and other tiny life forms structure periphyton, which joins to limestone. When it dries it transforms into a dim mud. Sawgrass and other water plants become shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other sort of soil in the Everglades which is discovered where water stays present longer consistently. Marl prairies are more often than not submerged from three to seven months of the year, while swamps may stay submerged for longer than nine months and now and again stay submerged starting with one year then onto the next. Sawgrass may command swamps, making a monoculture. Different grasses, for example, muhly grass ("Muhlenbergia filipes") and expansive leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Creatures living in the freshwater quagmires additionally possess marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry in certain pieces of the year; crocodiles assume an imperative job in keeping up life in remote pieces of the Everglades by tunneling in the mud amid the dry season, making pools of water where fish and creatures of land and water make due starting with one year then onto the next. Gator openings additionally draw in different creatures who assemble to benefit from littler prey. At the point when the area floods again amid the wet season, the fish and creatures of land and water which were supported in the crocodile openings then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.
