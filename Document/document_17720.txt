On 10 February 1964, "Melbourne" was performing trials in Jervis Bay under the command of Captain John Robertson, following the annual refit. The "Daring"-class destroyer was also present, undergoing her own trials following refit, under the command of Captain Duncan Stevens. The trials involved interactions between both ships, and when "Melbourne" performed night-flying exercises that evening, "Voyager" acted as the carrier's plane guard escort. This required "Voyager" to maintain a position 20Â° off "Melbourne"s port quarter at a distance from the carrier of .
Early in the evening, "Voyager" had no difficulties maintaining her position during the manoeuvres both ships performed. Following a series of turns intended to reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8:40Â pm, "Voyager" ended up to starboard of "Melbourne". At 8:52Â pm, "Voyager" was ordered to resume the plane guard station. The procedure to accomplish this required "Voyager" to turn away from "Melbourne" in a large circle, cross behind the carrier, then take position off "Melbourne"s port side. Instead, "Voyager" first turned to starboard, away from "Melbourne", then turned to port without warning. It was initially assumed by "Melbourne"s bridge crew that "Voyager" was conducting a series of tight turns to lose speed before swinging behind "Melbourne", but "Voyager" did not alter course again. At 8:55Â pm, with "Voyager" approaching, "Melbourne"s navigator ordered the carrier's engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens, having just become aware of the situation, gave the order "Full ahead both engines. Hard-a starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; "Melbourne" hit "Voyager" at 8:56Â pm.
