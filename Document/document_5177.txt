The gills are adnate (comprehensively connected to the stem marginally over the base of the gill) or adnexed (achieving the stem, however not joined to it), and are light violet dim to dull violet darker. They are either uniform in shading, or have whitish edges. The empty stem is by thick, measure up to in width all through or thicker at the top, cylindric or here and there straightened, and either straight or with turns and windings. Its surface is smooth, plush fibrillose, whitish to grayish, and stains blue-green sporadically when contacted or in age. The base of the stem is thickly secured with very much created white rhizomorphs. Youthful mushrooms have a white spider web like incomplete shroud that does not keep going some time before it vanishes, despite the fact that it some of the time stays as a non-perpetual ring on the upper piece of the stem. The substance is whitish to yellowish or ruddy yellow in the top, or ruddy dark colored in the stem, and shows next to zero dye response to damage. Like the majority of the dye "Psilocybe" mushrooms, the smell and taste of "P.ÃÂ aztecorum" is marginally farinaceous (like newly ground flour) in new examples; dried examples have an increasingly exceptional scent. A drop of weaken potassium hydroxide (KOH) stains the top, stem, and substance ruddy darker; here and there, the stem does not stain or stains marginally yellowish red. The spore print is blackish violet.
