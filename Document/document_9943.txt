The rent on Bryn Eglwys terminated in 1942, yet was stretched out on a yearly premise. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide indicates two return traveler trains working just on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes toward every path. No traveler administration was given on different days. Medium-term on 26 December 1946, a few debilitated help segments in the quarry gave way, bringing about a huge breakdown; the quarry was esteemed risky and shut right away. Haydn Jones had guaranteed to keep working the railroad as long as he was alive thus, regardless of the conclusion of the quarry, the railroad kept on running trains on a shoestring spending plan. In 1947 the British railroad framework was nationalized and the Talyllyn was one of only a handful few working rail lines excluded. The purposes behind this are vague, however it is critical that all official notice of the railroad had stopped quite a few years prior and all things considered, the line was essentially overlooked by officialdom. Somewhere in the range of 1947 and 1949 the railroad ran a traveler administration two days seven days. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who claimed the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry bought 10 tons of rail from the as of late lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones kicked the bucket and conclusion of the railroad appeared to be unavoidable, however the line kept on working for the rest of the late spring season, finishing on 6 October.
