Assets for the new Bonsall connect were endorsed by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) in OctoberÃÂ 1988, and development was booked to start in mid 1989. In NovemberÃÂ 1989, the California Coastal Commission gave the thumbs up for the realignment of SRÃÂ 76 in western Oceanside, from I-5 to Frontier Drive. In any case, in FebruaryÃÂ 1990, the Sierra Club, National Audubon Society, and League for Coastal Protection recorded a claim to have the endorsement toppled, refering to worries over the annihilation of environment. The Bonsall connect was finished in mid 1990, while the old extension turned into a National Historic Place. In 1992, the City of Oceanside offered to buy land as extra natural surroundings for the warbler, despite the fact that it was anything but involved with the claim. The next year, the City Council casted a ballot to utilize the Lawrence Canyon land for business use rather than for the ecological moderation, consequently slowing down the venture. Following this, the CTC dismissed the proposition to manufacture the expressway, requiring Caltrans to discover another bundle to use for building territory. The CTC approved the proposition a month later, gave that this land was found before development started. In October, the City Council chose to utilize the Lawrence Canyon land for moderation all things considered. By and by, a city councilman raised worries that the road would not be satisfactory to deal with 2010 traffic levels.
