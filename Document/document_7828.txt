A report was composed by the military area leader in Kragujevac, "Hauptmann" (Captain) Otto von Bischofhausen, following the slaughter. This report was routed to BÃÂ¶hme, and was later offered in proof at the Subsequent Nuremberg preliminaries. As indicated by von Bischofhausen, in the late night of 18ÃÂ October, every single male Jew in Kragujevac, alongside certain socialists, were captured by records, totalling 70ÃÂ persons. As this comprised extremely couple of prisoners to meet the amount of 2,300, it was proposed to gather the equalization by captures in the city, squares and places of Kragujevac, in an activity to be directed by III./749th Infantry Regiment, and I.ÃÂ Battalion of the 724th Infantry Regiment, some portion of the 704th Infantry Division. In light of this proposition, von Bischofhausen guaranteed that he recommended to the army administrator, Major Paul KÃÂ¶nig, that, rather than utilizing the number of inhabitants in Kragujevac, the required prisoners be assembled from encompassing towns which were known to be "totally strewn with socialists". As indicated by von Bischofhausen's record, this proposal was at first acknowledged by KÃÂ¶nig, and, on 19ÃÂ October, III./749th Infantry Regiment "cleaned up" the towns of MeÃÂkovac and MarÃÂ¡iÃÂ, and I./724th Infantry Regiment directed a comparative task in the towns of GroÃÂ¡nica and Milatovac. A sum of 422ÃÂ men were shot in these four towns, with no German misfortunes.
