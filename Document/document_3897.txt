In a recent report, Robert Bakker and Gary Bir proposed that "Ceratosaurus" was fundamentally worked in amphibian prey, for example, lungfish, crocodiles, and turtles. As demonstrated by a factual investigation of shed teeth from 50 separate areas in and around Como Bluff, teeth of both "Ceratosaurus" and megalosaurids were most basic in living spaces in and around water sources, for example, wet floodplains, lake edges, and bogs. "Ceratosaurus" additionally sometimes happened in earthly regions. Allosaurids, be that as it may, were similarly normal in earthbound and oceanic living spaces. From these outcomes, Bakker and Bir presumed that "Ceratosaurus" and megalosaurids must have overwhelmingly chased close and inside water bodies, with "Ceratosaurus" additionally benefiting from remains of bigger dinosaurs now and again. The scientists moreover noticed the long, low, and adaptable assortment of "Ceratosaurus" and megalosaurids. Contrasted with other Morrison theropods, "Ceratosaurus" indicated taller neural spines on the chief tail vertebrae, which were vertical instead of slanted towards the back. Together with the profound chevron bones on the underside of the tail, they show a profound, "crocodile-like" tail conceivably adjusted for swimming. Despite what might be expected, allosaurids highlight a shorter, taller, and stiffer body with longer legs. They would have been adjusted for quick running in open territory and for going after extensive herbivorous dinosaurs, for example, sauropods and stegosaurs, however as guessed by Bakker and Bir, occasionally changed to oceanic prey things when the substantial herbivores were missing.
