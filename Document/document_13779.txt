2. The wedded existence of Pinchwife and Margery depends on MoliÃÂ¨re's "School For Husbands" (1661) and "School For Wives" (1662). Pinchwife is a moderately aged man who has hitched an innocent nation young lady with the expectation that she won't know to cuckold him. Be that as it may, Horner shows her, and Margery carves a swath through the complexities of London high society marriage and enchantment without seeing them. Reclamation comedies frequently differentiate town and nation for entertaining impact, and this is one case of it. Both MoliÃÂ¨re in the "School For Wives" and Wycherley in "The Country Wife" get much comic business out of the gathering between, from one perspective, blameless yet curious young ladies and, then again, the refined seventeenth century culture of sexual relations which they experience. The distinction, which would later make MoliÃÂ¨re adequate and Wycherley frightful to nineteenth century commentators and theater makers, is that MoliÃÂ¨re's Agnes is normally unadulterated and righteous, while Margery is the exact inverse: eager about the virile comeliness of town gallants, rakes, and particularly theater on-screen characters, she keeps Pinchwife in a condition of consistent repulsiveness with her candor and her enthusiasm for sex. A running joke is the manner in which Pinchwife's obsessive envy dependably drives him into providing Margery with the very sort of data he wishes her not to have.
