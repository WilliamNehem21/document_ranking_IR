At last the Verdeja program's end accompanied the entry of military hardware from the United States, starting in 1953. From 1954, the Spanish Army got 389 M47 Patton Tanks, supplanting the T-26s, Panzer Is and Panzer IVs at that point in administration. The Verdeja had turned out to be totally outdated when contrasted with bigger, increasingly intense tanks, for example, the German Panther, the Soviet T-54 and the US M47. The T-54 had 200ÃÂ millimetre of steel protection on the turret mantlet, far more noteworthy than the Verdeja 2's most extreme covering thickness of 40ÃÂ millimetres. The Soviet 45ÃÂ millimetre model 1932 firearm was supplanted by the T-34's 76.2ÃÂ millimetre weapon, while the Germans embraced the 75ÃÂ millimetre L/70 tank weapon on the Panther. By 1950, Soviet tanks, for example, the T-54 were furnished with the D-10T 100ÃÂ millimetre tank firearm, and American tanks embraced the 90ÃÂ millimetre primary weapon. Despite the fact that the Verdeja was Spain's best indigenous plan, it was clobbered as outside nations delivered prevalent items. Besides, the requirement for self-pushed cannons was before long wiped out as the United States offered Spain M37 and M44 self-moved howitzers. Therefore, enthusiasm for the Verdeja evaporated after 1954. Spain would not endeavor another indigenous tank until the appearance of the Lince principle fight tank in the late 1980s.
