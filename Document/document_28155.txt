J. Hoberman of "The Village Voice" said the film was a "gripping" account that did "an excellent job in deconstructing the Venezuelan TV news footage of blood, chaos, and rival crowds", and said it was "nearly a textbook on media manipulation". Writing for "The New York Times", Stephen Holden said the film was "a riveting documentary" that delivered "the suspense of a smaller-scale "Seven Days in May"", citing the way in which it examined how television can be used to "deceive and manipulate the public". He reproached the film's uncritical depiction of ChÃ¡vez, and how it hinted at CIA involvement without presenting any proof. Ty Burr in "The Boston Globe" called the film "our best chance" to find out what really happened on 11â13Â April, but cautioned that the filmmakers' "pro-ChÃ¡vez stance" meant that for wider context audiences should look elsewhere, as it left out too much of ChÃ¡vez's record. Burr also said the film's attempt to make the US into a villain was ineffective. He said, "because [the filmmakers] view the chasm that divides Venezuela purely in the context of the Cold War and Latin American political instability, they downplay the class warfare that's exploding right in front of them." Nevertheless, Burr concluded that the film's narrow focus remained engrossing.
