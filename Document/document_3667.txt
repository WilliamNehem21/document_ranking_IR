The Rising of the North in 1569 saw Catholic nobles in northern England oppose the Protestant Queen ElizabethÃÂ I. The Catholic Thomas Percy joined the defiance and supporters congregated at the palaces of Alnwick and Warkworth. Sir John Forster, Warden of the March, requested those inside to leave and the manors were surrendered to his control. Amid the contention that pursued, Warkworth stayed under regal control. Forster plundered the palace, stripping it of its timbers and goods. The keep at any rate did not partake in this destiny, however in April 1572 Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon, lamented the treatment dispensed to the Percy palaces, keeping in touch with the ruler's central clergyman, "It is an incredible pity to perceive how Alnwick Castle and Warkworth are ruined by himÃÂ ... I am respectably educated that he implies totally to ruin them both." An attainder was issued against Thomas Percy so when he came into English care he was executed without preliminary on 22 August. Accordingly, Percy's child was ignored, yet under the terms of the attainder his sibling was permitted to acquire. In 1574, Elizabeth conceded Henry Percy consent to acquire the family's property and expect the title of 8thÃÂ Earl of Northumberland.
