"Lactifluus volemus" was the type species of the section "Dulces" in subgenus "Lactarius", and is currently classified in "Lactifluus" section "Lactifluus". The group around this "L. volemus" includes species with a dry cap, abundant latex, and a white or pale cream spore print. Because the closely related "L.Â corrugis" has overlapping morphological characters, including similar colouration in the cap and stem, it has been difficult to reliably distinguish between the two species. The difficulty in discerning the two is exacerbated by the fact that both species have several colour forms: Japanese specimens of "L.Â volemus" may have a red cap, a yellow cap with a long stem, or a velvet-like surface texture; the caps of "L.Â corrugis" may be either red, commonly rust-coloured. In 2005, Japanese researchers clarified the relationships between these two species and others in section "Dulces" using molecular phylogenetics, and by comparing differences in fatty acid composition, morphology, and taste. The colour variants group phylogenetically into different subclades, suggesting that they might better be considered as "different species, subspecies, or varieties". A 2010 molecular study of "L.Â volemus" of northern Thailand found that 79 tested specimens could be divided into 18 distinct phylogenetic species; six of these were described as new species: "Lactifluus acicularis", "L.Â crocatus", "L.Â distantifolius", "L.Â longipilus", "L.Â pinguis" and "L.Â vitellinus".
