"The streets that we are utilizing today were altogether worked by Smith," he said. "All the foundation is Smith's. We never endured the manner in which we are enduring now since Smith dealt with the economy that bolstered all individuals and they had enough to eat. When he left power the [British] pound was on a standard with the Zimbabwean dollar, however President Mugabe has killed all that." David Coltart, another MDC government official, issued an announcement after Smith's passing adulating him as a man of humility and respectability, yet scrutinizing what Coltart felt to be "grievous political choices as Prime Minister"; Coltart considered Smith's approaches to have radicalized dark patriots, incited Mugabe's ascent to control and along these lines "legitimately added to the injury that Zimbabwe is experiencing today". Godwin took a comparable line, portraying the crisis powers Smith used to battle dark patriots as "draconian"; he likewise called attention to that these "switches of restraint" had shaped the base for a lot of what Mugabe later did. Master Carrington talked brutally about Smith in a 2005 meeting with Heidi Holland, saying he loathed both Smith and Mugabe however would pick the last mentioned in the event that he "completely needed to pick"; Smith was, as he would see it, "a biased, nitwit" in charge of the majority of Zimbabwe's issues.
