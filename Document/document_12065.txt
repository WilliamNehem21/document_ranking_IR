The reaction of "Banksia marginata" to flame is variable. In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney districts, plants are executed by flame and recover from seed. They are serotinous, putting away their seed in old cones, shaping a seedbank in their shelter which is discharged after bushfire. A field ponder found that seeds were scattered short separations (for the most part or less), with those nearest to the parent plant faring the best. In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and furthermore eastern south Australia, it develops as a low bush which suckers (shoots developing from horizontal roots) after flame. Plants don't seem to live longer than 25 years; after this time the maturing plants start to pass on and are prevailing by more youthful plants emerging from suckers around the parent. A field ponder in Gippsland discovered tallying the hubs of "Banksia marginata" plants to be precise in showing age inside a year as long as a long time since the last flame. There is anecodotal proof of plants achieving 150 years of age in this locale. Plant species from networks subject to flame are contemplated internally select to be increasingly combustible; "Banksia marginata" tried from a dry sclerophyll network in southeastern Tasmania was appeared to consume promptly, and fire would spread effectively through it.
