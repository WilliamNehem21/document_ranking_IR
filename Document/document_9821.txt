h. Aeschines kept up that Demosthenes was paid off to drop his charges against Meidias as a byproduct of an installment of thirty mnai. Plutarch contended that Demosthenes took kickbacks out of dread of Meidias' capacity. Philipp August BÃÂ¶ckh likewise acknowledged Aeschines' record for an out-of-court settlement, and reasoned that the discourse was never conveyed. BÃÂ¶ckh's position was before long supported by Arnold Schaefer and Blass. Weil concurred that Demosthenes never conveyed "Against Meidias", yet trusted that he dropped the charges for political reasons. In 1956, Hartmut Erbse halfway tested BÃÂ¶ckh's decisions, when he contended that "Against Meidias" was a completed discourse that could have been conveyed in court, however Erbse then agreed with George Grote, by tolerating that, after Demosthenes verified a judgment to support him, he achieved some sort of settlement with Meidias. Kenneth Dover likewise supported Aeschines' record, and contended that, in spite of the fact that the discourse was never conveyed in court, Demosthenes put into flow an assault on Meidias. Dover's contentions were discredited by Edward M. Harris, who inferred that, in spite of the fact that we can't make sure about the result of the preliminary, the discourse was conveyed in court, and that Aeschines' story was an untruth.
