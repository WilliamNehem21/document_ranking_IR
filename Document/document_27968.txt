Only eight science fiction and fantasy magazines survived World War II. All were still in pulp magazine format except for "Astounding", which had switched to a digest format in 1943. "Astounding" continued to publish popular stories, including "Vintage Season" by C. L. Moore, and "With Folded HandsÂ ..." by Jack Williamson. The quality of the fiction in the other magazines improved over the decade: "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder" in particular published some excellent material and challenged "Astounding" for the leadership of the field. A few more pulps were launched in the late 1940s, but almost all were intended as vehicles to reprint old classics. One exception, "Out of This World Adventures", was an experiment by Avon, combining fiction with some pages of comics. It was a failure and lasted only two issues. Magazines in digest format began to appear towards the end of the decade, including "Other Worlds", edited by Raymond Palmer. In 1949, the first issue of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" appeared, followed in October 1950 by the first issue of "Galaxy Science Fiction"; both were digests, and between them soon dominated the field. Very few science fiction or fantasy pulps were launched after this date; the 1950s was the beginning of the era of digest magazines, though the leading pulps continued until the mid-1950s, and authors began selling to mainstream magazines and large book publishers.
