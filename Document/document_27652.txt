As a player, Fender quickly made an impact for Surrey. He took a hat-trick in his second game, and scored a century in his fifth, to establish his popularity with the Surrey crowds. During the season Fender scored 820 runs, often very quickly, and took 83 wickets including some through experimenting with leg spin bowling. According to "Wisden" his worth was measured by more than figures: "As a match winning factor he is a far greater force on a side than his records would suggest." In a powerful Surrey side he batted aggressively, bowled more frequently than at Sussexâmainly as a support bowler to the main attackâand established a reputation as a slip fielder. A teammate judged that Fender was the "making" of the team, and "Wisden" commented that "he always seemed the right man in the right place". A late replacement in the Gentlemen v Players game at Lord's, Fender was not particularly successful but made a good impression on critics. The season ended prematurely because of the outbreak of war in August 1914. Surrey had established a commanding lead in the County Championship table; as their nearest challengers had no objection, the MCC declared them as county champions.
