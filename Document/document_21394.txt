Around 1925, having had little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, where he was a reporter for the daily "Sinar Soematera". At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, "bangsawan", he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he referred to this as "toneel", based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of "Melati van Agam", a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and "Sitti Nurbaya", a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.
In the late 1920s, after spending some two years in Medan with the daily "Sinar Soematra", Andjar returned to Batavia and in 1929 helped establish the magazine "Doenia Film", a Malay adaptation of the Dutch-language magazine "Filmland"; although an adaptation, "Doenia Film" also contained original coverage of the domestic theatre and film industry. At the time, the cinema of the Indies was becoming established: the first domestic film, "Loetoeng Kasaroeng" ("The Lost Lutung"), was released in 1926, and four additional films were released in 1927 and 1928. Andjar wrote extensively regarding local cinematic and theatrical productions; for example, the Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes Andjar inspired the marketing for 1929's "Njai Dasima", which emphasised the exclusively native cast. In 1930 Andjar left "Doenia Film" and was replaced by Bachtiar Effendi.
