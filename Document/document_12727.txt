Alesi, Hill and Schumacher all made pit stops for their first of threeÃÂ stops on lapÃÂ 18. The Benetton pitcrew made a speedy stop for Schumacher, enabling him to stretch out beyond Alesi and Hill. Slope lost extra time with a staying refueling valve, making his stop keep going twice the length Schumacher's. Schumacher left the pit stop in fourth spot (behind Coulthard, and the yet-to-stop Berger and Herbert), with Alesi in seventh spot (split from Schumacher by Irvine) and Hill in tenth spot (isolated from Alesi by Frentzen and Blundell). With Alesi and Hill held up by the slower sprinters on two-stop methodologies in front, Schumacher pulled away and surrounded Coulthard. Blundell made a pit stop on the following lap, and Hill passed Frentzen on lapÃÂ 22. On the accompanying lap, Alesi passed Irvine at the clip; Hill attempted to finish Alesi however his front wing hit the back of Irvine's vehicle, causing minor harm. Irvine made a pit stop toward the finish of lapÃÂ 25, enabling Hill to continue his pursuit of Alesi unobstructed. Like his partner, Coulthard was booked to make threeÃÂ stops, however his pit methodology was changed to make just two by remaining out sixÃÂ laps longer than initially planned, and after that taking locally available more fuel than first arranged at his firstÃÂ stop on lapÃÂ 24. Because of a lighter fuel load for Schumacher as a result of the diverse procedures, Schumacher started to reliably lap quicker than the Scotsman.
