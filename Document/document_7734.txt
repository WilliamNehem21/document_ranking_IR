"Phantasmagoria" got blended audits. Vince Broady, official manager of "Mixed media World", said Sierra was savvy to endeavor to catch the grown-up market, which was searching for modern diversions particularly after the fame of amusements, for example, "The seventh Guest." Dwight Silverman of the "Houston Chronicle" proclaimed it the best round of the year, considering it a "masterwork" and "more or less close a film you control", despite the fact that he said not every person would value it because of its savage substance. "Excitement Weekly" gave it a B+ and called it "one of the surest signs yet of PC diversions moving toward the quality dimension of the motion pictures". The audit said it had some emotional and novel turns, yet in addition some "terrible contacts (that) appear somewhat subsidiary, for example, a Freddy Krueger-like bad dream in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of "The Salt Lake Tribune" called it "the most refined PC diversion to date" and "an unusual, wild, terrible ride that will make you seize each turn, regardless of whether you aren't regularly black out of-heart". In spite of the fact that McDaniel said it may be simple for experienced players, she valued that it was more open for easygoing players than troublesome diversions like "The seventh Guest".
