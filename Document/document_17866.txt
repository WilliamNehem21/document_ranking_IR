Kan EkÊ¼ had sent emissaries to MÃ©rida in December 1695 to inform MartÃ­n de UrsÃºa that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule. By mid-January captain GarcÃ­a de Paredes had advanced from BÊ¼atkabÊ¼ to the advance portion of the "Camino Real" at Chuntuki. By now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters, with many of his soldiers deserting as the force advanced towards Lake PetÃ©n ItzÃ¡; they were further delayed by the necessity of building an oar-powered longboat (or "piragua") to cross the San Pedro River. Soon after AvendaÃ±o's flight eastward from NojpetÃ©n, a group of 60 Maya warriors entered Chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons; they claimed to have been sent by AvendaÃ±o to collect religious regalia and another friar. This was not the case, and they were almost certainly a scouting party sent by the Kowoj and their ChakÊ¼an Itza allies to see what progress the Spanish army was making along the road. They spoke with GarcÃ­a and then rapidly departed without taking any of the items that they had supposedly been sent to collect. GarcÃ­a despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to discover AvendaÃ±o's whereabouts; at the same time AvendaÃ±o's Kejache guides were returning to Chuntuki from NojpetÃ©n with news of AvendaÃ±o's flight. The Itzas at the lake handed over an open letter written by AvendaÃ±o before his departure from NojpetÃ©n as a token of friendship between the Itza and the Spanish. Friar Juan de San Buenaventura was enthused by the letter and wished to travel on to NojpetÃ©n himself.
