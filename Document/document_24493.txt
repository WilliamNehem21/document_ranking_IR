Argyll went on in his 1867 book "The Reign of Law" to cleverly ridicule Darwin's ideas, particularly the prediction of a moth in Madagascar with a proboscis 10â11Â inches (250â275Â mm) long. He believed that adaptations showed divine purpose, not a mindless evolutionary arms race. In his response "Creation by Law" later that year, Alfred Russel Wallace produced a detailed explanation of how the nectary could have evolved through natural selection, and stated that he had carefully measured moths in the British Museum, finding that the proboscis of "Macrosila cluentius" from South America was 9Â inches (235Â mm) long, and the proboscis of "Macrosila morganii" from tropical Africa (since renamed "Xanthopan morganii") was 7Â inches (190Â mm) long. An enquiry raised in 1873 was answered by Darwin's friend Hermann MÃ¼ller, who stated that his brother Fritz MÃ¼ller had caught a sphinx moth in Brazil with a proboscis nearly long. Darwin's anticipation was fully met in 1903, when a subspecies of "Xanthopan morganii" was found in Madagascar with a proboscis about 12Â inches (300Â mm) long, and was named "Xanthopan morganii praedicta" to celebrate this verification of a testable prediction made by Darwin on the basis of his theory of natural selection.
