The Americas and Australia stayed free of measles and smallpox until the entry of European settlers between the fifteenth and eighteenth hundreds of years. Alongside measles and flu, smallpox was taken to the Americas by the Spanish. Smallpox was endemic in Spain, having been presented by the Moors from Africa. In 1519, a pandemic of smallpox broke out in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan in Mexico. This was begun by the military of PÃÂ¡nfilo de NarvÃÂ¡ez, who pursued HernÃÂ¡n CortÃÂ©s from Cuba and had an African slave experiencing smallpox on board his ship. At the point when the Spanish at last entered the capital in the late spring of 1521, they saw it strewn with the assortments of smallpox exploited people. The pestilence, and those that pursued amid 1545Ã¢ÂÂ 1548 and 1576Ã¢ÂÂ 1581, in the end murdered the greater part of the local populace. A large portion of the Spanish were safe; with his military of less than 900 men it would not have been workable for CortÃÂ©s to vanquish the Aztecs and overcome Mexico without the assistance of smallpox. Numerous Native American populaces were crushed later by the unintentional spread of maladies presented by Europeans. In the 150 years that pursued Columbus' entry in 1492, the Native American populace of North America was diminished by 80 percent from ailments, including measles, smallpox and flu. The harm done by these infections altogether helped European endeavors to dislodge and overcome the local populace.
