In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Tallon befuddled Denis Compton, however the umpire gave him not out in light of the fact that "the glare of the sun all of a sudden turned out to be intense to the point that he was unfit to see obviously the white line of the popping wrinkle" and Compton made 147. The England openers Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook had put on 100 in the second innings when Tallon got Washbrook, gathering up a ball from Lindwall. Washbrook "remained there transfixed. Indeed, even a portion of the Australian leg-side defenders communicated wonder". Tallon was known for his reckless engaging - "he was frequently thundering before he had examined certainties and it was his over-excitement that achieved the stunning choice" - and this caused an umpiring debate. In any case, Tallon kept up the intrigue and Bradman supported him. Washbrook told Wally Hammond that the ball had gone into the ground just before it went into Tallon's gloves and the England chief attempted fruitlessly to discover a press photo of the ball contacting the ground. Later in the match Tallon missed an essential confusing off the England wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans, who stayed put for 95 minutes without making a run. Tallon befuddled Compton once more, yet he was given not out and proceeded to make an unbeaten 103 out of a match-sparing stand of 85 with Evans.
