In September 2008, BBC Books, an imprint of Random House Publishing, published "The Writer's Tale", a collection of emails between Davies and "Radio Times" and "Doctor Who Magazine" journalist Benjamin Cook. Dubbed the "Great Correspondence" by Davies and Cook, "The Writer's Tale" covers a period between February 2007 and March 2008 and explores his writing processes and the development of his scripts for the fourth series of "Doctor Who": "Voyage of the Damned", "Partners in Crime", "Midnight", "Turn Left", "The Stolen Earth", and "Journey's End". The book's first chapter focuses on Cook's "big questions" on Davies' writing style, character developmentâusing the "Doctor Who" character Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) and the "Skins" character Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) as contrasting examplesâ, how he formulated ideas for stories, and the question "why do you write?". After several weeks, Cook assumes an unofficial advisory role to the scriptwriting and the development of the series. The book's epilogue consists of a short exchange between Davies and Cook: Cook changes from his role as "Invisible Ben" to "Visible Ben" and strongly advises to vastly alter the "denouement" to "Journey's End" from a cliffhanger that led into "The Next Doctor"âwhich had occurred in the previous three series finales, "The Parting of the Ways", "Doomsday", and "Last of the Time Lords"âto a melancholy ending that showed the Doctor alone in the TARDIS. After three days of deliberation, Davies accepts Cook's suggestion and thanks him for improving both episodes.
