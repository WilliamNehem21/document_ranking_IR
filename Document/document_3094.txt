On March 31, Houston stopped his men at Groce's Landing, generally north of San Felipe. Two organizations that would not withdraw more distant than San Felipe were relegated to protect the intersections on the Brazos River. For the following two weeks, the Texians refreshed, recouped from disease, and, out of the blue, started rehearsing military drills. While there, two guns, known as the Twin Sisters, touched base from Cincinnati, Ohio. Break Secretary of War Thomas Rusk joined the camp, with requests from Burnet to supplant Houston on the off chance that he would not battle. Houston immediately convinced Rusk that his arrangements were sound. Secretary of State Samuel P. Carson prompted Houston to keep withdrawing right to the Sabine River, where more volunteers would probably rush from the United States and enable the military to counterattack. Discontent with everybody included, Burnet kept in touch with Houston: "The foe are chuckling you to despise. You should battle them. You should withdraw no further. The nation anticipates that you should battle. The salvation of the nation relies upon your doing as such." Complaints inside the camp turned out to be strong to the point that Houston posted notification that anybody endeavoring to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.
