Berlioz wrote songs throughout his career, but not prolifically. His best-known work in the genre is the song cycle "Les nuits d'Ã©tÃ©", a group of six songs, originally for voice and piano but now usually heard in its later orchestrated form. He suppressed some of his early songs, and his last publication, in 1865, was the "33 MÃ©lodies", collecting into one volume all his songs that he chose to preserve. Some of them, such as "HÃ©lÃ¨ne" and "Sara la baigneuse", exist in versions for four voices with accompaniment, and there are others for two or three voices. Berlioz later orchestrated some of the songs originally written with piano accompaniment, and some, such as "ZaÃ¯de" and "Le chasseur danois" were written with alternative piano or orchestral parts. "La captive", to words by Victor Hugo, exists in six different versions. In its final version (1849) it was described by the Berlioz scholar Tom S. Wotton as like "a miniature symphonic poem". The first version, written at the Villa Medici, had been in fairly regular rhythm, but for his revision Berlioz made the strophic outline less clear-cut, and added optional orchestral parts for the last stanza, which brings the song to a quiet close.
