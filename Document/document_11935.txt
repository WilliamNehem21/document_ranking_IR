The two-circle chief's cut DVD and HD DVD were discharged on January 8, 2008, with its UK discharge on Blu-beam and DVD reported for September 29, 2008. Circle 1 highlights, notwithstanding a more drawn out cut of the film, a sound critique by Fincher and a second by Gyllenhaal, Downey, Fischer, Vanderbilt, and creator James Ellroy. Circle 2 incorporates a trailer, a "Zodiac Deciphered" narrative, a "Special visualizations of Zodiac" featurette, previsualization split-screen correlations for the Blue Rock Springs, Lake Berryessa, and San Francisco murder arrangements, a "This is the Zodiac Speaking" featurette, and a "His Name Was Arthur Leigh Allen" featurette. Different additional items evidently initially proposed for the set, including TV spots and featurettes on "Advanced Workflow", "Semantic Analysis", "Peril Surface: Geographic Profiling" (Dr. Kim Rossmo's geographic profile of the Zodiac), and "The Psychology of Aggression: Behavioral Profiling" (Special Agent Sharon Pagaling-Hagan's social profile of the Zodiac) were overlooked. In any case, the last three featurettes were made accessible on the film's site. This new form runs five minutes longer than the showy cut. For Oscar conflict, Paramount conveyed the Director's Cut DVD to the Producers Guild of America, the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild, rather than the official discharge variant. This was the first occasion when that the studio had done this.
