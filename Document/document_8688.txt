In September 2004, air ship from No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron joined the pivoting separation of C-130s set up by No.ÃÂ 36 Squadron in the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO) in February 2003, after the intrusion of Iraq; the C-130Js were required to be fitted with self-security hardware before conveying to the MEAO. No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron was reinforced to make a "super squadron" on 17ÃÂ November 2006, when its power of twelve C-130Js was enlarged by No.ÃÂ 36 Squadron's twelve C-130Hs, before the last re-outfitting with Boeing C-17 Globemasters and migrating to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. Two of the C-130s joined DHC-4 Caribous from No.ÃÂ 38 Squadron as a component of the RAAF's underlying commitment to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007. No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron took over full obligation regarding the Hercules separation to the MEAO in mid-2008, and in March 2010 one of its C-130Js finished the separation's 20,000th hour of flying activities. The squadron was exchanged from No.ÃÂ 86 Wing to No.ÃÂ 84 Wing on 1ÃÂ October 2010, as a major aspect of a rebuild of Air Lift Group. It was given the Gloucester Cup for its capability in 2011 at a function on 31ÃÂ May 2012. The C-130Hs were resigned that year, the keep going pair at Richmond on 30ÃÂ November. In January 2013, No.ÃÂ 37 Squadron attempted an effective scan and-salvage mission for Alain Delord, a missing round-the-world yachtsman who was discovered around south of Tasmania. Teams found Delord uncontrolled in a real existence pontoon before airdropping supplies, keeping up watch and at last managing in a salvage vessel fifty after eight hours.
