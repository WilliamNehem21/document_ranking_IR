Clarke went through the following ten years taking a shot at the novel in her extra time, while altering cookbooks full-time for Simon and Schuster in Cambridge. She likewise distributed stories in "Starlight 2" and "Starlight 3"; as per the "New York Times Magazine", her work was known and increased in value by a little gathering of imagination fans and pundits on the web. She was never certain, in any case, in the event that she would complete her novel or in the event that it would be distributed. Clarke endeavored to compose for three hours every day, starting at 5:30ÃÂ am, yet attempted to keep this calendar. Instead of composing the novel from start to finish, she wrote in pieces and endeavored to line them together. Clarke, conceding that the undertaking was for herself and not the peruser, "clung to this strategy" since "I felt that in the event that I returned and began toward the start, [the novel] would need profundity, and I would simply be skimming the outside of what I could do. In any case, on the off chance that I had realized it was going to take me ten years, I could never have started. I was lightened by suspecting that I would complete it one year from now, or the year after next." Clarke and Greenland moved in together while she was composing the novel. Greenland did not peruse the novel until it was distributed.
