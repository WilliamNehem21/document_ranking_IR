Despite the fact that book supervisor and college educator James Michener could have evaded military administration in World War II as an inheritance Quaker, he enrolled in the U.S. Naval force in October 1942. He was not sent toward the South Pacific auditorium until April 1944, when he was relegated to compose a background marked by the Navy in the Pacific and was permitted to travel broadly. He endure a plane accident in New Caledonia; the brush with death persuaded him to compose fiction, and he started tuning in to the accounts told by troopers. One voyage took him to the Treasury Islands, where he found an undesirable town, called Bali-ha'i, populated by "gaunt occupants and just a single pig". Struck by the name, Michener recorded it and before long started to record, on a battered , his form of the stories. On an estate on the island of Espiritu Santo, he met a lady named Bloody Mary; she was little, practically toothless, her face recolored with red betel juice. Punctuated with obscenity gained from GIs, she whined perpetually to Michener about the French provincial government, which would not permit her and other Tonkinese to come back to their local Vietnam, in case the estates be ousted. She let him know likewise of her arrangements to contradict expansionism in French Indochina. These accounts, gathered into "Stories of the South Pacific", won Michener the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
