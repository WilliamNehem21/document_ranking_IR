Upon Yazid's promotion in April 680, master Alid Kufans encouraged Husayn ibn Ali, the more youthful sibling of now perished Hasan, to lead a rebel against Yazid. Husayn in this manner sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to survey the political condition in Kufa. Mukhtar facilitated Ibn Aqil at his home before the entry of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. The last was delegated to supplant Mukhtar's dad in-law, Nu'man ibn Bashir, as representative due to Ibn Bashir's generous frame of mind towards Ibn Aqil and his adherents. Because of Ibn Ziyad's concealment and political moving, Ibn Aqil's following began dissolving endlessly and he was compelled to announce the revolt rashly. Mukhtar was not in the city at the time. In the wake of hearing the news, he endeavored to accumulate supporters from Kufa's environs, yet Ibn Aqil's revolt was crushed and he was executed before Mukhtar came back to the city. Mukhtar was captured and conveyed to the senator yet he denied contribution in the revolt. While Mukhtar was detained, Husayn was killed by Ibn Ziyad's powers at the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680. Mukhtar was a while later discharged upon the mediation of Abdullah ibn Umar, a powerful child of the second caliph and Mukhtar's brother by marriage, and requested to leave Kufa.
