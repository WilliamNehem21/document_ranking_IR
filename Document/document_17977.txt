Despite his unusual diet and behaviour in the presence of food, doctors described Domery as of a normal build, and tall for the period at . He had long, brown hair and grey eyes, was smooth-skinned, and was described as having a "pleasant countenance". Doctors observing Domery saw no signs of mental illness and although illiterate, he was considered of normal intelligence by his crewmates and by the prison doctors who studied him. Despite eating vast amounts of food, it was noted by the doctors studying him that he never vomited, other than when fed large amounts of roasted or boiled meat. He showed no outward signs of ill health, and doctors observing him noted that his eyes were lively and his tongue clean. His pulse was regular at around 84Â BPM, and his body temperature normal. His muscles were normally formed, but observed by doctors to be weaker than usual, although during his time in the army he had marched 14Â French leagues (approximately 25Â mi/42Â km) in a day with no ill effects.
It was observed that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00Â pm, Domery would begin to sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00Â am extremely hungry, regardless of what he had eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00Â am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00Â am, sweating heavily; as soon as he got out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.
