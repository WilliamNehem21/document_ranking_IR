Altham proceeded with his legal profession until his passing in 1617, and Bromley accomplished his ideal advancement to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by James in 1615, to breed and prepare the lord's dogs. In 1618, he was given duty regarding "gathering the relinquishments on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years". Having had her impact in the passings of her mom, sibling, and sister, Jennet Device may in the long run have ended up blamed for black magic. A lady with that name was recorded in a gathering of 20 attempted at Lancaster Assizes on 24 March 1634, in spite of the fact that it can't be sure that it was a similar Jennet Device. The charge against her was the homicide of Isabel Nutter, William Nutter's better half. In that arrangement of preliminaries the central indictment witness was a ten-year-old kid, Edmund Robinson. Everything except one of the blamed were discovered blameworthy, yet the judges wouldn't pass capital punishments, choosing rather to allude the case to the ruler, Charles I. Under questioning in London, Robinson conceded that he had created his proof, however despite the fact that four of the charged were in the end absolved, they all remained detained in Lancaster Gaol, where all things considered, they kicked the bucket. An official record dated 22 August 1636 records Jennet Device as one of those still held in the jail. These later Lancashire black magic preliminaries were the subject of a contemporary play composed by Thomas Heywood and Richard Brome, "The Late Lancashire Witches".
