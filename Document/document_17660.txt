Baronet Press, a small New York publishing house, agreed to publish "A Contract with God", which bears the credit "Produced by Poorhouse Press" of "White Plains, N.Y." on its indicia page. Eisner had originally intended to call the book "Tenement Stories", "Tales from the Bronx", or "A Tenement in the Bronx" but Baronet titled it "A Contract with God", after the lead story, as the term "tenement" was not widely known outside the eastern US. The trade paperback carried the term "graphic novel", though it is a collection of stories rather than a novel. As Baronet was not financially sound, Eisner loaned it money to ensure the book was published.
Sales were poor, but demand increased over the years. Kitchen Sink Press reissued the book in 1985, as did DC Comics in 2001 as part of its Will Eisner Library; and W.Â W. Norton collected it in 2005 as "The Contract with God Trilogy" in a single volume with its sequels, "A Life Force" (1988) and "Dropsie Avenue" (1995). The Norton edition, and subsequent stand-alone editions of "Contract", included extra final pages to the stories. , at least eleven translations have been published, including in Yiddish, a language which would have been common with many of the characters in the book. This Yiddish edition was published by the Amsterdam comics store Lambiek on 6 November 1984, in the presence of Eisner himself.
