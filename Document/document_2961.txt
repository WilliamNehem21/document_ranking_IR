On JanuaryÃÂ 18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Archibald Loudon Snowden whined that the "3" in the date, as struck by the Mint, too intently took after a "8", particularly on the littler measured divisions. Accordingly, Pollock requested Chief Engraver William Barber to re-imprint the date, opening the arms of the "3" more extensive on most divisions, including the three-dollar piece. Both the ClosedÃÂ 3 and OpenÃÂ 3 assortments are amazingly uncommon, however the official mintage of 25ÃÂ pieces for 1873 is downplayed, since a greater number of examples than that are known to exist. In 1875 and 1876, no pieces were struck for flow, with just pieces in verification condition being made accessible to gatherers. The official mintage is 20ÃÂ for 1875 and 45ÃÂ for 1876, however an obscure number of pieces may have been later unlawfully restruck for each date. Numismatic essayist R.W. Julian trusts that there were no later restrikes, yet as confirmation pieces were not checked until sold, workers substituted normal date pieces when unsold coins were to be softened. These pieces had been made accessible to the open just as a feature of a proof arrangement of every gold category, at a cost of $43 (a premium of $1.50 over assumed worth). Julian proposes that the moderately huge mintages of right around 42,000 out of 1874 and somewhere in the range of 82,000 of every 1878 were struck fully expecting the resumption of specie installments, yet when this at long last happened toward the finish of 1878, "there was a boisterous yawn from general society and the Mint kept a large portion of the pieces available, paying them out gradually as stocking stuffers.
