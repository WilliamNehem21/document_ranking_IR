The first proposed a square long guests focus on the south side of Market Street, that would likewise house the Liberty Bell. This would have intruded on the shopping center's three-square vista of Independence Hall, and made the ringer unmistakable just from the south, for example Chestnut Street. The second option set a comparative guests focus on the north side of Market Street, likewise intruding on the shopping center's vista, with the chime in a little structure on the south side. City organizer Edmund Bacon, who had supervised the shopping center's structure during the 1950s, saw protection of the vista of Independence Hall as fundamental. He made his own arrangement that incorporated a domed chime structure fabricated north of Market Street. Open response to the likelihood of moving the Liberty Bell so distant from Independence Hall was emphatically negative. NPS declared that the ringer would stay on the square among Chestnut and Market Streets. Different plans were proposed, each had qualities and shortcomings, however the objective of all was to urge guests to see a greater amount of the recorded park than simply the Liberty Bell.
