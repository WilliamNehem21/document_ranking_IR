Amid a time of forceful procurement planned to build up the global renown of Britain's gathering, it was obtained for the National Gallery in 1860 in Milan from the Guicciardi family by Charles Lock Eastlake for simply over ÃÂ£120, alongside various other Netherlandish works. Eastlake's notes notice that the works were "initially in the ownership of the Foscari family". The Foscaris were an affluent Venetian family which included Francesco Foscari who was Doge of Venice at the time the work was painted; the sensational story of him and his child is told in Lord Byron's play "The Two Foscari", and Verdi's musical show "I due Foscari". There is no narrative proof to substantiate the case that the work of art originated from the Foscari accumulation, and some workmanship history specialists trust that agents of the Guicciardis imagined this provenance to inspire Eastlake. Lorne Campbell considers the provenance "plausible", taking note of that a relative, Fergio Foscari (1732Ã¢ÂÂ 1811), an envoy to Saint Petersburg, wasted his fortune and may have been constrained into offering pictures having a place with the family. Campbell estimates that the sketch was created on commission for fare to Venice, taking note of that unrolled cloth would have been simpler to transport than canvas, and that the column of gaps just underneath the upper outskirt could be clarified in the event that it had been extended, mounted and confined by somebody other than Bouts or an individual from his workshop.
