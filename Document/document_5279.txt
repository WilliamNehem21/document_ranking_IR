"No Depression" was discharged by Rockville Records on June 21, 1990. The limited time visit for the collection started at Cicero's Basement, a St. Louis bar related with Washington University. The visit took Uncle Tupelo to both the East Coast and the Southwestern United States. Missouri radio stations KDHX and KCOU as often as possible played tracks off the collection. By March 1991, "No Depression" had sold more than 15,000 units, a hit by free record gauges. The returns from the collection recovered the $3,500 cost of the collection, however Rockville would not pay the band any eminences. Farrar and Tweedy later effectively sued Rockville CEO Barry Tenenbaum to accomplish the sovereignties. The unexpected achievement of the collection incited Columbia Records to pay the band to record extra tracks with Slade and Kolderie at Fort Apache Studio in the late spring of 1990, however the outcomes were not discharged. "Moving Stone" did not distribute a survey of the collection upon its underlying discharge, in spite of the fact that the magazine later included Uncle Tupelo in an article about rising stars close by The Black Crowes. "Moving Stone" later called the collection "one of the most intense, loneliest moans in late memory to emerge from the Midwest's retreat tormented fields". Robert Christgau expelled the collection as a "flop".
