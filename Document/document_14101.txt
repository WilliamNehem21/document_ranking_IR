The I Squadron held its first exercise of 1904 in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January. Further squadron practices pursued from 8 to 17 March. A noteworthy armada practice occurred in the North Sea in May, and in July the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain, halting at Plymouth on 10 July. The German armada withdrew on 13 July, destined for the Netherlands; the I Squadron tied down in Vlissingen the next day. There, the boats were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. The I Squadron stayed in Vlissingen until 20 July, when it left for a voyage in the northern North Sea with the remainder of the armada. The squadron ceased in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while different units went to different ports. The armada reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it led a fake assault on the harbor on 12 August. The armada at that point started arrangements for the pre-winter moves, which started on 29 August in the Baltic. The armada moved toward the North Sea on 3 September, where it partook in a noteworthy landing activity, after which the boats took the ground troops from the IX Corps that took part in the activities to Altona for a motorcade for Wilhelm II. The boats at that point directed their own motorcade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. After three days, the armada came back to the Baltic by means of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it took an interest in further landing tasks with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the moves arrived at an end. The I Squadron went on its winter preparing voyage, this opportunity toward the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.
