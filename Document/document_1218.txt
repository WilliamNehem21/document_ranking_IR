With the guide of Captain Alexandre Banza, Bokassa began the upset New Year's Eve night in 1965. To begin with, Bokassa and his men caught Jean Izamo, securing him a basement at Camp de Roux. Bokassa's men at that point involved the capital, Bangui, and overwhelmed the gendarmerie and other opposition. After 12 pm, Dacko made a beeline for the capital, where he was expeditiously captured, compelled to leave from office and afterward detained at Camp KassaÃÂ¯. As indicated by authority reports, eight individuals were executed for opposing the overthrow. Before the finish of January 1966, Izamo was tormented to death, yet Dacko's life was saved in view of a solicitation from the French government, which Bokassa was attempting to fulfill. Bokassa advocated the overthrow by guaranteeing he needed to spare the nation from falling affected by socialism, and cut off political relations with China. In the beginning of his administration, Bokassa broke down the National Assembly, annulled the Constitution and issued various announcements, restricting asking, female circumcision, and polygamy, in addition to other things. Bokassa at first attempted to get universal acknowledgment for the new government. Be that as it may, after a fruitful gathering with the leader of Chad, Bokassa got acknowledgment of the routine from other African countries, and in the end from France, the previous pilgrim control.
