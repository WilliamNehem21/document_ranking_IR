"Nemegtomaia" is estimated to have been around 2Â m (7Â ft) in length, and to have weighed 40Â kg (85Â lb), a size extrapolated from more completely known relatives. As an oviraptorosaur, it would have been feathered. The neural spines of the neck (cervical) vertebrae were short, and the neural arches had an x-shaped appearance. The middle three of these vertebrae were the largest. The scapula (shoulder blade) appears to have been 185Â mm (7Â in) in total length. The humerus (upper arm bone) had a fossa (depression) in a position similar to modern birds, but atypical among oviraptorosaurs, and appears to have been 152Â mm (6Â in) long. The radius of the lower arm was straight, oval in cross-section, and may have been 144Â mm (5Â in) long. The first finger was relatively large and had a strong ungual (claw bone), and was more massive than the two other fingers. The second finger was slightly longer than the first, and the third finger was the smallest. The upper margin of the ilium of the pelvis was straight, and though both ilia were close to each other, they were not fused together. The pubic shaft was turned backwards. The femur (thigh bone) is estimated to have been 286Â mm (11Â in) long, and the tibia of the lower leg 317Â mm long (12Â in).
