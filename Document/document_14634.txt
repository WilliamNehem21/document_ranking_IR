Divine beings were joined with one another as effectively as they were separated. A divine being could be known as the "ba" of another, or at least two gods could be joined into one god with a consolidated name and iconography. Neighborhood divine beings were connected with more noteworthy ones, and gods with comparative capacities were joined. Ra was associated with the neighborhood divinity Sobek to shape Sobek-Ra; with his individual decision god, Amun, to frame Amun-Ra; with the sun powered type of Horus to shape Ra-Horakhty; and with a few sunlight based gods as Horemakhet-Khepri-Ra-Atum. On uncommon event, even divinities of various genders were participated along these lines, creating mixes like Osiris-Neith and Mut-Min. This connecting of divinities is called syncretism. Dissimilar to different circumstances for which this term is utilized, the Egyptian practice was not intended to meld contending conviction frameworks, albeit outside gods could be syncretized with local ones. Rather, syncretism recognized the cover between gods' jobs and broadened the range of authority for every one of them. Syncretic blends were not lasting; a divine being who was engaged with one mix kept on showing up independently and to shape new mixes with different gods. In any case, firmly associated gods did now and again consolidate. Horus consumed a few bird of prey divine beings from different areas, for example, Khenti-irty and Khenti-kheti, who turned out to be minimal more than nearby appearances of him; Hathor subsumed a comparable cow goddess, Bat; and an early funerary god, Khenti-Amentiu, was superseded by Osiris and Anubis.
