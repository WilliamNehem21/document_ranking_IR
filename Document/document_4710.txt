In 865 the Viking Great Heathen Army arrived in East Anglia and utilized this as a beginning stage for an attack. The East Anglians were compelled to purchase harmony and the next year the Vikings attacked Northumbria, where they selected a manikin lord in 867. They at that point proceeded onward Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867Ã¢ÂÂ 868. Lord Burgred of Mercia was joined by King ÃÂthelred of Wessex and his sibling, the future King Alfred, for a consolidated assault on the Vikings, who declined a commitment; at last the Mercians purchased harmony with them. The next year, the Vikings vanquished East Anglia. In 874 the Vikings ousted King Burgred and Ceolwulf turned into the last King of Mercia with their help. In 877 the Vikings parceled Mercia, taking the eastern areas for themselves and permitting Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. He was depicted by the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle" as "an absurd lord's thegn" who was a manikin of the Vikings. The student of history Ann Williams sees this view as fractional and mutilated, that he was acknowledged as a genuine ruler by the Mercians and by King Alfred. The circumstance was changed the next year when Alfred prevailed upon a definitive triumph the Danes at the Battle of Edington.
