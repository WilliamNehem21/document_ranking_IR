The cruiser again participated in the pre-winter moves in 1907 and 1909. Amid the last moves, "Prinz Adalbert" participated in the Reserve Division, directed again by Zeye, who had now been elevated to "Vizeadmiral" (Vice Admiral). The ship filled in as the leader of the III Scouting Group, under "Konteradmiral" Johannes Merten, who might proceed to direction the Ottoman strongholds at the Dardanelles amid World War I. In March 1910 and March 1911, "Prinz Adalbert" led gunnery tests in the northern North Sea and visited TÃÂ³rshavn and Vestmanna in the Faeroe Islands. She visited ÃÂlesund in Norway in July and August that year. The ship's first time frame in administration arrived at an end in September, following a huge maritime survey in the Kiel roadstead for Wilhelm II and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the beneficiary to the Austro-Hungarian position of authority, which started on 5 September. "Prinz Adalbert" was then decommissioned in Kiel on the 29th, with the reinforced cruiser having her spot as the armada's gunnery preparing ship. After a protracted update, "Prinz Adalbert" came back to support on 1 November 1912, again with the big guns school. She was situated in Sonderburg, where she supplanted the shielded cruiser "Prinz Heinrich".
