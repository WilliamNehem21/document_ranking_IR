There is a wide scope of eateries, for the most part in Covent Garden's focal zone around the piazza, and in the St Martin's Lane territory circumscribing the West End; a portion of these with universal notorieties. Among the eateries are the memorable showy eating places, the most established of which is Rules, which was established in 1798, making it the most established eatery in London, trailed by J. Sheekey, a clam bar and fish eatery established in 1893 by market-slow down holder Josef Sheekey in Lord Salisbury's St Martin's Court, and The Ivy, which was established as an unlicensed Italian bistro by Abel Giandellini in 1917. Different eateries incorporate Belgo Centraal on Earlham Street, some portion of the Belgo chain of Belgian themed eateries; one of Jamie Oliver's Italian eateries, which opened in 2007; Gaby's Deli, a Jewish bistro and eatery serving falafels and salt meat sandwiches since 1965, and Mon Plaisir, established in 1943, one of the most seasoned French eateries in London. Covent Garden was home to a portion of London's most punctual cafÃÂ©s, for example, Old Slaughter's Coffee House, which kept running from 1692 until 1843, and a Beefsteak Club, the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks, which was helped to establish in 1736 by William Hogarth at the Theater Royal (presently the Royal Opera House).
