On 1 November 1941, Lent became acting Group Commander "Gruppenkommandeur" of the newly formed II./NJGÂ 2. Lent's first aerial victory as a "Gruppenkommandeur", his 20th night-time, and his last in 1941, came during the night of Friday 7 November to Saturday 8 November. He shot down a Wellington 1C heading for Berlin, which came down near Akkrum. The six-man crew of the bomber, "X9976" of No. 75 (New Zealand) Squadron, was killed in action. This achievement earned Lent a reference in the "Wehrmachtbericht" (his first of six in total), an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in the "Wehrmachtbericht" was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of one's Service Record Book.
Lent was promoted to "Hauptmann" on 1 January 1942. Later that year, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves () on 6 June 1942, at which time his total stood at 34 nocturnal victories plus seven day-time victories. The award was presented at the "FÃ¼hrerhauptquartier" on 28 and 29 June, his tally standing then at 39 nocturnal and seven day-time victories. Lent also held the distinction of achieving the first Lichtenstein radar-assisted air victory in a Dornier Do 215B-5 night fighter. Lent flew Dornier Do 215B-5 code R4+DC regularly on Himmelbett missions because of its five-hour endurance. Lent claimed at least four victories in this machine.
