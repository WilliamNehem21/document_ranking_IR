Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville (10ÃÂ SeptemberÃÂ 1823ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ 26ÃÂ March 1889), the main child of Richard Plantagenet Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, second Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, was in genuine monetary troubles by the center of the nineteenth century. The second Duke had spent intensely on works of art, womanizing, and endeavoring to impact decisions, and by 1847 he was nicknamed "the Greatest Debtor in the World". Over of the family's domains, and their London home at Buckingham House, were sold to meet obligations, and the family seat of Stowe House was seized by bailiffs as security and its substance sold. The main property staying in the control of the Grenville family was the family's generally little hereditary home of Wotton House, and its related grounds around Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire. Profoundly in the red, the Grenvilles started to search for approaches to expand benefits from their outstanding farmland around Wotton, and to look for business openings in the rising fields of substantial industry and building. Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, who turned into the Marquess of Chandos on the passing of his granddad Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, first Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1839, was delegated director of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 27ÃÂ MayÃÂ 1857. On the passing of his dad on 29ÃÂ JulyÃÂ 1861 he turned into the third Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and left the chairmanship of the LNWR, coming back to Wotton House to deal with the family's residual homes.
