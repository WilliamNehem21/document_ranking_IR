In 1954 Hamling began a buddy magazine, "Creative Tales"; furthermore, his organization Greenleaf Publishing was the distributer of "Maverick", a men's magazine demonstrated after "Playboy". In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a noteworthy wholesaler, implied that numerous magazines needed to scramble to discover new merchants. Free merchants regularly necessitated that the magazines be month to month, and that they be in a bigger organization than the summary size basic in sci-fi magazines. The bigger arrangement required higher income to be gainful, yet as a rule it demonstrated difficult to draw in the extra promoting salary that would have kept the magazines above water. Before the finish of 1958, numerous titles had vanished thus, with "Creative energy" one of the people in question; Hamling shut down both "Creative energy" and its sister magazine to put the cash in "Rebel." The last issue of "Creative energy" was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while "Innovative Tales", retitled "Space Travel", stopped with the November 1958 issue. There was no sign in either magazine that the end had come, however the last issue of "Creative energy" discarded its letter, book audit and friend through correspondence segments, all of which had showed up normally in earlier issues.
