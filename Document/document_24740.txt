Beginning with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", Angelou used the same "writing ritual" for many years. She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, "Roget's Thesaurus", and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. She would average 10â12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. She went through this process to "enchant" herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, "relive the agony, the anguish, the "Sturm und Drang"". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences such as her rape in "Caged Bird", in order to "tell the human truth" about her life. Angelou stated that she played cards in order to get to that place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively. She said, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in itâha! It's so delicious!" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in "telling the truth".
