Ruler Heinrich requested an invasion toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the warships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and after that left on the foray. After two days, the armada touched base off Gotland to demonstrate the German banner and was back in Kiel by 30 December. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" quickly supplanted her sister as the squadron lead, from 23 January 1915 to 23 February. The squadron came back toward the North Sea for gatekeeper obligations, yet was pulled back from cutting edge administration by February. Deficiencies of prepared teams in the High Seas Fleet, combined with the danger of working more established ships in wartime, required the deactivation of "Kaiser der Grosse" and her sisters. Beginning in October, she served quickly as a preparation send for motor room work force, however on 19 November she was decommissioned in Kiel and incapacitated. She was from there on utilized as a jail send for detainees of war in Wilhelmshaven. In November 1918, Germany gave in and marked the First Armistice at CompiÃÂ¨gne, which finished threats so a harmony settlement could be arranged. As per of the Treaty of Versailles, marked on 28 June 1919, Germany was allowed to hold just six ships of the " or "Lothringen" types". On 6 December 1919, the ship was struck from the maritime rundown and sold to send breakers. The next year, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was separated for scrap metal in RÃÂ¶nnebeck.
