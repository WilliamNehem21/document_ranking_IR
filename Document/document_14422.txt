The "Hoodlum" arrangement had been arranged as a set of three, and work on "Cheat III" was "in a genuinely propelled stage" when Looking Glass shut, as indicated by "PC Zone"s Keith Pullin. Randy Smith and Terri Brosius were selected as lead planners, and they built up the amusement's idea more than a while. In an open letter distributed after the organization's chapter 11, Smith composed that the third diversion would have occurred in an "open-finished, self-coordinated city", and that its plot would have fixated on the Keepers. Brosius recommended that "Cheat III" would have seen Garrett "accept[ing] that there are results to his activities", and that he would almost certainly have progressed toward becoming "prepared to give, instead of dependably take." The player would have revealed the diversion's story bit by bit, while investigating a free-meander condition. Genuine plans had been made to incorporate co-employable multiplayer, and another motor, Siege, had been underway. When Looking Glass shut, its benefits were exchanged and the "Criminal" protected innovation was sold at closeout. This raised questions that the "Cheat" set of three would be finished, a circumstance that Salon.com essayist Wagner James Au contrasted with Lucasfilm shutting after the arrival of "The Empire Strikes Back". Be that as it may, following bits of gossip, Eidos declared on August 9, 2000 that it had acquired the rights to "Hoodlum".
