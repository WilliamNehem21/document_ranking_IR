The degree to which "Falstaff" is a "Shakespearian" musical show has regularly been bantered by commentators. Despite the fact that the move is made from "The Merry Wives of Windsor", a few observers feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare's play into a completely Italian work. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf accepted there was not much or Shakespearian about the satire: "it was altogether done through the music". In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in "The Observer", "As a result of Shakespeare we like to consider "Falstaff" a work that has a certain Englishness. Actually the musical show is not any more English than "Aida" is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them changed the fat knight into one of the paradigms of "musical drama buffa"." Verdi himself, notwithstanding, felt that the Falstaff of the musical drama is definitely not a traditional Italian "buffo" character, however depicts Shakespeare's more full, increasingly questionable Falstaff of the "Henry IV" plays: "My Falstaff isn't just the saint of "The Merry Wives of Windsor", who is basically a joker, and enables himself to be deceived by the ladies, yet in addition the Falstaff of the two pieces of "Henry IV". Boito has composed the lyrics in agreement." A contemporary pundit contended that the content "imitated with sublime exactness the meter and musicality of Shakespeare's stanza", however Hepokoski takes note of Boito's utilization of customary Italian metric traditions.
