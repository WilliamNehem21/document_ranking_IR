In 2012, Sereno called attention to a few skull and dentition includes that recommend an absolutely or possibly prevalently herbivorous eating routine. These incorporate the horny bill and the specific cheek teeth (appropriate for cutting off vegetation), just as meaty cheeks which would have helped keeping nourishment inside the mouth amid rumination. The jaw muscles were broadened, and the jaw joint was set beneath the dimension of the teeth. This profound position of the jaw joint would have permitted a uniformly spread nibble along the tooth push, as opposed to the scissor-like chomp seen in flesh eating dinosaurs. At long last, size and position of the tusks are altogether different in isolated individuals from the Heterodontosauridae; a particular capacity in encouraging hence seems far-fetched. Sereno inferred that heterodontosaurids were equivalent to the present peccaries, which have comparative tusks and feed on an assortment of plant material, for example, roots, tubers, organic products, seeds and grass. Steward and partners proposed that the sustaining mechanical assembly of "Heterodontosaurus" was particular to process extreme plant material, and that late-enduring individuals from the family ("Fruitadens", "Tianyulong" and "Echinodon") most likely demonstrated an increasingly summed up eating regimen including the two plants and spineless creatures. "Heterodontosaurus" was described by a solid nibble at little expand points, however the later individuals were adjusted to an increasingly quick chomp and more extensive expands. A 2016 investigation of ornithischian jaw mechanics found that the relative nibble powers of "Heterodontosaurus" was practically identical to that of the more inferred "Scelidosaurus". The investigation recommended that the tusks could have assumed a job in sustaining by touching against the lower nose while editing vegetation.
