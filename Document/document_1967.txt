The second Raiders endured 16ÃÂ killed and 17ÃÂ wounded (in addition to 2ÃÂ wounded local aides). Non-fight losses totaled 225, of which 125ÃÂ suffered from intestinal sickness, 29 from looseness of the bowels, and 71 from ringworm or wilderness decay.

EarlyÃ¢ÂÂa lieutenant in Carlson's Company EÃ¢ÂÂportrayed the long Guadalcanal watch and the impact on his unit: "Persevering through the living conditions was more awful than the battle. My detachment ran in with 30ÃÂ men, one corpsman and one officer. When we turned out we had one officer, one corpsman, and 18ÃÂ enlisted, every one of whom had intestinal sickness, worms, loose bowels, wilderness spoil and high confidence.
