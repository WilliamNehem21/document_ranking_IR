"Oldenburg" was requested by the German Imperial Navy ("Kaiserliche Marine") under the temporary name "Synthetic Frithjof", as a substitution for the old beach front resistance send . The agreement for the ship was granted to the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig under development number 828. Her three sisters had been requested for 1908, but since of spending limitations, "Oldenburg" request was postponed to 1909. Chief of naval operations Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Navy, gave the agreement to Schichau before the 1909 spending plan had been affirmed, and the shipbuilder started storing materials to manufacture the ship. This gave the feeling that Germany was fabricating a larger number of war vessels than openly conceded, which provoked a maritime panic in Britain. The British open requested "we need eight [new battleships] and we won't pause", and in the range of a year eight new war vessels had been set down in Britain, a noteworthy acceleration in the worldwide maritime weapons contest. Work started on 1 March 1909 with the laying of her bottom, and the ship was propelled somewhat more than a year later on 30 June 1910. Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg initiated her, and Friedrich August, the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, gave the discourse. Subsequent to propelling, the inadequate ship was exchanged to Kiel for fitting-out, including fruition of the superstructure and the establishment of deadly implement, until August 1911. Named for the Duchy of Oldenburg in northern Germany, the ship was authorized into the High Seas Fleet on 1 May 1912, a little more than three years after work started, at an expense of 45.801ÃÂ million gold imprints.
