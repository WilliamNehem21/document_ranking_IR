The pied currawong's effect on littler fowls that are powerless against home predation is dubious: a few examinations have proposed that the species has turned into a difficult issue, however reality of this broadly held recognition was questioned in a 2001 survey of the distributed writing on their rummaging propensities by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who saw that regular presented winged creatures were more influenced than local feathered creatures. In any case, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decay of Gould's petrel at a settlement on Cabbage Tree Island, close Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been accounted for going after grown-up seabirds. Their expulsion from the islands stopped a decay of the undermined petrels. Moreover, a University of New England think about distributed in 2006 detailed that the reproducing achievement rates for the eastern yellow robin ("Eopsaltria australis") and red robin ("Petroica boodang") on the New England Tablelands were improved after homes were ensured and currawongs separated, and some yellow robins even re-colonized a zone where they had turned out to be locally wiped out. The nearness of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is adversely associated with the nearness of silvereyes ("Zosterops lateralis").
