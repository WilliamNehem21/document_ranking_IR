Instances of reused material incorporate Pallas' "Col raggio placido", which depends on Lucifer's aria from "La resurrezione" (1708), "O voi dell'Erebo", which was itself adjusted from Reinhard Keiser's 1705 musical show "Octavia". Agrippina's aria "Non ho cor che per amarti" was taken, as a rule unaltered, from "Se la morte non vorrÃÂ " in Handel's prior emotional cantata "Qual ti reveggio, goodness Dio" (1707); Narcissus' "SpererÃÂ²" is an adjustment of "Sai perchÃÂ¨" from another 1707 cantata, "Clori, Tirsi e Fileno"; and parts of Nero's aria in act 3, "Come nube che fugge dal vento", are acquired Handel's oratorio "Il trionfo del rhythm" (all from 1707). Afterward, some of "Agrippina's" music was utilized by Handel in his London musical shows "Rinaldo" (1711) and the 1732 rendition of "Acis and Galatea", for each situation with practically zero change. The main music by Handel displayed in London may have been Agrippina's "Non ho cor che", transposed into Alessandro Scarlatti's musical show "Pirro ÃÂ¨ Dimitrio" which was performed in London on 6 December 1710. The "Agrippina" suggestion and different arias from the musical show showed up in pasticcios performed in London somewhere in the range of 1710 and 1714, with extra music given by different arrangers. Echoes of "Ti vo' giusta" (one of only a handful couple of arias formed explicitly for "Agrippina") can be found noticeable all around "He was loathed", from Handel's "Savior" (1742).
