With no proof available to him to help Feletti's declaration, he was compelled to depend as a rule without anyone else rhetoric. Jussi set forward certain parts of the arrangement of occasions that he said recommended that orders had to be sure originated from RomeÃ¢ÂÂfor instance, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing himÃ¢ÂÂand affirmed that the Holy Office and the Pope were much better set to decree the legitimacy of the submersion than a mainstream court. He cited finally from Angelo Padovani's record of his gathering with Anna Morisi in July 1858, at that point provide reason to feel ambiguous about the merchant Lepori's case that he didn't realize how to purify through water a kidÃ¢ÂÂJussi delivered a police report in which Lepori was depicted as a dear companion of a Jesuit cleric.

He inferred that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had only done what that office expected him to do, and no wrongdoing had been submitted.
