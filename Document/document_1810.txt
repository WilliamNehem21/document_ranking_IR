Following Italy's entrance into the war on 10ÃÂ June 1940, Waller was associated with the look for minefields off the North African coast. A sharp shooter, he by and by exploded drifting mines utilizing a rifle and protection puncturing shots. On 21ÃÂ June, "Stuart" shelled the Italian-held town of Bardia. The following month, his tenth Destroyer Flotilla took an interest in the Battle of Calabria. Waller's boats completed bombardments on Fort Capuzzo on 17ÃÂ August and an Italian seaplane base in the Gulf of Bomba multi week later. In September, he was granted the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for "boldness, venture, and commitment to obligation on ongoing commitment"Ã¢ÂÂ specifically, his pinpointing of foe minefields. That month, he exchanged to HMAS "Vampire" while "Stuart" went in for refit. As the Allied militaries counterattacked Italian powers in December 1940, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, gave Waller order of the recently shaped Inshore Squadron, involving destroyers, minesweepers, and assistants. In his job as Cunningham's Senior Officer Afloat, Waller assumed responsibility for maritime help for the assault on Bardia, which tumbled to the Allies on 5ÃÂ January 1941. In the blink of an eye a short time later, he gave over order of the Inshore Squadron and exchanged back on board "Stuart".
