In his discourses, Aeschines utilizes pederastic relations of Demosthenes as a way to assault him. On account of Aristion, a young from Plataea who lived for quite a while in Demosthenes' home, Aeschines derides the "outrageous" and "ill-advised" connection. In another discourse, Aeschines raises the pederastic connection of his adversary with a kid called Cnosion. The defamation that Demosthenes' significant other likewise laid down with the kid proposes that the relationship was contemporary with his marriage. Aeschines claims that Demosthenes made cash out of youthful rich men, for example, Aristarchus, the child of Moschus, whom he purportedly beguiled with the misrepresentation that he could make him an extraordinary speaker. Evidently, while still under Demosthenes' tutelage, Aristarchus murdered and ruined a certain Nicodemus of Aphidna. Aeschines blamed Demosthenes for complicity in the homicide, calling attention to that Nicodemus had once squeezed a claim blaming Demosthenes for departure. He additionally blamed Demosthenes for having been such a terrible "erastes" to Aristarchus so as not even to merit the name. His wrongdoing, as per Aeschines, was to have deceived his "eromenos" by looting his domain, supposedly professing to be infatuated with the adolescent in order to get his hands on the kid's legacy. In any case, the account of Demosthenes' relations with Aristarchus is still viewed as more than far fetched, and no other student of Demosthenes is known by name.
