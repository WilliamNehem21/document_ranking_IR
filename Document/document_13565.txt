Writer Kevin O'Flynn composes that since overwhelming drinking hosted occurred at the get-together, the proof against Streltsov was "confounded and opposing", even from Lebedeva herself. Yet, the Soviet group mentor, Gavriil Kachalin, asserted in no time before Streltsov's passing that impact from high up in the Communist Party directed that the player would not have benefited from outside intervention; Kachalin said that police let him know of Khrushchev's own inclusion, fuelled by resentment held by Furtseva. As per Soviet Union colleague Nikita Simonyan, talking in 2006, Streltsov kept in touch with home to his mom "saying he was assuming the fault for another person". Streltsov and Lebedeva slept together, Simonyan stated, and he didn't trust their getting had been set together, however he was uncertain about whether Streltsov had assaulted her. Simonyan recommended that consensual sex could have been curved into an assault allegation by "the framework", which he said bore hostility towards the Torpedo forward. Notwithstanding, in a similar meeting Simonyan uncovered implicating photos of both Lebedeva and Streltsov from the season of the preliminary, incorporating one in which the Torpedo player's face "was streaked from nose to cheekbone with three parallel scratches". "[T]here is the likelihood that the photos were doctored or the wounds dispensed sometime in the not too distant future", Wilson remarks, "yet Soviet equity once in a while required such condemning proof." Streltsov's better half of a little more than a year, Alla, sought legal separation not long after the allegations were made. Aside from Streltsov himself, the main individuals from the group present at his preliminary were Ogonkov and Tatushin, who showed up as observers.
