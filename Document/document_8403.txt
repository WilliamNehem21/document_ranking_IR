"Oryzomys" is uncommon in Panama. Panamanian "Oryzomys" were first depicted by Goldman in 1912, who presented the name "Oryzomys gatunensis" for an example from GatÃÂºn in the Canal Zone. In 1918, Goldman kept the creature as a different animal categories, commenting that it was like "richmondi", yet unmistakable in the all around created edges along the edges of the interorbital district, the short interparietal bone (some portion of the top of the braincase), and the long nasal bones. In 1937, Bole portrayed another types of Panamanian "Oryzomys", "Oryzomys azuerensis" from ParacotÃÂ©, Veraguas Province. It is a darker structure, without the ruddy tones of close-by populaces, and has a wide skull with a short platform (front part) and edges on the interorbital area like those of "gatunensis". In spite of the fact that Goldman prescribed to him that "gatunensis" and "azuerensis" both be treated as subspecies of "couesi", Bole depicted "azuerensis" as a species since it didn't appear to be middle between the geologically nearest frames, "gatunensis" and "couesi", and was isolated by an extensive hole from the closest known populaces of "O.ÃÂ couesi" in northwestern Costa Rica and southeastern Nicaragua. In a 1966 audit of Panamanian warm blooded animals, Charles Handley diminished both "gatunensis" and "azuerensis" to subspecies of the bog rice rodent (in which "O.ÃÂ couesi" was incorporated at the time), and when "O.ÃÂ couesi" was restored as a different animal categories these structures ran with it. Examples from close to the sort territory of "azuerensis" vary by about 7% in their "Cytb" arrangements from other "O.ÃÂ couesi", which recommends that they may speak to a different animal groups. Be that as it may, Hanson and partners did not reestablish "azuerensis" as a species, since they couldn't analyze tests of "gatunensis".
