By 1960 Stoke were attempting to pull in supporters to the Victoria Ground, with the normal participation dipping under 10,000 without precedent for a long time. Tony Waddington was designated as the club's director in June 1960. He joined the club in 1952 as a mentor, before being elevated to associate chief in 1957. In his first season in control, 1960Ã¢ÂÂ 61, Stoke completed eighteenth in the Second Division. Groups were still low; a match against Preston North End pulled in 8,409 out of 1961. In any case, Waddington pulled off a huge upset by luring Stanley MatthewsÃ¢ÂÂpresently 46 years of ageÃ¢ÂÂback to the club, 14 years after he had left. A horde of 35,974 saw Matthews' arrival to the club, just a fortnight after the poor group against Preston. The arrival of Matthews stirred to ascend to eighth position in 1961Ã¢ÂÂ 62. Advancement was accomplished in the following season, when Stoke completed as bosses. In their first season back in the First Division, 1963Ã¢ÂÂ 64, Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table completion. Matthews stayed powerful, as he helped the club to the Football League Cup last in 1964, in spite of the fact that this finished in a 4Ã¢ÂÂ 3 thrashing to Leicester more than two legs.
