Since 1862, the Blancos had made rehashed suggestions to Paraguay, administered by despot Carlos Antonio LÃÂ³pez, trying to manufacture a union that may progress both their interests in the Platine locale. Upon the passing of LÃÂ³pez, his child, Francisco Solano LÃÂ³pez, succeeded him as Paraguayan despot. Not at all like the senior LÃÂ³pez, who endeavored to abstain from burdening coalitions, Solano welcomed the Blanco's proposition with excitement. He trusted Argentina was moving in the direction of the extension of both Uruguay and Paraguay, with the objective of reproducing the Viceroyalty of the RÃÂ­o de la Plata, the previous Spanish settlement that once enveloped the regions of each of the three countries. Solano LÃÂ³pez had, as far back as 1855, communicated this worry, remarking to the Uruguayan AndrÃÂ©s Lamas that "recreating [the old viceroyalty] is in the spirit of the Argentines; and subsequently, it isn't simply Paraguay that requirements to stand protect: your nation, the Oriental Republic [of Uruguay], needs to coexist with my own so as to get ready for any inevitabilities." In late 1863, Solano LÃÂ³pez was assembling his military and was in chats with Urquiza, the pioneer of the dissenter Argentine Federalists, to persuade him to join the proposed ParaguayanÃ¢ÂÂ Uruguayan collusion.
