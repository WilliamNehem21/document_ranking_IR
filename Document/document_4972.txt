Greg Jein, best known as the manufacturer of the outsider mothership from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", was approached to construct props for the film. Jein was a long-lasting "Star Trek" fan who had built the props for "The Final Frontier", yet was compelled to revamp props that had since strangely vanished. Jein added references to the first TV arrangement and other sci-fi establishments all through the prop plans; the Rura Penthe superintendent's staff contained pieces of a spaceship from "Buck Rogers", while the frong was nitty gritty with a prop from "Buckaroo Banzai". Components from "The Final Frontier" were altered and reused; a therapeutic actualize from the film turned into Chekov's blood analyzer, and the attack phasers originally found in "The Final Frontier" wound up standard issue. Gorkon's staff was expected to be a huge bone from an outsider animal he had murdered, with the structures molded out of green froth and endorsed by Meyer. Two duplicates were sufficiently able to help David Warner's weight; another two were intended to be light enough to be dangled from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were overhauled for the third film, the first holsters never again fit the weaponry; accordingly, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was unyielding about having the on-screen characters have the capacity to unholster their weapons, so the current guns must be updated. The Klingon expert marksman rifle was broken into areas, with parts demonstrated from genuine weapons.
