Coming up short on a pioneer of stature, the Catalan Company swung to their two recognized hostages; they solicited Boniface from Verona, whom they knew and regarded, to lead them, yet after he declined, picked Roger Deslaur. Deslaur demonstrated a failure, and the threatening vibe of Venice and the other Frankish states constrained the Catalans to look for an amazing defender. They swung to the Aragonese King of Sicily, Frederick II, who designated his child Manfred as Duke of Athens. By and by, the Duchy was administered by a progression of vicars-general delegated by the Aragonese Crown, regularly cadet individuals from the Aragonese illustrious family. The best vicar-general, Alfonso Fadrique, extended the Duchy into Thessaly, setting up the Duchy of Neopatras in 1319. The Catalans solidified their standard and endure a Briennist endeavor to recoup the Duchy in 1331Ã¢ÂÂ 1332. During the 1360s, the twin duchies were tormented by inner difficulty, incorporating a semi war with Venice, and progressively felt the danger of the Ottoman Turks, however another Briennist endeavor to dispatch a battle against them in 1370Ã¢ÂÂ 1371 came to nothing. It was not until 1379Ã¢ÂÂ 1380 that Catalan principle confronted its first genuine difficulty, when the Navarrese Company vanquished Thebes and quite a bit of Boeotia. In 1386Ã¢ÂÂ 1388, the driven ruler of Corinth, Nerio I Acciaioli, caught Athens and guaranteed the Duchy from the Crown of Aragon. With his catch of Neopatras in 1390, the period of Catalan standard in Greece reached an end.
