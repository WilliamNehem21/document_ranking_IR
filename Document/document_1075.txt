Headley is viewed by pundits as a standout amongst the best batsmen from the Caribbean and one of the best batsmen ever. In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley portrayed Headley as "the measuring stick against whom all other West Indian batsmen are estimated". In 1988, "The Cricketer" magazine set him in an untouched West Indian group, as completed a board of judges for another such group in July 2010, while in 2004, another board of specialists named him among the main five West Indian players. He was the principal world-class batsman from the West Indies who was dark, and was given the epithets "Map book" and "the Black Bradman" by analysts; some jested that Bradman ought to be classified "the White Headley". As per student of history Gideon Haigh, his job was made more earnestly by the shortcoming of his associates, as couple of exceptional players think that its simple to play in groups which lose often. In spite of the fact that he was a normally assaulting player, Headley wanted to play carefully inferable from the manner in which his group relied upon him. C. L. R. James trusted that no other extraordinary batsman needed to worry about such a concern for such a long time. In the years prior to the war, Headley scored 25.61% of the runs scored in Tests by West Indies, more than twice the same number of as the following best batsman, and 66% of the group's hundreds of years, scoring ten of the group's initial fourteen centuries in Test cricket. Headley as a rule batted at number three and as the opening batsmen were regularly rejected rapidly, he often started his innings early.
