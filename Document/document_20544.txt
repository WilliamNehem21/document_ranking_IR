Early on OctoberÂ 8, after turning west-southwestward away from the Greater Antilles, Iris began strengthening again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear. The NHC predicted peak winds of 105Â mph (165Â km/h) before the storm would hit Belize. It rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions, intensifying from 95Â mph (150Â km/h) to 140Â mph (225Â km/h) in a 12-hour period on OctoberÂ 8, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38Â mbar (1.12Â inHg). While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7Â mi (11Â km). For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3Â mi (5Â km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde into the center of Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145Â mph (230Â km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00Â UTC on OctoberÂ 9, it made landfall at peak intensity in Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize. Operationally, it was assessed as having made landfall with winds of 150Â mph (240Â km/h), though for an unknown reason this was lowered in post-analysis.
