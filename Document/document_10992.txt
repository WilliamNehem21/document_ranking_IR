The initial two boats utilized Harvey protection for a large portion of their heavily clad vertical surfaces with the exception of the firearm turrets and their help tubes, which were produced using Krupp shield. "Pobeda", be that as it may, utilized Krupp defensive layer for every last bit of her overwhelming vertical shield. Over the hardware spaces, the greatest thickness of their waterline protective layer belt was which diminished to side by side the magazines. The belt decreased to a thickness of over the hardware spaces and over the magazines. The belt secured of the boats' length and was high, of which the upper was planned to be over the waterline, however the boats were altogether overweight. Such a large amount of the belt was submerged that "Peresvet" just had of covering uncovered at ordinary burden; at full burden the impact was considerably more prominent and the belt was totally submerged. "Oslyabya" was considerably increasingly overweight and just had of her belt defensive layer appearing ordinary burden. The belt in the two boats ended in 7-inch transverse bulkheads, leaving the finishes of the boats unprotected. The transverse bulkheads of the waterline belt in "Pobeda" were wiped out as the belt was reached out to the finishes of the ship with 4-inch defensive layer plates. Over the waterline belt in every one of the three boats was a shorter strake of shield that ensured the center of the boats. It was long and 4 inches thick. The closures of the upper belt were shut off by 4-inch calculated transverse bulkheads.
