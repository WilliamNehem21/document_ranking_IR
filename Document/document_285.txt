While Tompkins and his supporters principally battled through the state's papers, the vast majority of which upheld the Anti-Relief group, Desha ventured to every part of the state making stump talks. Offering no particular stage, he concentrated only on the possibility that he restricted "legal usurpation" and trusted "all power had a place with the general population". He was commonly recognized as the applicant of the Relief Party, however history specialist Arndt M. Stickles has noticed that he utilized Anti-Relief talk in certain regions. Desha assaulted Tompkins' record as a judge, asserting that he had reliably upheld the Second Bank of the United States and the present Court of Appeals. This, Desha stated, place him in immediate and open resistance to the state's ranchers and guaranteed that, in the event that he were chosen, the state would be represented by the legal branch, not the representative. Desha guaranteed the state's papers aggrieved him a similar way the Anti-Relief party mistreated account holders. He additionally charged that Tompkins was not the genuine decision of the Anti-Relief party, yet just picked up its help by being the primary applicant with that situation to declare his appointment. Sponsor of Russell, who reliably ran a far off third in voter support, concurred with this case, saying Tompkins had joined the race before a date that had been recently conceded to among Anti-Relief competitors, giving him an uncalled for favorable position over Russell.
