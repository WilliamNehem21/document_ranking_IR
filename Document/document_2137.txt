One contender is in the common ward of Blacko, on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm; since the 1840s cases have been made that old brick work found in a field divider is from the remaining parts of the structure. In "The Lancashire Witch-Craze", Jonathan Lumby guesses that the structure was arranged on the fields encompassing Blacko Hill, close to an old street among Colne and Gisburn. Neighborhood old stories in the area holds that the remaining parts of Malkin Tower are covered in a field behind the adjacent Cross Gaits Inn open house; the pinnacle used to be highlighted on the hotel's sign. The essential proof supporting this area is by all accounts that an empty in the slope east of the ranch is known as Mawkin Hole. It has been recommended this is a similar spot referenced in the sixteenth century halmote court records for the house of Colne as Mawkin Yarde, portrayed as being "in the north of Colne", however anyplace inside the estate of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the main Ordnance Survey guide of the territory, made during the 1840s, distinguishes the homestead as Blacko Tower. The site is likewise a few miles from any of the detectable areas referenced at the preliminary.
