The species that Korhonen called EBSÂ B was named "A.Â bulbosa" by Helga MarxmÃ¼ller in 1982, as it was thought to be equivalent to "Armillaria mellea" var. "bulbosa", first described by Jean Baptiste Barla (Joseph Barla) in 1887, and later raised to species status by Josef VelenovskÃ½ in 1927. In 1973, the French mycologist Henri Romagnesi, unaware of VelenovskÃ½'s publication, published a description of the species he called "Armillariella bulbosa", based on specimens he had found near CompiÃ¨gne and Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte in France. These specimens were later demonstrated to be the same species as the EBSÂ E of Korhonen; EBSÂ B was later determined to be "A.Â cepistipes". Therefore, the name "A.Â bulbosa" was a misapplied name for EBSÂ E. In 1987 Romagnesi and MarxmÃ¼ller renamed EBSÂ E to "Armillaria gallica". Another synonym, "A.Â lutea", had originally been described by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1874, and proposed as a name for EBSÂ E. Although the name had priority due to its early publication date, it was rejected as a "nomen ambiguum" because of a lack of supporting evidence to identify the fungus, including a specimen, type locality, and incomplete collection notes. "A.Â inflata" (VelenovskÃ½, 1920) may represent another synonym, but the type specimens were not preserved, so it is considered a dubious name ("nomen dubium"). As of 2010, both the Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider "Armillaria gallica" Marxm. & Romagn. to be the current name, with "A.Â bulbosa" and "A.Â lutea" as synonyms.
