Between the mid-1890s and the late 1950s Vaughan Williams set in excess of eighty sonnets for voice and piano backup. The most punctual to endure is "A Cradle Song", to Coleridge's words, from around 1894. The melodies incorporate numerous that have entered the repertory, for example, "Linden Lea" (1902), "Quiet Noon" (1904) and the tune cycles "Tunes of Travel" (1905 and 1907) and "On Wenlock Edge". To Vaughan Williams the human voice was "the most seasoned and most prominent of melodic instruments". He depicted his initial tunes as "pretty much straightforward and well known in character", and the musicologist Sophie Fuller portrays this effortlessness and notoriety as steady all through his vocation. Numerous arrangers of the late nineteenth and mid twentieth hundreds of years composed nostalgic works for female voice; conversely, tunes by Vaughan Williams, for example, "The Vagabond" from "Tunes of Travel", to words by Robert Louis Stevenson, are "an especially manly much needed refresher" (Fuller), "virile outdoors sections" (Kennedy). Some of Vaughan Williams' later melodies are less notable; Fuller singles out the cycle "Three Poems by Walt Whitman", a to a great extent dim work, as time after time ignored by artists and pundits. For a portion of his tunes the arranger extends the backup to incorporate at least two string instruments notwithstanding the piano; they incorporate "On Wenlock Edge", and the Chaucer cycle "Pitiless Beauty" (1921), made a decision by an unknown contemporary faultfinder as "without a doubt among the best of present day English melodies".
