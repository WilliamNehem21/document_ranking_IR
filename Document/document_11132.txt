The spores of "C.ÃÂ micaceus" are ruddy dark colored, with measurements of 7Ã¢ÂÂ 10 by 4.5Ã¢ÂÂ 6ÃÂ ÃÂµm. By and large, they are lentiform (formed like a biconvex focal point), yet saw from the side they seem more almond-molded or axle molded, while in front view they seem oval or mitriform (generally the state of a miterÃ¢ÂÂa topped top). Spores have a germ pore, a leveled region in the focal point of the spore surface through which a germ cylinder may rise. The spore-bearing cells (the basidia) are four-spored, club-molded, and measure 10Ã¢ÂÂ 15 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ 7ÃÂ ÃÂµm. Studies have demonstrated that the basidia create in four discrete ages. The original basidia are the most protuberant, and reach out the best separation from the outside of the hymenium. Ensuing ages of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. At the point when a living gill is seen with a magnifying instrument, the four arrangements of basidia can be seen unmistakably. Arthur Buller instituted the expression "inaequihymeniiferous" to portray this method of hymenial advancement. The reason for the amazed basidia sizes is to encourage the arrival of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore release that compare to the four arrangements of basidia, and basidia that have discharged the majority of their spores rapidly start to autodigest. The amazed setup limits the opportunity of spores slamming into neighboring basidia amid discharge.
