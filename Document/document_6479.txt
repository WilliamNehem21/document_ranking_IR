In May 1994, Aditya read the main draft of the content to a few individuals from the Yash Raj Films generation group alloted to work with him, including a cinematographer, a workmanship executive and a discourse essayist. They were not awed, yet Aditya held quick to his thoughts. He was given all out article control by his dad, the maker, and made the film as indicated by his very own preferences and sensibilities. Aditya battled with both the discourse essayist Javed Siddiqui and the melody lyricist Anand Bakshi to create words that were "youthful sounding". There were close to home conflicts over composition credits on the last content. Pamela's companion Honey Irani trusted she merited a composition credit that she didn't get, and Siddiqui trusted Aditya did not merit halfway credit for the discourse. After "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge", neither of them at any point worked with Yash Raj Films once more. In the wake of favoring the content, Yash was counseled about the tunes, yet generally left the inventive procedure to his child, and has solidly denied that he was a phantom executive on the undertaking. He didn't shoot a solitary casing, and did not see a few bits of the film until it was almost finished.
