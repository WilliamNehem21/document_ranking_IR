Inside seven days after her demise, Horace Greeley recommended to Emerson that a life story of Fuller, to be classified "Margaret and Her Friends", be arranged rapidly "before the intrigue energized by her pitiful perish has passed away". A significant number of her compositions were before long gathered together by her sibling Arthur as "At Home and Abroad" (1856) and "Existence Without and Life Within" (1858). He likewise altered another variant of "Lady in the Nineteenth Century" in 1855. In February 1852, "The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli" was distributed, altered by Emerson, James Freeman Clarke, and William Henry Channing, however a significant part of the work was controlled or rephrased. It forgot insights concerning her relationship with Ossoli and a prior association with a man named James Nathan. The three editors, trusting the open enthusiasm for Fuller would be brief and that she would not get by as a verifiable figure, were not worried about precision. For a period, it was the top of the line life story of the decade and experienced thirteen releases before the century's end. The book concentrated on her identity instead of her work. Spoilers of the book disregarded her status as a commentator and rather reprimanded her own life and her "unwomanly" self-importance.
