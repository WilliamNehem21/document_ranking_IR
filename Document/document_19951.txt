In March 1821 Berlioz passed the baccalaurÃ©at examination at the University of Grenoble â it is not certain whether at the first or second attempt â and in late September, aged seventeen, he moved to Paris. At his father's insistence he enrolled at the School of Medicine of the University of Paris. He had to fight hard to overcome his revulsion at dissecting bodies, but in deference to his father's wishes, he forced himself to continue his medical studies.
The horrors of the medical college were mitigated thanks to an ample allowance from his father, which enabled him to take full advantage of the cultural, and particularly musical, life of Paris. Music did not at that time enjoy the prestige of literature in French culture, but Paris nonetheless possessed two major opera houses and the country's most important music library. Berlioz took advantage of them all. Within days of arriving in Paris he went to the OpÃ©ra, and although the piece on offer was by a minor composer, the staging and the magnificent orchestral playing enchanted him. He went to other works at the OpÃ©ra and the OpÃ©ra-Comique; at the former, three weeks after his arrival, he saw Gluck's "IphigÃ©nie en Tauride", which thrilled him. He was particularly inspired by Gluck's use of the orchestra to carry the drama along. A later performance of the same work at the OpÃ©ra convinced him that his vocation was to be a composer.
