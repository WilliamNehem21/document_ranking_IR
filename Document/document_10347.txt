Half a month prior to the introduction of the No. 5 train, the railroad, without precedent for its history, facilitated an exclusive train on its track. On the morning of May 10, preceding Disneyland opened through the afternoon, a private function was held at New Orleans Square Station to respect Disney artist and rail devotee Ollie Johnston, evidently to express gratitude toward him for moving Walt Disney's enthusiasm for trains, which prompted the formation of Disneyland. The genuine thought process in having Johnston there was before long uncovered when a straightforward steam train not part of the DRR's moving stock, comprising of a train named "Marie E." and a rear, moved towards the station and halted at its stage. Johnston, a past proprietor of the steam train, used to run it on his excursion property, which he sold, alongside the train, in 1993. The man who currently possessed the train was Pixar movie chief John Lasseter, who had acquired the train to Disneyland request to give Johnston, his guide, a chance to rejoin with and drive his previous train. Johnston, at that point in his nineties, was helped into the "Marie E.", and with Lasseter next to him, he got a handle on the train's throttle and drove his previous belonging multiple times around the DRR's fundamental line. In spite of the fact that Johnston kicked the bucket in 2008, Lasseter keeps on running the "Marie E.", the rear, and a combination of train vehicles on his private Justi Creek Railway.
