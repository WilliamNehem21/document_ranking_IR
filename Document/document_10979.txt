In the seventeenth century, privateers began to utilize the GalÃÂ¡pagos Islands as a base for resupply, restocking on nourishment and water, and fixing vessels before assaulting Spanish settlements on the South American terrain. In any case, the GalÃÂ¡pagos tortoises did not battle for survival now in light of the fact that the islands were removed from caught up with delivery courses and harbored couple of profitable normal assets. All things considered, they stayed unclaimed by any country, uninhabited and strange. In correlation, the tortoises of the islands in the Indian Ocean were at that point confronting termination by the late seventeenth century. Between the 1790s and the 1860s, whaling boats and hide sealers methodicallly gathered tortoises in far more prominent numbers than the marauders going before them. Some were utilized for nourishment and a lot more were executed for high-grade "turtle oil" from the late nineteenth century ahead for rewarding deal to mainland Ecuador. A sum of more than 13,000 tortoises is recorded in the logs of whaling ships somewhere in the range of 1831 and 1868, and an expected 100,000 were taken before 1830. Since it was least demanding to gather tortoises around seaside zones, females were most defenseless against exhaustion amid the settling season. The gathering by whalers stopped in the long run through a blend of the shortage of tortoises that they had made and the challenge from unrefined petroleum as a less expensive vitality source.
