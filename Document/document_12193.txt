Staying in such a position would require Mercedes-Benz to deliver a focused vehicle for the 1936 season. Despite the fact that the skeleton of the W25 was abbreviated, and the motor was essentially moved up to 4.74ÃÂ litres, the vehicle demonstrated mediocre compared to the Type C created via Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved the case to coordinate the motor, and the W25 demonstrated uncompetitive and problematic. In spite of this, Caracciola opened the season with a success in the downpour at the Monaco Grand Prix, subsequent to beginning from third position. He drove the Hungarian Grand Prix early however resigned with mechanical issues. At the German Grand Prix, he resigned with a fizzled fuel siphon, before assuming control over his partner Hermann Lang's vehicle; he later resigned that vehicle with supercharger issues. Caracciola drove the Swiss Grand Prix for a few laps, Rosemeyer trailing him intently, however the Clerk of the Course requested Caracciola to surrender the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was observed to obstruct the Auto Union. The two had a warmed contention after the race regardless of Caracciola's later retirement with a back pivot issue. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936Ã¢ÂÂCaracciola won just twice, in Monaco and TunisÃ¢ÂÂthat Neubauer pulled back the group mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.
