In 1924, the American palaeontologist Charles W. Gilmore described a complete skull of "S. validus" with associated postcranial remains (specimen UALVP 2 in the University of Alberta Laboratory for Vertebrate Palaeontology), until then the most complete remains of a dome-headed dinosaur. This find confirmed Hatcher's interpretation of the domes as consisting of the frontoparietal area of the skull. UALVP 2 was found with small, disarticulated bony elements, then thought to be gastralia (abdominal ribs), which are not known in other ornithischian dinosaurs (one of the two main groups of dinosaurs). Gilmore pointed out that the teeth of "S. validus" were very similar to those of the species "Troodon formosus" (named in 1856 and by then only known from isolated teeth), and described a skull dome discovered close to the locality where "Troodon" was found. Therefore, Gilmore considered "Stegoceras" an invalid junior synonym of "Troodon", thereby renaming "S. validus" into "T. validus", and suggested that even the two species might be the same. Furthermore, he found "S. brevis" to be identical to "S. validus", and therefore a junior synonym of the latter. He also placed these species in the new family Troodontidae (since Lambe had not selected a type genus for his Psalisauridae), which he considered closest to the ornithopod dinosaurs. Because the skull seemed so specialized compared to the rather "primitive"-looking skeleton, Nopcsa doubted whether these parts actually belonged together, and suggested the skull belonged to a nodosaur, the skeleton to an ornithopod, and the supposed gastralia (belly ribs) to a fish. This claim was rebutted by Gilmore and Loris S. Russell in the 1930s.
