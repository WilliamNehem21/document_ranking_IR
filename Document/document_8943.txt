At the point when Merwin moved toward becoming supervisor in 1945 he brought changes, however craftsman Earle K. Bergey held the imaginative opportunity he had generally expected given his association with Standard. Some contend that Bergey's spreads turned out to be increasingly practical, and Merwin figured out how to improve the insides of "Alarming" to the point of being a genuine opponent to "Surprising", recognized pioneer of the field. Commentators' conclusions differ on the overall nature of the magazines of this time; Malcolm Edwards respects "Frightening" as second just to "Surprising", yet Ashley considers "Exciting Wonder" to be "Astounding"s nearest challenger in the late 1940s. Merwin's revelations included Jack Vance, whose first story, "The World Thinker", showed up in the Summer 1945 issue. He additionally consistently distributed work by Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore, who composed both under Kuttner's name and as "Keith Hammond": in a four-year term from 1946 to 1949 the composition group of Kuttner and Moore had seven books distributed in "Frightening", for the most part science dream, a subgenre not normal around then. Remarkable books that showed up in the late 1940s incorporate Fredric Brown's "What Mad Universe" and Charles L. Bridle's "Trip Into Yesterday", later distributed in book structure as "The Paradox Men". Arthur C. Clarke's epic "The City and the Stars" first observed print in "Surprising" in condensed structure, in the November 1948 issue, under the title "Against the Fall of Night".
