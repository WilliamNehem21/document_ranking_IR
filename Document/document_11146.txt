In his 2001 index raisonnÃÂ©, Slive ascribes 694 sketches to Ruisdael and records another 163 artistic creations with questionable or, he accepts, off base attribution. There are three principle reasons why there is vulnerability over whose hand painted different Ruisdael-style scenes. Right off the bat, four individuals from the Ruysdael family were landscapists with comparable marks, some of which were later deceitfully adjusted into Jacob's. This is additionally entangled by the way that Ruisdael utilized varieties of his mark. This regularly peruses "JvRuisdael" or the monogram "JVR", at times utilizing a little italic 's' and some of the time a Gothic long 's, for example, on "Scene with Waterfall". Besides, numerous seventeenth century scene works of art are unsigned and could be from understudies or copyists. At long last, fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for monetary benefit, with the most punctual case announced by Houbraken in 1718: a specific Jan Griffier the Elder could copy Ruisdael's style so well that he frequently sold them for genuine Ruisdaels, particularly with dolls included the style of the craftsman Wouwerman. There is no expansive scale efficient way to deal with discovering Ruisdael's attributions, not normal for the legal science used to locate the right attributions of Rembrandt's works of art through the Rembrandt Research Project.
