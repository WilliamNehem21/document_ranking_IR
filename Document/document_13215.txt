The palace site offers normal protections, as steep slants to opposite sides and the coast to a third. The unprotected side toward the east is surrounded by a profound dry canal. The chÃÂ¢teau is worked of nearby lias limestone rubble with Sutton stone and sandstone dressings. The external gatehouse is drawn nearer through present day bulwarks. The gatehouse has a portcullis room above, with a unique chimney of and a wooden portcullis with wooden entryways behind. The main (external) court past is the soonest part of the manor, developed by the de Haweys in the late-twelfth century to supplant a Norman timber stronghold. The latest RCAHMW study, distributed in 2000, recognized "noteworthy remnants" of the most punctual stone stronghold which had been missed by before studies. This revelation empowered a conclusive dating for the main stone-fabricated chÃÂ¢teau to "before 1200". The building history specialist John Newman draws examinations with Newcastle at Bridgend and Coity Castle. To the sides of this passage are a local range and the Brewhouse, the last significant increments made by the Stradlings. The inward divider for the most part endures and has a little unique pinnacle toward the north, and a square gatehouse on the east close to the rectangular Mansell Tower, an extension of the first keep. In an article in "The Archeological Journal", C. P. Spurgeon takes note of the plan similitudes between the pinnacle's door frames and those in the chancel of St Donat's congregation, showing a prior development date than that of the work embraced by Peter de Stradling.
