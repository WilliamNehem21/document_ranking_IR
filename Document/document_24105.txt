The fertilized eggs develop within the female's oviduct. At first, they are enclosed in an egg case while the developing embryos absorb the yolk. After hatching, the pups remain in the oviduct and receive additional nutrition from milky secretions. With no umbilical cord or placenta, the unborn pup relies on buccal pumping to obtain oxygen. Brood size is usually one or occasionally two. The gestation period is thought to be 12â13 months. When fully developed, the pup resembles a miniature adult and is expelled from the oviduct with no further parental care. In wild populations, an interval of two years between births may be normal, but a few individuals become pregnant in consecutive years, demonstrating an annual ovulatory cycle. The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium has had some success in breeding "M. alfredi", with one female giving birth in three successive years. In one of these pregnancies, the gestation period was 372 days and at birth the pup had a width of and weight of . In southern Africa, "M. birostris" males mature at while females reach maturity slightly over that. In Indonesia, "M. birostris" males appear to mature at , while female mature around . In southern Africa, "M. alfredi" matures at widths of for males and for females. In the Maldives, males of "M. alfredi" mature at a width of , while females mature at . In Hawaii, "M. alfredi" matures at a width of for males and for females. Female mantas appear to mature at 8â10 years. Manta rays may live as long as 50 years.
