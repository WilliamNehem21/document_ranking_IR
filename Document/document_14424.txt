As McPherson expressed, "The adventure to a far off objective, the arrival home, and the journey which includes the voyage out, accomplishment, and return are average examples in Black collection of memoirs." For Angelou, this mission took her from her youth and immaturity, as depicted in her initial two books, into the grown-up world. The setting in Angelou's initial two life accounts was constrained to three spots (Arkansas, Missouri, and California), however the "setting tears open" in "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas" to incorporate Europe as she went with her "Porgy and Bess" organization. McPherson saw Angelou's third personal history as "a bright voyage through Angelou's twenties", from early years set apart by dissatisfactions and mortification, into the more extensive worldÃ¢ÂÂto the white world and to the universal network. This period portrayed "long periods of happiness", just as the beginning of Angelou's extraordinary achievement and satisfaction as a performer. Lupton expressed that Angelou's movement story in "Singin' and Swingin'," which took up around 40 percent of the book, gave the book its sorted out structure. Angelou's perceptions about race, sexual orientation, and class made the book in excess of a basic travel account. As a Black American, her movements around the globe place her in contact with numerous nationalities and classes, extended her encounters past her well-known hover of network and family, and confused her understandings of race relations.
