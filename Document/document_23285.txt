Maintaining peak intensity for about 18Â hours, Dog began a weakening trend as it made a sharp turn to the west. It accelerated to the north on SeptemberÂ 10, and two days later Dog passed within of Cape Cod. Newspapers attributed heavy rainfall in the Mid-Atlantic statesâwhich resulted in five deathsâto the hurricane. Further north, the hurricane killed 12Â people in New England, and produced a total of $2Â million (1950Â USD, $ Â USD) of property damage. Twelve others died in two shipwrecks off the coast of Canada. The hurricane later became a strong extratropical cyclone, maintaining hurricane-force winds while passing south of Nova Scotia and eventually hitting Scotland with hurricane-force gusts on SeptemberÂ 18.
Hurricane Easy developed on SeptemberÂ 1 from a trough in the western Caribbean, which persisted after Hurricane Baker moved through the region in late August. Moving northeastward, the hurricane crossed Cuba on SeptemberÂ 3 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. Easy turned to the northwest and strengthened to its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane. At the time, Easy was located just off the west coast of Florida; however, a ridge to its north caused the hurricane to stall, execute a small loop, and make landfall near Cedar Key. Following the landfall, Easy moved offshore, turned to the southeast, and made a second landfall near Hernando Beach on SeptemberÂ 6. The hurricane turned northwestward over the Florida Peninsula, and gradually weakened as it moved into Georgia and the southeastern United States. On SeptemberÂ 9, Easy dissipated over northeastern Arkansas.
