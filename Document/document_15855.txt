By the end of 2009, "xx" had appeared on several critics' lists of the year's best albums. It was ranked 21st by "The Wire", ninth by "Rolling Stone", sixth by "Uncut", third by "Pitchfork", second by "NME", and fourth by "Chicago Tribune" critic Greg Kot. "The Guardian" named it the year's best record in their annual critics poll and Tim Jonze, the newspaper's editor, hailed it as not only "the sound of 2009, [but also] a distinctive musical statement of the like we may never get to hear again". It also finished seventh in "The Village Voice"s Pazz & Jop poll of American critics and third in HMV's Poll of Polls, an annual list compiled by British music retailer HMV and collated from best-album nominations made by journalists in the English and Irish music press. In decade-end lists of the greatest records from the 2000s, "The Sunday Times" and its sister paper, "The Times", ranked "xx" seventy-seventh and thirtieth, respectively. The record was also included in the 2010 edition of Robert Dimery's music reference book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die". In September of that year, "xx" won the Mercury Prize, an annual award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland. Before the nominations shortlist had been announced, bookmakers and critics considered the xx as favorites and predicted they would win over the more high-profile artists Corinne Bailey Rae, Paul Weller, and Dizzee Rascal. McCormick, one of the critics who predicted its victory, explained that it "seemed the record that most represented Britain" with its charmingly intimate style and unique take on modern pop tastes.
