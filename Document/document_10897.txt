As the most seasoned structure on the Georgia Tech grounds, Tech Tower has amassed various fringe landmarks and locales of enthusiasm throughout the years. Two walkways circle the structure, including the Tower Walk, given by the Class of 1950 out of 2000. Georgia Tech's five star dedication, a marble water fountain, was given in 1911 by the Class of 1903 and is arranged east of Tech Tower's fundamental passageway. Additionally close to the principle access to Tech Tower is a marbled pair of seats given by the Class of 1925 in memory of the individuals who kicked the bucket in World War I. A couple of feet away stands a marbled seat dedication to Paul Howes Norcross, a 1902 Georgia Tech graduate and previous ASCE president who died in the "Norman" watercraft debacle of May 8, 1925. The gravestone of Sideways the puppy is situated close Tech Tower's back passage, similar to an instructive notice specifying Tech Tower's initial history, given by the Class of 1932. A staircase given by the ANAK Society in 1921 interfaces Tech Tower to the adjoining D. P. Academic Building by means of a ceaseless walkway. At long last, a steam-driven air blower, casually known as the "steam motor," sits conspicuously at the highest point of the slope close Tech Tower as a notice of the school's modern roots.
