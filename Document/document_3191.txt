The winged animal's head and chest area regularly differ between pale dark colored and some shade of dim (particularly on the brow and back) in many subspecies. Some are cleaner, more extravagant darker rather, and all have fine high contrast dots aside from on the remiges and rectrices (fundamental wing and tail quills), which are light dark colored with darker groups. The heart-molded face is normally splendid white, yet in some subspecies it is dark colored. The left ear is somewhat over the eyes on the vertical plane, while the correct ear is marginally beneath the eyes. The introduction of the ear coverts in connection to the face additionally varies between the ears, with a distinction of about 15ÃÂ°. The underparts, including the tarsometatarsal (lower leg) quills, change from white to ruddy buff among the subspecies, and are either for the most part unpatterned or bear a differing number of small blackish-darker spots. It has been discovered that at any rate in the mainland European populaces, females with more spotting are more advantageous than plainer winged creatures. This does not remain constant for European guys paradoxically, where the spotting changes as indicated by subspecies. The snout shifts from pale horn to dull buff, relating to the general plumage shade, and the iris is blackish darker. The feet, similar to the snout, shift in shading, going from pink to dim pinkish-dark and the claws are dark.
