At the point when Armstrong connected at a neighborhood Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop in the late 1950s, he gave his religious alliance as "deist". His mom later said that Armstrong's religious perspectives caused her misery and trouble in later life, as she was increasingly religious. In the mid 1980s, Armstrong was the subject of a trick saying that he changed over to Islam in the wake of hearing the "adhan", the Muslim call to supplication, while strolling on the Moon. The Indonesian vocalist Suhaemi composed a tune called "Gema Suara Adzan di Bulan" ("The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon"), depicting Armstrong's change; the melody was examined broadly in Jakarta news outlets in 1983. Comparative trick stories were found in Egypt and Malaysia. In March 1983, the State Department reacted by issuing a message to government offices and offices in Muslim nations saying that Armstrong "has not changed over to Islam". The lie surfaced once in a while for the following three decades. Some portion of the disarray emerged from the comparability between the names of Armstrong's American living arrangement in Lebanon, Ohio, and the nation of Lebanon, which has a lion's share Muslim populace.
