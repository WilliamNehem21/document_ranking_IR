Among workmanship students of history and commentators, Ruisdael's notoriety has had its good and bad times throughout the hundreds of years. The principal account, in 1718, is from Houbraken, who waxed expressive over the specialized dominance which permitted Ruisdael to reasonably delineate falling water and the ocean. In 1781, Sir Joshua Reynolds, organizer of the Royal Academy, respected the freshness and power of Ruisdael's scenes. After several decades other English faultfinders were less awed. In 1801, Henry Fuseli, educator at the Royal Academy, communicated his hatred for the whole Dutch School of Landscape, rejecting it as close to a "transcript of the recognize", an insignificant "specification of slope and dale, bunches of trees". Of note is that one of Fuseli's understudies was Constable, whose profound respect for Ruisdael stayed unaltered. Around a similar time in Germany, the essayist, statesman and researcher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe commended Ruisdael as a reasoning craftsman, even a writer, saying "he exhibits astounding ability in finding the accurate time when the imaginative staff comes into contact with a clear personality". John Ruskin be that as it may, in 1860, seethed against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists, calling their scenes places where "we lose all confidence in religion as well as all recognition of it". In 1915, the Dutch workmanship student of history Abraham Bredius called his comrade less a painter but rather more an artist.
