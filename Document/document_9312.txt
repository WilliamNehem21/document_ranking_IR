The content had two noteworthy jobs: rulers in a kingdom, the senior of whom was the legend and the more youthful the lowlife. M. K. Radha was offered the piece of Sasankan, the more youthful ruler. Since he was then known for brave jobs, Radha was reluctant to play a reprobate and rather consented to play the more seasoned ruler, Veerasimhan. His better half Gnanambal induced Vasan to cast Radha in the job. K. J. Mahadevan (an individual from Gemini's story office) was picked to play Sasankan, and T. G. Raghavachari consented to coordinate the film. Albeit some recording of Mahadevan was taped, his execution was considered "excessively delicate" and he was supplanted; be that as it may, he stayed on the task as a scriptwriter and an associate chief. At the point when Raghavachari proposed Ranjan as Sasankan, Vasan was hesitant; in spite of the fact that the maker at first considered the performing artist too womanly to even think about playing a "steel-hard reprobate", Vasan in the end yielded. Ranjan had focused on B. N. Rao's "Saalivaahanan" (1945), however Kittoo induced him to test for "Chandralekha" and Rao gave the performing artist a couple of days off. The screen test was fruitful, and Ranjan was thrown.
