Yoshizawa set more noteworthy accentuation on the story, in contrast to the arcade form, and composed and planned a plot that included more than 20 minutes of artistic cutscenesÃ¢ÂÂthe first run through a NES amusement contained such groupings. Tecmo called the cutscene framework "Tecmo Theater" where the amusement uncovers the storyline between Acts using enlivened arrangements. They are utilized toward the start of each Act to present new characters, for example, Irene Lew, Walter Smith, and the Jaquio. This component utilizes systems, for example, close-ups, substitute camera edges, varying mood melodies, and audio effects to make the amusement increasingly agreeable for players. Not at all like prior titles, for example, "Last Fantasy", the cutscenes comprised of expansive anime craftsmanship on the top portion of the screen with discourse on the base half. This made the masterful style progressively reminiscent of other manga titles, for example, "LupinÃÂ III" and "GolgoÃÂ 13". Dimitri Criona, Tecmo USA's chief of offers and advertising, said that comfort recreations had preference over arcade diversions in that they permitted the making of a more drawn out amusement and the incorporation of cutscenes, which Tecmo trademarked as "film screens". He noted support amusements required an alternate reward structure than arcade recreations. The amusement contains a component that was initially a glitch yet was left in the last diversion deliberately, as per Masato Kato; having lost to any of the diversion's last three managers, the player is sent back to the start of the 6th demonstration.
