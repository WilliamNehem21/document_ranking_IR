"bill". In like manner, German naturalist Johannes Gistel proposed the name "Timeta" to supplant "Leptorhynchus" in 1848. John Gould had depicted the grouped stilt as "Himantopus palmatus" in 1837, yet recorded it as "Cladorhynchus pectoralis" in his 1865 work "Handbook to the Birds of Australia". Gould likewise composed that its circulation was vague after it was first recorded at Rottnest Island however not somewhere else in Western Australia, and later in South Australia, until huge numbers were seen by the British wayfarer Charles Sturt at Lepson's Lake north of Cooper Creek in what is presently western Queensland. German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach put it in another variety, naming it "Xiphidiorhynchus pectoralis" in 1845. Australian ornithologist Fred Lawson gave it the name "Cladorhynchus australis" in 1904. Gregory Mathews in his 1913 "Rundown of the Birds of Australia" synonymised every single resulting genu and species names, utilizing "Cladorhynchus australis". He recorded his subspecies "rottnesti" from 1913, however this has not been perceived since. Both Joseph G. Strauch in a recent report and Philip C. Chu in a 1995 re-examination of bone and muscle characters found that the joined stilt was sister taxon to the avocets, with the stilts of the class "Himantopus" a prior branch. A recent report consolidating hereditary qualities and morphology fortified its situation as sister to the avocet ancestry.
