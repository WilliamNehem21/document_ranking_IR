Baen's successors, Pierce, Stine, and Kemske, were unfit to keep up his standard. Pohl stayed faithful to the magazine, yet the serialization of his novel "Jem" exemplified "World" developing issues. Because of the magazine's undeniably sporadic calendar, the serialization extended from the last issue of 1978 into 1980, well after it had showed up in book structure. In November 1977, Paul Walker assumed control over the book section from Spider Robinson, and Jerry Pournelle left the science segment toward the finish of 1978. The work of art quality dropped to an awkward dimension, and regardless of the presence of a couple of effective stories and books, for example, C. J. Cherryh's "The Faded Sun: Kesrith", the general quality was drastically more terrible than it had been under Baen. "Cosmic system" decay was to a great extent because of the monetary inconveniences of the distributer, Arnold Abramson, who diminished the compensation rate (during an era of high expansion) to a penny a word. Indeed, even that low rate did not ensure convenient dispensing, and numerous authors quit submitting on account of "Universe" notoriety for paying gradually, if by any means. Expenses were expanding for paper, postage, and creation, and the soft cover treasury advertise was blasting, adding to the challenge that "Cosmic system" confronted. Floyd Kemske's solitary issue never gotten newspaper kiosk appropriation, destined by the money related inconveniences of the magazine's distributer, Vincent McCaffrey.
