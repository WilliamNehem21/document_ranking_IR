The ground-level passage territory to the Second World War dedication is on the southern side of the indented greenery enclosure and comprises of two arches flanking a low divider that faces the First World War remembrance. Incorporated with the low divider is a stone like Lutyens' Stone of Remembrance, which is recorded with the long periods of the war (1939Ã¢ÂÂ 1945) and conveys the commemoration's devotion: . Every one of the flanking arches bolsters an over-life-sized statue, speaking to a Merchant Navy mariner (on the east side) and officer (on the west). The passageway steps either side of the arches slip to the indented greenery enclosure that contains the name boards. The dividers of the greenery enclosure are high in Portland stone, to coordinate the first commemoration, with the names of the missing from the Second World War recorded on 132 bronze boards fixed to the dividers. The name boards circle the whole depressed patio nursery, lining both the northern and southern dividers, and the eastern and western dividers. Divided at normal interims along the semi-roundabout (northern) some portion of the dedication are seven symbolic models speaking to the Seven Seas. These are crafted by Charles Wheeler, who additionally executed the models for Maufe's augmentations of the Royal Navy commemorations. The greenery enclosure is fundamentally grass, with a figure of a compass in a 'pool' of bronze, set to attractive north, in the middle. The Red Ensign (the banner flown by British-enlisted non military personnel vessels) flies over the site.
