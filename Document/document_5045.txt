As indicated by the "Somewhat English Saxon Chronicle", ÃÂthelberht ruled "in great concordance and in extraordinary harmony" and "in harmony, love and respect". He seems to have been on great terms with his more youthful siblings and in a contract of 861 (S 330) he conceded land to St Augustine's, Canterbury as an end-result of the abbot's proceeding with faithfulness to him, ÃÂthelred and Alfred. A few history specialists trust that the three siblings concurred that each would prevail to the honored position thusly. In two sanctions in 862 and 863 (S 335 and S 336) ÃÂthelred makes allows as lord of the West Saxons and ÃÂthelberht isn't referenced. In Keynes' view, ÃÂthelberht may have assigned some power in Wessex, maybe in his own nonattendance. Be that as it may, a contract of ÃÂthelberht dated December 863 (S 333) is validated by ÃÂthelred and Alfred as "filius regis" (ruler's child). ÃÂthelberht allowed resistance from illustrious and legal administrations to Sherborne church to pay tribute to the spirits of his dad ÃÂthelwulf and his sibling ÃÂthelbald. In contrast to most sanctions, which were in Latin, this one is in Old English, and students of history differ whether this mirrors a pattern towards more noteworthy utilization of the vernacular as more qualified to recording authoritative archives or backing for Alfred's later case that learning of Latin had declined tragically when he went to the royal position in 871.
