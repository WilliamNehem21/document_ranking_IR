Angelou continued to expand the settings of her autobiographies in her subsequent volumes. "The Heart of a Woman" had three primary settingsâthe San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Egyptâand two secondary onesâLondon and Accra. Lupton stated that like all of Angelou's books, the structure of "The Heart of a Woman" was based upon a journey. Angelou emphasized the theme of movement by opening the book with a spiritual ("The ole ark's a moverin'"), stating, "That ancient spiritual could have been the theme song of the United States in 1957". This spiritual, which contained a reference to Noah's ark, presented Angelou as a type of Noah and demonstrated her spirituality. Angelou also mentioned Allen Ginsberg and "On the Road", the 1951 novel by Jack Kerouac, thus connecting her own journey and uncertainty about the future with the journeys of literary figures. Even though the reason Angelou traveled to Africa is an eventual failed relationship, she made a connection with the continent, both in this book and in the one that follows it, "All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes". As Lupton stated, "Africa is the site of her growth". Angelou's time in Africa made her more aware of her African roots. Lupton insisted, however, that although Angelou journeys to many places in the book, the most important journey she described is "a voyage into the self".
