Pete Schulberg of "The Oregonian" expressed, "Overlook all the upheaval about "NYPD Blue". "Murder" conveys without the licentious language and skin shots. It delineates savagery in a most convincing manner: You don't see it. You simply feel it." Bob Wisehart of "The Sacramento Bee" stated, "most importantly while "NYPD Blue" is a fine show Ã¢ÂÂ it was on my 10-best rundown for 1993 Ã¢ÂÂ "Manslaughter" is better. There's been in no way like it since the prime of "Slope Street Blues"." Elaine Liner, TV pundit with the "Corpus Christi Caller-Times", who called "Crime" "as compensating an hour of genuine, quality TV as you could request", lauded it for featuring quality composing as opposed to tricks like the bareness from "NYPD Blue", and commended it for fleshing out the criminologists and exploited people, however the suspects as well, as in "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of "The Boston Globe" stated, "If [the nudity] is the thing that it took to get you to watch "NYPD Blue" and you chose to remain in light of the fact that it was grittier, better composed, coordinated and acted than some other dramatization on TV, be exhorted that "Murder" is so far better than "NYPD Blue" in every one of those classifications that in case you're not [watching it], you're feeling the loss of the greatest hour of verbose TV since "Slope Street Blues" and "St. Somewhere else" left the air."
