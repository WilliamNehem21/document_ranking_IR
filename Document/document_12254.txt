In 1917, Kenyatta moved to Narok, where he was engaged with transporting domesticated animals to Nairobi, before migrating to Nairobi to work in a store selling cultivating and designing gear. In the nighttimes, he took classes in a congregation mission school. A while later he came back to Thika before getting business building houses for the Thogota Mission. He additionally lived for a period in Dagoretti, where he turned into a retainer for a nearby sub-boss, Kioi; in 1919 he helped Kioi in putting the last's case in a land debate under the watchful eye of a Nairobi court. Wanting a spouse, Kenyatta entered an association with Grace Wahu, who had gone to the CMS School in Kabete; she at first moved into Kenyatta's family residence, despite the fact that she joined Kenyatta in Dagoretti when Ngengi drove her out. On 20 November 1920 she brought forth Kenyatta's child, Peter Muigui. In October 1920, Kenyatta was called before the Thogota Kirk Session and suspended from taking Holy Communion; the suspension was because of his drinking and his relations with Wahu without any father present. The congregation demanded that a conventional Kikuyu wedding would be deficient, and that he should experience a Christian marriage; this occurred on 8 November 1922. Kenyatta had at first wouldn't stop drinking, yet in July 1923 formally denied liquor and was permitted to come back to Holy Communion.
