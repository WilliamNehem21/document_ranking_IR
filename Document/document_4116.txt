On the "Palamecia", different individuals from the gathering rejoin with Vanille and Sazh before they go up against Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in camouflage. Barthandelus tells the gathering that their Focus is to change into the brute Ragnarok and kill the resting fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon above water above Pulse. Killing Orphan will result in the devastation of Cocoon. The gathering escapes and gains from Cid that the fal'Cie trust that Cocoon's demolition will bring the Maker, the maker of the universes. The fal'Cie can't hurt Orphan themselves. Vanille and Fang uncover to the gathering that they were engaged with the War of Transgression hundreds of years sooner, and that their Focus at that point had been the equivalent: to change into Ragnarok and endeavor to demolish Orphan. The gathering takes off to Pulse and voyages to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's main residence, where they would like to figure out how to expel their l'Cie marks. The town is left, and they locate no living individuals superficially. The gathering is fruitless in evacuating their imprints, and Barthandelus goes up against them once more. The gathering discovers that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to make disorder in Cocoon to constrain the Cavalry to assault Cid and Orphan in a rebellion.
