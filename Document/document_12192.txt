In 1881, Alphonse Milne-Edwards depicted two new species in the variety "Triaenops" based on examples as far as anyone knows gathered by LÃÂ©on Humblot on Madagascar: the rosy "Triaenops rufus" and the bigger, dark "T. humbloti". Jean Dorst, who audited Madagascan "Triaenops" in 1947, held both as isolated species; in another survey, distributed in 1982, John Edwards Hill thought about the two to speak to similar species. In 1994, Karl Koopman considered "rufus" itself to be a piece of the Middle Eastern and terrain African species "Triaenops persicus", a probability Hill had examined, however most creators viewed the two as particular species. In 2006, Julie Ranivo and Steven Goodman overhauled Madagascan "Triaenops" and discovered little variety among examples of "T.ÃÂ rufus" from all through the dry pieces of the island. After three years, they distributed another paper which demonstrated that the first material of "T.ÃÂ rufus" and "T.ÃÂ humbloti" was unmistakable from Madagascan examples recognized as ""Triaenops rufus"" and progressively like "T.ÃÂ persicus". On his voyage to Madagascar, Humblot had remained in Somalia and Yemen, and Goodman and Ranivo inferred that he had most likely gathered the "Triaenops" there, after which their provenance was mistakenly recorded. In this manner, "rufus" and "humbloti" can't be utilized for the Madagascan species, and Goodman and Ranivo proposed the new name "Triaenops menamena" for the species previously known as "T.ÃÂ rufus". The particular name "menamena" is Malagasy for "rosy", alluding to the creature's shading. "Rufous trident bat" has been utilized as a typical name for "Triaenops rufus".
