On 10 June, the "Famous" and the escort bearer put to ocean to mimic another airstrike on Sabang as a methods for diverting the Japanese while the Americans were assaulting landing strips in the Mariana Islands and getting ready to attack the island of Saipan. For the arranged assault on Port Blair in the Andaman Islands in mid-June her air amass was strengthened by the 14 Corsairs of 1837 Squadron; six Barracudas from No. 21 TBR Wing were arrived to prepare for the extra contenders. On 21 June, the ship propelled 15 Barracudas and 23 Corsairs against the runway and harbor of Port Blair. Two of the Barracudas were compelled to come back with motor inconvenience before the assault started and another was shot down over the objective.

Awful climate corrupted the exactness of the Barracudas and little harm was perpetrated beside a couple of flying machine obliterated on the ground and a couple of little art soaked in the harbor. With more than 50 air ship airborne at a certain point, the British understood that a solitary deck mishap may result in the loss of each flying machine noticeable all around on the grounds that there was no other bearer accessible to arrive on board.
