In 1999, Turner Entertainment (the film's present rights holder) chose to reproduce, as intently as would be prudent, the first form by joining the current film with more than 650 still photos of the lost scenes (huge numbers of which had been utilized in Weinberg's book), as per a unique progression layout composed by von Stroheim. All materials were given by the Margaret Herrick Library. This reclamation runs just about four hours. It was created by film preservationist Rick Schmidlin and altered by Glenn Morgan. Schmidlin reestablished numerous characters and sub-plots from the first form. Another melodic score was made by Robert Israel. The recreation cost $100,000 to deliver. Schmidlin called the completed item "a recreation of Von Stroheim's lost account." It debuted at the 1999 Telluride Film Festival and was later screened at the Venice Film Festival and the Pordenone Silent Film Festival before being circulated on Turner Classic Movies on December 5, 1999. Film faultfinder Todd McCarthy called the reestablished rendition of "Ravenousness" a triumph. Roger Ebert called "Eagerness" a magnum opus and said that the reestablished Schmidlin cut outlines the "pretentious sensibilities [that] went into MGM's slash work." Rosenbaum lauded the undertaking, yet guaranteed it must be considered a "contemplate adaptation". The reproduction won an uncommon reference from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards.
