The French propelled protect touched base in Ostrach on 8Ã¢ÂÂ 9 March, and throughout the following week skirmished with the Austrian forward posts, while the remainder of the French armed force arrived. Jourdan arranged his 25,000 troops along a line from Salem Abbey and Lake Constance to the Danube stream, focused in Ostrach. He built up his order base camp at the majestic city of Pfullendorf, ignoring the whole Ostrach valley. Jourdan was expecting Dominique Vandamme's troops to touch base so as to help his far north flank close to the stream, yet Vandamme had gone to Stuttgart to research a supposed nearness of Austrian troops there and had not rejoined the fundamental armed force. Subsequently, the French left flank, under order of Gouvion Saint-Cyr, was meagerly kept an eye on. Jourdan thought he had additional time, expecting Charles would require still three or four days to move his troops over the Lech, and walk to Ostrach, however by the center of Holy Week in 1799, in excess of 33% of Charles' military, 48,000 blended troops, was situated in a development parallel to Jourdan's, and his 72,000 outstanding troops were displayed with the left wing at Kempten, the inside close Memmingen, and the correct flank reached out to Ulm.
