USÂ 113Â Business begins at an intersection with USÂ 113 (Worcester Highway) south of Snow Hill. The business route heads northeast as two-lane Market Street into the town limits and to the downtown area. USÂ 113Â Business passes near the neoclassical home Chanceford and by the Julia A. Purnell Museum, which displays the history and memorability of Snow Hill, including the namesake's needlework. The route passes the Georgian-style Samuel Gunn House and All Hallows Episcopal Church, an example of 18th-century church vernacular architecture, on either side of its junction with MDÂ 12 (Church Street). MDÂ 12 joins USÂ 113Â Business for a short concurrency through downtown Snow Hill, during which the two highways pass the Worcester County Courthouse and Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church, an Isaac Pursellâdesigned High Victorian Gothic church honoring Francis Makemie, the founder of Presbyterianism in the United States. After MDÂ 12 turns north onto Washington Street, the business route passes the Gothic Revivalâstyle George Washington Purnell House and meets the west end of MDÂ 365 (Bay Street) at the east end of downtown Snow Hill. USÂ 113Â Business crosses Purnell Branch, a tributary of the Pocomoke River, and leaves the town limits of Snow Hill just west of its northern terminus at USÂ 113.
