Amid the evening of MayÃÂ 19 there were further dialogs at RodrÃÂ­guez PeÃÂ±a's home. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the gathering, which included military and regular citizen pioneers. They organized that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan JosÃÂ© de Lezica, the senior alcalde (metropolitan officer), while Castelli would meet with the procurator JuliÃÂ¡n de Leiva, to request their help. They requested that the Viceroy permit an open cabildo, and said that in the event that it was not uninhibitedly allowed the general population and the criollo troops would walk to the Plaza, constrain the Viceroy to leave by any and all conceivable means, and supplant him with a loyalist government. Saavedra remarked to Lezica that he was associated with double-crossing in light of his consistent solicitations for wary and estimated steps. This remark was intended to weight Lezica into accelerating the lawful framework to enable the general population to communicate, or generally chance a noteworthy insubordination. Lezica requested persistence and time to influence the Viceroy, and leave a gigantic exhibition if all else fails. He contended that if the Viceroy was removed in that way, it would comprise an insubordination, which would transform the progressives into bandits. Manuel Belgrano gave the next Monday as the due date to affirm the open cabildo before making direct move. Leiva would later go about as a go between, being both a friend of Cisneros and a confided in mediator for the more moderate progressives.
