"Sisters on the most fundamental level" got the Governors Award at the 23rd Primetime Emmy Awards service in 1971. Montgomery's biographer Herbie Pilato composed that the topic of defeating preference is fundamental to "Beguiled" due to the noticeable quality of the marriage between a witch and a human, and that "no scene of the arrangement more obviously spoken to this cry against bias than the occasion story, 'Sisters on a fundamental level.'" A commentator from the Australian paper the "Every day Liberal" composed that "Sisters on the most fundamental level" is "exceptionally insightful" and contended that it is the sole scene of the arrangement that isn't just a "lightweight offering" intelligent of "the United States' post-war society of new commercialization and promoting." When the seventh period of "Entranced" was discharged on DVD in 2009, DVD Talk analyst Paul Mavis composed that "Sisters on a basic level" has a more plain message than some other scene of the period. He commended the on-screen characters' exhibitions in the scene and composed that, due to the scene's self-evident yet-compelling scrutinize of bigotry, "what's exceedingly unexpected about "Sisters on a fundamental level" today is that it would probably be named politically mistaken and 'coldhearted' by some on the grounds that the cast don blackface at a certain point."
