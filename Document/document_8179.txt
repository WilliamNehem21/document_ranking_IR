The Byzantine naval force, similar to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire itself, was a continuation of the Roman Empire and its foundations. After the Battle of Actium in 31ÃÂ BC, without any outer risk in the Mediterranean, the Roman naval force performed for the most part policing and escort obligations. Gigantic ocean fights, similar to those battled in the Punic Wars, never again happened, and the Roman armadas were made out of moderately little vessels, most appropriate to their new assignments. By the mid fourth century, the changeless Roman armadas had dwindled, with the goal that when the armadas of the adversary rulers Constantine the Great and Licinius conflicted in 324ÃÂ AD, they were made, all things considered, of recently manufactured or laid hold of boats from the port urban areas of the Eastern Mediterranean. The common wars of the fourth and mid fifth hundreds of years, notwithstanding, spurred a recovery of maritime movement, with armadas for the most part utilized to transport armed forces. Impressive maritime powers kept on being utilized in the Western Mediterranean all through the main quarter of the fifth century, particularly from North Africa, however Rome's dominance of the Mediterranean was tested when Africa was invade by the Vandals over a time of fifteen years.
