Alexander F. Reichert was delegated by the Supreme Court to contend the case for Lara. Reichert contended that an Indian clan had no intrinsic sway with respect to non-part Indians, however just the power that Congress chose to give the clan, refering to "Duro", "Wheeler", and "Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe" to help his contention. He expressed that it was the spot of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to decide the inalienable sway of the clan. Lara contended that since the clan had no such intrinsic sway, it could just indict a non-part Indian dependent on government power, which would make a consequent Federal arraignment an infringement of the preclusion of twofold peril. It was noticed that individuals from Indian clans were in the meantime United States natives, and ensured under the constitution in a similar way as some other resident. Reichert expressed that "Duro" was chosen as an established issue, not as an issue of custom-based law, and it was the Court's place to decide the issue, not the spot of Congress. To subject Lara to an arraignment by an inborn court, which was not expose to the Bill of Rights, would deny Lara of his rights as a United States resident. Lara's position was upheld by "amicus curiae" briefs documented by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (alongside a few different areas), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (singular Indians).
