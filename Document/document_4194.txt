Pusey, the powerful "high church" Anglican scholar related with the Oxford Movement, composed a letter of help to MÃÂ¼ller, replicated in "The Times". In his view, Boden's expectations would be best cutting-edge by choosing MÃÂ¼ller. Ministers couldn't win changes over without knowing the subtleties of the religion of those with whom they were managing, he composed, and MÃÂ¼ller's productions were "the best endowments which have yet been offered" on those in such work. He included that Oxford would pick up by choosing him to a position where MÃÂ¼ller could invest all his energy in work "of such essential and enduring significance for the transformation of India." Beckerlegge discovers Pusey's help important, since Pusey would not have concurred with MÃÂ¼ller's specific "wide" way to deal with Christianity, and was along these lines giving a judgment on the scholastic capacities of the applicant best put to propel teacher work in India. One mysterious essayist of a letter to the press in help of MÃÂ¼ller, in a matter of seconds before the race, communicated it in this way: "A man's close to home character must stand exceptionally high, and his religious conclusions can manage the cost of however little ground for animadversion on either hand, when he joins as his unhesitating supporters Dr. Pusey and Dr. Macbride"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a reference to John Macbride, portrayed in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" as "a significantly religious layman of the 'old' zealous school". Be that as it may, Dowling depicts MÃÂ¼ller as "impercipient of the unpretentious touches of philosophical contention, the fine shadings and compunctions of Victorian religious feeling"ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ a shortcoming that was held against him.
