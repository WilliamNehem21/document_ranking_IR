In his book, "The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond", Ed Morales composed that Miguel's joint effort with Manzanero "conveyed light to a neglected ace of [bolero]" and "was a noteworthy update of the class". "Sentiment" improved Silvetti's notoriety for being an arranger and maker; as indicated by Leila Cobo of "Board", the collection "completely re-imagined the translations of conventional boleros" and "started a downpour of work for Silvetti, incorporating records with Vic Damone and Engelbert Humperdinck". His game plans wound up known as the "Silvetti Sound", which Cobo portrayed as "tied down in clearing songs, rich string courses of action, acoustic instrumentation, or more all, audacious sentimentalism". "Romance"s achievement supported Linda Ronstadt, JosÃÂ© Luis RodrÃÂ­guez and PlÃÂ¡cido Domingo to record current adaptations of customary boleros. As indicated by Miguel's previous administrator Mauricio Abaroa, in spite of the fact that boleros were as yet recorded by customary artists at the time, "what made Luis Miguel so fruitful was that it was a young fellow singing them and that he sang them like present day ditties". Amid the "Bulletin" Hot Latin Songs Chart's 25th commemoration in 2011, Miguel was number one on the Hot Latin Songs Top Artists graph. Manzanero thought about their association, saying that he "put in the mouths of his age the majority of the incredible sentimental melodies that had a 30-year history". In 2015, "Announcement" recorded "Sentiment" as one of the Essential Latin Albums of Past 50 Years, a proofreader expresses: "What's turned out to be so predictable in Latin music nowadays - the tribute collection by a contemporary craftsman regarding a virtuoso of another period - began with "Sentiment"".
