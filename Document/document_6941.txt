With not exactly a large portion of a quarter remaining and somewhere around three scores, Virginia Tech had an about outlandish shortfall to survive. The Hokies handled the kickoff for a touchback, and the Tech offense started at its 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first and second plays of the drive, Vick was sacked for misfortunes. The third play was a fragmented pass, and the Hokies were compelled to punt. In the wake of handling the kick at their 38-yard line, Florida State started running out the clock by running the ball. Subsequent to neglecting to pick up a first down on two back to back surges and an inadequate pass, Florida State punted. The ball folded into the end zone, and Tech's offense started again at its 20-yard line. Vick tossed for short yardage, at that point Kendrick kept running for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Vick finished a 23-yard initially down go to Emmet Johnson, and the Hokies entered Florida State an area with the clock ticking relentlessly down. On the primary play in Seminoles' region, Vick finished another 23-yard pass, this opportunity to Davis, who got a first down at the Florida State 23-yard line. On account of a holding punishment against the Seminoles, Tech was allowed a first down at the State eight-yard line. Vick tossed a fragmented pass, kept running for three yards, and after that tossed another go to a player who was held back before the objective line. Confronting fourth down and requiring only two yards for a touchdown, Tech endeavored to go for the touchdown, yet Vick was sacked and turned the ball over on downs with 1:12 remaining. With no time remaining, Florida State kept running down the clock and earned the 46Ã¢ÂÂ 29 triumph.
