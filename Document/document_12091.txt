The creation organization set up by Olivier took a rent on the St James' Theater. In January 1950 he delivered, coordinated and featured in Christopher Fry's section play "Venus Observed". The generation was prominent, in spite of poor audits, yet the costly creation did little to help the funds of Laurence Olivier Productions. After a progression of film industry disappointments, the organization adjusted its books in 1951 with creations of Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra" and Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" which the Oliviers played in London and after that took to Broadway. Olivier was thought by certain faultfinders to be under standard in the two his jobs, and some associated him with playing intentionally beneath his typical quality so Leigh may show up his equivalent. Olivier rejected the proposal, seeing it as an affront to his trustworthiness as an on-screen character. In the perspective on the pundit and biographer W.ÃÂ A. Darlington, he was basically miscast both as Caesar and Antony, finding the previous exhausting and the last powerless. Darlington remarks, "Olivier, in his center forties when he ought to have been showing his forces at their very pinnacle, appeared to have lost enthusiasm for his own acting". Throughout the following four years Olivier invested quite a bit of his energy filling in as a maker, introducing plays instead of coordinating or acting in them. His introductions at the St James' incorporated seasons by Ruggero Ruggeri's organization giving two Pirandello plays in Italian, trailed by a visit from the ComÃÂ©die-FranÃÂ§aise playing works by MoliÃÂ¨re, Racine, Marivaux and Musset in French. Darlington considers a 1951 generation of "Othello" featuring Orson Welles as the pick of Olivier's creations at the theater.
