"The Dawn of Love" (under its unique title of "Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love") was displayed in 1829 at the Birmingham Society of Arts, yet other than that its history amid Etty's lifetime isn't recorded. No record of its unique deal exists, and it was not among the 133 artistic creations incorporated into the real review presentation of Etty's works at the Royal Society of Arts in 1849. It is realized that in 1835 it was in the accumulation of material business person Joseph Strutt, yet it was not among the works of art sold on his passing in 1844. In June 1889 it was purchased from an obscure purchaser for an obscure total by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has stayed in the gathering of the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum in Bournemouth from that point forward. It was appeared at a 1899 show of works from Russell-Cotes' gathering at the Glasgow Corporation Gallery. This show caused some debate attributable to its alleged indecent nature; in 1894 various as far as anyone knows foul prints of works by real craftsmen had been expelled from a Glasgow shop by police and officers, and it was felt unseemly for an openly financed instructive body to show a work of equivalent profanity. A few illuminators of the craftsmanship world, for example, Frederic Leighton mediated, and the display proceeded. "The Dawn of Love" was additionally shown at a 1955 Arts Council presentation, and was one of the works displayed in a noteworthy review of Etty's works at the York Art Gallery in 2011Ã¢ÂÂ 12.
