Being a cimolodont, "Catopsbaatar" did not have I1 incisors. The I2 upper-front incisors of "Catopsbaatar" were very robust and had a sharply limited band of enamel. The two incisors converged slightly towards the middle, touching each other. The smaller I3 incisor behind was cone-shaped. The alveolus (tooth socket) of "Catopsbaatar"'s I3 incisor was formed by the premaxilla, rather than the premaxilla and maxilla (unlike in "Tombaatar"). The front upper premolars P1 and P3 were only present in juveniles (deciduous), disappearing (with their alveoli) in older individuals. P1 appears to have had two cusps, was single-rooted, and had a cone-like, blunt crown. P3 was single-rooted and smaller than P1. The cusp formula of the P4 premolar was 5â4:1, the central cusp being the largest. The P4 of "Catopsbaatar" was almost trapezoidal in shape (unlike in "Djadochtatherium" and "Kryptobaatar", where it is crescent-shaped), smaller, and lacking ridges. "Catopsbaatar" also differed by only having three upper premolars, lacking the P2 (a feature shared with "Tombaatar"). Other mammals usually evolve the loss of teeth at the beginning or end of a tooth row, not in the middle (as in multituberculates). The cusp formula of the M1 molar was 5â6:5â6:4, with the inner ridge extending about 75 percent of the tooth's length. The cusps of M1 were sharp and unworn in juveniles, but worn and concave in older animals. The cusp formula of the M2 molar was 2:2â3:2â3.
