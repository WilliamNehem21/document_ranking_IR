York Cottage, initially known as Bachelors' Cottage, was worked by Edward, Prince of Wales, not long after he procured Sandringham to give further settlement to visitors. It was home to George V from 1893 until his mom's passing empowered him to move into the primary house in 1925. While talking about his dad with Harold Nicolson, at the time Nicolson had been named to compose the late King's life story, Edward VIII, by then Duke of Windsor, commented "Until you have seen York Cottage you will never comprehend my dad". The bungalow was no more profoundly respected structurally than the principle house; James Pope-Hennessy, the official biographer of Queen Mary, called it, "hugely obscene and unequivocally, resistant ugly". Nicolson depicted it as a "morose little manor (with) rooms undefined from those of any Surbiton or Upper Norwood home". He was especially pretentious of the illustrious washing game plans: "Goodness my God! what a spot. The King's and Queen's showers had tops that closed down with the goal that when not being used they could be utilized as tables". "It is practically mind blowing that the beneficiary to so huge a legacy lived in this awful little house." Nicolson's strictures did not show up in his official memoir of the King. York Cottage is as of now the bequest office for the Sandringham Estate.
