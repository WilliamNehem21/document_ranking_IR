Sino-Roman relations included the for the most part backhanded contact, stream of exchange products, data, and incidental voyagers between the Roman Empire and Han Empire of China, just as between the later Eastern Roman Empire and different Chinese lines. These realms crawled continuously nearer over the span of the Roman venture into the antiquated Near East and synchronous Han Chinese military attacks into Central Asia. Common mindfulness stayed low, and firm learning about one another was restricted. Just a couple of endeavors at direct contact are known from records. Middle of the road realms, for example, the Parthians and Kushans, looking to keep up worthwhile authority over the silk exchange, repressed direct contact between these two Eurasian forces. In 97 AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao attempted to send his emissary Gan Ying to Rome, yet Gan was discouraged by Parthians from wandering past the Persian Gulf. A few claimed Roman emissaries to China were recorded by old Chinese history specialists. The first on record, as far as anyone knows from either the Roman head Antoninus Pius or his embraced child Marcus Aurelius, landed in 166 AD. Others are recorded as touching base in 226 and 284 AD, with a long nonattendance until the primary recorded Byzantine government office in 643 AD.
