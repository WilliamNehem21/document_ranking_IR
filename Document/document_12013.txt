The tune's music video was coordinated by Francis Lawrence and delivered by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video manages the verses' topic of Stefani's look for motivation in songwriting. It opens with a long non-melodic area in which Stefani touches base in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She gets a few calls from Interscope name head Jimmy Iovine, who endeavors to drive her forward with her performance debut venture, yet she answers that she is drained and deadened. After a fizzled studio endeavor, Stefani sees a flyer promoting help for a temporarily uncooperative mind. Upon entry she is approached to round out a suspicious poll, where the camera skillet to the inquiries which will be imperative. She is then informed that she will be charged when she is done. She requests elucidation just to find that she is as of now back in the studio without anyone else's input. At the point when Stefani gets a larger than usual pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit trinket that she had recently observed hops over the room. She tosses the watch at the trinket, making her fall back on her seat and wind up transported to a dreamland dependent on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking-Glass".
