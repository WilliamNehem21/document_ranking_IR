In July, "Incensed" set out nine Fulmars of 800 Squadron, 'A' Flight of 880 Squadron with four Sea Hurricane IBs, nine Swordfish from 812 Squadron and nine Albacores of 817 Squadron to assault the German-involved ports of Kirkenes, Norway, and Petsamo, Finland, withdrawing Scapa Flow on the 23rd in organization with the bearer , two cruisers and six destroyers. The two transporters and their escorts accumulated in Seidisfjord, Iceland, under the order of Rear Admiral Wake-Walker where they refueled in late July. "Irate" assaulted dispatches in Petsamo on 30 July with every last bit of her Swordfish and Albacores, escorted by six Fulmars and each of the four Sea Hurricanes, yet there was almost no transportation present. One little ship, MV "Trotter", was sunk, a few oil stockpiling tanks were set ablaze, and a few wooden wharfs were torpedoed. The British boats had been spotted before the assault and two Fulmars and an Albacore were shot somewhere near the alarmed barriers. "Enraged" was shy of fuel and needed to leave in the blink of an eye a short time later, yet she exchanged her Albacores to "Triumphant" to top off that bearer's destroyed squadrons before she left. Ocean Hurricanes of 880 Squadron shot down a shadowing Dornier Do 18 flying pontoon on 31 July as the ship was leaving.
