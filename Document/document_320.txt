In 1847Ã¢ÂÂ 8 a few of the old houses related with the church building on the west side were destroyed, and some minor changes were made to the limit divider. Auxiliary fortification of the ruin and some reproduction work started in the mid twentieth century, including reclamation of the east peak rose window in 1904 and the substitution of the missing structure pieces, mullions, and beautifying ribs in the window in the north-east mass of the chapterhouse (Fig.ÃÂ 15). By 1913, repointing the dividers and extra waterproofing of the divider tops were finished. In 1924 the ground level was brought down and the seventeenth century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further fixes and reclamation followed amid the 1930s, including the halfway destroying of some nineteenth century buttressing (Fig.ÃÂ 16), the remaking of areas of the nave docks utilizing recouped pieces (Fig.ÃÂ 17), and the expansion of outside material to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig.ÃÂ 18). From 1960 to 2000, artisans reestablished the house of God's disintegrating stonework (Fig.ÃÂ 19) and somewhere in the range of 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was step by step supplanted, and its re-material was finished (Fig.ÃÂ 20). Floors, coating, and another rooftop were added toward the south-west pinnacle somewhere in the range of 1988 and 1998 and practically identical rebuilding work was finished on the north-west pinnacle somewhere in the range of 1998 and 2000 (Fig.ÃÂ 21).
