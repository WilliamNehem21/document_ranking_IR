The red-topped parrot essentially benefits starting from the earliest stage, the container of eucalypts or cones of sheoak with one foot and removing the seed with their slim snared nose. The finesse it displays utilizing its foot and mouth to remove seeds is additionally appeared by the since quite a while ago charged dark cockatoo ("Calyptorhynchus baudinii"). The two happen in a similar natural surroundings, both work in separating the marri's store of substantial seeds. The two species prise marri seeds out of their woody case by controlling it with the foot and lower mandible, and embeddings the purpose of the upper mandible at openings in the seed-scattering valve. The imprints left by the lower mandible on the marri's nut recognize it from those benefited from by different parrots and cockatoos. The red-topped parrot leaves shallow checks around the opening of the case, with little harm to the husk. The species mostly sustains and controls objects with its left foot; constrained testing of Australian parrot species demonstrates that laterality is related with bigger size, and huge numbers of these are left-footed, however two other wide followed parrot species (ruby rosella and Australian ringneck) are correct footed, and littler species demonstrate no inclination.
