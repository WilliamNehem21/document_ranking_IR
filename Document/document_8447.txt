Rivalry from different predators of marine warm blooded animals, for example, macropredatory sperm whales which showed up in the Miocene, and executioner whales and incredible white sharks in the Pliocene, may have additionally added to the decay and termination of megalodon. Fossil records demonstrate that the new whale-eating cetaceans ordinarily happened at high scopes amid the Pliocene, showing that they could adapt to the undeniably predominant virus water temperatures; yet they likewise happened in the tropics (e.g., "Orcinus" sp. in South Africa). The biggest macropredatory sperm whales, for example, "Livyatan" are best known from the Miocene, yet persevered into the Pliocene, while others, for example, "Hoplocetus" and "Scaldicetus", made due until the early Pleistocene. These may have involved a specialty like that of orcas before in the long run being supplanted by them. Ongoing proof and progressively precise dating strategies demonstrate that "C. megalodon" may have ceased to exist sooner than induced; fossils inspected in North Pacific stores demonstrate the sharks endured an offbeat elimination around 3.6-4 million years back, as confirm by the way that a considerable lot of the species that filled in as prey for "C. megalodon" made due for a lot of time after the monster shark went wiped out, precluding past speculations with respect to a marine mass eradication. This is theorized to be because of both cooling surface temperatures bringing about range discontinuity for "C. megalodon" just as rivalry with the recently advanced present day extraordinary white shark for existing kinds of prey.
