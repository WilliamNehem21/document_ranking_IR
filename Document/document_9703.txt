Endeavors are currently in progress to repopulate islands previously occupied by tortoises to reestablish their biological systems (island rebuilding) to their condition before people arrived. The tortoises are a cornerstone animal categories, going about as biological system engineers which help in plant seed dispersal and trampling down brush and diminishing the understory of vegetation (enabling light to enter and germination to happen). Fowls, for example, flycatchers roost on and fly around tortoises to chase the creepy crawlies they dislodge from the brush. In May 2010, 39 disinfected tortoises of half and half starting point were acquainted with Pinta Island, the main tortoises there since the clearing of Lonesome George 38 years prior. Sterile tortoises were discharged so the issue of interbreeding between species would be stayed away from if any fruitful tortoises were to be discharged later on. It is trusted that with the ongoing distinguishing proof of a half breed "C. abingdonii" tortoise, the rough hereditary constitution of the first occupants of Pinta may in the end be reestablished with the distinguishing proof and migration of suitable examples to this island. This methodology might be utilized to "retortoise" Floreana later on, since hostage people have been observed to be plummeted from the wiped out unique stock.
