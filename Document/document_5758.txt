Following Marianna's passing in 1890, it was accounted for in French papers that she had at long last, on her deathbed and with Edgardo next to her, become a Christian. Edgardo disproved this: "I have in every case passionately wanted that my mom grasp the Catholic confidence," he wrote in a letter to "Le Temps", "and I attempted commonly to get her to do as such. In any case, that never occurred". After a year, Father Pio Edgardo Mortara came back to Italy without precedent for two decades to lecture in Modena. A sister and a portion of his siblings turned out to hear his lesson, and for an incredible remainder Edgardo approached his relatives at whatever point he was in Italy. Amid a 1919 stay in Rome he visited the House of Catechumens he had entered 61ÃÂ years previously. At this point he had settled at the convent of the Canons Regular at Bouhay in LiÃÂ¨ge, Belgium. Bouhay had a haven to the Virgin of Lourdes, to which Father Mortara felt a unique association, the Lourdes nebulous visions of 1858 having happened in a similar year as his own transformation to Christianity. Father Pio Edgardo Mortara dwelled at Bouhay for a mind-blowing remainder and passed on there on 11ÃÂ March 1940, at 88 years old.
