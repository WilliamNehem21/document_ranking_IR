The original "Ravenloft" module has been revised and expanded three times. In 1993, TSR published "House of Strahd" (module code RM4). It was updated to include rules from the second edition of "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons". The module credits the original work by the Hickmans, but was revised by Bruce Nesmith, who along with Andria Hayday created the "Ravenloft" campaign setting. Nesmith introduced some new creatures, developed Strahd's tactics further, and added a Time-Track Table so that the referee can anticipate the sunset. In October 2006, Wizards of the Coast released an updated and expanded version of the original module for "Dungeons & Dragons" version 3.5 as a 226-page hardcover book entitled "Expedition to Castle Ravenloft". It was based on the original module, and not the "Ravenloft" material made in the intervening years. "Expedition to Castle Ravenloft" is designed to be played as a mini-campaign lasting about 20 game sessions, much longer than the original module, although it contains options for running long 8-session or short 4-session adventures. The book also includes suggestions for incorporating the adventure into an existing generic setting, Forgotten Realms, Eberron or d20 Modern campaign. Wizards of the Coast released the board game "Castle Ravenloft" in 2010 as part of the "Adventure System" series of board games using a simplified 4th edition rule set. In 2016, Wizards of the Coast published "Curse of Strahd", an adaptation of the original Ravenloft module for the 5th edition of "Dungeons & Dragons", which was generally well received, earning the 2016 ENnie Awards for Best Adventure and Best Art/Cover and runner up for Product of the Year.
