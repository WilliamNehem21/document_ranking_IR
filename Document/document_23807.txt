The "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos has received mixed reactions from gaming sites. "Hardcore Gamer"s Brady Hale called the series "anything but ordinary" in the variety of games it featured. In an article concerning the 25th Anniversary event for the "Final Fantasy" series, Joystiq's Ben Gilbert called the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" mythos "occasionally bizarre and often beautiful". In 2014, Jeremy Parish of USGamer said that the series was "much ado about nothing", stating that since the games shared a large amount of themes and plot points with the main series, there seemed little reason for a distinction. TechnoBuffalo's Ron Duwell, in an article concerning a documentary video on "Final Fantasy XV", called the series "overly ambitious", but felt that it was worth "Fabula Nova Crystallis" "[imploding] upon itself" if "Final Fantasy XV" fulfilled its promises. Kat Bailey, writing for USGamer as part of her review for "Final Fantasy XV", said that series fans were ready for the subseries to come to an end with the game's release. RPG Site's Chelsi Laire called the subseries "a series of successes and failures, but mostly the latter" due to its troubled development, but hoped that the company would revisit the brand in the future.
