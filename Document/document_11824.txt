That morning, 5 September, following a 10-minute mounted guns readiness, the American troops moved out in their third day of counterattack. It was multi day of downpour. As the assault advanced, the Marines drew closer Obong-ni Ridge and the ninth Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had battled tirelessly amid the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the prior month. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see North Korean troops delving in. The Marines moved toward the go between the two slopes and took positions before the North Korean-held high ground. At 14:30 roughly 300 North Korean infantry originated from the town of Tugok and covered positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 only north of the street and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks astonished and thumped out the two driving Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the crushed Pershing tanks blocked fields of flame, four others pulled back to better positions. Strike groups of B Company and the first Battalion with 3.5-inch rocket launchers raced without hesitation, took the tanks enduring an onslaught, and demolished them two, just as a reinforced faculty transporter following behind. The North Korean infantry assault was ruthless and dispensed 25 losses on B Company before fortifications from A Company and supporting Army mounted guns and the Marine 81ÃÂ mm mortars repulsed it. September 5 was per day of overwhelming losses wherever on the Pusan Perimeter. Armed force units had 102 murdered, 430 injured, and 587 long gone for a sum of 1,119 setbacks. Marine units had 35 slaughtered, 91 injured, and none long gone, for an aggregate of 126 fight losses. All out American fight setbacks for the day were 1,245 men.
