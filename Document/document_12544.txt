The work's authenticity pulled in a lot of critique when it was first shown. Some considered it to be an attack against Romanticism, others said that its little subtleties demonstrated an intense similarity, however fabricated a mental profile of the sitter. Workmanship history specialist Geraldine Pelles considers Bertin to be "without a moment's delay serious, suspicious, and forceful". She noticed that there is a sure measure of projection of the craftsman's identity and reviews ThÃÂ©ophile Silvestre's depiction of Ingres; "There he was soundly situated in an easy chair, unmoving as an Egyptian god cut of stone, his hands extended wide over parallel knees, his middle solid, his head haughty". Some contrasted it with Balthasar Denner, a German pragmatist painter impacted by Jan van Eyck. Denner, in the expressions of Ingres researcher Robert Rosenblum, "represented considerable authority in account each and every line on the essences of matured people, and even impressions of windows in their eyes." The examination was made by Ingres' admirers and spoilers alike. In 1833, Louis de Maynard of the CollÃÂ¨ge-lycÃÂ©e AmpÃÂ¨re, writing in the powerful "L'Europe littÃÂ©raire", rejected Denner as a feeble painter worried about hyperrealistic "interests", and said that both he and Ingres missed the mark concerning the "magnificent creations of Ingres' self-broadcasted saint, Raphael."
