Amid the season Fender scored 820 runs, frequently all around rapidly, and took 83 wickets incorporating some through exploring different avenues regarding leg turn bowling. As indicated by "Wisden" his value was estimated by more than figures: "As a match winning element he is a far more noteworthy power on a side than his records would propose." In an incredible Surrey side he batted forcefully, bowled more every now and again than at SussexÃ¢ÂÂfor the most part as a help bowler to the primary assaultÃ¢ÂÂand built up a notoriety for being a slip defender. A partner made a decision about that Fender was the "making" of the group, and "Wisden" remarked that "he generally appeared the correct man in the opportune spot". A late substitution in the Gentlemen v Players diversion at Lord's, Fender was not especially effective but rather established a decent connection on commentators. The season finished rashly as a result of the episode of war in August 1914. Surrey had built up a directing lead in the County Championship table; as their closest challengers had no protest, the MCC announced them as province champions.
