Middle Easterner arrangements, particularly the development of a vast armada, did not go unnoticed by the stressed Byzantines. Ruler Anastasios II () sent a government office to Damascus under the patrician and urban administrator, Daniel of Sinope, apparently so as to supplication for harmony, however actually to keep an eye on the Arabs. Anastasios, thus, started to plan for the unavoidable attack: the strongholds of Constantinople were fixed and furnished with abundant big guns (launches and other attack weapons), while sustenance stores were brought into the city. Moreover, those occupants who couldn't store nourishment for no less than three years were cleared. Anastasios fortified his naval force and in mid 715 dispatched it against the Arab armada that had come to PhoenixÃ¢ÂÂgenerally related to present day Finike in Lycia, it might likewise be current Fenaket crosswise over Rhodes, or maybe Phoenicia (current Lebanon), popular for its cedar woodlandsÃ¢ÂÂto gather timber for their boats. At Rhodes, be that as it may, the Byzantine armada, supported by the warriors of the Opsician Theme, revolted, murdered their officer John the Deacon and cruised north to Adramyttium. There, they acclaimed a hesitant assessment gatherer, Theodosius, as head. Anastasios crossed into Bithynia in the Opsician Theme to stand up to the insubordination, yet the renegade armada cruised on to Chrysopolis. From that point, it propelled assaults against Constantinople, until, in pre-fall, sympathizers inside the capital paved the way for them. Anastasios held out at Nicaea for a while, at long last consenting to leave and resign as a priest. The promotion of Theodosios, who from the sources seems to be both reluctant and unfit, as a manikin sovereign of the Opsicians incited the response of different topics, particularly the Anatolics and the Armeniacs under their separate "strategoi" (officers) Leo the Isaurian and Artabasdos.
