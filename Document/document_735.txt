The extreme left flank of the German assault fell on the 104th Brigade close to the town of Treux, in spite of the fact that with the line south of the Ancre here, the safeguards were less subject to shock and had great fields of flame. A post of the eighteenth (Service) Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers was situated in a profound depressed street in the upper east corner of Marrett Wood, which was southwest of Treux itself. On the night of 27 March, Monash had requested the tenth Brigade to build up if the 35th Division truly held the wood, and watches of the 37th Battalion had found the British post in the depressed street and gave some help, comprising of a couple of riflemen and a Lewis firearm team which was low on ammo. About 06:00, a little German assault was propelled in this division, yet it was repulsed with Lewis firearm fire. About 08:00, Germans were seen drawing closer out there, and the leader of the Lancashire Fusiliers post approached the 37th Battalion for more noteworthy help. Before this could arrive, a few hundred Germans of II/13 IR assaulted, yet they were beaten off by the consolidated British-Australian power at Marrett Wood with the assistance of the British big guns. The remainder of 13 IR assaulted further east around the town of Ville, yet were effectively ceased by the fundamental line of the 106th Brigade. Because of the Lancashire Fusiliers' solicitation for fortifications, an organization of the 38th Battalion involved Marrett Wood about 11:35, similarly as another fruitless German ambush was mounted. A further ineffective endeavor was made at 16:30. The Germans accused absence of sufficient cannons support for their inability to catch Treux and Marrett Wood.
