A spin-off of "Lord of War" was first prodded toward the finish of its credits, which expressed, "Kratos Will Return". "Divine force of War II" was formally reported at the 2006 Game Developers Conference (GDC). David Jaffe ventured down and turned into the imaginative chief of its continuation and "Divine force of War"s lead illustrator Cory Barlog accepted the job of diversion executive. Barlog said that in the diversion, players would see "a bigger perspective on Kratos' job inside the fanciful world." Like "Divine force of War", the amusement utilizes Santa Monica's Kinetica motor. Enchantment assaults turned into a fundamental piece of the battle framework and it was progressively refined. New animals and legends from the folklore, and progressively manager fights were included. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that they didn't see "Divine force of War II" as a spin-off, yet rather a continuation of the past diversion. Jaffe said that they would not like to incorporate the Roman numeral number two (II) in the title therefore, however they didn't need the title to pass on the impression it was a development pack. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason "Divine force of War II" showed up on the PlayStation 2 rather than the PlayStation 3Ã¢ÂÂwhich was discharged four months before "Lord of War II"Ã¢ÂÂ was on the grounds that "there's a 100 million individuals out there that will probably play "Divine force of War II" when it dispatches." Barlog guaranteed that the diversion would be playable on the more current stage, which initially had PlayStation 2 in reverse compatibility.<ref name="PALGN7/26/06"></ref><ref name="Spike5/5/06"></ref>
