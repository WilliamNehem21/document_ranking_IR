By April, Robert W. Woolley had been appointed as Director of the Mint, and he endorsed tests of the gold dollar, the first to have work finished, on April 22. He at that point headed out to San Francisco, and was there when the kicks the bucket for the dollar landed on the 27th. At the point when the San Francisco Mint's coiner inspected them, they turned out to be inadequate with regards to the mint imprint "S", standard on coins delivered there. Woolley didn't know whether this was deliberate, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on the 29th. After discovering that it was deliberateÃ¢ÂÂJoyce contemplated that as the whole mintage of this, the main memorial issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be created at San Francisco, there was no compelling reason to utilize a mint imprintÃ¢ÂÂWoolley requested that the bites the dust at San Francisco and in travel be come back to Philadelphia, and new ones delivered with the mint imprint. Woolley trusted that individuals would accept the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then utilize a mint imprint. Burdette takes note of that the San Francisco Mint was a wellspring of nearby pride and the exclusion of the mint imprint would almost certainly have prompted across the board dissent, and perhaps to two assortments of every one of the new coins: with mint imprint, and without. New dollar kicks the bucket were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the next day. Bites the dust for the $50 pursued on May 14, and for the quarter hawk on May 27.
