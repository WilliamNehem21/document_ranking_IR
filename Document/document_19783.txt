The format of the series also pays homage to "Tales of the Unexpected", "The Twilight Zone" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents". Pemberton and Shearsmith returned to writing more macabre stories, according to the latter, as they "always feel slightly unfulfilled if [they] write something that's purely comedic, it just feels too frivolous and light". During the filming of "Sardines", Shearsmith professed excitement to be working on "Inside No. 9", saying that "being in the middle of filming a third series of "Psychoville" would be utterly depressing". Pemberton and Shearsmith aimed for a simpler experience than "Psychoville", describing "Sardines" by saying the episode is "just about some good actors in a wardrobe with a good story". As each episode of "Inside No. 9" features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, "Sardines" starred Katherine Parkinson, Tim Key, Luke Pasqualino, Ophelia Lovibond, Anne Reid, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Anna Chancellor, Marc Wootton, Ben Willbond and Timothy West. West had previously starred in "Tales of the Unexpected", and Shearsmith said that, due to this prior appearance, "it was a great nod" to have West in the episode. "Sardines" has more characters than any other episode of the first series, and these characters were written before casting took place. Pemberton recalls the fun he had in selecting a cast for the episode, aiming to bring together a very varied group of actors who would work well as a group.
