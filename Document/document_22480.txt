H. L. Gold, "Galaxy" first editor, had worked at Standard Magazines in the early 1940s as an assistant editor, reading for Standard's three science fiction pulps: "Startling Stories", "Thrilling Wonder", and "Captain Future". With the advent of the war, Gold left publishing and went into the army, but in late 1949 he was approached by Vera Cerutti, who had once worked for him. Cerutti was now working for a French-Italian publisher, Ãditions Mondiales Del Duca founded by Cino Del Duca, that had opened an office in New York as World Editions. She initially asked Gold for guidance on how to produce a magazine, which he provided. World Editions took a heavy loss on "Fascination", its first attempt to launch a US magazine, and Cerutti returned to Gold asking for recommendations for new titles. Gold knew about "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction", a digest launched in the fall of 1949, but felt that there was still room in the market for another serious science fiction magazine. He sent a prospectus to World Editions that included a proposal for a series of paperback sf novels as well as a periodical, and proposed paying three cents a word, an impressively high rate, given that most competing magazines were paying only one cent a word. World Editions agreed, hired Gold as the editor, and the first issue appeared in October 1950. The novel series subsequently appeared as "Galaxy Science Fiction Novels".
