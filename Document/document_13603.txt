Before the finish of August clearly the associations in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were not going to be prepared in time for the 1923 yield, and the advisory group chose to continue alone. It confirmed that if ranchers speaking to half of Alberta's absolute wheat land consented to pool their harvest by September 15, the pool would continue. Brownlee trusted this was an unthinkable goal. In spite of the test and problematic nature of the model and the so far nonexistent association that was to execute it, this goal was met. The Alberta Wheat Pool was conceived. By the next year's collect, practically identical associations had framed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and a Central Selling Agency (CSA) was shaped to sell every one of the three territories' wheat. The CSA's first president, Alexander James McPhail (whom Brownlee chose), offered Brownlee the situation of CSA general administrator, at the appealing compensation of $20,000 every year (an assume that Brownlee had helped set). At the encouraging of his administration partners and the UFA authority, both of who felt his proceeded with nearness in Edmonton was indispensable to the UFA government's hang on power, he declined; he was rather made the CSA's general guidance. Brownlee was likewise intensely engaged with the production of a domesticated animals pool and three dairy pools, as a kind of "poolmania" hit Alberta ranchers.
