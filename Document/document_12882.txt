Two sorts of wet prairies flourish in the Everglades: marl and water-swamp network. Wet prairies are marginally raised like sawgrass swamps, yet contain plenteous plant assorted variety. Marl prairies are found where marl covers limestone that may project as apexes or disintegrate into "arrangement gaps": despondencies shaped by similar procedures that make sinkholes. Arrangement openings, be that as it may, don't meet the water table; they are loaded up with downpour water. The surface is secured just three to seven months of the year, however the water is generally simply profound. Marl is made by layers of periphyton inexactly joined to the limestone, and structures a dim or white brittle mud when it dries. Whenever overwhelmed, the marl can bolster an assortment of water plants, and diminutive person cypresses may develop for many years however not surpass in stature. Arrangement gaps may stay overwhelmed notwithstanding when the prairies are dry, and they bolster sea-going spineless creatures, for example, crawfish and snails, just as larval creatures of land and water which feed youthful swimming flying creatures. Where the prevalent soil is peat, a water-swamp network exists. Its hydroperiod is longer than the marl prairie, despite the fact that its plants are less differing. These locales will in general be on the fringe among swamps and sawgrass bogs.
