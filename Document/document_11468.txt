The initial three-dollar pieces were 15ÃÂ proof coins, conveyed to the Secretary of the Treasury, James Guthrie, by Mint Director Snowden on AprilÃÂ 28, 1854, probably for dissemination to lawmakers. The Philadelphia Mint at that point started the biggest generation of three-dollar pieces the group could ever observe. Boss Coiner Franklin Peale conveyed 23,140ÃÂ pieces on MayÃÂ 8 and 29,181 pieces four days after the fact. Be that as it may, after JuneÃÂ 8, there was just a single further conveyance by Peale, on NovemberÃÂ 10, when the last 22,740 of the mintage of 138,618ÃÂ were conveyed. Notwithstanding the strikings at Philadelphia, there was branch mint creation, with 24,000ÃÂ pieces struck at the New Orleans Mint (1854-O) and 1,120ÃÂ at Dahlonega (1854-D). A couple of kicks the bucket was sent from Philadelphia to the Charlotte Mint on JuneÃÂ 1, however they were not utilized. A couple was sent to Dahlonega that day, landing on JuneÃÂ 10, with checks and other important hardware following on JulyÃÂ 15. The coinage of the 1854-D occurred in August; the piece is today an irregularity as few were set aside and it was not until decades later that mintmarked coins were spared as unmistakable assortments. Bites the dust were sent to New Orleans in 1855, 1856, 1859, and 1861, just to stay unused; no further strikings occurred at any of the three southern branch mints.
