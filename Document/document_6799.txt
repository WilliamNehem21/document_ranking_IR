On the morning of 5 January, the nineteenth Infantry Brigade propelled its assault on the Meriega area, beginning from the Bardia street and following a crawling flood southward with the help of six Matilda tanks, all that stayed in working request. The others had been hit by shells, immobilized by mines, or had just separated. The organization authorities of the lead legion, the 2/eleventh Infantry Battalion, did not get their last requests until 45 minutes before begin time, so, all in all the begin line was away. As a result, the contingent arrived late, and the proposed two organization assault must be completed by only one: Captain Ralph Honner's C Company, but with each of the six Matildas available to him. Honner's men needed to truly pursue the flood, and had just barely gotten up to speed with it before it stopped. As they propelled, they experienced harsh criticism from the left, the right, and before them, yet setbacks were light. Most positions surrendered when the infantry and tanks approached, however this did not diminish the flame from posts further away. By 1115, C Company had achieved the Switch Line and caught Post R5 and afterward R7. B Company, following on the left, cleared Wadi Meriega, catching Lieutenant General Ruggero Tracchia and Brigadier General Alessandro de Guidi, the authorities of the 62nd and 63rd Infantry Divisions individually. Now, Honner ceased to merge his position and permit Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Dougherty's 2/fourth Infantry Battalion to go through. Be that as it may, Honner took the surrender of Posts 1, 2 and 3 and his men did not quit progressing.
