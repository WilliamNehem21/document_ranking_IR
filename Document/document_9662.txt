The sporadically molded spores measure from 7.2 to 11.6 by 5.1 to 7.9 micrometers (ÃÂ¼m), each including a couple of thick protusions. Strange spores of an alternate shape, now and then with projections more particular from the genuine spore than is common, can at times structure; this is maybe because of poor climate. The club-molded basidia measure 25 to 40 by 9 to 14 ÃÂ¼m, and every basidium bears four spores. The yellowish pleurocystidia (cystidia on the substance of the gill) are ventricose or once in a while club-formed, estimating 41 to 89 by 12 to 23 ÃÂ¼m, including a cell divider up to 4.5 ÃÂ¼m thick. The tip regularly twists and is encrusted with precious stone like structures, while the base decreases, or limits into a little stalk. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are much the equivalent, yet they are commonly fairly shorter and stouter. The more drawn out caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) happen right down the stem and measure up to 99 ÃÂ¼m long with an increasingly factor shape. The mushrooms additionally highlight "paracystidia", club-molded cystidia-like structures on the gills lacking precious stones, just as "cauloparacystidia" on the stem. In "Inocybe saliceticola", the paracystidia are genuinely plentiful, with dainty cell-dividers, while the bounteous cauloparacystidia can have marginally thicker dividers and are regularly masterminded in groups.
