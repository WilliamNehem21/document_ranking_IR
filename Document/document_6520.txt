Parsons and Sara were in an open relationship energized by the O.T.O's. polyandrous sexual morals, and she wound up enchanted with Hubbard; Parsons, in spite of endeavoring to curb his interests, turned out to be seriously desirous. Roused to locate another accomplice through mysterious methods, Parsons started to commit his energies to leading dark enchantment, causing worry among individual O.T.O. individuals who trusted that it was summoning troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that "our very own Jack is fascinated with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the begin he constantly needed to inspire somethingÃ¢ÂÂregardless, I am slanted to think, as long as he got an outcome." He told the occupants that he was pervading statues in the house with an enchanted vitality so as to pitch them to individual mediums. Parsons announced paranormal occasions in the house coming about because of the ceremonies; including phantom movement, sightings of spheres and spooky spirits, catalytic (sylphic) impact on the climate, and immaterial voices. Pendle proposed that Parsons was especially powerless to these translations and credited the voices to a trick by Hubbard and Sara. One custom purportedly conveyed shouting banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an episode that irritated Forman for an incredible remainder. In December 1945 Parsons started a progression of ceremonies dependent on Enochian enchantment amid which he jerked off onto mystical tablets, joined by Sergei Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto. Portraying this otherworldly task as the Babalon Working, he would have liked to realize the manifestation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He enabled Hubbard to participate as his "copyist", trusting that he was especially delicate to recognizing mystical wonders. As depicted by Richard Metzger, "Parsons yanked off for the sake of otherworldly progression" while Hubbard "filtered the astral plane for signs and dreams."
