The city turned into the managerial focus of the Roman region of Mauretania Tingitana. It stayed faithful to Rome regardless of a revolt in 40Ã¢ÂÂ 44ÃÂ AD driven by one of Ptolemy's freedmen, Aedemon, and its occupants were compensated with gifts of citizenship and a ten-year exclusion from duties. The city was raised to the status of a "municipium" and its arrangement of administration was redesignd, with the Punic-style "suffetes" supplanted by yearly chosen "duumvirs", or sets of judges. In any case, the city's position was constantly shaky; it was situated on the south-eastern edge of the territory, confronting threatening and progressively ground-breaking Berber clans. A ring of five fortresses situated at the advanced villas of AÃÂ¯n Schkor, Bled el Gaada, Sidi Moussa, Sidi Said and Bled Takourart (antiquated Tocolosida) were built to reinforce the city's resistance. Sidi Said was the base for the Cohors IV Gallorum equitata, a helper rangers unit from Gaul, while AÃÂ¯n Schkor housed Hispanic and Belgic companions. Sidi Moussa was the area of an associate of Parthians, and Gallic and Syrian mounted force were based at Toscolosida. Rising strains in the area close to the finish of the second century drove the sovereign Marcus Aurelius to arrange the development of a circuit of dividers with eight entryways and 40 towers. Volubilis was associated by street to Lixus and Tingis (present day Tangier) yet had no eastwards associations with the neighboring area of Mauretania Caesariensis, as the domain of the Berber Baquates clan lay in the middle.
