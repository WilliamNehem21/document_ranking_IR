Polk's first guide was Grundy, yet in the assembly, Polk came progressively to contradict him on such issues as land change, and came to help the approaches of Andrew Jackson, by then a military saint for his triumph at the Battle of New Orleans (1815). Jackson was a family companion to both the Polks and the ChildressesÃ¢ÂÂthere is proof Sarah Polk and her kin called him "Uncle Andrew"Ã¢ÂÂ and James Polk rapidly came to help his presidential desire for 1824. At the point when the Tennessee Legislature stopped on who to choose as U.S. representative in 1823 (until 1913, administrators, not the general population, chose congresspersons), Jackson's name was set in assignment. Polk parted from his standard partners, giving his vote a role as an individual from the state House of Representatives for the general in Jackson's triumph. This helped Jackson's presidential shots by giving him later political experience to coordinate his military achievements. This started a collusion that would proceed until Jackson's passing from the get-go in Polk's administration. Polk, through a lot of his political profession, was known as "Youthful Hickory", in light of the moniker for Jackson, "Old Hickory". Polk's political vocation was as subject to Jackson as his moniker suggested.
