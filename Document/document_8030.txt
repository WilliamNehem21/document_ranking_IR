As the French Revolution and its apparent risk to the United Kingdom picked up energy, so did Garrow's vocation; he indicted in the greater part of the state preliminaries, and as he expanded in experience was left to oversee a large number of them himself, facing driving advodates, for example, Thomas Erskine, James Mingay and James Scarlett. In May 1794 the Government suspended "habeas corpus", in 1795 banned every single open gathering, in 1797 prohibited mystery associations and in 1799 prohibited all social orders keen on transforming the manner in which the United Kingdom was run. The Government arranged a progression of 800 captures, with 300 execution warrants for high treachery made out and marked, endeavoring to indict Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke. Solid was the first to be attempted, with the indictment contending that he looked for an unrest in England like that in France. With Garrow arraigning and Erskine guarding, the preliminary endured eight days rather than the ordinary one, and the foreman of the jury was tense to the point that he conveyed the decision of "not blameworthy" softly and afterward quickly swooned. Tooke was then arraigned; once more, the jury discovered him not blameworthy, with the outcome that the other 800 preliminaries were relinquished.
