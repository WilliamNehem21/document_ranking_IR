In any occasion, you have to depict demise". Thus, Nomura proposed slaughtering off the courageous woman. Aerith had been the main courageous woman, however the passing of a female hero would require a second; this prompted the making of Tifa. The engineers chose to murder Aerith, as her demise would be the most obliterating and considerable. Kitase needed to portray it as abrupt and unforeseen, leaving "not a sensational inclination but rather extraordinary vacancy", "sentiments of the real world and not Hollywood". The content for the scene was composed by Nojima. Kitase and Nojima then arranged that a large portion of the primary cast would pass on in the blink of an eye before the last fight; Nomura vetoed the thought since he felt it would undermine the effect of Aerith's demise. A few character relations and statuses experienced changes amid advancement. Aerith was to be Sephiroth's sister, which affected the plan of her hair. The group at that point made Sephiroth a past adoration enthusiasm of hers to extend her backstory, yet later swapped him with Zack. Vincent and Yuffie were to be a piece of the principle account, yet because of time imperatives, they were about sliced and in the long run consigned to being discretionary characters.
