Fleury arrived at the Flames' 1988 training camp overweight, and was assigned back to Salt Lake to begin the 1988â89 season. He averaged nearly two points per game, recording 37Â goals and 37Â assists to lead the IHL in scoring after 40Â games. Mired in a slump, the Flames recalled Fleury on January 1, 1989, in the hope he could help their offence. He played his first NHL game against the Quebec Nordiques two nights later and recorded his first points â three assists â on January 5 against the Los Angeles Kings. He scored his first two NHL goals in a 7â2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on January 7. Fleury continued to score, and finished with 34Â points in 36Â games in his NHL rookie season. He added 11 points in the playoffs, helping the Flames to the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history.
After improving to 33Â goals in his first full season, Fleury broke out in 1990â91, scoring 51 goals and 104 points to lead the Flames offensively. He played in the 1991 All-Star Game, scoring a goal in an 11â5 victory by the Campbell Conference over the Wales Conference. Towards the end of the season, Fleury set a league record by scoring three shorthanded goals in one game against the St. Louis Blues. He shared the NHL Plus-Minus Award with Marty McSorley, whom he tied for the league lead with +48. Fleury scored only two goals in the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs, but after his overtime winner in game six against the Oilers he famously slid the entire length of the ice in jubilation before crashing into the boards as his teammates attempted to catch up to him. The Flames were defeated in game seven, which ended their season.
