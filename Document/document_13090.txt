In 1918, Long started encouraging Terhune to distribute a book of his puppy stories, however Terhune himself was not persuaded at first. He believed them to be just "hack stating" and substandard compared to his different works. Indeed, even after Long persuaded him regarding the open's affection for the works, Terhune at first did nothing towards the objective. Soon thereafter, Doubleday-Page, which had distributed Terhune's last novel "Fortune", composed requesting to see his next book while advising him that their agreement gave them first refusal rights to it. Needing to escape from that distributer because of the horrid execution of "Fortune", Terhune chose to pursue Long's recommendation so he could utilize the book of puppy stories to satisfy his legally binding commitment. After he gathered together the twenty "Fellow" stories he had composed up until this point, he revamped them into parts and presented the book. He was unsurprised that it was rejected, yet in the dismissal letter the organization alluded to Alfred Ollivant's 1898 novel "Owd Bob" and Jack London's 1903 novel "The Call of the Wild" as "prevalent bits of work". As Terhune himself believed the two writers to be unremarkable scholars, he ended up established that "Fellow: A Dog" would be distributed. E. P. Dutton's John Macrae, who was a known canine sweetheart, found the accounts "basic however enchanting" and felt the open might want them enormously.
