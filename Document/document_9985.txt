The Hotspur Football Club was shaped in 1882 by a gathering of students from Saint John's Middle Class School and Tottenham Grammar School. Generally matured 13 to 14, the young men were individuals from the Hotspur Cricket Club shaped two years sooner. Robert Buckle with his two companions Sam Casey and John Anderson considered the thought so they could keep on playing sport amid the winter months. Club legend expresses that the young men accumulated one night under a lamppost along Tottenham High Road around 100 yards/meters from the now-devastated White Hart Lane ground, and consented to frame a football club. The date of their gathering is obscure, so the Hotspur Football Club is taken to have been framed on 5 September 1882, when the eleven young men needed to begin paying their first yearly memberships of sixpence; before the year's over the club had eighteen individuals. In spite of the fact that the name "Northumberland Rovers" was mooted, the young men settled on the name "Hotspur". Similarly as with the cricket club, it was picked out of appreciation for Sir Henry Percy (otherwise called Harry Hotspur, the dissident of Shakespeare's Henry IV, section 1), whose Northumberland family once claimed land in the territory, incorporating Northumberland Park in Tottenham.
