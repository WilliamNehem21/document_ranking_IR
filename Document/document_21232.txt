Returning to Australia on the RMS "Strathaird", Barr joined the Royal Australian Air Force as an air cadet on 4Â March 1940. After undergoing instruction on Tiger Moths at No.Â 3 Elementary Flying Training School, Essendon, and on Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons at No.Â 1 Service Flying Training School, Point Cook, he was commissioned as a pilot officer on 24Â September. He gained a reputation as something of a rebel during training, and became forever known as "Nicky", for "Old Nick", or the Devil. In his quest to gain assignment as a fighter pilot, he had deliberately aimed poorly during bombing practice, a stratagem also adopted by at least two of his fellow students. By November 1940, he had been posted to No.Â 23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron, flying CAC Wirraways on patrol off the Queensland coast. The aircraft was, according to Barr, "our front line fighter in those days, but it didn't take too long to realise that the capacity of the Wirraway, compared with the types of planes that we were going to encounter, left much to be desired". Though his duties frustrated him somewhat, Barr was grateful to have this extensive flight experience under his belt when he eventually saw combat. While based in Queensland, he served as honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor, Sir Leslie Wilson, and also captained the RAAF rugby union team. He was promoted to flying officer on 24Â March 1941.
