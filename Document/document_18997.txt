Kielan-Jaworowska originally classfied "Catopsbaatar" as a member of the multituberculate family Taeniolabididae in 1974. In 1994, she suggested that "Djadochtatherium" was close to "Catopsbaatar" ancestry. She and Hurum named a new family of multituberculates, Djadochtatheriidae (which they placed in the new suborder Djadochtatheria), in 1997. The family included the genera "Djadochtatherium", "Catopsbaatar", "Kryptobaatar", and "Tombaatar", all from the Gobi Desert. The family differs from other multituberculates (and other mammals) in that the front margins of its snout were confluent with the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), giving the snout a trapezoid shape when seen from above. In general, other mammals have snouts where the side margins are curved inward in front of the zygomatic arches. Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum revised the higher ranks within Multituberculata in 2001, replacing the suborder Djadochtatheria with the superfamily Djadochtatherioidea (placed in the suborder Cimolodonta).
The following cladogram shows the placement of "Catopsbaatar" among other multituberculates according to Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 1997:
The most complete adult "Catopsbaatar" skull (specimen PM 120/107) is long and wide, with a lower jaw. By comparison, the skull of the juvenile holotype (ZPAL MgMâI/78) is about long and wide, with a lower jaw. The largest adult skull (ZPAL MgMâI/79) is long but, since it is incomplete, its other measurements are unknown. "Catopsbaatar" was larger than its relatives, "Kryptobaatar" and "Djadochtatherium". Multituberculates had relatively large skulls and short necks; their skulls were proportionally longer and wider than those of similarly sized rodents and marsupials. The external appearance of their heads may have been similar to those of rodents.
