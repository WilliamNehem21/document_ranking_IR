Williston named a number of other new "Elasmosaurus" species in his 1906 revision. In 1874 he and Mudge discovered a specimen in Plum Creek, Kansas. While he initially assigned it in 1890 to a new species of "Cimoliasaurus", "C.snowii", he subsequently recognized the elasmosaurid nature of its humerus and coracoids. Thus, he renamed the species "E.snowii". A second specimen, discovered by Elias West in 1890, was also assigned by him to "E.snowii". In 1943 Welles moved "E.snowii" to its own genus, "Styxosaurus", where the species has remained. However, the West specimen was assigned to "Thalassiosaurus ischiadicus" (see below) by Welles in 1952; Carpenter returned it to "S.snowii" in 1999. Williston also reassigned the species "E.ischiadicus" from the genus "Polycotylus", where he had initially placed it when he named it in 1903. The type remains were discovered by him in the same 1874 expedition with Mudge. Williston referred another specimen discovered by Mudge and H.A. Brous in 1876. In 1943 both specimens were referred to the new genus "Thalassiosaurus" by Welles, who then assigned the latter to the new genus and species "Alzadasaurus kansasensis" in 1952. Glenn Storrs considered both to be indeterminate elasmosaurids in 1999; in the same year, Carpenter assigned both to "Styxosaurus snowii".
