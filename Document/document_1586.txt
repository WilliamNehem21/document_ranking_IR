Meanwhile, Venier was told to verify the arrival of Giorgio, and acknowledgment from the Sultan of Venetian command over Thessalonica, the encompassing towns, and the fortification of Kortiach (Mount Chortiatis). In return, he was to offer a yearly tribute of 1,000 to 2,000 ducats, and to appropriate annuities to the Sultan's central retainers.

In the event that he found the city under attack, Loredan was to assault GallipoliÃ¢ÂÂwhere he had scored a noteworthy triumph in 1416Ã¢ÂÂimpede the entry of Ottoman troops over the Dardanelles, and if practicable, to attempt and work up resistance to the Sultan among neighboring rulers. To stress the way that Venice did not want war, Loredan was told to educate the neighborhood Turkish officers that his activities were just as a result of the detainment of Giorgio and the attack of Thessalonica, which they had gained lawfully.
