"God of War: Ascension (Original Soundtrack)" was composed by Tyler Bates and was released on iTunes on March 5, 2013 by SCE and La-La Land Records. It was included as DLC in the "God of War: AscensionâCollector's Edition" and "Special Edition". On October 15, the soundtrack was made available for free on PSN for a limited time. A notable feature of "Ascension"s soundtrack is that it was scored by only one composer; all the previous games had multiple composers. Tyler Bates previously scored the similarly themed film "300" and game "Rise of the Argonauts". Bates said "My goal was to create a sound that supported the timeless dark age of "God of War", while expanding the parameters of the 'Sword and Sandals' genre." Although the game's story is linear, he approached the project as if he were scoring a novel as opposed to a film. Bates did not play any of the previous games and chose not to in order to take the score "to new places without being overtly aware of the great music that is emblematic" of the prior installments. The soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and features solo vocal work from Rafe Pearlman and Ciscandra Nostalghia.
