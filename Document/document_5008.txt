A sanctuary required numerous individuals to play out its ceremonies and bolster obligations. Clerics played out the sanctuary's fundamental ceremonial capacities, yet in Egyptian religious belief system they were far less imperative than the ruler. As sanctuary enrichment delineates, all services were, in principle, acts by the lord, and ministers just remained in his place. The ministers were in this manner subject to the lord's position, and he reserved the option to delegate anybody he wished to the brotherhood. Indeed, in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most clerics were government authorities who left their common obligations for part of the year to serve the sanctuary in movements. When the ministry turned out to be increasingly proficient, the ruler appears to have utilized his control over arrangements for the most part for the most noteworthy positioning positions, generally to remunerate a most loved authority with a vocation or to intercede for political reasons in the undertakings of an essential clique. Lesser arrangements he assigned to his vizier or to the ministers themselves. In the last case, the holder of an office named his own child as his successor, or the sanctuary church presented to choose who should fill an unfilled post. Religious workplaces were very worthwhile and would in general be held by the wealthiest and most compelling individuals from Egyptian culture, until Roman monetary changes diminished the sanctuaries' assets.
