At the point when Bottin joined the venture in mid-1981, pre-creation was in advancement, yet no structure had been settled on for the outsider. Craftsman Dale Kuipers had made some fundamental artworks of the animal's look, yet he left the undertaking in the wake of being hospitalized following a car crash before he could create them further with Bottin. Craftsman considered the Thing as a solitary animal, yet Bottin proposed that it ought to be continually changing and ready to seem as though anything. Woodworker at first considered Bottin's depiction of his thoughts as "excessively strange", and had him work with Ploog to draw them. As a major aspect of the Thing's structure, it was concurred anybody absorbed by it would be an ideal impersonation and would not realize they were the Thing. The performing artists invested hours amid practices talking about whether they would realize they were the Thing when dominated. Clennon said that it didn't make a difference, since everybody acted, looked and smelled precisely the equivalent before being dominated. At its pinnacle, Bottin had a 35-man team of craftsmen and professionals, and he thought that it was hard to work with such a significant number of individuals. To help deal with the group, he procured Erik Jensen, an enhancements line maker who he had worked with on "The Howling" (1981), to be responsible for the exceptional make-up impacts unit. Bottin's group additionally included mechanical viewpoint director Dave Kelsey, make-up angle facilitator Ken Diaz, moldmaker Gunnar Ferdinansen, and Bottin's long-term companion Margaret Beserra, who oversaw painting and hair work.
