Different competitors being viewed as included National League President Ford Frick, Democratic National Committee Chairman Robert E. Hannegan, previous Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, previous government Judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds proprietor Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs proprietor Philip K. Wrigley raised solid resistance to Frick, who had been the leader, New York Yankees co-proprietor Larry MacPhail started to advocate for Chandler. At the point when the proprietors met in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 24, 1945, to vote in favor of another chief, Chandler's name was not on the waitlist, which had Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the hopefuls got the required 66% dominant part, and in the wake of campaigning by MacPhail and New York Giants proprietor Horace Stoneham, the proprietors took a casual vote to check whether anybody could be chosen. Chandler's name showed up in the main three on every one of the sixteen tallies. Supported, the proprietors at that point held another formal vote. After two tickets, Chandler got the essential dominant part. A third vote was taken to settle on the decision consistent.
